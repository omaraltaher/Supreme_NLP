CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We  will  hear 

  

 

 

 

 

argument  next  in  Case  14­1457,  Betterman  v.  Montana. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Rowley. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  FRED  A.  ROWLEY,  JR. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  Speedy  Trial  Clause  applies  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  prosecution  through  its  culmination  in 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing.  It  is  not  cut  off  when  the  defendant  pleads 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  is  found  guilty.  The  Court  has  said  that  the  clause 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guarantees  an  early  and  proper  disposition  of  a  criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

charge,  and  that  guarantee  applies  to  the  guilt  stage  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  prosecution  when  most  defendants  plead  guilty  and  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sentencing  stage,  which  may  be  the  only  place  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  prosecution  today  when  a  defendant  actually 

   

 

 

 

 

mounts  a  defense. 

   

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Does  the  Federal  Speedy 

  

 

 

 

 

Trial  Act  ­­ not  the  constitutional  provision,  but  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislation  ­­ does  that  cover  sentencing,  or  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited  to  trial? 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Your  Honor,  my  understanding  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  it's  limited  to  trial.  The  Court  has  recognized

specific  interests  that  are  protected  by  the  Speedy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Trial  Clause,  and  those  interests  apply  not  just  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumptively  innocent  defendants,  as  the  State  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  suggests,  but  some  of  them  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  to  guilty  defendants. 

 

 

 

            

In  Barker,  for  instance,  the  Court  notes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  one  of  the  interests  that  are  protected  by  this  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  protected  by  this  clause  is  the  interest  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rehabilitation,  and  that  a  prolonged  period  of  detention 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in  jail  can  affect  a  defendant's  rehabilitation.  Well, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that's  specific  to  a  guilty  defendant.  And  in  Smith  v. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hooey,  the  Court  noted  that  even  though  the  defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  been  incarcerated  in  Federal  prison,  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  could  still  be  prejudiced  by  a  prolonged  delay 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  State  prosecution  that  followed  because  it  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affect  his  ability  to  seek  a  concurrent  sentence.  That 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

interest  also  is  specific  to  a  guilty  defendant. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  sharp  line  between  the  guilt  stage  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  prosecution  and  the  criminal  ­­ and  the  sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stage  of  a  prosecution  isn't  supported  by  this  Court's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

speedy  trial  precedence. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  do  you  do  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ all  of  our  speedy  trial  decisions  say  there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  one  remedy,  and  that  is  case  over.  Dismissal  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  only  appropriate  remedy.  But  you're  ­­ you're  not

arguing  that,  I  understand,  with  respect  to  sentencing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  are  arguing  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  ROWLEY:  We  were  not  arguing  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  it's  different.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

speedy  trial  requirement  says  if  you  ­­ if  you  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comply  with  the  constitutional  provision,  dismissal. 

 

 

 

 

 

But  you're  saying  sentencing  is  not  the  same  as  trial, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  that  extent,  that  the  remedy  is  different? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Your  Honor,  at  the  guilt  stage 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  prosecution,  the  outcomes  are  ­­ are  binary.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  defendant  is  either  adjudicated  guilty  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charges  are  dismissed  or  the  defendant  is  acquitted.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  two  possible  outcomes  at  the  guilt  stage:  Guilt 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  innocence. 

 

            

At  sentencing,  the  situation  is  quite 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  There's  greater  opportunity  for  tailoring, 

  

 

 

 

 

which  is  what  the  Court  requires  per  Morrison;  and  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  be  a  greater  need  for  tailoring  because  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  has  been  adjudicated  guilty.  So  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  context  where  courts  have  wide  discretion, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  there's  a  range  of  possible  sentences,  where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  range  of  possible  outcomes,  tailoring  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  greater  opportunity  for  tailoring  and  ­­

remedy  be  in  a  case  like  this? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Your  Honor,  we  submit  that  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper  remedy  in  a  case  like  this  would  be  to  reduce 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Betterman's  sentence  by  the  period  of  delay,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montana  Supreme  Court  concluded  that  the  period  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unjustified  delay  here  was  14  months. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  he  was  serving  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

another  sentence.  He  was  serving  a  sentence  for  another 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

crime. 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  He  was  ­­ so 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  got  time  served  credit  on  the  prior  sentence  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  was  serving.  But  that  period  of  delay,  the  14 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

months  was  not  credited  to  his  sentence  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bail­jumping  sentence,  which  is  the  ­­ the  sentence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that's  at  issue  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  submit  that  a  proportionate  remedy, 

   

 

 

 

 

an  appropriate  remedy,  would  be  to  reduce  that  sentence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  period  during  which  he  was  denied  access  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rehabilitation  programs  and  suffered  the  anxiety  that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detailed  in  his  affidavit,  and  that  that  would  be  a  ­­ a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  to  go.  The  lower  courts  have  applied  that  sort  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy  to  sentencing  delays.  And  another  possible 

  

 

 

 

 

 

outcome  in  another  case  would  be  simply  to  vacate  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remaining  portion  of  the  defendant's  sentence. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  here  we  submit  that  a  tailored  remedy

would  be  just  reducing  his  sentence  by  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  do  you  make  of  the  fact 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Sixth  Amendment  says  that  "the  accused  shall 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enjoy  the  right  to  a  speedy  and  public  trial  by  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impartial  jury"? 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Your  Honor,  the  impartial  jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

clause  doesn't  cut  off  or  limit  the  word  "trial."  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  that  because  the  Court  has  recognized  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  trial  right  might  apply  at  a  suppression  hearing, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  there's  no  jury  convened  at  a  suppression  hearing. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Court  concluded  that  in  Waller.  So  the  impartial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury  clause  applies  to  the  portions  of  a  criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution,  the  stages  of  a  prosecution  where  a  jury  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

actually  impaneled.  And  if  you  go  back  to  the  purpose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  an  ­­ of  the  impartial  jury  clause,  which  was  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevent  jurors  from  offering  evidence  against  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant,  it  makes  good  sense  that  it  would  apply  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  stages  of  a  criminal  prosecution  where  a  jury  is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

convened. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Mr.  Rowley,  if  we  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  disagree  with  you  and  say  that  there's  no  Sixth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  right  and  there  was  only  a  due  process  right, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  you  waived  any  argument  that  you  meet  the  due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  standard? 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  We  haven't  included  that.  We

didn't  include  that  in  the  question  presented,  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  And  the  Montana  Supreme  Court  rejected  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge.  It  applied  a  due  process  test  and  concluded 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  under  a  due  process  analysis,  Mr.  Betterman 

   

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  be  entitled  to  relief. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that  gets  to  an  important  point  here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  I  ­­ I  understand 

   

   

  

 

that.  So  you're  admitting  you're  giving  up  that  its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  under  the  Due  Process  Clause  might  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong? 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Your  Honor,  we  are  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

advancing  that  claim  here.  And  so  there  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  difference,  we  submit,  between  the  due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  analysis  and  the  Barker  test  that  this  Court  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied  under  the  Sixth  Amendment  speedy  trial  right, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  that  is  that  under  a  Barker  analysis, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice  may  be  presumed.  And  ­­ and  Barker  also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addresses  specific  forms  of  prejudice  that  may  flow  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  delay  in  a  criminal  prosecution. 

   

 

 

 

            

The  Lovasco  test  that  is  applied  under  a  due 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  analysis  does  not  address  some  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  agree,  but  why  do  you

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  you  want  to  cut  them

MR.  ROWLEY:  Your  Honor,  that's  the  test 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Montana  Supreme  Court  applied  below.  It  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  that  other  courts  that  have  rejected  the  Sixth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment's  speedy  trial  rights  application  at

Lovasco,  and  that  test  creates  a  significant  burden. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  For  example,  Mr.  Rowley, 

  

 

 

 

 

just  to  continue  on  this  line  of  questioning,  there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  case  that  we  have  which  dealt  with  civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forfeitures,  which  is  the  $8,850  in  U.S.  currency  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  it  said,  Well,  we're  going  to  do  a  due  process 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis,  but  we're  going  to  take  the  Barker  factors  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  test  for  that  due  process  analysis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  think  one  of  the  questions  that  Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor  is  asking  is:  Why  wouldn't  that  be  equally 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  here?  In  other  words,  even  if  ­­ and  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  saying  that  this  is  right,  but  even  if  there's  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  ­­ falls  within  the  due  process  box  rather  than

the  Sixth  Amendment  box,  that  there's  still  a  further 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  as  to  whether  the  Lovasco  approach  is  right  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  this  U.S.  currency  approach  is  right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Your  Honor,  that's  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Montana  Supreme  Court  attempted  to  do.  So  it  eventually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modified  the  Lovasco  test  and  tried  to  draw  on  Barker 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles  in  applying  it.  But  if  you  compare  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

results  in  this  case  to,  say,  the  result  in  the  Burkett 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  where  the  court  analyzed  the  specific  forms  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice  that  are  at  issue  in  a  ­­ a  pretrial  or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

presentencing  delay  situation,  and  if  you  don't  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  presume  prejudice  or  require  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution  to  rebut  articulated  prejudice 

 

 

 

 

particularized  by  ­­ it's  been  articulated  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant,  the  court  there  found  a  violation,  and  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  here,  despite  modifying  Lovasco,  did  not  find  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation.  And  so  the  test  is  still  inadequately 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

protective. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  guess  I'm  ­­ I  guess  I'm 

    

   

 

 

 

 

not  ­­ just  not  sure  what  you  ­­ you  mean  by  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  in  this  other  case,  the  civil  forfeiture  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  just  said  we're  going  to  apply  the  four  factors  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Barker.  And  if  that  were  the  result  of  the  due  process 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach,  I  mean,  it  just  wouldn't  make  any  difference 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  box  it  was  in.

MR.  ROWLEY:  That  would  ­­ that  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  be  true,  Your  Honor,  but  that's  not  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montana  Supreme  Court  here  did.  So  it  didn't  apply  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  factors  in  Barker.  It  didn't  apply  Barker  in  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

straightforward  fashion  because  it  approached  prejudice 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  way  that  Lovasco  did.  It  required  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  to  make  an  affirmative  showing  of  prejudice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  required  that  that  showing  be  substantial.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  from  the  Barker  test.  And  we  submit  also  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  the  specificity  of  this  right,  that  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enumerated  in  the  Sixth  Amendment,  that  it  would  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  for  the  Court  to  shunt  that  interest,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set  of  interests  that  are  enumerated  in  the  Sixth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment,  into  the  due  process  test;  that  the  better 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach  is  to  do  what  the  lower  courts  have  done,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  to  take  the  Barker  framework,  which  already  exists, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  apply  it  in  straightforward  fashion  to  a  delay  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  you're  not  asking  us 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  it  in  a  straightforward  fashion.  That's  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg  asked  you,  because  you're  giving  up  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Barker  remedy. 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Your  Honor,  the  lower  courts, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  applying  Barker  to  the  sentencing  context,  have  fixed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  tailored  remedies  in  recognition  of  the  fact  that

there  may  be  a  difference  between  a  delay  at  the  guilt 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

stage  and  a  delay  at  sentencing,  because  now  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's  been  convicted. 

 

 

            

And  so  the  lower  courts,  in  applying  Barker, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  done  this.  They  have  tailored  remedies.  They  have 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied  remedies  that  leave  the  conviction  standing  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

try  to  affix  some  proportionate  remedy  for  the  delay  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  why  don't  you  think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  they've  done  the  same  thing  under  the  Due  Process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clause,  recognizing  that  it  is  unfair  to  undo  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction  merely  for  sentencing  delay  because  you're  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer  presumed  innocent,  you're  now  guilty? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  The  key  ­­ yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why  isn't  the  due 

  

 

 

 

 

process  test  that's  being  applied  that  modification? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Your  Honor,  the  ­­ the  reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  the  due  process  test,  as  it's  been  applied  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower  courts,  doesn't  do  the  job  is  because  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue  to  require  an  affirmative  showing  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice. 

So  they  don't  presume  prejudice  which  may  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant.  Washington,  the  case  out  of  the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Fifth 

Circuit  that  we  cite,  illustrates  this  point 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the 

 

court  there  didn't  presume  prejudice.  And  as 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court 

 

explained  in  Doggett,  it  may  be  important  to

prejudice  because  it  is  sometimes  hard  to  show  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  of  a  delay  on  the  defendant's  defense  or  other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forms  of  prejudice. 

 

 

            

 

 

 

And  so  even  the  courts  that  have  applied 

 

 

 

 

Lovasco,  and  have  modified  it,  still  ­­ still  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presume  prejudice,  still  don't  require  the  prosecution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  make  a  showing  in  response  to  articulated  prejudice. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  just  apply  Lovasco  and  require  an  affirmative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

showing  of  substantial  prejudice. 

 

 

 

            

So  even  this  modified  version  that  you  see 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Montana  Supreme  Court's  opinion  below,  we  submit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  inadequate  and  also  not  appropriate  because  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  enumerated  right  in  the  Sixth  Amendment  and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't  be  shunted  into  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  when  you  say  prejudice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  presumed,  do  you  mean  it  should  be  presumed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusively?  Could  it  be  rebutted? 

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Yes,  Your  Honor,  it  could  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rebutted.  And  indeed,  in  a  case  like  this  where  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  has  articulated  specific  forms  of  prejudice,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  denied  access  to  rehabilitation,  I  suffered  anxiety, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  ought  to  be  able  to  come  in  and  rebut  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption. 

            

Now  here,  despite  those  specific  forms  of

Mr.  Betterman  filed,  the  State  did  not  offer  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence.  The  first  evidence  that  we  saw  was  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefing  on  the  merits  in  this  Court.  So  the  State  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  the  opportunity  to  make  a  showing,  and  it  didn't  do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  When  you  say  that  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy  should  be  tailored,  tailored  to  what?  What  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  is  the  Court  supposed  to  do,  in  ­­ in  your  view? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Select  a  punishment  that  is  appropriate  to  deter  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  from  doing  this  again,  or  select  a  remedy  that  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  way  undoes  the  ­­ the  damage  or  the  prejudice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  been  done  to  the  defendant? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Your  Honor,  Morrison  speaks  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this,  and  it  requires  that  the  Court  fix  a  remedy  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  tailored  to  the  injury  suffered  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  violation. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Okay.  Well,  then,  in  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

situation,  I  don't  know  why  reducing  the  sentence  by  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

length  of  the  unconstitutional  delay  ­­ the  supposedly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional  delay  undoes  the  damage  that's  been

MR.  ROWLEY:  Your  Honor,  it's  a

recognizes,  but  that  also  bear  on  his  prospects  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parole,  on  his  case  for  parole  or  early  release.  And  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  he  was  denied  access  to  them  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  period  of  time  bears  on  his  ability  to  try 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  win  early  release.  And  this  Court  has  recognized 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  any  amount  of  time  that  the  defendant  has  to  spend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  prison  as  a  result  of  a  Sixth  Amendment  violation  is

And  so  we  submit  that  it  is  proportionately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tailored,  even  if  the  fit  isn't  perfect. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  When  Justice  Ginsburg  asked 

  

 

 

 

 

you  about  the  Federal  Speedy  Trial  Act,  and  you  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  does  not  cover  sentencing.  But  there  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  of  Montana  law  that  do  cover  sentencing.  Why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  you  seek  relief  under  those? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Your  Honor,  there  are  Montana 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statutes  that  require  that  sentencing  take  place  within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  reasonable  amount  of  time  and  foreclose  on  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delay.  But  we  have  been  unable  to  find  a  case  where  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  was  actually  able  to  win  some  kind  of  relief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  basis  of  those  statutes.  As  the  Montana  Supreme 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  decision  below  reflects,  the  court's  view  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  that  those  statutes  incorporate  due  process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles,  and  so  it  would  be  due  process  principles 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  provided  the  relief.  And  we  haven't  found  any  case

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Did  you  bring  a  claim  under 

   

  

 

 

 

 

those  statutes? 

 

            

not. 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  We  did  not,  Your  Honor.  We  did

are  these  disadvantages,  but  he  had  certain  advantages, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too,  from  being  in  jail.  He  was  closer  to  his  family. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He  was  closer  to  his  counsel  to  confer  more  easily  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel.  Isn't  it  then  we  have  to  consider  the  pluses 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  well  as  the  disadvantages? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Certainly,  Your  Honor.  If

directly  on  his  case  for  parole,  the  prejudice  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

palpable.  It  resonates  strongly  with  Barker  itself  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  Smith  v.  Hooey  where  the  Court  noted  that  even  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  incarcerated  on  a  prior  charge,  you  may  yet 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffer  prejudice  as  a  result  of  delay  in  a  subsequent 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution. 

            

So  back  to  Justice  Sotomayor's  question 

 

 

 

 

 

about  Lovasco,  and  about  the  difference  between  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  tests.  We  submit  that  if  you  compare  the  outcome 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  and  compare  the  outcome  in  Burkett,  Burkett 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  a  defendant  who  advanced  a  very  similar  theory 

   

   

 

 

 

 

of  prejudice.  The  theory  was  he  was  denied  access  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rehabilitation  programs  and  that  he  suffered  anxiety. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  defendant  testified  to  that  effect,  and  the  Third 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  concluded  that  in  the  absence  of  contrary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence,  that  that  was  enough  to  state  or  to  show  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sixth  Amendment  violation. 

 

 

            

Whereas  in  ­­ in  the  decision  below,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montana  Supreme  Court  placed  the  burden  squarely  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Betterman  to  make  an  affirmative  showing  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial  prejudice.  So  even  though  he  submitted  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

affidavit  that  detailed  the  prejudice,  the  Montana 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme  Court  deemed  it  speculative. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  My  problem  is  with  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

use  of  ­­ of  language.  Prejudice  is  prejudice.  And

they  ­­ they  seem  to  be  arguing  that  substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice  means  something  like  actual  damages,  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  point  to  something  that  I've  actually  been  damaged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  either  having  served  longer  than  the  sentence  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately  imposed,  or  something  else  like  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

But  why  are  you  even  taking  on  the 

 

 

 

 

substantial  damage  definition?  Why  aren't  you  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

arguing  that  prejudice  is  prejudice? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Well,  it  is,  Your  Honor,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lovasco  actually  uses  the  word  "actually."  So  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lovasco  test  that  was  applied  by  the  Montana  Supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You're  still  ­­ you're 

  

 

 

 

 

still  in  the  Lovasco  test? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Yes.  I  mean,  if  ­­ if  the 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

court  ­­ that's  the  court  ­­ that's  the  due  process  test 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  court  has  applied.  Now,  if  the  court  were  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  the  Barker  test,  including  the  way  that  Barker 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approaches  prejudice,  could  be  actionable  under  the  Due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Process  Clause,  that  would  be  a  different  story,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  not  the  way  that  lower  courts  have  examined  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  would  effectively  give  a  defendant  Sixth  Amendment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

relief  under  the  Due  Process  Clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  that  is  not  what  the  Montana  Supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  did,  Your  Honor,  and  that  is  not  the  way  that  it

applied. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  that's  not  the  way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you're  arguing  the  case. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Well,  Your  Honor,  we  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

preserve  a  ­­ a  due  process  challenge.  Our  challenge  is 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

solely  under  the  Sixth  Amendment.  It's  set  forward 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ in  the  ­­ in  the  question  presented  and,  indeed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  lower  courts  we  pressed  a  Sixth  Amendment  right. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  to  Your  Honor's  question,  if  the  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  to  take  that  Sixth  Amendment  analysis  and  drop  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  due  process  context,  the  defendant  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  get  the  same  relief.  But  we  submit  that  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given  that  the  right  is  enumerated  in  the  Sixth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment,  that  it  ought  to  ­­ that  the  relief  ought  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  granted  under  that  clause  and  not  shunted  into  due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process. 

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions,  I'd  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  reserve  the  balance  of  my  time.

sentencing  delay  because  its  purpose  is  to  protect  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumptively  innocent  defendant  from  the  harms 

 

 

 

 

 

associated  with  a  criminal  charge.  That  purpose  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  the  text  in  history  of  the  clause.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  the  remedy  that  this  Court  has  said  must 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply  to  speedy  trial  violations.  And,  importantly,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

leaves  defendants  with  other  means  of  challenging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unjustified  sentencing  delay  without  requiring  the  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having  to  modify  both  the  test  and  the  remedy  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speedy  trial  violation. 

 

 

            

The  Speedy  Trial  Clause  is  unique  among 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sixth  Amendment  rights  because  it  goes  to  the  heart  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government's  authority  to  try  a  presumptively 

   

 

 

 

 

innocent  defendant  at  all.  If  the  government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

unjustifiably  delays,  it  may  forfeit  the  right,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  dismissal  is  the  remedy. 

 

 

 

 

            

Sentencing  delay  doesn't  impact  the  validity 

 

 

 

 

 

of  trial.  It  doesn't  impact  the  authority  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  to  bring  a  defendant  to  trial.  And  after 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

conviction,  none  of  the  interests  that  are  supported  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Speedy  Trial  Clause  apply.  For  example,  there  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  no  anxiety  over  public  accusation  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accusation  has  been  confirmed.  At  the  moment  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction,  a  defendant's  liberty  is  justly  deprived 

   

 

 

 

 

because  ­­ and  that's  why  bail  is  presumptively

unavailable  at  that  point. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  When,  in  your  view  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

let's  say  we  agree  with  you  that  speedy  trial  isn't  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  rubric.  When  would  a  delay  in  sentencing  amount 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  a  due  process  violation? 

   

 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  I  think  if  a  ­­ if  a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

defendant  could  show  prejudice,  for  example,  if  he  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  able  to  present  mitigating  evidence  at  sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  passage  of  time,  a  lost  witness,  that  ­­ that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  be  one  example.  If  he's  serving  a  ­­ if  he's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

awaiting  sentencing  for  a  time  longer  than  the  maximum 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  for  ­­ for  the  charge,  that  would  ­­ that  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  another  example. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  you  ­­ you  would  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

count  factors  of  the  kind  that  were  raised  here,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  I  could  have  gotten  into  a  drug  treatment  program  in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  penitentiary  that's  not  available  in  the  jail.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not  include  that? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  That's  right,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

Ginsburg.  And  ­­ and  the  reason  why  it  ­­ it's  too 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speculative  a  basis,  you  know,  it's  speculative  whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

rehabilitative  programs  or  parole  would  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available  and  whether  the  defendant  would  have  taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advantage  of  them. 

 

 

            

And  I  ­­ this  case  is  ­­ is  a  good  example

of  that.  It's  not  in  the  record  because  it  happened 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  the  Montana  Supreme  Court's  decision,  but  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  was  ­­ was  offered  parole  in  March  of  2014 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  ­­ conditioned  on  that  he  would  fill  ­­ fulfill  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rehabilitation  program.  He  started  the  rehabilitation 

  

 

 

 

 

program,  and  16  days  later  he  quit,  quit  it,  so  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parole  was  rescinded.  And  that's  ­­ that's  the  sort  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speculative  basis  ­­ I  think  it's  too  speculative  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  to  ­­ to  give  a  remedy. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  defendant's  always  able  to  file  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandamus  claim  if  he  ­­ if  he's  ­­ the  sentence  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harming  him.  He  can  first  ask  to  be  sentenced.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  in  this  case  didn't  mention  it  until  nine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

months  into  the  progress  ­­ process. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  General,  there  ­­ there  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

be  some  real  differences  between  the  pretrial  context 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  presentencing  context,  but  one  which  seems  quite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar  is  the  potential  of  delay  to  impair  the  defense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  I  guess  I  would  like  you  to  address  that,  because, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  as  the  Petitioners  point  out,  in  most  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  days,  most  of  the  actual  adjudication  of  contested 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues  goes  on  in  sentencing  rather  than  at  the  trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stage,  given  that  we  don't  have  very  many  trials 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anymore.

made  it  very  clear  that  this  was  an  important  interest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  thinking  about  the  speedy  trial  right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  Yes,  Justice  Kagan,  a  few 

   

  

 

 

 

points.  First  of  all,  I  would  ­­ I  would  say  that  that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

danger  is  equally  at  issue  in  pre­indictment  delay, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delay  involving  interlocutory  appeal,  which  the  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held  was  not  included  in  the  speedy  trial  analysis  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Loud  Hawk  v.  United  States.  Second  ­­ so  that  can  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedied  by  ­­ by  due  process,  even  if  it's  a  similar 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest. 

            

Second,  there's  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  doesn't  ­­ Lovasco 

  

 

 

 

 

really  talks  about  a  whole  different  set  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

considerations  in  the  pretrial  context,  which  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  apply  once  the  indictment  ­­ once  the  accusation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  been  made. 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  Perhaps  not.  But  I  think 

   

  

  

 

 

it  would  apply  in  the  ­­ in  the  interlocutory  appeal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  or  even  ­­ or  even  appeal  in  resentencing.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  those  same  considerations  would  be  at  issue.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delay  could  impact  or  retrial  ­­ if  there's  a  retrial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordered  on  remand  in  a  case.  And  those  are  interests 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Due  Process  Clause  can  ­­ can  remedy. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  other  ­­ the  other  point  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  is  different.  I  mean,  there  ­­ the  same

rules  don't  apply.  And  usually,  the  same  facts  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aren't  ­­ aren't  at  issue.  I  mean,  given  the  ubiquity 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  plea  agreements,  so  often  the  ­­ the  real  action  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  plea  bargaining,  anyway.  And  ­­ and  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor  and  the  defendant  agree  on  a  sentence  or  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

range  of  sentence,  and  then  ­­ and  then  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implemented  by  the  judge. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  sometimes,  but  there 

  

 

 

 

 

may  also  be  real  factual  disputes.  It  might  be  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  amount  of  loss.  It  might  be  about  the  amount  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drug  quantity.  It  might  be  about  prior  bad  acts.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  be  about  a  whole  range  of  things  which  are  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds  of  things  that  we  actually  typically  think  of  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contested  issues  at  trial. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  That's  true.  I  would 

    

  

 

 

argue  the  due  process  provides  adequate  remedy  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation,  but  there  is  different  standard,  too.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  the  rules  of  evidence  don't  apply.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Confrontation  Clause  doesn't  apply.  There's  no  burden

And  our  argument  is  that  ­­ that  due  process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  remedy  any  prejudice  that  happened  ­­ ­

sentence,  more  or  less  like  this  one,  where  you  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility  of  a  sentence  between  zero  and  ten  years. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

How  do  you  ­­ how  does  the  judge  know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  ­­ if  the  defendant  is  brought  before  him  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

year  eight,  eight  and  a  half,  nine,  how  does  the  judge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  that  if  the  defendant  had  been  brought  to  him  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

year  five,  he  would  have  given  him  a  six­year  sentence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead  of  an  eight? 

 

 

 

            

Don't  you  think  that  there's  a  lot  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

pressure  on  the  judge  if  the  defendant's  hearing  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delayed  for  eight  years  to,  say,  time  served?  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  ­­ don't  ­­ don't  you  think  there's  prejudice  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  an  unexplained  delay  caused  by  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  likely  than  not  had  some  sort  of  effect  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence? 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  Well,  I  think  in  that 

   

  

 

 

 

case,  the  defendant  should  ­­ if  it's  that  lengthy  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delay,  he  should  ask  to  be  sentenced.  And  like  I  say, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  can  ­­ he  can  always  file  a  mandamus  petition  in  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Look,  this  defendant 

  

 

 

 

asked  to  be  sentenced  faster.  He  was  told  that  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  other  issues  the  court  was  dealing  with.  So  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple  of  the  months  were  not  his  fault,  clearly  not  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fault,  it  was  an  administrative  fault.

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  That's  true.  There 

  

  

 

 

was  ­­ not  all  the  delay  was  his  fault.  But  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  ­­ he  didn't  mention  anything  about  wanting  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentenced  until  nine  months  into  that  process  when  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed  a  ­­

   

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  that  may  go  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  of  whether,  under  a  Barker  analysis  or  any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis,  he  should  be  heard  to  complain  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delay,  but  I  still  am  not  quite  sure  why  your  definition 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  substantial  prejudice  or  actual  prejudice  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  controlling  one. 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  I  ­­ I  think  the  court 

    

   

 

 

 

said  ­­ even  the  court  ­­ lower  courts  that  have  applied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Speedy  Trial  Clause  to  sentencing  delay,  they  ­­ you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  the  Tenth  Circuit,  for  example,  in  Perez  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sullivan,  they  assume  that  it  applies,  on  the  one  hand, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  the  Court's  decision  in  Pollard,  but  then  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other,  they  recognize  that  the  interests  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply.  They  ­­ they  recognize  that  in  order  to  fashion 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  remedy  in  a  post­conviction  setting,  the  defendant  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  show  prejudice. 

 

 

            

In  addition,  it  takes  into  account  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ that  the  balance  is  shifted.  The  person  is  no

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Assume  ­­ assume  that 

  

 

 

 

 

there  is  a  prompt  trial,  then  a  very  substantial  delay 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

in  sentencing,  and  then  there's  an  appeal,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal  results  in  new  trial.  Does  the  Speedy  Trial  Act 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  apply  when  the  defendant  says  that  my  second  trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  delayed? 

 

            

Are  there  cases  on  that? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  I  don't  ­­ I  don't  think 

    

   

 

 

 

so.  I  think  generally  when  courts  ­­ lower  courts  are 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying  delay  in  the  appellate  context,  resentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context,  they  apply  due  process.  And  I  can't  think  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Because  if  that  delay  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

attributable  to  the  State,  it  seems  to  me  there  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  Speedy  Trial  Act  violation  in  that  connection. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  There  may  be.  And  ­­ and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

lower  courts,  when  they're  look  at  appellate  delay  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delay  in  resentencing,  I  mean,  it's  a  ­­ it's  a  pretty 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

similar  test  as  far  as  the  Speedy  Trial  Clause  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned  when  courts  are  applying  at  presentencing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  requires  a  showing  of  prejudice,  and  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

evaluates  the  government's  reasons  for  the  delay. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  ­­ but  you're  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

aware  of  any  cases  of  the  kind  I've  indicated  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  ­­ the  Speedy  Trial  Act  then  clicks  in  for  the

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  I'm  not  aware  of  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Under  Montana  law,  can  a  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

cases. 

            

a  defendant  who  suffers  inordinate  delay  in  sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  relief? 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  Certainly.  There's  ­­

  

  

 

 

there  are  rules  on  delay,  prohibiting  delay,  just  like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  in  most  States,  if  not  every  State.  And  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  rules  there's  specific  procedures  that  put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  place  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  Mr.  Rowley  indicated 

  

 

 

 

 

that  there  ­­ there's  the  rules  there,  but  no  defendants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  had  the  benefit  of  getting  it  ­­ their  sentences 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shortened  because  of  those. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  Well,  I  ­­ I'm  not  aware 

   

  

 

 

 

 

of  any  defendants  pressing  claims,  any  reported 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions  on  those  ­­ those  claims,  one  way  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other.  But  a  defendant  always  has  that  option,  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

especially  under  mandamus. 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  I  think  at  that  point,  fashioning 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  remedy  just  for  delay,  I  think,  is  difficult  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  friend  mentioned  14  years,  but  the  delay  ­­ I  mean, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  months.  The  delay  wasn't  really  14  months  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unjustified  delay.  Like  I  said,  he  didn't  make  his 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

claim  until  nine  months.  But  before  that,  there's

going  ­­ always  going  to  be  some  delay  and  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  the  court  did  ­­ did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  it  ­­ the  delay  was  principally  caused  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court's  institutional  problems. 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  It  ­­ it  was.  There 

  

  

 

 

 

 

were  ­­ the  court  took  a  while  to  ­­ to  decide 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

post­conviction  motions,  and  it  was  institutional  delay. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  don't  ­­ I  don't  disagree  with  that.  But  my  point  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there's  always  going  to  be  some  delay  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

processes.  And  so  to  figure  out  what  the  remedy  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  simply  by  ­­ by  including  the  entire  14  months,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  would  be  a  windfall  to  the  defendant,  especially 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case  where  he's  ­­ he  was  receiving  credit  on

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Is  that  typical?  Is

time  served? 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  Yes.  In  fact,  it's

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Is  there  any  way

prejudice.  And  I  think  they're  well  equipped  to  do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Where  did  ­­ where  did  it

eight  and  a  half­year  delay  between  when  a  person  was 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

indicted  and  when  they  were  brought  to  trial.  And  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  ­­ there  ­­ the  Court  said  there  was  no

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  no.  My  question  is  you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

heard  your  ­­ your  brother  counsel  say  that  Barker  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wingo,  if  it  applied,  would  presume  prejudice.  So  I've 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  been  looking  at  that.  And  in  the  case  itself  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  presume  prejudice. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  It  does  not. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  analyzes  whether  there 

  

 

 

 

 

was  or  was  not  prejudice.  So  I  want  to  know  where  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  of  presumed  prejudice  comes  from. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  The  first  ­­ the  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

factor  in  Barker  is  to  ­­ to  analyze  what  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  know  the  four  factors.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

have  them  in  front  of  me. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  Yes.  That's  the 

  

  

 

 

presumptive  prejudice  factor  gets  you  ­­ gets  you  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test.  So  it  triggers  the  test.  I  think  my  friend  is

the  witnesses  will  be  gone  and  so  forth.  So  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  fair  to  say  there  was  prejudice  in  such  a  case,  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  it's  about. 

 

 

 

            

So  if  it  isn't  presumed  all  the  time,  do  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  any  objection,  as  he  apparently  does  not  have  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection,  to  our  saying  you're  right.  It's  the  Due 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Process  Clause. 

 

            

Now,  in  applying  the  Due  Process  Clause  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  where  the  sentencing  has  been  unduly  delayed  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  the  claim,  you  ­­ the  Court  should  apply  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factors  as  set  out  in  Barker  v.  Wingo. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  And  there's  a  couple 

   

  

 

 

problems  with  that.  One,  Barker  was  specifically 

  

 

 

 

 

 

designed  to  take  into  account  pretrial  interests  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Speedy  Trial  Clause.  And  in  the  case  that  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan  mentioned,  the  forfeiture  case,  that  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pre­adjudication  case,  so  it  fit  in  that  context.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying  Barker,  courts  have  done  it,  applied  it  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Sorry,  that  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

forfeiture  case. 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  that's  a  penalty 

   

  

 

 

after  adjudication.  The  forfeiture  doesn't  start  until

before  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Whatever  the  case  is,  I'd 

  

 

 

 

 

 

like  to  get  an  answer  to  my  question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  says  the  Court  should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

balance  four  factors:  Length  of  delay,  the  reason  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delay,  the  defendant's  assertion  of  his  right,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice  to  the  defendant. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  I  quote  that  sentence  and  say  those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  the  factors  that  should  be  taken  into  account  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Due  Process  Clause,  do  you  have  any  objection  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that? 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  Prejudice  needs  to  take 

  

 

 

 

 

the  forefront  in  that  analysis. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  should  just  reverse  the 

    

 

 

 

 

four? 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  Well,  the  problem  with 

  

 

 

 

 

Barker  is  it  held  ­­ it  holds  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    

I  mean,  in  the 

 

 

postconviction  setting  is  that  none  of  the  factors  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary.  So  prejudice  doesn't  necessarily  have  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

shown  in  Barker.  Lower  courts  have  modified  that  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  in  the  postconviction  setting,  a  defendant  has  to

show  prejudice.  In  the  ­­ the  test  that  lower  courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use,  the  modified  Barker  test  looks  a  lot  like  Lovasco. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  fact,  it  say  it's  indistinguishable  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice.  And  prejudice  is  the  key,  to  the  answer  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  question,  Justice  Breyer,  that  in  a  postconviction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

setting,  that's  what's  necessary. 

 

 

 

            

 

 

And  also,  to  my  friend's  point  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  made  claims  of  prejudice,  I'd  point  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  Joint  Appendix  66  and  68  where  he  ­­ he  made  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  of  prejudice  in  ­­ in  the  space  of  a  couple 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

paragraphs.  And  this  sort  of  illustrates  the  problem 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  has  in  rebutting  claims  of  prejudice  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aren't  substantiated.  He  didn't  file  his  ­­ his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

affidavit,  which  was  still  fairly  bare,  but  at  least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  substantiated,  until  three  months  after  he  filed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  motion,  and  the  motion  was  denied,  his  motion  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reconsider.  So  I  think  defendants  in  this  context  have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  come  forward  with  some  showing  of  prejudice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  that  ­­ that  might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

present  some  challenges,  but  there  are  also  challenges 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  other  side.  It's  often  hard  to  show  that  people 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  forgotten  things,  that,  you  know,  they've  forgotten 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them.  So  unless  there's  something  like  a  witness  dying, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  very  difficult  to  make  the  kind  of  showing  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  suggesting.  And  that's  why  Barker,  you  know,  left

things  flexible  and  said,  you  know,  in  most  cases,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  are  going  to  look  at  prejudice.  We're  going  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see  what  you  have  to  say  for  yourself.  In  some  extreme 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  we're  not  going  to  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So,  again,  I  guess  I'm  back  with 

   

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer's  question  as  to,  yes,  this  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  context,  but  why  don't  all  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considerations  apply? 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  The  court  has  never 

  

 

 

 

 

presumed  prejudice,  except  in  the  extreme  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  wasn't  suggesting  presumed 

    

 

 

 

prejudice,  because  Barker  doesn't  suggest  presumed 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice.  As  you  say,  the  difference  that  Barker  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  your  test  is  simply  that  Barker  says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  always  necessary  to  show  prejudice,  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  extreme  circumstances  in  which  we'll  just  take  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  granted. 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  I  don't  think  that  takes 

    

 

 

 

 

into  consideration  the  change  that  happens  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction.  I  mean,  there's  a  substantial  change. 

    

   

 

 

The  ­­ the  interests  of  the  society  take  the  forefront. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  to  give  ­­ I  think  it  gives  the  defendant  a  windfall 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  ­­ if  he  can  come  to  court  and  say  this,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delay  has  prejudiced  me,  but  I'm  not  really  going  to  ­­

a  very  significant  part  of  this  rule  has  to  do  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impairment  of  the  ability  to  defend  yourself,  and  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  that  kind  of  consideration  applies  just  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well  at  the  sentencing  phase  as  it  does  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction  stage,  maybe  in  most  cases  more  so,  given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  most  of  the  action  these  days  takes  place  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  phase,  I  guess  I  just  wouldn't  see  why 

   

   

 

 

 

 

there's  any  need  for  a  different  rule,  especially  given 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  level  of  flexibility  that  Barker  gives. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It's  not  like  Barker  says  we're  presuming 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice  in  all  circumstances.  Barker  is  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice  is  one  of  the  four  factors.  And  it's  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  one.  And  usually  we'll  expect  people  to  come 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  with  some  kind  of  showing,  except  for  in  extreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  when  not. 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  I  think  it  comes  down  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

a  remedy.  You  know,  the  remedy  for  a  speedy  trial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation  is  dismissal.  So  in  the  postconviction  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  that's  what  we  said  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Barker  when  we  were  talking  about  a  pretrial  case,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  remedy  in  this  case  would  be  different. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SCHOWENGERDT:  Right.  But  it  would  be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

more  difficult.  If  the  defendant  doesn't  have  to  show 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice,  I'm  not  ­­ I'm  not  sure  how  you  ­­ what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ what  the  Court  would  remedy.  And  that's  one  of

the  reasons  that  the  prejudice  should  be  required, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  there's  got  to  be  something,  something  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Court  is  actually  remedying.  And  even  in  the

determination  of  facts  that  are  relevant  at  sentencing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  does  not  take  place  exclusively,  or  probably  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  doesn't  take  place  primarily  at  the  time  when  the

SUPPORTING  THE  RESPONDENT 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

To  go  right  to  Justice  Kagan's  concern  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  possibility  that  a  defendant's  defense  at  sentencing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  impaired,  we  think  the  due  process  analysis  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adequate  to  address  that.  And  we  think  that's  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because,  although  the  defendant  has  to  show  prejudice, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  prejudice  standard  should  essentially  be  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  that  applies  in  cases  of  other  violations  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  rights  that  may  affect  the  defendant's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ability  to  defend  at  sentencing.  And  that  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  should  have  to  show  that  theirs  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  probability  that  the  result  would  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different,  the  outcome  would  have  been  different.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  same  standard  that's  used  in  cases  of  Brady 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violations  of  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

one  that  doesn't  require  the  defendant  to  show  by  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preponderance  that  he  would  have  received  a  different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

sentence  or  anything  like  that.  He  just  has  to  show 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  he  suffered  prejudice.  That  ­­ that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  ­­ when  you  take  all  the  evidence  into  account,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

puts  the  outcome  in  a  different  light. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  how  did  you  see  that  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  from  what  goes  on  under  the  Barker  analysis?

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  I  think  under  Barker,  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Court  does  allow  for  prejudice  to  be  presumed  in  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  so  the  defendant  does  not  have  to  show  ­­ make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  kind  of  concrete  or  particularized  showing  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice.  We  think  that  ­­ that  in  the  case  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  ­­ prejudice  at  sentencing  that  the  defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  have  to  show  some  concrete  effect  ­­ some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concrete  effect  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  I  take  it  that  we've 

   

  

 

 

 

 

said  that  that's  the  case  where  the  delay  is  super­long, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  take  a  delay  of  eight  or  ten  years.  And,  you  know, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  is  it  in  that  very  extreme  circumstance  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  should  make  ­­ that  the  defendant  should  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  make  any  particularized  showing? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  I  think  the  defendant  may 

   

  

 

 

 

 

well  be  able  to  make  a  particularized  showing  in  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  but  I  think  ­­ I  think  there  are  ­­ there  are  two 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

primary  reasons  that  it's  just  not  appropriate  in  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  for  prejudice  to  be  presumed  at  sentencing.  And  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  first  one  of  those  is  that,  I  think,  you  know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  constitutional  rule  has  to  take  into  account  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wide  range  of  sentencing  proceedings  here.  So  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  talking  about  pretrial  delay,  I  think,  you  know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  trials  involve  historical  facts  that,  in  theory, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  affected,  could  be  prejudiced  by  delay.

That's  not  the  case  of  all  sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearings.  There  are  fully  discretionary  systems 

  

 

 

 

 

where  ­­ where  historical  facts  would  not  have  as  great 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  effect.  There  are  sentencings  that  turn  mostly  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  present  characteristics  of  the  defendant,  rather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  on  ­­ on  historical  facts. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  think  ­­ I  think  prejudice  should  not 

   

   

 

 

 

 

be  presumed  in  any  case,  but  in  a  situation  where  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  actually  will  be  affected,  the  due  process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  is  tailored  enough  to  allow  him  to  have  relief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  situation. 

 

 

            

And  I  think  the  second  reason  it's  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  ever  to  presume  prejudice  at  sentencing  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  conviction  changes  everything.  It  ­­ once  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

once  a  defendant  has  been  convicted,  there's  a  strong 

   

   

 

 

 

 

societal  interest  in  giving  him  an  appropriate  sentence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  to  give  him  a  remedy  for  presentencing  delay,  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  involves  ­­ generally,  the  remedy  is  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involve  lowering  what  would  otherwise  be  an  appropriate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence.  So  in  that  context,  I  think  it's  appropriate 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  require  the  defendant  to  show  some  actual  injury  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  to  justify  the  societal  cost  of  lowering  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise  appropriate  sentence.

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  I  think  capital  cases  may

capital  sentencing  is  essentially,  in  some  respects,  an

because  the  penalty  phase  really  is  a  trial?

in  which  you  treat  the  ­­ the  penalty  phase  as  a  ­­ as

the  Speedy  Trial  Clause  aren't  implicated;  and, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  even  though  that  kind  of  delay,  pre­arrest

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  In  that  situation,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

defendant  is  at  liberty  in  a  pre­indictment  delay? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  That's  right.  And  that's  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

that's  why  the  core  concerns  of  the  Speedy  Trial  Clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aren't  implicated  in  that  scenario,  that  ­­ that  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Speedy  Trial  Clause  isn't  implicated  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's  liberty  interest  hasn't  been  ­­ hasn't  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrained  by  the  indictment. 

 

 

 

            

But  a  similar  thing  happens  after 

   

 

 

 

conviction.  At  that  point,  the  defendant  doesn't  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cognizable  liberty  interest  ­­ a  cognizable  interest  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

avoiding  the  ­­ the  detriments  that  can  be  imposed  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him  as  a  result  of  the  conviction  and  as  an  incident  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sentence. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  we  take  out  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"presumed  prejudice"  which  is  not  part  of  the  Barker 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis,  it  just  says  ­­ defines  "prejudice,"  how  would

prejudice,  you  have  to  prove  some  prejudice,  how  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  change  the  analysis? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  I  think  that  ­­ I  think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

there's  one  other  difference,  I  think,  in  ­­ in  the  two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approaches,  aside  from  the  presumed  prejudice;  and  that

in  ­­ in  the  due  process  context,  the  Court  said  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Marion  that  the  type  of  prejudice  we're  concerned  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  actual  prejudice  to  the  defense  of  a  criminal  case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  for  the  pretrial. 

  

 

 

 

 

MS.  ANDERS:  Right,  but  what  that  ­­ we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  what  that  means  in  the  sentencing  context  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  defendant  should  have  to  show  a  concrete  effect  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  defense  at  sentencing;  in  other  words,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probability  that  the  result  would  have  been  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or,  you  know,  that  he's  been  serving  longer  time  than  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  have  been.  But  I  think  it  also  means  that  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  things  like  ­­ like  access  to  rehabilitation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

programs,  anxiety,  that  those  would  not  be  independently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cognizable  as  prejudice  under  the  due  process  inquiry. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  You  think  that  if  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  was  writing  to  a  judge  every  week  saying,  I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anxious,  I  really  need  to  know  what  my  sentence  is,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  judge  ignores  it  for  a  period  of  time,  that  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  still  has  to  prove  something  more?  That's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  facts  of  this  case.  There  was  no  complaint  for  nine 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

months.  So  whatever  treatment  the  defendant  started, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

started  ­­ for  anxiety  started  well  before  any  time  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elapsed  in  this  sentence. 

 

 

 

            

But  you  don't  think  that  defendant  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled  to  any  consideration  by  a  ­­ a  trial  court,  or

that  we  should  be  barring  a  trial  court  from  considering 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that? 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  And  two  points  with  respect  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  I  mean,  certainly  if  a  ­­ if  a  defendant  is 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

asking  for  sentencing  and  the  court  is  ignoring  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  be  inappropriate.  The  defendant  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  have  ­­ have  other  remedies,  I  think,  at  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  after  requesting  sentence,  perhaps  mandamus, 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps  a  habeas  petition. 

   

 

            

But  if  all  ­­ if  the  only  prejudice  he's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claiming  is  anxiety,  then  ­­ then  yes,  I  do  think  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  not  be  cognizable  under  due  process.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that's  ­­ that's  really  because  once  a  defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  been  convicted,  he  can  ­­ he  now  can  be  sentenced. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He  can  be  subject  to  the  practical  deprivations  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  incident  of  sentence.  And  I  ­­ I  think  that  after  he 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  been  sentenced,  of  course,  he  doesn't  have  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  in  not  being  anxious,  that  kind  of  thing.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  I  think  it  would  be  very  odd  to  say  that  he  has  a  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  sentencing  delay­related  interest  in  that  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  that  could  be  the  basis  for  a  constitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Ms.  Anders,  I'm  sorry,  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  things  that  strikes  me  as  odd  about  your  argument

appropriate  in  certain  circumstances.  You  just  want  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

put  this  under  the  Due  Process  Clause.  And  what's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what's  odd  is  that,  as  you  say,  that  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

post­conviction  context,  the  president  ­­ the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  has  been  deprived  of  any  liberty  interest,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yet  the  Due  Process  Clause  talks  about  a  deprivation  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liberty,  but  the  defendant  no  longer  has  a  liberty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest. 

            

So  it  seems  a  very  odd  place  to  park  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  and  this  remedy,  the  Due  Process  Clause,  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context.  It  seems  much  more  natural  that  you  would  do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  under  the  Speedy  Trial  Clause  on  the  assumption  ­­ on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ on  the  view  that  the  ­­ that  the  trial  has  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  both  the  adjudication  of  guilt  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  of  the  proper  sentence. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  two  points  with  respect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  that.  I  think  if  the  Court  were  to  say  ­­ to  ­­ to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use  the  standard  that  ­­ that  we  propose,  so  essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  presumed  prejudice,  only  certain  things  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cognizable  as  prejudice,  and  ­­ and  the  remedy  would  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always  be  ­­ vacatur  the  conviction,  then  I  think  we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably  wouldn't  have  a  practical  objection  to  calling 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  Speedy  Trial  Clause,  right?  What  we're  concerned 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

about  is  the  substantive  standard  and  ­­ and  the  remedy.

convicted,  the  societal  interests  have  shifted;  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  why  it's  appropriate,  I  think,  to  apply  due 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

process.  The  defendant  has  a  liberty  interest  in  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

length  of  his  sentence.  He  has  a  ­­ he  has  a  due 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  interest  in  a  fundamentally  fair  sentencing 

   

 

 

 

 

proceeding.  And  so  we  think  due  process  nicely  captures 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  interest  the  defendant  has. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  the  Court  has  said  before  ­­ before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rest,  before  speedy  trial  kicks  in,  due  process  applies. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  it  provides  a  right.  And  we  think  that  after  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  no  longer  has  the  interest  protected  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Speedy  Trial  Clause,  due  process  can,  again,  provide  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper  approach.

the  defendant's  defense  at  sentence. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  as  Barker  illustrates,  and  Smith  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hooey  also  illustrates,  there  are  other  forms  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice  that  are  specific  to  the  Speedy  Trial  Clause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  may  apply  to  a  defendant  and,  indeed,  may  apply  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  defendant  even  after  they've  been  convicted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So,  for  example,  in  Smith  v.  Hooey,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  had  already  been  incarcerated  on  a  prior 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  charge.  That  defendant's  liberty  interests  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

already  impinged,  and  yet  the  Court  noted  that  the  delay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  the  follow­on  prosecution  could  still  prejudice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him. 

            

So  this  notion  that  you  would  apply  the  due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  test  or  the  Lovasco  test  and  require  a  showing, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  affirmative  showing  that  the  defendant  would  have  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  different  outcome  at  sentencing  but  for  the  delay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  highlights  why  due  process  is  inadequately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suited. 

            

Justice  Kagan's  question  points  to  another 

 

 

 

 

 

anomaly  in  the  test  that  has  been  proposed  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  because  of  this  focus  on  liberty  interests. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  in  ­­ in  Smith  v.  Hooey,  the  defendant  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already  ­­

liberty,  it's  not  incorporated  under  the  Fourteenth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment,  anyway. 

 

            

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Yes,  Your  Honor,  but  ­­ but  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  mean,  the  Sixth 

    

 

 

 

Amendment  applies  only  to  the  Federal  government,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  only  because  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  liberty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  applies  to  the  States.  So  liberty  is  involved. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Yes,  Your  Honor,  but  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  that  the  State  of  Montana  and  the  United  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  taken  is  that  at  sentencing,  once  a  defendant  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  convicted,  they  don't  have  a  specific  liberty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

interest  of  the  kind  that  was  recognized  in  Barker  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  kind  that  was  recognized  in  Smith  v.  Hooey;  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  interest  in  rehabilitation,  in  accessing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rehabilitation  programs  that  could  be  affected  by  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delay  in  a  prosecution. 

   

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Isn't  ­­ his  liberty  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  affected.  He's  in  jail.  So  he's  sitting 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  in  jail.  Tell  him  you're  free.  I  don't  think  he 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believes  it. 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  ­­ and  then  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  is:  Is  ­­ at  some  point,  is  being  in  jail  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deprivation  of  his  liberty  without  due  process?  Because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Due  Process  Clause  would  require  application  of

sentencing  under  ­­ and  when  it's  ­­ it's  not  due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process  when,  say,  Barker  v.  Wingo  or  some  violation  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violated.  I  don't  see  a  problem  with  liberty. 

    

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Well,  Your  Honor,  the  point  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply  that  the  Speedy  Trial  test  that  the  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

articulated  in  Barker  is  better  suited  to  the  specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forms  of  prejudice  that  are  at  issue  in  this  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  addresses  this  concern  with  even  a  defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

who's  been  guilty,  accessing  rehabilitation  programs,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  anxiety  that  that  defendant  may  feel  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  stage. 

 

            

And  this  gets  to  another  point  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  made,  and  that  is  that  ­­ that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conviction  changes  everything,  because  the  concerns  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  articulated  in  Barker  may  yet  be  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  at  the  sentencing  stage,  given  that  most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions  today  result  from  guilty  pleas. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  the  fact  that  a  defendant  ­­ their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense  may  be  impaired  by  a  delay  in  criminal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceedings,  may  be  more  significant  at  the  sentencing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stage  because  it  may  be  the  only  place  where  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  challenges  an  upward  adjustment  or  contests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts. 

            

The  fact  that  the  defendant  may  need  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access  rehabilitation  programs  may  be  more  pronounced  at

sentencing  because  the  defendant's  already  been 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted,  they're  going  to  serve  time,  and  they  want  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  access  to  the  programs  that  they'll  need  to  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parole  as  soon  as  ­­ as  possible. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

So  we  submit  that  ­­ that  Barker  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  test;  that  if  the  Court  agrees  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Barker  ­­ Barker's  the  appropriate  framework,  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper  right  to  ground  that  analysis  in  is  the  Sixth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  and  not  the  Due  Process  Clause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that  is  particularly  so  because  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

antecedents  of  the  Due  Process  Clause  which  ­­ which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply,  not  just  to  the  ­­ the  guilt  stage  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution,  but  also  to  sentencing.  And  why?  Because 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

at  ­­ at  common  law,  and  at  the  time  of  the  Framing  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Framing,  sentencing  and  ­­ and  the  jury  verdict  were  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closely  bound. 

 

            

And  ­­ and  the  right  is  rooted  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice  of  circuit  justices  riding  into  the  countryside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  resolving  cases.  Not  just  presiding  over  jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trials,  but  resolving  cases.  They  had  the  power  to  hear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  decide  those  cases.  Their  jurisdiction  was  from  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beginning  of  the  prosecution  through  the  end. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  we  think  the  Sixth  Amendment  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  basis  for  this  right.

adoption  of  the  Sixth  Amendment,  weren't  post­trial  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presentencing  delays  fairly  common? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Your  Honor,  the  Stevens 

  

 

 

 

 

Treatise  says  that  at  the  time,  at  common  law,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing  took  place  usually  ­­ not  always  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Usually. 

  

 

MR.  ROWLEY:  Usually  soon  thereafter. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  ­­ but  not  always. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  ROWLEY:  That's  right,  Your  Honor.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

as  a  general  rule,  the  sentencing  did  take  place  soon 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  the  ­­ the  jury  issued  its  verdict,  and  oftentimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediately.  And  the  cases  that  we  catalog  in  our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appendix  illustrate  that  point. 

 

 

 

            

But  it's  not  just  that.  As  the  Court  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized,  the  sentence  was  usually  automatic.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

flowed  from  the  jury  verdict.  And  so  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  that's  just  not  true  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  historical  matter. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Well,  it  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  It's  not  true  as  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

historical  matter.  If  you  look  at  the  ­­ at  the  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  provisions  that  were  enacted  by  Congress,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

called  for  a  range  of  ­­ of  sentences,  and  the  ­­ and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sentencing  judge  had  to  select  within  that  range.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I'm  talking  about  the  early 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18th  century,  not  when  you  say  that  it  was  automatic. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Your  Honor,  I'm  referring  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  observations  that  this  Court  has  made  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Apprendi  line  of  cases.  And  it  is  the  early  part  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18th  century,  because  as  the  Court  has  noted  ­­ I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorry  ­­ in  the  early  part  of  the  19th  century,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  the  Court  has  noted,  States  started  to  adopt  statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  gave  sentencing  courts  more  discretion.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  at  common  law,  certainly  at  the  time  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Founding,  the  Court  noted  that  typically  the  verdict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dictated  the  sentence.  And  so  this  right  that  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  That  just  isn't  true.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

don't  have  the  right  to  change  history.  It  isn't  true. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  first  ­­ if  you  look  at  the  very  first  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  that  were  enacted  by  Congress,  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress,  they  were  not.  It  was  not  determined  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentencing. 

            

MR.  ROWLEY:  Your  Honor,  many  of  the  ­­ for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  crimes,  serious  crimes  at  common  law,  and  even  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  that  today  we  would  consider  not  so  serious, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usually  the  penalty  was  death.  And  so  there  was  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

close  relationship.  The  Court  has  called  it  a  close 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

relationship  between  the  verdict  and  sentencing.
