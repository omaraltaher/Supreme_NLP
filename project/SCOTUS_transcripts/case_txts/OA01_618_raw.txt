CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 01-618, Eric Eldred v. John D. Ashcroft.


Mr. Lessig.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE LESSIG


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. LESSIG:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please


the Court:


Petitioners are before you this morning


challenging Congress's 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term


Extension Act, which extended the term of subsisting and


future copyrights by 20 years.  Petitioners submit such a


blanket extension of existing terms exceeds Congress's


power under the Copyright Clause and it violates the First


Amendment.


Now, the Government has responded to


petitioners' argument in a way that betrays a simple but


fundamental confusion.  The Government has argued as if


petitioners had advanced a general theory of the Copyright


Clause, or a general constraint under which Congress must


operate.  That is a mistake.  This case is about limits to


an enumerated power.  It's not about general power of


Congress to exercise its copyright authority.  Petitioners


have advanced a particular interpretation of the only

express limits in the Copyright Clause designed to give


those limits meaning.


QUESTION:  Mr. Lessig, I'll tell you what


bothers me about your position, and that is that Congress


has extended the term so often through the years, and if


you are right, don't we run the risk of upsetting previous


extensions of time?  I mean, this seems to be a practice


that began with the very first act.


MR. LESSIG:  Justice, we do not believe that the


very first act extended terms at all.  Speaking


technically, which for a lawyer means speaking accurately,


the 1790 act did not extend a Federal term.  The 1790 act


granted a term for works that already existed in precisely


the pattern that the English parliament had done in the


Statute of Anne in 1710, and that the English parliament


did with monopolies, general monopolies in the statute


of --


QUESTION:  But there have been a number of


extensions since.


MR. LESSIG:  That's right.


QUESTION:  Even if you can get over the first


hurdle.


MR. LESSIG:  That's right.  That's the important


hurdle, and we'd like to jump that first, but the other


ones, Justice, you're right, in 1831 and in 1909 Congress

extended terms in a way that is inconsistent with the


strongest form of the test that we have advanced.  Those


extensions, however, were never challenged in any court


and certainly not considered by this Court.


QUESTION:  Well, doesn't that itself mean


something, Mr. Lessig?  The fact that they were never


challenged, perhaps most people, and perhaps everybody


felt there was no basis for challenging them.


MR. LESSIG:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it's


absolutely true that this case is here because of a


fundamentally important changed circumstance that makes


the Framers' limitations on the Copyright Clause much more


significant.  This is the first time I can remember where


this Court has been pointed to changed circumstances as a


reason to reaffirm the Framers' values, because for most


of this period, Mr. Chief Justice, the only people who


were regulated by copyright law under the Copyright Act


would have been commercial publishers, primarily, and now


for the first time the scope of this exclusive right has


expanded because of the changed technology of the Internet


to reach an extraordinarily broad range of creativity that


never would have been imagined before.


Now, it's not the case that the earlier


extensions were not questioned on constitutional grounds. 


In fact, Melville Nimmer, in the consideration of the 1976

act, suggested they were plainly under --


QUESTION:  Well, I'm talking about court


challenges, not academic challenges.


MR. LESSIG:  That's right, there is no court


challenge.


QUESTION:  Mr. Lessig, your theory, as I


understand it, regardless of changed circumstances or not,


your basic theory, which on your argument would have been


appropriate at any time historically, is that there has at


least got to be the possibility of a kind of a causal


connection between the extension and the promotion or


inducement for the creation of some subsequent work, but


why is that any more plausible a reading of the Promotion


Clause than simply a reading that says the Promotion


Clause requires that there be a general scheme in place,


which overall tends to promote or induce, and part of one


aspect of that scheme can be that the -- that at the


discretion of Congress the period of protection is


extended from time to time? 


Why do you require -- why do you say the clause has


got to be read by this kind of specific causation theory


as opposed to a kind of systemic theory of promotion?


MR. LESSIG:  Justice Souter, the reason is


exactly related to the point I began with, that this is a


case about limits and not about discretion.  If it's not

the case that this Court --


QUESTION:  No, but that's -- I mean, that's the


issue in the alternative reading.


MR. LESSIG:  That's right.


QUESTION:  And why is it a limit case, rather


than a discretion within a general scheme kind --


MR. LESSIG:  That's right.


QUESTION:  -- of clause?


MR. LESSIG:  Because if this Court does not


adopt a reading of the form we've offered, then there is


no limit to the ability of Congress to extend subsisting


terms.


QUESTION:  Do you say the same thing for scope? 


This case is about duration, but Congress from time to


time -- in fact, you mentioned --


MR. LESSIG:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- the expanded applications of


copyright, and Congress itself extends the scope from time


to time.


MR. LESSIG:  That's right.


QUESTION:  Would you make, as far as, say,


translation rights that didn't exist before, the same


argument?


MR. LESSIG:  I --


QUESTION:  Why -- or -- and if you wouldn't, why

not?


MR. LESSIG:  I -- no, Justice Ginsburg, we would


not, and the reason is again related to the method we have


adopted to interpret "limited times."  We have not said


that "promote the progress of science" is a general and


independent constraint on the Copyright Clause authority. 


We've said it must be looked to to interpret the scope of


"limited times," and unless retrospective extensions are


forbidden, it will eviscerate the meaning of "limited


times."  That does not occur in the context of the scope


of exclusive right, nor in the context of the power to


secure.  If that's --


QUESTION:  Could we then go back to Justice


O'Connor's question?  To make that very specific, if we


agree with you, does that mean that we would, in


principle, have to hold the 1976 extension


unconstitutional?  I mean, in 1976, Congress extended the


term from 28 years renewable once, to life of the author


plus 50 years.  Now they're extending it life of the


author plus 70.  If the latter is unconstitutional on your


theory, how could the former not be?  And if the former


is, the chaos that would ensue would be horrendous.


MR. LESSIG:  Justice Breyer, under our theory as


we've advanced it, you're right; the 1976 act would be


unconstitutional.  Whether this Court would apply such a

holding in this case to that act is a question that would


have to be resolved under the retrospective --


QUESTION:  Maybe we ought to find another


theory, then.  Is there any --


(Laughter.)


MR. LESSIG:  Justice, the theory, which would


advance the aim of limiting times in a way that is


enforceable, is only applicable in the case that we


brought before you here to the '98 act, and would not


necessarily be applicable under the '76 act for the


reasons the Government has offered.  We would not advance


this argument, but the Government has offered an argument


in a parallel case that suggests a distinction between the


'76 act and this case.  That's not been briefed here. 


It's been grounded in their claim that the treaty power


creates some special power.  We wouldn't advance that


claim, but the point is there are a number of issues that


the '76 act --


QUESTION:  In essence, you think it's at least


arguable that the '76 act had various positive aspects to


it in terms of the purpose of the Copyright Clause that


this act lacks?


MR. LESSIG:  That's certainly true, and we also


believe that, for the reasons averted to by amicus AOL in


this case and the reasons you've just suggested, the

disruption in that context under the retrospectivity cases


Ryder and Reynoldsville Casket Company would be sufficient


to fit it within the, quote, "severe disruption exception"


to the retrospectivity. 


QUESTION:  Well, I suppose implicit in the


argument that the '76 act, too, should have been declared


void, and that we might leave it alone because of the


disruption, is that for all these years the act has


impeded progress in science and the useful arts.  I just


don't see any empirical evidence for that.


MR. LESSIG:  Justice, we are not making an


empirical claim at all.  Nothing in our Copyright Clause


claim hangs upon the empirical assertion about impeding


progress.  Our only argument is, this is a structural


limit necessary to assure that what would be an


effectively perpetual term not be permitted under the


copyright laws.


QUESTION:  Well, perhaps I misunderstood.  I


thought the whole thrust of your argument was that there


is a great First Amendment force here that's being


silenced, that's being thwarted.


MR. LESSIG:  Well, the thrust certainly --


QUESTION:  I thought that's the whole


underpinning of your case.


MR. LESSIG:  It's certainly the case that we are

asserting, in light of the changed circumstances, that the


opportunity to build upon works within the public domain


is a fundamental First Amendment interest, and that the


First Amendment values, vital speech interest at stake of


this case, is that the public domain be permitted as a


source for cultivating work about our culture without


unnecessary legal restriction.


QUESTION:  Well, but you want more than that. 


You want the right to copy verbatim other people's books,


don't you?


MR. LESSIG:  We want the right to copy verbatim


works that should be in the public domain and would be in


the public domain but for a statute that cannot be


justified under ordinary First Amendment analysis or under


a proper reading of the limits built into the Copyright


Clause.


QUESTION:  Mr. Lessig, on your First Amendment


argument I don't see where the retroactivity-prospectivity


comes in, because -- I follow your argument under the


Copyright Clause, but if you're saying that the time is


too long, the public domain should get this stuff sooner


rather than later, would you explain to me how your


prospectivity-retrospective line fits into your First


Amendment claim?


MR. LESSIG:  Justice, we've argued that it would

be inappropriate in this case for the Court to consider


the prospective line until they decide whether the case,


whether the prospective and retrospective is severable,


and we submit it's an easy case to show that it's not.


QUESTION:  On the First Amendment --


MR. LESSIG:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- argument you're making that as, I


take it, an argument independent of, it doesn't hang on


your Copyright Clause argument.


MR. LESSIG:  That's right.  I --


QUESTION:  And so let's just take -- let's say


that was your only argument in this case.  How does that


tie into a retrospective-prospective distinction?


MR. LESSIG:  Well, the strongest First Amendment


argument is about the retrospective extension, because of


a fundamental change that occurs when Congress extends


subsisting copyrights, rather than when Congress


legislates prospectively.


When Congress legislates prospectively, it has


no way to know who's going to benefit from its extension. 


It is simply evaluating what the term should be


prospectively in a way that we presume this Court should


presume is legitimate under the First Amendment.  When it


legislates retrospectively, it is, in effect, looking at


particular authors and estates of authors who are before

Congress asking for this extension, and it's choosing


between these particular authors and the public at large.


Now, it may be that in exercising that choice in


this case, Congress made an objective valuation of who


would be in the best position to advance the interests of


promoting the progress of science, or any original --


QUESTION:  But you -- under your intermediate


scrutiny test we would not be hypothesizing what might


have been in Congress's mind.  Your First Amendment test


is a stringent one.  You have to have an important


purpose, and the means that you use is necessarily tied to


that purpose.  If you take that position, I don't see how


you make the retroactive-prospective line work.


MR. LESSIG:  Well, the line comes from deciding


what the First Amendment interest is, and if this Court


heed the First Amendment interest off of this difference


between selecting who gets the benefit of 20 years of


extension and just simply legislating in a general way


prospectively, then this Court could hold, with respect to


the prospective, that it's not even necessary to raise the


intermediate scrutiny in that context, but again, for


Ashwander reasons we don't think that this Court should


address the prospective aspect of the CTEA even under the


First Amendment.


QUESTION:  Even though Congress's pattern has

been to treat all authors equally?  I mean, the reason


that it's been prospective and retrospective is that


people should be, people who hold copyrights should be


subject to the same regime and not have some people who


got their copyrights the week before the law passed


treated differently than people who got it the week after.


MR. LESSIG:  Well, Justice, that certainly is


the reason the Government offers for this pattern.  It, of


course, doesn't explain actually what Congress has done


and, even in this case, when a work has passed into the


public domain, then there is precisely the same


week before/week after problem that you advert to, that


extension does not extend to all subsisting works, it only


extends to all subsisting copyrights.  So that line is


already drawn in the practice that Congress has adopted,


but our point is, the only way to assure --


QUESTION:  But Congress has -- or, you're not


disputing that Congress has always made these extensions,


both retroactive and prospective?


MR. LESSIG:  Well, in 1831 it did not.  In 1831


it granted the benefit of its extension to a subset of all


subsisting copyright holders.


QUESTION:  Let's stick with 1976.


MR. LESSIG:  In 1976 --


QUESTION:  Because that was what you said --

that's -- the pattern under the CTEA is identical to the


one in the '76 act.


MR. LESSIG:  That's absolutely right, yes.  So


they have extended it to both.  But our argument is,


unless this Court draws a line about this extension, then


for the reasons Judge Sentelle suggested below, there will


be no limit to Congress's ability to --


QUESTION:  Judge Sentelle did not deal with the


First Amendment, as far as I --


MR. LESSIG:  That's right.


QUESTION:  -- recall.


MR. LESSIG:  That's right.


QUESTION:  And so I'm asking you -- perhaps I'm


missing it.  I haven't seen where you get the


prospective-retrospective in connection with your First


Amendment.  It seems that you're just saying there that 70


years is an unreasonable -- is not necessary.


MR. LESSIG:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And it doesn't serve an important


purpose.


MR. LESSIG:  Yes.  Precisely -- actually, we're


not saying anything about the 70 years in this case even


under the First Amendment, because we believe it's


unseverable, but --


QUESTION:  But I thought you were saying that if

you accept the Copyright Clause argument, then you have a


way, in effect, of devaluing the Government's claim of its


important interest and important objective when you get to


the First Amendment intermediate scrutiny analysis. 


Whereas if you don't accept the Copyright Clause claim,


then, in order to make the First Amendment analysis we've


simply got to say, well, gee, is the promotion of useful


art and so on more important than the public domain, and


can we say that that allows a distinction between 50 years


and 70 years?


We're pretty much at sea, so I thought your


Copyright Clause argument was necessary to give us some


handle with which to deal with the First Amendment.


MR. LESSIG:  Our Copyright Clause argument is


certainly a way of framing why extensions of subsisting


terms cannot be seen to promote the First Amendment


interest of speech at all.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Let's assume we don't -- for


the sake of argument here, let's assume we don't accept


the Copyright Clause argument.  Do you have an independent


First Amendment argument in your brief?


MR. LESSIG:  Yes, of course we do.


QUESTION:  Okay, and it is -- tell me in a


sentence or two what it is.  I mean, at that point I'm


where Justice Ginsburg is.

 MR. LESSIG:  Yes.  The First Amendment argument


we've argued in our brief is with respect to the


retrospective extension, and the First Amendment argument


is, that needs to --


QUESTION:  No, but that's the Copyright Clause


argument, and it seems to me you're saying, okay, we then


apply that in First Amendment analysis, which allows us to


make a coherent intermediate scrutiny argument.


If we don't accept the Copyright Clause


retrospectivity argument --


MR. LESSIG:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- then what is your First Amendment


argument?


MR. LESSIG:  That's right, I'm sorry, Justice. 


What I'm saying is not that it's the retrospectivity that


makes the First Amendment argument troubling -- I mean,


that drives our First Amendment argument.  All I'm saying


is, we have addressed the retrospective portion of CTEA,


and so I'm saying in the retrospective portion of CTEA you


would apply ordinary, intermediate First Amendment review,


and you would ask --


QUESTION:  Well, this Court really has not -- if


you say that the Copyright Clause is not violated, I don't


think there are examples where this Court has then


resorted to First Amendment analysis to invalidate the

MR. LESSIG:  Well, Justice O'Connor, the First


Amendment is always an independent limitation on what


otherwise would be legitimate exercises of congressional


authority, so this --


QUESTION:  Yes, but the Framers seem to have


adopted these two things at the same time --


MR. LESSIG:  That's right.


QUESTION:  -- in effect.


MR. LESSIG:  That's right, and if --


QUESTION:  And I think there are not examples


that I can think of where we have said, well, we'll


analyze it under the Copyright Clause, but if that


fails we'll turn to the First Amendment.


MR. LESSIG:  Justice, that's right.  If only we


had the Framers' copyright before us, because of course,


again remember,the exclusive right the Framers spoke of


was the right to print and publish.  It didn't include the


derivative rights, it didn't include the display rights,


and it certainly --


QUESTION:  Right.  It has expanded very much,


and they also envisioned a very short term, and I can find

a lot of fault with what Congress did here --


MR. LESSIG:  That's right.


QUESTION:  -- because it does take a lot of


things out of the public domain that one would think that


someone in Congress would want to think hard about.


MR. LESSIG:  That's right.


QUESTION:  But having done that, it's very


difficult to find the basis in the Constitution for saying


it isn't a limited term.  It's longer than one might think


desirable --


MR. LESSIG:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- but is it not limited?


MR. LESSIG:  Well, if it is limited, then there


is no limit to the ability of Congress to extend


subsisting terms, and that fundamentally destroys the


objective that the --


QUESTION:  The rule against perpetuities might


jump in there at some point.


(Laughter.)


MR. LESSIG:  Right, and we submit the Framers


had something very different in mind than the rule against


perpetuities.  The point is, if this is permitted, then


there is no limit to the ability to extend terms, and that


is precisely contrary to what the Framers had in mind when


they worried about this problem originally.

 What was the problem they were solving?  It was,


as this Court stated in Graham --


QUESTION:  Well, I could agree with you, in


terms of policy, that this flies directly in the face of


what the Framers had in mind, absolutely.  But does it


violate the Constitution?


MR. LESSIG:  Well, if it flies in the face of


what the Framers had in mind, then the question is, is


there a way of interpreting their words that gives effect


to what they had in mind, and the answer is yes.


QUESTION:  Well, you know, certainly what is


happening in the country today in the way of


congressional -- under the Commerce Clause is totally


different than what the Framers had in mind, but we've


never felt that that was the criterion.  What the Framers


thought of, there weren't steamboats, there weren't


railroads.


MR. LESSIG:  That's right.


QUESTION:  We've said there was a general grant,


and that Congress was free to run with it in many


respects.


MR. LESSIG:  In many respects, Mr. Chief


Justice, but, as this Court has also said, there are


limits to what Congress can do under the Commerce Clause.


QUESTION:  But isn't --

 QUESTION:  Can I ask you about one of the


limits, just focusing on the Copyright Clause and the


progress of science and useful arts?  In your view, does


that -- is that limited to encouraging creativity by


authors and inventors, or does it also include the


distribution of materials that might not otherwise be


distributed, like old films and so forth?


MR. LESSIG:  We're happy to adopt a broader


interpretation of what promote the progress is about,


within the general framework that the Framers established


in light of the English practice, which was a quid pro


quo.  The ability to facilitate distribution --


QUESTION:  So that if the quid pro quo is that


we can facilitate distribution of some old film by an


additional monopoly grant, you'd think that's permissible?


MR. LESSIG:  So long as the grant is conditioned


upon the distribution.  So long as the grant --


QUESTION:  In other words you could have --


right now, if Congress decides to have a law, and this law


is going to give copyrights in 1) the Bible, 2)


Shakespeare, 3) Ben Jonson, and the reason they do it is


that they think that that would lead publishers to produce


those and distribute them, and they're right, they will,


okay?  In your view, that's perfectly constitutional?


MR. LESSIG:  No, that's the view of the

Government's, Justice Breyer.  My view is --


QUESTION:  Well, I thought that was the question


you were getting, and I thought you were saying -- I must


have misunderstood.  I thought you were saying that was


constitutional.


MR. LESSIG:  No.  What we were saying is, if


Congress wants to permit restoration of films, for


example, an issue that's been well briefed here, Congress


can say, if you restore the film, then the restoration


gets a copyright so long as it satisfies originality as


outlined in Feist, and it gets a copyright for a period of


time.  But this Court's opinion in Graham and in Feist


made clear that it could not extend copyrights to works in


the public domain.  The Government doesn't concede that,


but we stand on that as a way of understanding why this


Court --


QUESTION:  So your answer to Justice Stevens is


no, they cannot give a copyright purely for purposes of


dissemination to publishers, is that right?


MR. LESSIG:  No.


QUESTION:  Oh, all right.


MR. LESSIG:  They cannot give a copyright purely


for purposes of distribution to publishers.


(Laughter.)


MR. LESSIG:  They would need to satisfy all of

the implied limitations that this Court has expressed in


the context of this, the most carefully limited clause in


Article I, section 8.  It is one of the --


QUESTION:  Mr. Lessig, the clause says, Congress


shall, and suppose Congress decides in this expanded world


of ours that it's going to make certain changes and demand


other changes from our treaty partners.  Suppose it says,


well, the Germans led the fight for 70 years in the


European Union, we'll go with that, but we're going to


insist that they have a more expansive notion of, say, a


fair use.  Now, why couldn't that fit within the promotion


of knowledge?


MR. LESSIG:  Justice Ginsburg, we have no


quarrel with the objective of harmonization fitting within


the "promote the progress of science" understanding,


subject to constitutional limitations.


If France adopted a rule that said you couldn't


grant copyrights to hate speech, we could not harmonize


with that rule consistent with our First Amendment and


similarly, as Mary Beth Peters testified before Congress,


ours is the only Constitution that has an express


limitation on terms.  That's got to mean something, and if


it means that we are limited in our ability to agree with


the Europeans as they continually expand the term in light


of their own vision of what copyright is about, then

that's the meaning of a constitutional restriction.


This Court's interpretation of "limited times"


could, of course, eviscerate that term of any meaning, but


under the principle of enumeration as this Court has


articulated it, this Court should interpret that clause in


a way that gives its terms effect in a simple way.  Just


as a limited addition print is not a limited -- is not


limited if each time a customer comes in a new print is


printed, so, too, a limited term is not limited if each


time copyright holders come to Congress they can extend


the term.


QUESTION:  Well, but the difference -- the


reason that analogy doesn't cut it for me is that the


limited edition print depends basically on an implied


understanding between the person who makes the print and


the person who buys it, and the understanding is, you


won't go beyond 100, or whatever number you write.


We're not engaged in a contractual analysis


under the Copyright Clause between the writer and the --


and somebody representing the public domain.


MR. LESSIG:  That's right.


QUESTION:  The analogy doesn't seem to work.


MR. LESSIG:  That's right.  All that I'm


suggesting is, here is a plain meaning of the term that


gives effect to the constitutional limit in a way that

assures that, in fact, the limit is respected, contrary to


the Government's argument, which, in effect, permits


Congress the power perpetually to extend terms.


If I may reserve the remainder of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Lessig.


General Olson, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


GENERAL OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The questions today, especially the initial


questions, suggest one of the many insurmountable


obstacles to petitioners' petition in, position in this


case.  That is that the first Congress explicitly gave


copyright protection to the authors of any books already


printed as well as explicitly the owners of existing


copyrights.  Thereafter, in 1831, 1909, 1976, and 1998,


and in numerous private copyright bills and temporary


extensions of the copyright law and in repeated patent law


revisions, Congress extended the terms of Federal


copyright and patent protection of subsisting works.


As this Court explained 100 and some years ago


in its Burrows-Giles opinion, such constructions are


accorded very great weight and, as that Court went on to


say, when consistent and unchallenged for over a century

are almost conclusive that consistent construction by


Congress of its authority under the Copyright and Patent


Clause now has lasted from the 105th -- from the first


through the 105th Congress.  It has been sustained by


Justices of this Court and early decisions of this Court. 


It is consistent with what the law of England was from the


Statute of Anne --


QUESTION:  Yes, but take one of the early


extensions, just extending a -- an already granted patent


to an inventor for an extra 10 years.  How can that be


squared with the language of the provision?  Maybe


Congress did it, but maybe it acted improperly when it did


it.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, the Congress --


QUESTION:  And that's our question, really.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, that -- it seems to me


that there may be -- this is -- the clause itself is a


very, very broad grant.  It says the --


QUESTION:  Do you view it as entirely a grant,


or do you think it also contains limitations?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I think that to the extent


that there may be limitations, Justice Stevens, they


are -- require considerable deference by this Court to the


judgment of Congress --


QUESTION:  Well, I understand that, but do

you -- I'd be interested in knowing, do you think it does


contain limitations?


GENERAL OLSON:  It contains -- the clause itself


contains limitations, limited times, authors, exclusive


rights and things of that nature.  I don't think -- and


the petitioners expressly disclaim the assertion that


there are any substantive limitations in the "Promote the-


Progress" Clause.


What the Framers were saying is, we want to give


Congress the authority to promote the progress of useful


arts and sciences, and --


QUESTION:  How did the example we just talked


about, a patentee giving an extra 10 years on his -- how


does that promote the progress of science?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, it may provide additional


incentives for the patentee to exploit and promote and


disseminate that particular work.  With respect to


creative works like works of art, books and that sort of


thing, it may provide many ways --


QUESTION:  I'm just concentrating on our


patentee, and I'm wondering how that fits into the notion


that there was a bargain in effect between the inventor


and the Government that at a certain period of time it


would become part of the public domain.  It seems to me


it's inconsistent with that.

 GENERAL OLSON:  It isn't inconsistent, I submit,


Justice Stevens, for the Congress to exercise its juris --


its responsibility under this broad grant of power to


determine that there could be many ways in which the


holder of an existing right may benefit the public by


continuing to have that right for an additional period of


time, the same reason that Congress -- same reasons that


Congress had when it created the right in the first place. 


It's not just the right --


QUESTION:  No, the reason for the right in the


first place was to encourage invention.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, but I -- we submit that


specifically with respect to the Copyright Clause, but I


think it applies to the patent portion of the clause at


all, it isn't just the invention, it isn't just the


writing of the work -- and this relates to the questions


that were asked of my colleague a moment ago.  It includes


the dissemination of the work, not necessarily --


QUESTION:  Dissemination alone?


GENERAL OLSON:  Not necessarily the


dissemination alone --


QUESTION:  Well, no, not -- don't say not


necessarily.  I'm -- for purposes of my thinking about it,


I'd like to know, imagine we have just dissemination.


GENERAL OLSON:  That something is already in the

public domain.


QUESTION:  That's correct.  The only


justification for the extension, there is no other, is


dissemination of a work that is already in existence.


GENERAL OLSON:  I would not want to rule that


out, Justice Breyer, for the very reason --


QUESTION:  Well, I want to say, do you think yes


or no?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I think that it could very


well be yes, for the reason that in the 1790 statute the


Congress specifically was aware of -- that there were


State copyright laws which didn't last as long as the


Federal statute.  Several of the States hadn't finished


enacting those copyright laws, and a couple of States


hadn't enacted them at all. 


QUESTION:  So in your opinion, in my example, if


you recall it --


GENERAL OLSON:  It's --


QUESTION:  -- your answer would be, if Congress


tomorrow wants to give a copyright to a publisher solely


for the purpose of reproducing and disseminating Ben


Jonson, Shakespeare, it can do it?


GENERAL OLSON:  It may --


QUESTION:  I hate to say may --

 QUESTION:  -- because that really -- that's an


important question.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, because I don't think that


a per -- I don't think there is a per se rule that should


apply here because this is a grant of Congress, to


Congress to exercise its judgment as to what may be


beneficial.  There may be other constitutional provisions


that come into play, or there may be other existing --


QUESTION:  All right, let me explain to you why


it's important to me.  I have a list.  This is an economic


statute.  The harms that seem to be caused by it, the


extension, I've listed as follows, approximate numbers,


made up, but magnitude correct.


The existing copyright holders who survive,


their copyright survives 70 years, who have already been


paid, on the numbers that were given, about $24 billion or


more, will receive an extra $6 billion.  That, I take it,


is a harm.  Their works have already been created.


Harm number 2.  The fact that people, for the 99


percent of the copyrights that have no commercial value


after 70 years, have to find the copyright holder to put


them in databases.  The cost of that, on my numbers in


here, made up, at least a billion dollars, or they can't


find the people at all and get permission, an innumerable


cost, un -- valuable cost to people who want to use it.

Those are costs.


On the plus side I see uniformity,


dissemination, and -- now, you tell me.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I also see compliance with


international competitive markets and the laws that are


being adopted, and the incentives --


QUESTION:  Uniformity.  That's uniformity.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, that's not just


uniformity.  It's providing incentive to people to publish


here, as opposed to publish in Europe, where longer terms


might be available.  There is an incentive to distribute


existing works that may be necessary.  It's the


consistency that Congress is promoting by saying to


individuals, as they might have said when they enacted the


Copyright Clause in the first place, we will not only give


you 14 years, but if we change our mind tomorrow, and


think that a better, a longer period is necessary,


we're -- this is consistency, but it's also a matter of


fairness, and it's --


QUESTION:  Why -- on the last point, it's --


I've counted that as zero.  The reason I've counted it as


zero is it seems to me that the added value, incentive


value to produce between life plus 50, or life plus 70, is


zero.  It's carried out, as the economists do, to three


decimal points, divide by 100 for the probability of your

ever having such a work, and you get virtually zero, no


difference between this and a perpetual copyright.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I think that that's a very


good illustration of why the authority is granted to


Congress, because if you are an 80-year-old writer, that


may make a considerable difference in terms of what you


decide to do.


QUESTION:  How could it?


GENERAL OLSON:  It may -- because you may -- if


you have no incentive, if you know that this is going to


go into the public domain sooner rather than later, it may


affect your judgment with respect to --


QUESTION:  In -- I --


GENERAL OLSON:  It might also affect whether the


publisher -- what the publisher pays for your prospective


work, Justice Breyer.  We -- the Copyright Clause


incentive provides incentives not just for -- not just to


the creators, but to the disseminators, the publishers,


the broadcasters, the film companies.


QUESTION:  So you think, say, Verdi, Othello,


Verdi, Othello, 80 years old, the prospect of an extra 20


years way down the pike would have made a difference?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I think again that


illustrates why the authority is vested in Congress to


make these judgments rather than in courts to make these

judgments, because we're not talking about the effect on


an individual author, or an individual creator.  What the


Framers of the Constitution were concerned about is a


gross judgment with respect to what might generally


provide incentives to the population --


QUESTION:  But it is hard to understand how, if


the overall purpose of the Copyright Clause is to


encourage creative work, how some retroactive extension


could possibly do that.  I -- one wonders what was in the


minds of the Congress, even if somehow they didn't violate


the clause.  But if we affirm here, is there any limiting


principle out there that would ever kick in?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, that's a -- that is a


difficult question to say whether there is any limiting


principle when such a broad grant of power, authority is


given to Congress and has been exercised so repeatedly


that --


QUESTION:  Well, if it's a limited term, as the


Constitution says, is there indeed any limit out there?


GENERAL OLSON:  What I submit -- well, first of


all, even the petitioners acknowledge that, as far as


prospective limits are concerned, that isn't a judgment


that this Court is being made to ask and, in fact, the


petitioners acknowledge that it isn't a judgment that this


Court should make, so the only point that the

anything that --


QUESTION:  In Victorian England you could buy a


box seat for 900 years.  There was serene complacency


about their culture, and God bless them, but --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  -- I really think this is an


important question and, as Justice O'Connor points out, if


we have to ask what's the most plausible explanation for


this rule, to reward existing vested interest or to


stimulate new works, it seems to me that it's probably the


former.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  I mean, we know that.


GENERAL OLSON:  It is -- well, it -- let me say


with respond -- in response to both of those questions, an


unlimited time would violate the Copyright Clause. 


Something that was the functional equivalent of an

Framers specifically did not put in numbers.  They had the


opportunity to do that.  Thomas Jefferson suggested that a


number should be put in.  We submit that it would be --


even -- since the petitioners don't suggest that it's an


appropriate function of this Court, certainly in this


case, to pick a number, 133 years or something of that


nature, but it is quite clear that Congress from the


Statute of Anne, 1710, we have 300 years of history, of


Congress thinking that it continues to benefit the


process, not just of the productivity, of the creation of


the work itself, but the dissemination of it to provide --


QUESTION:  General Olson, you say that the


functional equivalent of an unlimited time would be a


violation, but that's precisely the argument that's being


made by petitioners here, that a limited time which is


extendable is the functionable, functional equivalent of


an unlimited time, a limited time that 10 years from now


can be extended, and then extended again, and extended


again.  Why -- their argument is precisely that, a limited


time doesn't mean anything unless it means, once you have


established the limit for works that have been created


under that limit, that's the end.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, the Framers had an


opportunity to say immutable, unalterable, unamendable. 


They didn't use that.  They used the phrase, limited term,

which means then, meant then and means now, a certain


specified --


QUESTION:  Okay, assuming --


GENERAL OLSON:  -- number of years under the


statute.


QUESTION:  With the exception of a limitation


which illustrates the distinction between forever on the


one hand and a definite number on the other, is there any


limitation in the clause?  Does the promotion, does the


preambular recitation of promotion as such place a limit


on it?


GENERAL OLSON:  I submit, Justice Souter, that


there's no per se limitation, that if there is, as Justice


Scalia suggested, for -- if it is true that Congress,


having specified 14 years or 28 years, decides that


doesn't work very well because of the economies of other


countries, the parade of constraints on artists in other


countries, the reasons that we want things to be preserved


or distributed, it should be 2 more years, or 5 more years


later --


QUESTION:  Yes, but that argument would apply to


new copyrights, but to extension of already existing


copyrights your argument doesn't apply.


GENERAL OLSON:  It does apply, Justice Stevens,


because --

 QUESTION:  The work has already been created.


GENERAL OLSON:  The work has already been


created, but the artists that are creating works day in


and day out take into consideration the fact that Congress


has decided, there's an ease of administration --


QUESTION:  But for them, they get the benefit of


the longer term if you don't apply it to an existing


copyright.  I mean, if you say you need 70 years because


of changes in the economy to encourage works, you grant 70


for the future, but why does that, making that apply to


somebody who created his work 20 years ago and has already


provided what he, the quid pro quo, why do you need it for


him? 


GENERAL OLSON:  We're not just -- because we're


not just talking about the author.  If we -- we're talking


about --


QUESTION:  The Constitution refers to the


authors and the inventors, doesn't it?  They're certainly


the prime actors in this scene, aren't they?


GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, but all of the history of


the development of these clauses suggests that -- and this


Court has indicated in its decisions with respect to


copyright, that the Framers were concerned and the


Congress is legitimately concerned not just in providing


the spark of creativity, but to make sure that that's

distributed widely and available, and there may be many


reasons why -- we're -- we --


QUESTION:  And that it gets into the public


domain at the expiration of the term.  That was an


important part of the bargain.


GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, and what -- but the


definition of the term was a responsibility vested in


Congress, because it has the power -- the legislative


history of the 1998 act itself suggests what was going on


here and suggests why the Framers gave this authority to


Congress.  There were numerous hearings, there were


testimony by the folks that represent the same position as


petitioners here as to why this shouldn't be done, why it


should be done.


Congress weighed -- as this Court, the phrase


that this Court used, I think it was in the Feist case,


the delicate balance that was so difficult for Congress


to --


QUESTION:  How --


QUESTION:  Okay, but you --


QUESTION:  -- what weighs in that balance,


because to go back for one second, in practical, economic


terms I gather the difference between a copyright that


lasts for 100 years, lasts for 1,000 years, lasts forever,


is probably something less than 1,000 -- on $1,000 a

penny.  I mean, it's a penny on 1,000, or probably a lot


less than that, frankly.  So I can not only not imagine a


person whose decision to write would be governed by such a


thing, I cannot imagine a European who would come to


America to copyright his work for such a reason.  Indeed,


I wonder why that European wouldn't come anyway, even if


the term were 10 years, because if he doesn't come, he's


not going to get protection.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, the --


QUESTION:  I mean, who are these people that are


going to be moved by that incentive?


GENERAL OLSON:  The -- as we described in our


brief, in pages 34 through 36, I believe it is in our


brief, that the concerns about the limitation on


exploitation and the limitation of a copyright period in


Europe is based upon the country of origin of the work and


the shortest time available.  So that there may be


differences, and we describe that, but that illustrates,


Justice Breyer, the difference between 1 cents and 10


cents and $100 with respect to this particular author


who's this particular age, or a particular author like


Melville, whose works weren't -- weren't -- didn't -- or


Schubert, whose works weren't properly appreciated or


exploitable until many years after their death.


All of these variations are quintessentially

legislative judgments.  It would be very difficult for the


Framers to have eschewed deciding 14 years was a


constitutional limitation, and for this Court to say 99


years is, and again, even the petitioners aren't asking


the Court to make that judgment.  The petitioners are only


saying that there shall be a per se rule that the word


"limited times," means unchangeable times.


QUESTION:  But there has to be a limit, as you


acknowledge.  Perpetual copyright is not permitted.  Who


is the judge of -- within that line?  Who is the judge of


when it becomes unlimited?  Is there, in other words,


judicial review and, if there is, what standard would this


Court apply to determine whether something short of


perpetual is still unlimited?


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, the issue before this


Court, I hasten to say, as I said before, is only whether,


once the Congress makes that judgment, it can ever change


it retrospectively.  The issue before this Court is not


whether, in the future, a certain length of time would be


appropriate.  That -- but the answer to that, Justice


Ginsburg, I submit, is found in the Necessary and Proper


Clause, and this Court's interpretation of the Necessary


and Proper Clause as to the extent that this Court would


find or not find that the judgment made by Congress with


respect to the implementation of this very broad power is

convenient or useful in terms of the achievement of the


goals.


QUESTION:  Okay, and is your argument that we


should so find and hold against their retrospective


argument, because there is some, at least plausible basis


to say that there can be a causal connection between the


retrospective extension and some benefit that can be


traced to those particular works through the retrospective


extension, like dissemination?  Is that your argument?


GENERAL OLSON:  That is among our arguments,


Justice Souter.


QUESTION:  Is it also your argument that even if


you cannot trace that kind, or at least plausibly argue


that there could be that kind of a causal benefit, that it


would still be constitutional, because you should judge


the extension simply as contributing to a general system,


one feature of which is that from time to time there may


be retrospective extensions, and so long as that general


system induces the creation of works, or the dissemination


of works, or the preservation of works, so long as the


general system works, there is no review, no limitation on


the tinkering that can be done, even retrospectively?  Is


that also your argument?


GENERAL OLSON:  I think that's a fair statement


of an argument that we have made and articulated in the

brief --


QUESTION:  Okay.


GENERAL OLSON:  -- that unless there is a -- the


Court is -- because the circumstances change, that we are


living in an era now where piracy is a significant


problem, there's question of administrative ease, of


administering a system where copyrights may be different


for one set of authors, or different for another set of


authors, there's changes that are taking place


internationally, so that what we're saying is that not


only could this Court conceive of reasons why Congress


thought it was accomplishing the objectives of this


clause, but that there are numerous objectives that are


entirely legitimate in --


QUESTION:  Do you also argue that the Necessary


and Proper Clause alone will justify the retroactive


extension simply as a matter of equity?


GENERAL OLSON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  That is, that the Copyright Clause


justifies the extension for works not yet created, but it


would be enormously inequitable to have other authors who


put in the same amount of work get a lesser protection, so


the Necessary and Proper Clause now allows you to do the


retrospective?


GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, Justice Scalia, and the

examples that are --

inequitable if they get exactly what they were entitled to

GENERAL OLSON:  The implicit promise that --


QUESTION:  I mean, they have some right to


expect that they will be -- you know, an additional grant,


later on?


GENERAL OLSON:  I think that's not an


unreasonable expectation at all, Justice Stevens, because


that was the premise of the --


QUESTION:  That is the way it's always been


done.  There hasn't been any copyright extension that


hasn't applied to subsisting work.


GENERAL OLSON:  That's --


QUESTION:  But there was one -- Justice Breyer


brought up Ben Jonson, so -- this case doesn't involve


works that are already in the public domain.


GENERAL OLSON:  That is correct.

argument under the Necessary and Proper Clause justifies


extension of the copyright for those whose copyright will


expire tomorrow if it's not extended, in order to put them


on parity with those getting copyrights for new works, why


doesn't it apply to the copyright, the holder of the


copyright that expired yesterday?


GENERAL OLSON:  You could arguably -- you could


conceivably make that argument, Justice Souter, but there


is a bright line there.  Something that has already gone


into the public domain, which other individuals or


companies or entities may then have acquired an interest


in, or rights to, or be involved in disseminating --


QUESTION:  And if you don't --


GENERAL OLSON:  This is a rational --


QUESTION:  If you don't draw the line there,


then Ben Jonson certainly gets recopyrighted.


QUESTION:  Well, the difficulty --


QUESTION:  If we're just looking for a bright


line, the line that they suggest between unexpired patents


and copyrights and brand new ones is also just as bright.


GENERAL OLSON:  Oh, I concede that it's a bright


line, but it's a bright line that would have --


QUESTION:  Except Congress chose this one and


didn't choose the other one.  That's --

 QUESTION:  Basically you're saying the


presumption ought to be in the congressional judgment


about how to draw the line as well as in how long a line


to draw.


GENERAL OLSON:  I agree, and this Court has --


we're not just talking about the judgment of the Congress


of the -- the 105th Congress in 1998.  This is the way the


Statute of Anne was written.  This is the way the State


copyright laws were written when this country became a


Nation.  This is the way the 1790 copyright statute, the


number of --


QUESTION:  Well, of course, the original statute


was replacing a bunch of State statutes or State rules,


partly common law, partly statutory, that -- they had kind


of a mixed up legal situation, and there was an interest


in having one uniform rule for the first time around.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, there was an interest in


having a uniform rule, and that's precisely why the


Framers created the Copyright Clause in the Constitution,


but there was copyright protection in some States, there


wasn't copyright protection in other States, and what we


know from the decision of this Court in the Wheaton


decision is that there was not a common law copyright in


existence.  This Court explicitly held that.


Now, the petitioners make this quid pro quo

argument that somehow implicitly the initial 1790


copyright statute was saying to people, you get a


copyright if you exchange whatever existing rights you


have.  That simply does not make any sense.  There is no


language, and it's a relatively late-discovered argument,


because it sees its full --


QUESTION:  I want you to finish that, but I want


you to go back to the -- I have one question on the equity


principle.  Are you -- I want you to finish. 


GENERAL OLSON:  I wasn't finished, but I'm happy


to come back.


QUESTION:  Go ahead.  No, no, you finish first.


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I was going to say there's


no language whatsoever of preemption, abandonment,


abrogation, or exchange in the 1790 copyright, but


compare -- Copyright Act.  But compare that to the 1793


Patent Act under the same clause, where there is that


exchange there.


The other thing, as this Court has said, there


is no implied abrogation of common law rights which would


be a doctrine which would be inconsistent with what the


petitioner is arguing.  Now --


QUESTION:  Why -- I mean, I think you have a


point on this equity principle.  I wonder, is there any


review there?  That is, suppose you have a statute, as

this one arguably is, where 99.9 percent, many billions of


dollars of benefits, are going to the existing holders of


copyright on grounds of equity, and the effect of the


statute in eliciting new works is near zero.  I mean, that


would seem -- where this equity idea is the camel and the


production idea is the gnat, and is there any -- can we


say something like that, or does Congress have total


leeway in respect to --


GENERAL OLSON:  Well, it --


QUESTION:  -- who they want to give the money


to, basically?


GENERAL OLSON:  Justice Breyer, it's conceivable


that the Court might do that if that situation was


present, but it's not remotely the situation here.  We


have the adoption of copyright terms which are consistent,


generally speaking, with copyright terms which exist in


the European Union, our principal competitor, and in


connection with international treaties.


We have a copyright term that's consistent with


the concept of the creator plus the creator's first


generation heirs.  We have a copyright term, remember,


which supersedes the earlier copyright provisions that


were added to the period between creation and publication,


so that the limited number of years in the first, the 1790


and the 1831 statute were the number of years plus the

relatively unlimited period of time between creation and


publication, so we don't have anything remotely like that


in this situation.


We have a process which, as you suggested, or


one of the questions suggested, is -- may not have been


the policy that you as a Member of Congress would have


supported.  You might have made the balance, that delicate


balance that this Court has referred to, in another way,


but that is something that Congress, through its ability


to gather facts and make balances, is quintessentially


capable of doing, and that is where the Framers vested 


the responsibility, and what this statute does is to


favor, if at all, the creator with respect to the


utilization of these rights, as opposed to the person who


wishes to copy the creator.  That's an entirely rational


distinction for Congress to make.


Thank you.


QUESTION:  Thank you, General Olson.


Mr. Lessig, you have 3 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE LESSIG


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. LESSIG:  General Olson has been perfectly


clear in setting out the structure of the Government's


argument.  It is that there is no effective limit on


Congress's power under the Copyright Clause.  Now, were

this the first time this Court had considered Congress's


copyright authority, that might be a plausible argument,


but the very first time this Court ever struck down a law


of Congress as exceeding Article I, section 8 power was in


the context of the Copyright Clause.


We have 125 years of history of this Court


making sure that the limits, both express and implied, in


the Copyright Clause, have some meaning.  The Feist


opinion very clearly sets out the implied limits, a per se


limit for originality, for the reasons Justice Breyer was


trying to get me to say.  The Harper as well as Graham set


out very clear limits on the context of the ability to


extend works in the public domain.  Those limits make no


sense under the reasoning the Government has offered.  The


Government's reasoning would make all of those opinions


irrelevant and wrong.


Now, we offer a simple way to make this clear,


express limit make sense, and that is precisely the


understanding we suggest that existed in 1790.  The only


precedents that existed in 1790  were precedents of


setting a term, and then when parliament was asked in


1735, '37, and '39 to extend it, they rejected it, and as


amicus historians said, they rejected it because, as a


pamphleteer described it, that would be effectively a


perpetual term.


49 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 Now, this delicate balance that the Government


invokes, Justice Breyer, let me give you the numbers.  The


delicate balance is that, under the most reasonable


assumptions of copyright royalty income and under our


interest rate of 7 percent, as the amicus economists note


at page 6, note 6 of their brief, the current term gives


authors 99.8 percent of the value of a perpetual term.


Now, that might be a delicate balance, that they


give the author 99.8 percent and the public .2 percent,


but in my mind, that's delicate in a very different sense


of that term.


Thank you very much.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Lessig.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the
