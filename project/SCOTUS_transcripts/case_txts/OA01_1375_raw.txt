JUSTICE STEVENS:  The Court will hear argument


in the case of the United States against the Navajo Nation


now.


Mr. Kneedler.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. KNEEDLER:  Justice Stevens, and may it


please the Court:


In 1987, the Secretary of the Interior, at the


request of the Navajo Nation and Peabody Coal Company,


approved a package of lease amendments to two outstanding


leases between the parties.  With respect to the lease


principally at issue here, Lease number 8580, the 

amendments increased the royalty to be paid by Peabody


from 37-and-a-half cents per ton to 12-and-a-half percent


of the value of the coal, a more than six-fold increase in


the amount of the royalty.  That new royalty level was the


same as the standard royalty on Federal coal leases, and


it was well in excess of the then regulatory minimum that


the Secretary had prescribed for what a tribe and a coal


company could agree to, which was then only 10 cents per


ton. 


The package of lease amendments also contained

numerous other provisions that were of benefit to the


tribe, including amendments to the other lease, that


more -- that approximately doubled the amount of the


royalty and a substantial increase in payments for water


use at the mines.


The Secretary's approval of the lease package in


1987 fully complied with the Mineral Leasing Act and the


regulations that the Secretary has prescribed to govern


her approval of lease agreements under that act. 


Because there was no violation of any act of


Congress or regulation of an executive department, much


less one that could fairly be interpreted as mandating the


payment of damages by the Government, there is no cause of


action in this case under the Tucker Act. 


The Court --


QUESTION:  Is there some other possible cause of


action?  Certainly it was unfortunate, to say the least,


that the Secretary of the Interior at the time apparently


had private conversations that -- with representatives of


Peabody Coal to try to discourage the approval of the


20-dollar rate.


MR. KNEEDLER:  It was unfortunate, Justice


O'Connor. 


QUESTION:  And is there any other remedy for the


tribe potentially for this action?

QUESTION:  Is there a lawsuit now pending --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Not -- not on that basis. 


QUESTION:  -- to cover something else? 


MR. KNEEDLER:  There's a -- there's a suit by


the tribe against Peabody, but -- but the -- as a remedy


against the United States, the only suit would be


conceivably an APA action.


I -- I should point out that there was no


regulation or statute that barred that communication at


the time. 


QUESTION:  It's the APA action.  I mean, is


this -- is this a proceeding -- was the proceeding


supposed to be a proceeding required by statute to be 

decided on a record?


MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  No, it was not.


QUESTION:  Well, then that's an informal


adjudication. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  I'm -- I'm not --


QUESTION:  Ex parte communications take place


all the time in those situations.  So what's unfortunate


about it?  Maybe it was unfortunate politically, but I


mean, legally --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.

MR. KNEEDLER:  There was not and there was not


in the Secretary's regulations at the time.  I did not


mean to imply --


QUESTION:  Would there be now?


MR. KNEEDLER:  No. 


QUESTION:  I mean, I don't know any agency --


MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  There's --


QUESTION:  -- that ever forbids of something


like that, but I might be wrong.  I want to find out about


it. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  No, there's -- there's not. 


And -- and I didn't mean to imply that an APA suit would


be successful.  All I meant to say is that that would be


the avenue in which to test that because an argument that


that was a -- that that was a violation would be


essentially --


QUESTION:  Violation of what?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Of -- of some -- some standard of


procedure of fairness -- procedural fairness I suppose


that a court would impose.  Again, we don't think that a

court could do that.  I -- I simply wanted to say that


if --


QUESTION:  There are some D.C. Circuit cases


that suggest when there's a contest between a valuable


privilege, that ex parte communications are not -- not to


be permitted.


MR. KNEEDLER:  But that is -- that is not


something, first of all, that -- that appears in a statute


or regulation, and under Vermont Yankee, which I think


came after those D.C. Circuit decisions, it wouldn't be


proper for a court to impose that on a -- onto an agency. 


In any event, there was no restriction here.


QUESTION:  The D.C. Circuit used to create its


own APA before -- before --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  -- before Vermont Yankee.


MR. KNEEDLER:  That's -- that's correct.  And


we --


(Laughter.) 


MR. KNEEDLER:  We don't think there's any legal


standard, but even if there were, that sort of thing is


not something that would mandate the payment of -- of


damages for a violation.


QUESTION:  The APA suit that you're -- you're


envisioning as a potential -- that doesn't have any

dollars attached to it.  That would be for declaratory


injunction?


MR. KNEEDLER:  To -- or to set aside the -- the


Secretary's subsequent approval of the lease or -- or


something of that nature. 


QUESTION:  Well, the lease is now expired, I


take it.


MR. KNEEDLER:  The lease --


QUESTION:  We're not still operating under that


same lease, or are we?


MR. KNEEDLER:  We -- we are.  The -- the tribe


and the -- and the Peabody are still operating under that


same lease.  It was amended in 1987.  This was 3 years


after the -- the communication that -- that you're


referring to.


QUESTION:  And there's been no application to


set aside the lease.


MR. KNEEDLER:  There has not.  And -- and as


I -- as I pointed out, there are numerous aspects of the


lease package that was approved in -- in 1987 that are


advantageous to the -- to the tribe.


QUESTION:  And since the events, has the tribe


obtained the authority to impose taxes that was not


previously --


MR. KNEEDLER:  It -- well, the -- this Court in

1985 in the Kerr-McGee case upheld the right of the Navajo


tribe to impose taxes, but that's without the Secretary's


approval.  And these lease agreement -- the lease


amendments in 1987 were negotiated and arrived at in -- in


the context of that decision. 


Now, the -- the tribe has waived its right to


collect taxes with respect to coal that goes to the -- a


generating station in -- in Arizona.  The rest of the


coal, though, is subject to the -- to the tax.  There's an


overall cap on that. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, just -- could I just go


back for a second to the Secretary's private


communications with the -- the coal company?  Is it your


position that did not breach any fiduciary obligation


whatsoever?


MR. KNEEDLER:  No --


QUESTION:  They did not have a fiduciary


obligation to the tribes?


MR. KNEEDLER:  It did not -- it did not breach a


legal fiduciary obligation.  There is a -- there is a


sense in which everything that the Secretary of the


Interior does or, for that matter, everything the United


States Government does with respect to Indians is -- is of


a fiduciary nature in a moral sense.  In a political


sense --

 QUESTION:  So at least in that respect, it's


different from the Vermont Yankee situation. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, but -- but it's important


to look at the context in which this communication


occurred.  The -- what -- what the -- what the Secretary


was being asked to do or -- or what -- what the Interior


Department was being asked to do was to make an adjustment


under an existing -- a term of the existing lease that


said that the royalty amount that was then prescribed,


which was 37-and-a-half percent, was subject to a


reasonable adjustment by the Secretary after the 20-year


anniversary of the lease.


QUESTION:  Well, isn't it -- isn't it -- maybe I


misunderstand the facts.  But wasn't it fairly clear that


had this conversation not taken place, that the adjustment 

would have been put into effect that the tribe wanted?


MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't think that's clear at all


because the -- Peabody Coal Company -- aside from this


communication, Peabody Coal Company sent the letter to the


Secretary of the Interior in early July of 1985 in -- in


which the representative of Peabody said, it appears that


the tribe believes that there's an imminent decision in


its favor on appeal from the local BIA area directors


setting the 20 percent rate.


QUESTION:  Which was true, wasn't it?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, yes.  That was -- that was


true.  But that's a subordinate official in the Interior


Department.  The Secretary of the Interior -- as a matter


of constitutional law, and as a matter of the regulations


in effect at the time, the Secretary of the Interior had


the authority to take control of any matter that was then


pending in the Department. 


But my important -- the important point is that


in that letter, Peabody Coal Company requested the


Secretary to assume jurisdiction over the matter, and to


either rule in its favor or, failing that, to -- to send


the parties -- request the parties to negotiate further,


which is exactly what happened.


QUESTION:  And that letter --


MR. KNEEDLER: 


That letter -- that letter was --

a copy of that letter was sent to the Navajo Nation.  And


it -- it subsequently is clear that -- deposition


testimony of Mr. Nelson, which is in the joint appendix in


this case, makes it clear that he understood.  He was --


he was a special assistant to the chairman of the Navajo


Nation at the time.  It makes it clear that -- that the


Navajo Nation had understood that the Secretary preferred


for them to go back to negotiate, which was a -- a


perfectly reasonable response by the Secretary of the


Interior in that situation.

 The -- the increase of the royalty rate from --


from approximately 1 percent or a little over 1 percent to


20 percent was unilateral by the area director.  It --


there was not a -- input by -- by Peabody at that time,


even though the area director communicated with --


QUESTION:  Did both the tribe and Peabody


understand what was being considered, the increase that


had been recommended by the junior people in the


Department? 


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  That -- that -- the -- the


area director's increase of -- to 20 percent, an


adjustment of 20 percent, was appealed by -- was appealed


by Peabody and the utilities that -- that are served by


Peabody.  And that appeal was briefed to the Assistant


Secretary, and it was pending. 


And then in -- in July 

that was -- that area director's decision was in 1984. 


The briefing was, I think, about 6 months later, and then


in July of 1985, the -- is -- is when the Secretary


requested the Assistant Secretary to put off deciding this


and have the parties negotiate.  And they reached a


tentative agreement within -- within a month.  It was --


QUESTION:  If -- if Fritz, the Assistant


Secretary, had signed off on the 20 percent, would there


have been a further -- further recourse by --


MR. KNEEDLER:  The -- the Secretary could have

overruled that.  The -- the Secretary under the -- under


the governing regulations that we quote in our brief the


Secretary retained the authority to overrule any decision


by -- by the Assistant Secretary. 


QUESTION:  Mr. -- I'm sorry. 


QUESTION:  There was -- you mentioned in your


brief another route, appellate route, that could have been


taken in this case which would have rendered a final


decision, one not subject to the Secretary's --


MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  I believe that could have


still been subject to the Secretary's determination. 


What -- what the Navajo Nation could have done, if it did


not want to continue with negotiations, was to request


that the matter be transferred from this informal appeals


process to the Assistant Secretary to a formal appeals 

process which goes to the Interior Board of Indian


Appeals. 


QUESTION:  Well, I think --


MR. KNEEDLER:  At that point the Secretary could


have assumed jurisdiction of the matter from the IBIA


under the same regulation I referred to.  The Secretary


always had it within his power to -- to take -- take


cognizance of a case and not leave it with the -- with the


board. 


QUESTION:  Even if the court --

 MR. KNEEDLER:  There was a prohibition against

otherwise the Secretary retained the authority to -- to


take the case. 


QUESTION:  Mr. -- Mr. Kneedler, did the -- was


the Secretary's approval required on the contract that


included, or the -- the revision that included the


12-and-a-half percent royalty rate?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, there were two leases, and


the Secretary's approval was required.  But the reason was


different for the two.  In the -- under the lease


principally at issue here, 8580 --


QUESTION:  Let's just take that one. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  -- the -- the lease itself had a


clause that said that the royalty was subject to a 

reasonable adjustment


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. KNEEDLER:  -- by the Secretary.


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. KNEEDLER:  As to that, we believe that there


could be no claim under the Tucker Act for the -- for the


fundamental reason that that is not a -- a duty that is


prescribed by an act of Congress, or a regulation under


the Tucker Act. 


QUESTION:  No, no.  I -- I understand.  Wasn't

that also subject to the general statutory requirement


that these leases be approved by the Secretary?  They --


you know, it would be negotiated by the tribes, but


ultimately didn't it require the Secretary's approval?


MR. KNEEDLER:  It -- it may well have and that


was not -- that was not addressed.  The basis of the claim


here was --


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. KNEEDLER:  -- that the Secretary had -- had


a duty under the lease.


QUESTION:  -- let -- let me just assume and --


and maybe I shouldn't do this, but you just briefly at


least assume that the Secretary's approval was required as


a -- a matter of statute.  Would that approval


responsibility -- in your judgment -- carry any duty 

toward the tribe, anything comparable to a fiduciary duty


toward the tribe not to approve an amendment if that


amendment was not as good as the -- in the Secretary's


judgment, the tribe could have gotten?


MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  There's -- in -- in our view


there is no duty under this statute to maximize returns to


the tribe.


QUESTION:  What -- Tell -- let me ask you --


maybe it would be easier if I asked you kind of the


converse question.  What responsibility does the approval

responsibility include?  In other words, is it merely


ministerial, or does it imply any duty at all toward the


tribe?


MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't know that I would call it


ministerial, but -- but the statute is -- is rather bare


in its terms.  It just says that the -- that the tribe,


through its council -- and this is -- this is a statute of


general application -- may -- with the approval of the


Secretary -- lease its land for coal purposes.  What


the -- what the preconditions for the Secretary to give


his approval are then and now is a matter for the


Secretary to flesh out by regulations. 


QUESTION:  So --


QUESTION:  Well, is -- does the United States,


though, have some general duty of trust to the tribe? 

MR. KNEEDLER:  I think it would be fair to say


that -- that there is -- that there is a -- as I said, a


general moral and political duty. 


QUESTION:  Sure.  And so when the Secretary has


to approve a lease, should that general duty be kept in


mind as part of that process?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Surely.  Surely, and again we're


not -- we're -- we quite agree that as -- that as a matter


of what -- what judgment should -- should inform the


Secretary in her approval of the lease.

statute, is there?  I mean, I -- I think the -- the point


that Justice O'Connor is -- is raising is -- is my point. 


Once you get a specific statutory obligation, assuming 

that approval carries some obligation of care, inquiry,


whatever, doesn't that carry with it some of the duty that


we normally have in mind when we talk about the trust


duty, and doesn't that take it out of the sphere of the


merely moral and the merely political into the legal?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, that -- let me answer it


this way.  The Secretary -- as I said, I believe it's up


to the Secretary to decide how to flesh out the regime for


her approval of leases and she has done this in the


regulations including, importantly, now and at the time

per ton.  Now, it's 12-and-a-half percent, which is the


standard rate of --


QUESTION:  But a minimum -- a minimum is a


minimum.


MR. KNEEDLER:  No.


QUESTION:  So there's still something to argue


about there, I would --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, no.  And it's important to


understand why -- why I -- I think that's not correct the


way the Secretary's regulations are written. 


This act has a number of goals, one of which is


revenue for the tribe, but another is tribal self-


determination, and this is clear from the legislative 

history of the Indian Mineral Leasing Act as described in


1938 and described by this Court in its Cotton Petroleum


decision.  So the -- the point is that it is up to the


tribe to enter into agreements subject to approval by the


Secretary. 


QUESTION:  Well, then I -- I think the


implication of your argument is that the approval is


purely ministerial.  In other words, if the tribe is the


responsible party, then the Government is not.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the -- the -- it's actually

something of a hybrid I -- I believe.  And what the


Secretary has chosen to impose on herself, which is not


the same thing as to whether it's -- it's legally


enforceable, is a set of regulations that would govern the


way in which she approves a lease.  And with respect to --


again, with respect to royalty, there is a specific


regulation that says 12-and-a-half percent. 


What -- the way the Secretary has -- has


accommodated these competing goals is that there is a -- a


minimum set of standards to which any agreement between a


tribe and a lessee enter into, any -- a set of standards


that must be satisfied.  Beyond that -- beyond those --


satisfaction of those standards, it is up to the tribe and


the -- and the lessee --


QUESTION:  Well, all right.  That's, I take it,


their argument -- as I understand their argument, or part


of it anyway, is that if you put -- we hold property in


trust for the tribe.  That by itself doesn't do much for


them.  That's Mitchell I. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  Right. 


QUESTION:  But when you get a whole lot of very


detailed rules and regulations about how the Government


needs to behave, well, then, you find that there is a


specific duty for the Government even if it isn't quite in


those rules and regulations to behave like a trustee of a

trust, i.e., use prudent care, reasonable care, whatever


the standards are. 


So they're saying whatever the details of the


regs are here, there certainly was a highly detailed set


of something that governed how the Government would behave


in this particular lease complexity, a very complicated


situation.  And therefore, regardless of what they said,


there was also, because of that complexity, an obligation


for the Government to use reasonable, prudent care no


matter what the regs said. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --


QUESTION:  And that's what they didn't do here. 


You see, it's just like Mitchell II.


MR. KNEEDLER:  But it's -- it's not just like


Mitchell II.


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, what's your response


to that? 


MR. KNEEDLER:  And I -- and I think the


important difference is in Mitchell II the Court recited a


number of specific statutory duties -- statutory and


regulatory duties that were directed at assuring a


particular amount of income for the tribe under the


circumstances.  Fair market value for a right-of-way. 


Sustained yield management of -- of timber harvest. 


Specific statutory directives to take into account the

financial needs of the beneficiaries whose allotments were


going to be logged off.


QUESTION:  I see where you're going.  I see


where you're going with that.  But that reads Mitchell II


very narrowly.  And it is as if in that forest filled with


Government foresters that the tribe members had to stay


out of, one day a forester working for the Government


introduces some termites into the trees, and lo and


behold, there doesn't happen to be a particular anti-


termite regulation.  I think you'd read Mitchell II as


even though there's no anti-termite regulation, still


there was a duty of care there for the Government not to


behave that way. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I -- I don't think so.  I


mean, again, there may be -- there may be a tort action. 

The -- the Tucker Act does not cover the entire


universe --


QUESTION:  So if I think --


QUESTION:  Termites are good for trees. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  You know, they're -- they're not good


for houses, but they're good for trees. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  No.  These are bad anti-tree


termites.

MR. KNEEDLER:  But the --


QUESTION:  If -- if I read Mitchell II somewhat


more broadly and thought that there was an obligation


there to behave like a trustee even if I couldn't pin it


to a particular reg, this particular action, would I then


have to decide against you here?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, no, because we -- we think


that there was -- that the Secretary's approval of the --


of the lease amendments in 1987 satisfied a duty of


reasonable prudence.  The standard that was articulated in


the documents presented to the Secretary for approval


was -- was whether the lease package could be regarded as


a reasonable exercise of -- of business judgment.  This


was set forward --


QUESTION:  Well, but that -- that argument sort


of takes the lease terms simply in the context of the --


the 12-and-a-half percent minimum that the Secretary had


taken.  But it seems to me that they have a stronger


argument and it is closer to the termite argument.  And


the stronger argument is whatever your obligations as a


trustee may be under the approval responsibility, you at


least have an obligation not to skew the bargaining


process in a way that hurts us when you know that is what


it will do.

 And as I understand the argument about the


ex parte communication, it's not that the ex parte


communication was per se unlawful.  It -- it clearly


wasn't.  The argument is that the ex parte communication


resulted in action by the Secretary that, in effect,


induced the tribe to take a different negotiating posture


from the one it would have taken.  And therefore, their


argument is like the termite argument:  You're not


supposed to introduce bad termites into the forest, and


you're not supposed to take action as a minimum that hurts


us as negotiators.


What is your response to that? 


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, several things.  The -- the


termite example is different, first of all, in that it has


an immediate physical impact on the -- on the trees -- the 

substance of the trust.  What you're describing is a


procedural -- is -- is at bottom a procedural --


QUESTION:  It makes trees less valuable.  This


makes coal less valuable under the contract.  They get


hurt. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the -- the -- secondly,


the -- there is no indication that the substance of the


communications was any different from the -- from what the


tribe knew anyway, which was that Peabody had requested


the Secretary not to act and to allow the parties to

return to negotiations.  But beyond that, when they --


then the -- this -- this -- these are all things that


happened in 1984 and 1985.  That was superseded by the


parties' lease agreement in 1987. 


In 1987, as part of the lease agreement that was


submitted to the Secretary and that the Navajo Nation


requested that the Secretary approve, the area director's


decision that initially established a 20 percent rate


unilaterally was vacated and Peabody's appeal was


dismissed.  That wiped the slate clean for everything that


happened up until then.


The question then is what is -- was the 1987


lease amendment package proper?  And under Mitchell, as we


see it, unless there is a violation of a specific


statutory or regulatory provision in the approval of the 

lease, there cannot be a claim for money damages under the


Tucker Act.  And --


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, you had started to


explain that the -- the responsibility, or the authority


came out of the lease itself with respect to -- to the


main lease --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Right. 


QUESTION:  -- that we're talking about.  But


then you said that there was also Secretary approval


involved in the one where it wasn't a term of the lease.

I think you started to say that.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  In -- in 1987, what the


parties presented to the Secretary was not a proposal to


adjust the royalty under the -- Article VI of the existing


lease.  It was a set of new amendments that, among other


things, superseded that clause of the lease and put in


place another dispute resolution mechanism for adjusting


the royalties in the future.  As part of that, the -- the


controversy with respect to the 1985 -- 1984 to 1985


adjustment was -- was eliminated. 


But that 1987 package provided well in excess of


the minimum royalty rate both for the 8580 lease and also


the other lease with -- for the Navajo with respect to


coal it owned jointly with the Hopi Tribe.  And that


satisfied the specific regulatory standard that the 

Secretary had prescribed for deciding when she would


approve lease agreements.


QUESTION:  What I can't quite understand with


reference to your position as to the correct reading of


Mitchell II is this:  It seems to me you say that even if


there's a breach of a fiduciary duty, there still has to


be some specific statute or regulation which we violate,


and that specific statute or regulation must imply that


there is a cause of action for damages.  That makes the


fiduciary component quite irrelevant.  Either there's a

specific statute, or there isn't. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  No, I don't think it does because


it -- the fiduciary -- the important discussion in


Mitchell II of the fiduciary responsibility had to do with


whether the specific statutory or regulatory duty -- which


is prong one -- could in turn be fairly interpreted to


requirement -- require the payment of compensation. 


That's where the fiduciary obligation comes in. 


But this case fails at the first step because


there is no specific statutory or regulatory provision


that was violated. There's no need to get to the second


step in the analysis on that theory. 


And this specificity requirement was reflected


in Testan and Sheehan, both of which were decided prior


to -- to Mitchell. 


Both say that there has to be a right 

granted with specificity. 


It's also confirmed by things that have happened


since then.  That's the way the Federal Circuit in the


Brown and Pawnee decisions that we -- that were cited in


the decision below looked at Mitchell -- Mitchell II. 


There had to be a specific provision that was violated.


And that's also entirely consistent with last


year's decision in the Gonzaga case under -- under the


very parallel situation of 1983 where the Court said there


has to be a -- a right granted with specificity -- an

entitlement granted with specificity -- where the question


is whether a -- a -- another Federal statute gives rise to


a cause of action under a general cause of action creating


a statute, in that case 1983.  But we think the analysis


is directly parallel. 


If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my


time for rebuttal. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Frye.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL E. FRYE


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. FRYE:  In listening -- Mr. -- Justice


Stevens, and may it please the Court:


In listening to the Government, it's clear that


the Government has not come to terms yet with the basic


principle established in Mitchell II, that where Congress 

gives the Federal Government control of Indian property,


that control necessarily implicates trust duties.  And


violations of trust duties, when the Government is


exercising responsibilities, within the contours of those


statutes and regulations, gives rise to a claim for money


damages in the Court of Federal Claims.  That's what's


missing. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Frye, the Government has stressed


that this is not a control situation like Mitchell II. 


Rather, like Mitchell I, one of the objectives of this

legislation of IMLA was to give the tribe the management


and control authority, and the Government had just a


secondary role of approving at the end of the road.  But


unlike the -- the United States was running the timber


operation.  Here, it's the tribe that's negotiating the


lease.  It seems to me that's quite different. 


MR. FRYE:  That's a two-part question.  One,


after the Navajo tribe signed the coal lease in 1964, it


had absolutely no control over anything.  I'd like to read


you one -- just one regulation, one operating regulation,


that the Secretary has.  It empowers -- and this is at


page 44 of our lodging.  This is BLM's responsibility, not


even BIA who has the principal responsibility.  BLM has


the responsibility to, quote, oversee exploration,


development, production, resource recovery and protection, 

diligent development, continued operation, preparation,


handling, product verification, and abandonment


operations.


QUESTION:  Oversee.  What does oversee mean? 


Did it do that or oversee it?  I mean --


MR. FRYE:  Oh, the Secretary doesn't mine coal


anymore than the BIA cuts timber, but BIA sells timber to


private timber companies to do the timber-cutting.  The


BIA oversees that timber production in the same way it


oversees the coal operation.

 QUESTION:  I'm not sure that that's anything


more specific than the general trust responsibility that


the United States has.  It has to oversee the disposition


of all the lands that it holds in trust, but I'm not sure


that that's the kind of control that -- that we were


talking about in Mitchell II.


MR. FRYE:  Well, Mitchell II control is


absolutely parallel.  The same --


QUESTION:  What -- what about --


MR. FRYE:  Yes, the second part of your


question. 


QUESTION:  The purpose of IMLA was to help the


Indians exercise their own sovereignty.


MR. FRYE:  IMLA has come before this Court


several times. 


In the first case, in the Poafpybitty case 

in 1968, the Government looked at IMLA and said this


statute imposes trust responsibilities and trust duties on


the Government.  It said that three times in that


decision.


QUESTION:  Does it waive sovereign immunity in


the statute for purposes of monetary damages against the


Government?  It doesn't do so expressly.


MR. FRYE:  It doesn't do so expressly just as


the -- the timber statutes didn't do so expressly in


Mitchell II.  But it has that same overlay of

comprehensive Federal control and regulation. 


QUESTION:  That's true, but -- but the


Government had a good response to my question, which was


that if, in fact, I was agreeing with you for the purposes


of interpreting Mitchell II hypothetically, they said, you


know, this is a procedure, and it's a procedure that


you're complaining was violated.  And that's significant


for two reasons.  First, it would read this trust


responsibility as creating procedures in identical


circumstances where a party is an Indian tribe that do not


exist in respect to anyone else, and secondly, it would be


finding a -- money damages, $600 million in fact, for a


violation of this -- one of these procedural regulations.


And I cannot even think -- though there may be


some, I cannot think of an instance where a private person 

who really has been badly hurt can recover money damages


from the Government where what the Government did was not


follow the right procedure.  So it's new procedures, plus


the money damages, and you'd have to overcome all those


hurdles.


MR. FRYE:  Okay.  We are not complaining,


Justice Breyer, about any procedural problem.  What we are


complaining is -- is about the Secretary colluding with


Peabody Coal Company to swindle the Navajo Nation.  That's


what this case is all about.

 QUESTION:  That's -- that's -- tell me a little


bit less pejoratively and --


MR. FRYE:  I will tell you. 


QUESTION:  -- more specifically.  Yes.


MR. FRYE:  Yes.  The -- the memorandum that


Secretary Hodel hand-delivered to Fritz, every word of


that was penned by Peabody's lawyers in -- in the


administrative appeal, and that's shown in the joint


appendix --


QUESTION:  Again, that's -- you know, in a


particular context, that might be terrible, but when


you're talking about administration, it's a very common


thing for parties to submit proposed findings, et cetera. 


So I don't know about this circumstance, but that -- that


in and of itself is -- is not obviously it. 

MR. FRYE:  That wasn't my entire answer.


Following that, the Secretary of the Interior


basically instructed his subordinate to lie to the Navajo


Nation so it would not know what went on.  The -- and that


subordinate was the last person that the Navajo Nation


would have expected to deceive it.  That person had worked


with Navajo Chairman Peterson Zah on the reservation and


had named his son Peterson Zah Vollmann. 


After that, the negotiations were skewed, as


Justice Souter mentioned.  The Navajo Nation thought,

because of these odd communications coming from


Washington, that its trustee thought that the 20 percent


figure was vulnerable on the merits.  We're talking about


a breach of trust.  And the -- the question is whether


the --


QUESTION:  Maybe he did think it was vulnerable


on the merits.  I mean, couldn't the Secretary think that?


MR. FRYE:  The record -- the record shows


absolutely no consideration by the Secretary.  The


standard that was at play here --


QUESTION:  Well, isn't -- isn't that -- isn't


that was -- isn't that the representation that Peabody


made to the Secretary, that that was just an enormous


increase in the -- in the fee? 


MR. FRYE: 


Peabody actually -- the letter that 

Peabody wrote to Secretary Hodel that was mentioned by my


brother Kneedler actually didn't get to Hodel's office. 


The record shows that that -- that that letter was routed


directly to Fritz, code 200 on the document, and that


Fritz gave it to his solicitors who were working on his


opinion, and those --


QUESTION:  No.  I understand that.  But -- but


don't you think in the ex parte -- the -- the oral


ex parte contact, the same point was made?  What --


MR. FRYE:  We have no idea what was made.

you're -- you're upping our -- our cost 20 times?  I mean,


you know, that's incredible. 


MR. FRYE:  That's -- that's not the context of


this discussion.  The -- the royalty rate was upped to


20 percent a year before.  We had had extensive briefing,


studies done by the Department of the Interior, all of


which said that 20 percent was the right number.  The


Secretary of the Interior had no basis for saying it was


the wrong number.


QUESTION:  What is the number today? 


MR. FRYE:  The number today --

MR. FRYE:  -- is less than the Federal minimum


of 12-and-a-half percent.  And we proved that, and that's


in our proposed finding of fact number 315 that it was --


QUESTION:  What -- has the tribe asked to set


aside this lease?


MR. FRYE:  We have not.  We didn't learn about


this until discovery in this case.


QUESTION:  Well, you know about it now.  I mean,


does the tribe want out from under this lease?


MR. FRYE:  We have sued Peabody, and there are

aspects of that that deal with reformation of the lease.


But we don't have any ability to get past damages from the


Government for breach of trust for the time period for


which this activity was concealed.


QUESTION:  I don't -- I don't understand what


the breach of trust consists of.  Number one, it -- you --


you acknowledge it doesn't consist in the -- in the ex


parte contract.  I -- contact.  I assume that any trustee


does -- does not have an obligation to call in the -- the


cestui que trust whenever -- whenever a lessee wants to


talk about something.  I'm sure many trustees deal ex


parte.


MR. FRYE:  No -- no trustee has the ability to


be disloyal, actively disloyal to the -- to the


beneficiary.


QUESTION:  I'm not -- I'm not talking about


actively -- I'm just talking about the ex parte --


receiving ex parte presentations --


MR. FRYE:  The Secretary --


QUESTION:  -- from somebody who wants -- who


wants a lease altered.  Can -- can an ordinary trustee do


that? 


MR. FRYE:  The -- the Secretary and any ordinary


trustee can receive all the communications he wants.


QUESTION:  Absolutely.

 MR. FRYE:  If the question is what the Secretary


did in response to that --


QUESTION:  All right, and so -- so then you --


you're down to what the Secretary did in response.  That


depends on what the Secretary's obligation is, I -- I


presume.


MR. FRYE:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And as I read the statute and


regulations, the Secretary's only obligation was to assure


that a very low minimum was -- was complied with.  And


after that, the negotiation was up to the tribe.  Is that


a fair representation of -- of what the statute and regs


require?


MR. FRYE:  The statutes and regulations did


require minimum royalty rates, and as this Court held --

QUESTION:  Which are very low. 


MR. FRYE:  Very low.  Absurdly low.  I mean,


the -- the Government would say to this Court if we had


approved -- if we had misled the Navajo Nation so badly


that it would have taken 11 cents a ton, we could approve


the 11 cents a ton because the minimum royalty rate was


10 cents a ton even though we knew it was worth $4 a ton


in royalty.


QUESTION:  Yes, but -- I'm actually having


exactly the same problem.

 MR. FRYE:  Okay. 


QUESTION:  What precisely is it that breached


the trust, without any characterization? 


MR. FRYE:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Who said -- what is the act that's


supposed to be the breach of the fiduciary duty?  It's


not, you're saying now, the procedure of ex parte


communication.  It is -- and then you said there was a


misrepresentation.  What was that?  I mean, are there


other things too?


MR. FRYE:  Yes.  There are a variety of things


that led the tribe to accept Peabody's proposed package


of -- of lease concessions from our standpoint, and the --


the breach --


QUESTION: 


Well, would you --

MR. FRYE:  -- the culminating events of the


breach --


QUESTION:  Can I interrupt you, sir?  Could --


could you specify what the variety is because I want to


know the same thing Justice Breyer wants to know. 


MR. FRYE:  Yes.  The culminating event was the


approval of a lease for a less than 12-and-a-half percent


royalty rate where the tribe gives up -- has a negative


bonus of $89 million in back --


QUESTION:  All right.  But that's -- that's a

lease that the -- that the tribe at that point had agreed


to.  Would you specify what the Government did or said,


number one, that led the tribe to act differently from the


way it would have acted otherwise? 


MR. FRYE:  But for the Secretary's intervention,


20 percent would have been slipped in as the new royalty


rate.


QUESTION:  What intervention?  Precisely what?


MR. FRYE:  The -- the memo that Peabody's


lawyers wrote that Secretary Hodel signed telling the


deciding official to stop action.


QUESTION:  Well, now wait a minute.  When --


when the Secretary exercises his authority to approve


leases, is it your -- is it your contention that the only


obligation -- not to approve leases, but to -- but to --

to give effect to that provision of the lease which allows


him to increase the lease rates -- that's what we're


talking about here.  When he -- when he approaches that


obligation, is it your contention that his only duty is to


the tribe?


MR. FRYE:  Yes.  That -- that is the --


QUESTION:  He should raise it -- he should raise


it 5,000 percent if he can get away with it? 


MR. FRYE:  The --


QUESTION:  Surely --

 MR. FRYE:  The key modifier is if he can get


away with it. 


QUESTION:  -- I just don't read it that way.  It


seems to me that no -- anybody would be crazy to enter


into a lease like that.  One would expect that the -- that


the Secretary would act fairly.  Sure, take into account


what's fair for the tribe, but also what's fair for the


coal company that entered into a lease at a much lower


rate earlier at arm's length.  You think he -- you think


the Secretary couldn't take into account what's fair for


the coal company at all.


MR. FRYE:  What the Secretary had to take into


account is provided by the language of Article VI of the


lease.  The adjustment had to be reasonable.  And to --


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MR. FRYE:  And to find that out, the


Secretary's --


QUESTION:  And reasonable doesn't mean whatever


will give the tribe the most money.  It also certainly


includes what -- what's fair for the -- for the person


who -- on the other side of the lease who -- who is


suddenly getting socked with a 20-fold increase.  I don't


think that's unreasonable at all for the Secretary to take


that into account. 


MR. FRYE:  The Secretary can't doff his trust

responsibilities by donning the mantel of an


administrator.  If it's reasonable, that means I think


necessarily that the Secretary can't set it so high as to


bankrupt the operation and stop the coal mining.


QUESTION:  But that may be, but there must be a


statute -- there must be a statute that turned over to the


Secretary or his office the job of interpreting that word


reasonable in the lease.  What -- what's that statute?


MR. FRYE:  That would be the Indian Mineral


Leasing Act.


QUESTION:  And it gives the Secretary -- and


you're saying that that statute, when it gives the


Secretary the power to decide what is or is not reasonable


under the lease, means that the Secretary must really just


take the Indians' point of view into account? 

MR. FRYE:  Absolutely not.  He needs to exercise


independent judgment to make sure that whatever the


royalty rate that he is going to substitute for the


original one is reasonable. 


QUESTION:  Is fair, in other words, to


everybody.


MR. FRYE:  I think fair is not a bad


characterization.  Fair and reasonable. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  Then -- well, but then what's


the -- the breach here?  He was doing apparently what he

thought was fair, I guess.  I mean, maybe it was -- maybe


he was wrong, but --


MR. FRYE:  The Secretary was not doing what he


thought was fair.  The -- Peabody sent his best friend in


there with his pocket full of Peabody's money and -- and


it was -- and that's in the records.  It's $13,000 for a


couple of hours of work.  And he says, my clients have


learned that there is a decision coming down that's going


to hurt them.  Put a stop to it.  And the Secretary did. 


There was no independent judgment. 


QUESTION:  That $13,000 didn't go to the


Secretary, did it?


MR. FRYE:  Oh, there's no -- absolutely --


QUESTION:  That was -- that was for the


lobbyist.


MR. FRYE:  It was for the lobbyist.  And


frankly, he was underpaid for this -- this bit of


skullduggery. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  I agree with you. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. FRYE:  I'd like to get back to Justice


Ginsburg's question about the second purpose of the


statute.  Here, the Department of the Interior thwarted


both purposes of the statute.  It thwarted our independent

ability to have a -- to exercise our self-determination in


an informed way.  It disinformed us so that we couldn't


exercise informed self-determination.  And -- and that's


what the judge in the Court of Federal Claims said.  He


said, a negotiator's weapon is knowledge.  And unaware of


these things, the Navajo Nation was without critical


knowledge, and in fact, the record shows that the


Secretary was giving this knowledge and more to the people


who were negotiating against us.  So we didn't have that


ability --


QUESTION:  May I just interrupt?  Mr. Kneedler


said that this really was all contained in the letter that


was sent to the Secretary with copies to the tribe


earlier.


MR. FRYE: 


The -- the request was -- was 

included in that letter, and -- and the tribe did get a


copy of that letter.  But we didn't know that the


Secretary had acted on Peabody's request.  In fact, the


Secretary told us the opposite. 


QUESTION:  But didn't you know that at least --


didn't you know at least it was a possibility as long as


the letter was on the table? 


MR. FRYE:  I guess that -- it certainly would be


a possibility. 


But there -- there was sort of a law of the case

that developed in this administrative procedure.  Peabody


made the same request of Secretary Clark, and


Secretary Clark said to his Assistant Secretary Fritz,


what should I do with this?  So Fritz asked everybody, do


you want me to stay this so you can negotiate?  The Navajo


Nation said no. 


Fritz then wrote everybody saying, we've gotten


your letter.  You wanted us to set aside this procedure so


you can negotiate.  Not everyone wants to negotiate.  So


we're going to continue.  That was kind of the law of the


case here. 


Getting back to Justice Breyer's question, the


culminating event was the approval of a lease at


sub-12-and-a-half percent rates when every Federal study


said the royalty rate ought to be 20 percent.  There was


no other Federal study.  And that was a breach of the duty


of care.


This Court has said in the Kerr-McGee case that


the basic purpose of the Indian Mineral Leasing Act --


QUESTION:  Excuse me. 


MR. FRYE:  -- was to maximize revenues. 


QUESTION:  It wasn't -- it -- more precisely it


wasn't the approval of a lease.  It was the approval of --


of the -- the raise of the figure that was contained in a


lease that had already been concluded.

 MR. FRYE:  That is incorrect, sir.


QUESTION:  That is incorrect? 


MR. FRYE:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Why? 


MR. FRYE:  Volume II of the joint appendix in


this Court includes both the original lease and these coal


lease amendments, and they're virtually totally different


documents.  There's new tax waivers.  There's a new


dedication of 90 million tons of coal.  There's a -- for


the north lease and for the other lease another


180 million tons of coal, all without a competitive bid.


So we not only didn't get the Federal minimum,


we certainly didn't get 20 percent.  We didn't get the


Federal minimum of 12-and-a-half percent, and we had to


pay a bonus to the companies of $89 million to get what we 

got.


QUESTION:  But you got a severance tax as part


of the package, and one of the things that the Government


suggested is if -- if you take the 12 percent and you add


the 8 percent, then you get up to the 20 percent, which


was your figure.


MR. FRYE:  Justice Ginsburg, we had the tax


before all of this happened.  And as -- as my brother


Kneedler mentioned to the Court, we can't tax 60 percent


of the coal because it goes to the Navajo generating

station which has a tax waiver in the plant site lease. 


So we're capped at the 12-and-a-half percent royalty level


for 60 percent of the coal.  And before we entered into


these lease amendments, we were not restricted in the


amount of taxes that the Navajo Nation could impose.


QUESTION:  And as I understand it now, it's --


what you're saying, it's just as if the trees in Mitchell


where the money from the tree was supposed to go to the


Indians, if the Government had cut it down and sold it for


a half a cent a tree. 


MR. FRYE:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  All right.  And all this other stuff


with the procedures is just evidentiary of what was going


wrong.  But what was going wrong is it's like selling the


trees at too low a price, if they were supposed to go to 

the -- the tribe, if the proceeds had been.  That's --


that's the -- basically the argument. 


MR. FRYE:  I think that's right.  The damage-


causing activity finally was the approval of these


damaging lease amendments. 


QUESTION:  Was the price above the minimum that


the Secretary's regulations provided for? 


MR. FRYE:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Well, it seems to me the problem then


was with the Secretary's regulation, not with what went on

here.  That regulation was invalid as arbitrary,


capricious --


MR. FRYE:  No.  The regulation only set a


minimum royalty, and as this Court --


QUESTION:  But that's -- but that's the point,


I mean, in order to leave full negotiating authority to


the tribe.  And what you're saying is that minimum is so


low that it -- it produces, you know, highway robbery.  It


seems to me that the problem is -- is with the regulation


and maybe you can get at it when the regulation is applied


this way.  I don't know. 


MR. FRYE:  The -- in Mitchell II, for example,


there was a claim -- the Mitchell II claims did not track,


by the way, specific statutory and regulatory provisions. 


There was a claim, for example, that was upheld for the 

failure of the Department of the Interior to -- to develop


a system of roads and easements conducive to timber


harvesting.  There was no statute that required that. 


There was no regulation that required that.  That was part


of the trust duty. 


And there was one other claim that was upheld in


Mitchell II, and a statute said, you -- if you're going to


deposit these monies into the Federal Treasury, the


Federal Government has to get at least 4 percent.  It was


a minimum 4 percent rate.  And the allottees and tribe in

the Mitchell case said, just by turning around you could


have gotten 8 percent, and the court below said, yes, you


can't be satisfied as trustee with the minimum rate.  You


have to at least strive for the ceiling.  And that was


upheld.  That claim was upheld here. 


So there were several claims in Mitchell II that


were not tracking any specific --


QUESTION:  There was not in Mitchell II a


statute that -- that sought to place the negotiating power


in the hands of the Indians rather than in the hands of


the Government.  I mean, that's what distinguishes this


case.  You have here a scheme that is meant to -- meant to


place the tribe in -- in charge of its own fate, and --


and it effectively tells the Secretary, we don't want you


to negotiate these leases. 
 That's quite a bit different. 

MR. FRYE:  Actually that's incorrect.  The


statutory scheme in Mitchell II, section 406(a), said that


the -- the Indians could -- or could sell their timber


with the consent of the Secretary.  It's the exact same


structure as we have here.  What we have here is the


Indians can lease their coal with the approval of the


Secretary of the Interior.  The approval has a real


history. 


QUESTION:  It's certainly not how -- how the


Court described it in Mitchell II because the Court spoke

about exclusive control, that the United States did all


the negotiating, that -- and it made all the arrangements. 


Now, whatever you -- you say, you have to deal with what


is in that opinion, and it does stress the exclusive


control of the United States and distinguishes the prior


case on the ground that the other case was designed to


give the Indians autonomy to deal for themselves.


MR. FRYE:  The -- the Secretary certainly had


exclusive control over whether to approve this


transaction, whether to allow the trust asset to be sold


or not.  He had exclusive control over that, and that is


within the contours of the statutes and regulations. 


And I --


QUESTION:  I thought that the -- the authority


came from the lease from the term that the -- that the 

tribe agreed to, that the -- the authority to adjust the


royalty in this case comes from the lease, not from any


statute or regulation.  Isn't that true?


MR. FRYE:  That's correct.  Of course, that


lease itself was approved by the Secretary of the Interior


as trustee of these --


QUESTION:  Wait.  I thought you said some of


these were new leases.  I mean, that's what confuses me.


When I was making that point earlier, you said no, some of


them were new leases.  Now, the authority to adjust the

rate for the new leases certainly didn't exist in the old


lease, did it? 


MR. FRYE:  That's not even at issue.  There


is -- there is no secretarial authority to adjust the rate


in the new lease. 


QUESTION:  Well, that -- that's right.  So some


of your complaint does not rest upon the provision in the


original lease that gives the Secretary the power to


adjust the rate. 


MR. FRYE:  Yes.  I -- I think in response to


Justice Breyer, the -- the event that caused the damages


here was the improvident approval, without observation


of --


QUESTION:  Of the new leases. 


MR. FRYE:  Of the new leases.  That is correct.


QUESTION:  So that -- and that -- that's --


there isn't a -- sort of like a statute that says,


Secretary, give an approval or not.  What there is is the


tribe negotiates something.  Then they have the


director -- the area director, say, okay, that's all right


because the tribe asked him to say.  And then somebody


approve -- appeals to the Department of the Interior under


a regulation of the Interior Department allowing any


aggrieved party to go appeal.  And then the Secretary


intervenes in that, and then they don't tell the tribe.

And because they don't tell the tribe, the tribe enters


into a different lease.  That's really what happened.


MR. FRYE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And it's hard to fit that into the


model of the Secretary charging a penny for a tree.  The


Secretary, in a sense, didn't charge anything for


anything. 


MR. FRYE:  The Secretary allowed this trust


asset to be conveyed for what he knew to be about half of


its value. 


Now, the approval requirement has a history,


going back to the first administration of George


Washington.  In the Trade and Intercourse Acts, Congress


first erected what this Court has called the strong shield


of Federal law, to prevent Indians from being despoiled in 

their property.  And Congress, when it legislates,


legislates against this rich history, this background in


the context of the approval requirement. 


In the Anicker case in 1987, in a leasing


context, the -- the Court said that the -- this strong


shield of Federal -- of Federal law was designed to


protect the Indians from the designs of those who would


take their property for less than fair compensation. 


That's the -- that's the meat of the approval --


QUESTION:  Okay.  So you're saying the approval

was wrong for two reasons, I guess.  Number one, the rate


approved was less than half fair value.


MR. FRYE:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  So that, in effect, every -- every


lease that was approved at the 12-and-a-half percent was


wrongly approved.


MR. FRYE:  No.  This is extraordinarily valuable


coal.  This is unusual coal. 


QUESTION:  I see.  Okay. I --


MR. FRYE:  This is 12,500 btu coal. 


QUESTION:  I stand corrected. 


So it was the -- the approval was wrong simply


because the -- the particular value of this coal meant


that it was being conveyed away for -- for half what it


was worth.


MR. FRYE:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  That's the substance.


And then you're also making the argument that it


was wrong -- and I think I used the word, the -- the


bargaining process was skewed, but you're -- you're making


that argument too? 


MR. FRYE:  Yes.  The Secretary should have known


that the end result was going to be unfair because he had


skewed the bargaining.


QUESTION:  Okay.  May -- may I ask you this

question as to whether he really did skew it?  As I


understand what the skewing might be, it would be simply


the refusal of the Secretary to allow the administrative


process to go forward, as a result of which the tribe


ended up negotiating when it might not otherwise have


negotiated.  It might have held out. 


My question is this.  Didn't someone -- and I


forget who it was now -- on behalf of the Secretary come


right out and say to the tribe, the Secretary or the


Department or the Bureau thinks it would be better if you


resolved this by negotiating?  And isn't it fair to say


that that is practically saying, look, we're not going to


decide this thing?  You go out and decide it by


negotiating.  And if that is true, didn't they, in effect,


tell them in substance what they were doing? 

MR. FRYE:  Well, the beneficiary of a trust


shouldn't have to guess what his trustee is really telling


him.  If that's what the trustee wanted to say, the


trustee should have said, I've met with Peabody.  I like


their lobbyist.  I'm not going to do something that


Peabody doesn't like, and -- and we're going to sit on


this thing, as his subordinate said, until hell freezes


over until you agree that -- with something that Peabody


likes and you can live with.  If we had been given that


information, we would have taken a much different

approach.  I guarantee you. 


Now, I think Justice O'Connor made the point


that if all we have -- if -- if the trust duty only


applies to specific statutory and regulatory violations,


then it's meaningless.  The trust duty has to be something


greater than that.  And this Court in the Varity


Corporation case about 6 years ago said precisely that. 


The trust duty has to be something greater than the sum of


these distinct parts. 


QUESTION:  So -- so the mere designation of a


trustee in these cases is a waiver of sovereign immunity?


MR. FRYE:  I would say not, Your Honor.  There


has to be this overlay of comprehensive Federal control


and supervision. 


And I would note too in the Indian Tucker Act, 

it doesn't restrict Indian plaintiffs to the same rights


and remedies.  It gives people -- Indian tribes and Indian


people the same access to the court, and it uses a


different word.  It uses the word laws in the -- in the


jurisdictional statute in the Indian Tucker Act.  And we


know from Illinois versus City of Milwaukee and other


cases that laws means Federal common law and the -- and if


there's anything that's grounded in the Federal common law


tradition, it's the trust duty owed to Indian tribes.  And


that's what we sue under, the Indian Tucker Act.

 One month ago yesterday, President George Bush


once again issued a presidential proclamation, following


those of President Reagan and President Clinton, honoring


the Navajos and recognizing their special service to the


United States in times of war.  And as this Court


indicated in the Shoshone case, the Navajo tribe was


entitled to a fidelity at least as constant.


We respectfully urge affirmance.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Frye. 


Mr. Kneedler, you have 4 minutes left. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. KNEEDLER:  Thank you, Justice Stevens.


First, with several factual points.  The tribe


did know the substance of -- of what had happened with 

respect to Secretary Hodel.  As I pointed out earlier,


Mr. Nelson's deposition, which is excerpted in the joint


appendix, makes clear that the tribe had learned, he said,


from Washington that -- that it was requested there that


they go back to negotiations. 


And also I would call the Court's attention to


page 2370 of the appendix, which are notes of the


negotiating session -- first negotiating session that


occurred after that on August 30th, 1985.  It's a note in


which Chairman Zah of the Nation acknowledges that

Secretary Hodel apparently wanted them to go back and try


to reach an agreement.  So it's clear that the parties


entered into these negotiations with a full understanding


of -- of what the Secretary's preferred course was.


Secondly, I think it's -- it's completely not


true that Secretary Hodel directed a subordinate to lie to


the Navajo Nation.  The -- on page 117 of the joint


appendix, there's a copy of the directive that -- or


the -- the memorandum that Secretary Hodel sent to the


Assistant Secretary about this.  And he makes four very


significant points entirely reasonable under the


circumstances. 


He -- he referred to the fact that affirming the


decision outright unilaterally might lead to prolonged


litigation, during which the -- Peabody might well put 

the -- the royalties into escrow and the tribe wouldn't


get them. 


It would impair the future ongoing contractual


relationship between the parties.  Peabody has a huge


presence on the reservation, and it was obviously


beneficial for the parties to resolve this peaceably and


not just this isolated royalty increase under this one


lease, but a whole host of issues that were -- that were


facing the two parties:  taxation, payment for water,


other -- other leases in which there was a significant

increase. 


And those other leases, by the way, did not have


an adjustment clause.  So the tribe here got the benefit


not only of an increase on this lease, but an increase on


a lease that did not have an adjustment clause. 


And Secretary Hodel then said it would be


preferable to allow the parties to negotiate, and then


importantly at the end, he said, I haven't reached a final


decision on the merits of the appeal.  I just think it


would be better if the parties went back and negotiated.


And since, as Justice Scalia pointed out, this was a lease


provision that was -- protected both parties, what is


reasonable for both parties, it was certainly an


appropriate resolution of that for the Secretary to say --


in the normal situation where you have a -- a 

disagreement, or differing views under a lease, to send


the parties back and seek to have them negotiate.


Also, I would point out on page 125 of the joint


appendix, there's a letter from Mr. Vollmann in which he


points out that the Secretary is aware of each party's


concerns about the settlement, again making it clear


that -- that the Department in Washington was aware of the


state of affairs out there. 


So the only -- the only -- aside from all of


that, the claims about the negotiations that preceded the


55 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1987 lease amendments are essentially procedural or tort


claims, or claims about improper regulation of -- of a


negotiating process.  They aren't the sort of money-


mandating statutory or -- first of all, there's no


claim -- no -- no identification of a statutory or


regulatory provision that -- that specifically regulates


this and was violated.  But in any event, just like the


Due Process Clause that this Court held in Testan is not


money-mandating, the same is true here as well.


JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
