ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN


            8            

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 00-843


            9              

MR. FELDMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


           10    

please the Court:


           11              

Under the Pole Attachments Act, the FCC is


           12    

required to regulate pole attachments to ensure the rates,


           13    

terms, and conditions for those attachments be just and


           14    

reasonable. 


           15              

The question presented in this case is whether


           16    

two particular types of attachments are covered by the


           17    

act. 


           18              

The first is an attachment to provide cable


           19    

television service and commingled Internet access.  That


           20    

means that over that particular wire at the particular


           21    

time is traveling both cable television service and


           22    

Internet access at different frequencies. 


           23              

The second type of attachment at issue is an


           24    

attachment used to provide wireless telecommunications


           25    

services.

            1              

The FCC determined and the most natural reading


            2    

of the act requires that both types of attachments are


            3    

covered.  The operative provision, the basic coverage


            4    

provision, defines a pole attachment as any attachment by


            5    

a cable television system or provider of


            6    

telecommunications service.


            7              

QUESTION:  Where do we find the text of the act?


            8              

MR. FELDMAN:  In the appendix to our petition


            9    

for certiorari, right at the end.  The language that I'm


           10    

talking about now is on page 205a.


           11              

QUESTION:  Is it in your brief? 


           12              

MR. FELDMAN:  I'm sure it's in our brief also,


           13    

but it's not -- it's not separately set forth in an


           14    

appendix there. 


           15              

QUESTION:  Go ahead. 


           16              

MR. FELDMAN:  But the -- and the section I'm


           17    

referring to now is section 224(a)(4).  It says, the term


           18    

pole attachment means any attachment by a cable television


           19    

system or provider of telecommunications service to a


           20    

pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled


           21    

by a utility. 


           22              

QUESTION:  And don't you think it's implicit in


           23    

that definition that it mean not just an attachment by,


           24    

but also an attachment for the purpose of the business of?


           25              

MR. FELDMAN:  I think it's -- what is --

QUESTION:  They couldn't put up a billboard, you


            2    

know -- you know. 


            3              

MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  I think that the use of


            4    

the term, in particular, cable television system, it has


            5    

to be part of the cable television system, which could be


            6    

reasonably construed to mean the -- the network of -- of


            7    

devices that are used to provide cable television system


            8    

service to people.  I think that's correct, and I think


            9    

probably the same thing is true with the


           10    

telecommunications --


           11              

QUESTION:  Telecommunications.


           12              

MR. FELDMAN:  -- provider of telecommunications


           13    

services. 


           14              

But I -- what I would contrast -- what's at


           15    

issue here is these attachments are used to provide


           16    

commingled cable television and Internet access. 


           17              

QUESTION:  Now, is -- is Internet access part of


           18    

a cable television system? 


           19              

MR. FELDMAN:  The FCC hasn't reached a


           20    

conclusion on that yet because what the FCC concluded --


           21    

and I think what the most natural reading of the statute


           22    

leads to the conclusion as well -- that if an attachment


           23    

is an attachment that's used to provide cable television


           24    

system service, the fact -- or it's used by a cable


           25    

television system, the fact that it's also used for

            1    

something else doesn't exclude that attachment from the


            2    

act. 


            3              

QUESTION:  Oh, that's fair enough. 


            4              

But what if -- what if it not only is added to


            5    

the cable television system, but it also in itself


            6    

consists of telecommunications?


            7              

MR. FELDMAN:  If it still is -- well, it would


            8    

still be.  Then it would be covered under -- under either


            9    

provision of the act. 


           10              

QUESTION:  Well, it would be covered under (e),


           11    

under -- under the telecommunications rate.  Right? 


           12              

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, I wouldn't quite say that. 


           13    

The rate would have to be determined under (e), and I


           14    

would agree with you on that.  But the act -- it concerns


           15    

rates, terms, and conditions and also mandatory access. 


           16    

And in terms of the basic coverage of the act, what


           17    

particular rate --


           18              

QUESTION:  Okay.  But we're talking about the


           19    

rates here.  I mean, that's -- that's the fighting issue.


           20              

And -- and why -- how could the -- the thing I


           21    

really do not understand about this case is how the


           22    

commission could possibly resolve it without ever


           23    

purporting to decide whether Internet is


           24    

telecommunications.  It has -- it has purported to reserve


           25    

that question, hasn't it?

MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I wouldn't quite put it that


            2    

way.  I think what the commission did, if you look at


            3    

paragraph 33 and 34 of its order in this case, is what


            4    

they said is --


            5              

QUESTION:  Where do we find that? 


            6              

MR. FELDMAN:  That is on page 80 -- the best


            7    

place to start with is 87a at paragraph 33.  That's of our


            8    

appendix.


            9              

What they say is, several commentators suggested


           10    

that cable operators providing Internet service should be


           11    

required to pay the section 224(e) telecommunications


           12    

rate.  We disagree. 


           13              

And then they cite a prior order, the Universal


           14    

Service Order, where the -- in which the FCC concluded


           15    

that based on the statutory definition of


           16    

telecommunications, cable service is not


           17    

telecommunications.  And they concluded that based on the


           18    

proposition that -- that -- under the statutory


           19    

definition, telecommunications requires no change in the


           20    

material transmitted back and forth. 


           21              

QUESTION:  Okay.  But you think that -- that


           22    

issue is up in this case, then, whether -- whether --


           23              

MR. FELDMAN:  No. 


           24              

QUESTION:  -- indeed, Internet service is


           25    

telecommunications?

            1              

MR. FELDMAN:  No, I don't think so for this


            2    

reason.


            3              

QUESTION:  Well, you're saying that the -- that


            4    

the decision here rests upon that. 


            5              

MR. FELDMAN:  No.  Excuse me.  I don't -- I


            6    

wouldn't say that's up in this case for this reason.  The


            7    

-- these -- what the court of appeals held is that these


            8    

wires are not covered by the act at all.  They're simply


            9    

not covered, not under the (d) rate, not under the (e)


           10    

rate.  A utility can charge a -- an attach -- or a cable


           11    

television system whatever rate it wants, $50, $100, or


           12    

$1,000.  It doesn't matter.  The FCC has no jurisdiction.


           13              

QUESTION:  Well, but the issue is here not


           14    

whether the court of appeals was right; it's whether the


           15    

commission was wrong. 


           16              

MR. FELDMAN:  Right, but the rate issue was --


           17    

the -- the court of appeals did not -- did not address --


           18    

and I don't even think was presented to the court of


           19    

appeals -- what the proper rate is to apply. 


           20              

The question is whether the FCC has jurisdiction


           21    

over these attachments at all, and these are attachments


           22    

by a cable television system or provider of


           23    

telecommunications service.  And if you look at the -- the


           24    

-- that coverage provision in (a)(4) that I was referring


           25    

to before, if it turns out that Internet access is

            2    

way, then the act would then -- the attachment would be -


            3    

- would be protected under both halves of that.  It would


            4    

both be an attachment by a cable television system; it

would also be an attachment by a provider of


            6    

telecommunications service.

theoretically it could be neither.


            9              

MR. FELDMAN:  It theoretically could be neither.


           10              

QUESTION:  All right.  And don't you think, as a


           11    

result of that, we don't know?  We cannot tell.  We cannot


           12    

infer from -- from what the agency did what its view was


           13    

on this, which is -- at least is consistent with the fact


           14    

that it's got another proceeding going on to -- to get


           15    

into the definitional matter.


           16              

MR. FELDMAN:  I don't think that that's correct.


           17              

QUESTION:  Doesn't it make sense for us to say


           18    

to the agency, you've got to explain to us what you at


           19    

least believe your jurisdictional basis is for this


           20    

because, depending on whether your jurisdictional basis is


           21    

the general provision or (d) or (e) may affect that --


           22    

that may -- the result in this case could be dependent on


           23    

that.  And we should know. 


           24              

MR. FELDMAN:  I think the agency was very clear


           25    

that its basis for jurisdiction is (a)(4), which is the

basic coverage provision of the act, and --


            2              

QUESTION:  All right.  Then that -- then that


            3    

forces -- in other words, you're saying the agency made it


            4    

clear that it was neither (d) nor (e).


            5              

MR. FELDMAN:  No.


            6              

QUESTION:  All right, and I agree.


            7              

MR. FELDMAN:  No.  That's not quite right. 


            8              

QUESTION:  You can infer -- you're right.  You


            9    

can infer that --


           10              

MR. FELDMAN:  I don't know -- I'll tell you what


           11    

the agency said.  What they said was it's not (e) based on


           12    

this past precedent, which Congress has now asked us to


           13    

look into and we're now looking into it once again.  We


           14    

may change our mind, but as of now, it's not (e).


           15              

QUESTION:  But it could be (d).


           16              

MR. FELDMAN:  And they said it could be (d)


           17    

because we're not -- we don't have to decide whether it is


           18    

a -- whether the Internet access part of it is a provision


           19    

-- is a cable service because if it's a cable service,


           20    

it's covered under the terms of (d).  If it's not a cable


           21    

service, we're going to apply the just and reasonable rate


           22    

as being the same thing --


           23              

QUESTION:  Okay, but if it's -- if it's under


           24    

(d), we review it strictly within (d) terms.  But if we


           25    

don't know whether they're acting under (d) or whether

            1    

they're acting under the general just and reasonable


            2    

power, then we've got to decide another issue.  We've got


            3    

to decide whether, in fact, there's anything left under


            4    

the general power, and if we decide that and say the


            5    

answer is no, only then do we get to the question whether


            6    

this -- whether this is a proper jurisdictional exercise


            7    

under (d). 


            8              

And we should not have to go, it seems to me,


            9    

through that sort of byzantine reverse decisional tree


           10    

when the agency itself could tell us up front what it was


           11    

acting under.  And, therefore, I'm suggesting that maybe


           12    

on this part of the case, the wise thing to do would be to


           13    

vacate, send the thing back, and say, tell us -- you know,


           14    

come to grips with us and tell us what you believe you're


           15    

operating under and we'll review that.


           16              

MR. FELDMAN:  But I -- I think the agency was


           17    

quite clear, and they pinned their decision --


           18              

QUESTION:  They were quite clear that it wasn't


           19    

(e), but they're not quite clear on anything else. 


           20              

MR. FELDMAN:  Right, but the question of then


           21    

whether it's (d) or not is -- just has to do with the


           22    

question of what the right rate is.  What the agency was


           23    

100 percent clear on was this is an attachment by a cable


           24    

television system, and therefore, the FCC has authority to


           25    

provide for just and reasonable rates.  I would add --

            1              

QUESTION:  Mr. Feldman, are you saying that it's


            2    

an academic question what the precise rate is when we're


            3    

dealing with a court of appeals decision that says that's


            4    

irrelevant because there is no authority at all in the


            5    

FCC? 


            6              

MR. FELDMAN:  And I'd like to address that.  I


            7    

think that the point is that is not a -- even almost not a


            8    

-- probably not a possible reading of the statute, and


            9    

certainly not the one that the FCC -- once the FCC adopted


           10    

a contrary one --


           11              

QUESTION:  So, you're asking us to say that the


           12    

FCC does have authority.  Which particular rate category


           13    

it falls under is for another day.


           14              

MR. FELDMAN:  That's right.


           15              

QUESTION:  But the basic question is does it


           16    

have any authority to come up with a just and reasonable


           17    

rate at all.


           18              

MR. FELDMAN:  That's correct.  And I would --


           19              

QUESTION:  But it's also the case that we are


           20    

being forced to decide an issue which, if the agency were


           21    

clear and came out and said it's (d), we wouldn't have to


           22    

decide.


           23              

MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I don't think that that's


           24    

right because whether the agency says it's (d) or not, the


           25    

fact is that (a)(4) covers this.  And let me -- let me

            1    

give this as an illustration. 


            2              

QUESTION:  Well, yes, but that's the -- that's


            3    

one of the issues.


            4              

MR. FELDMAN:  I realize that, but that -- that


            5    

issue, it seems to me, is not a difficult one.  If you


            6    

look at (d), for example, (d) -- Congress knew quite well,


            7    

when it was dealing with rates, not when it was dealing


            8    

with terms, conditions, or mandatory access, which are


            9    

also at issue in the statute -- when it was dealing with


           10    

rates, it was quite clear this subsection -- that's (d)(3)


           11    

-- shall apply to the rate for any pole attachment used by


           12    

a cable television system solely to provide a cable


           13    

service. 


           14              

Now, if Congress wanted to limit the -- the


           15    

coverage -- the general coverage of the act, it could have


           16    

used exactly that same language, and in (a)(4), it could


           17    

have said, the term pole attachment means any attachment


           18    

by a cable television system used solely to provide cable


           19    

service.  But Congress actually made a distinct choice. 


           20    

For purposes of the rate, it did want that to govern, and


           21    

it had a reason for doing that, which I can go into.


           22              

QUESTION:  I can give you -- I can give you


           23    

another -- another plausible explanation.  Indeed, I think


           24    

it's -- it's to my mind the most plausible explanation.  I


           25    

think Congress divides the world -- the world -- of what


14

            1    

can go on poles into cable and telecommunications.  There


            2    

are these two categories.  That's the only reason people


            3    

are going to string wires:  cable or telecommunications.


            4              

Then when it got to prescribing the rates, what


            5    

are you going to do with something that overlaps between


            6    

the two?  You can provide one rate for cable, another rate


            7    

for telecommunications.  What about one that is both?  You


            8    

solve that question by, in the first rate section, saying


            9    

if it's cable only, it has this rate, and if it's


           10    

telecommunications, which is everything else, including


           11    

the mingling of telecommunications with cable, it's


           12    

another rate.  That would be a perfectly plausible


           13    

explanation of why Congress put cable only in the later


           14    

section and in the earlier section just talked about cable


           15    

because it thought anything else that cable does will be


           16    

telecommunications.


           17              

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, if Congress thought that --


           18    

again, the result of -- of if that were true could be that


           19    

the (e) rate might apply to this thing, but it would still


           20    

be that the (e) rate applied.  It would not be that this


           21    

-- that these attachments are not protected at all. 


           22              

And I would add that in 1996, when Congress


           23    

passed this statute, the FCC had already determined in


           24    

several cases that a cable attachment that's also used to


           25    

provide data transmission services was still an attachment

            1    

by a cable television system and still entitled to the


            2    

protection of the Pole Attachment Act.  That -- that


            3    

decision was affirmed by the D.C. Circuit in the Texas


            4    

Utilities case in 1993, and the FCC had applied it in


            5    

several cases after that. 


            6              

So, by the time Congress -- and Congress did not


            7    

change any of the relevant language that was important for


            8    

that decision.  It still left it the pole attachment means


            9    

any attachment by a cable television system. 


           10              

I mean, I would add if the -- whatever the FCC


           11    

is to -- is going to determine about what the Internet


           12    

access is, whatever they would determine about that, the


           13    

attachment would still be an attachment by a cable


           14    

television system.  I don't see how you can construe it to


           15    

mean it's not any longer an attachment by a cable


           16    

television system.  It may be something else as well.


           17              

QUESTION:  But let's assume that the FCC


           18    

determines that this is not telecommunications --


           19              

MR. FELDMAN:  And I think they have


           20    

determined --


           21              

QUESTION:  -- and it's not -- and it's not


           22    

cable, and you have a hybrid cable.  Would the commission


           23    

be within its authority to charge the cable company more


           24    

for the hybrid cable than it does for the regular cable?


           25              

MR. FELDMAN:  If it turned out that this

            1    

additional -- the addition of Internet access meant that


            2    

it was neither cable nor telecommunications service --


            3    

that that additional service was neither -- neither of


            4    

those, then the FCC would have to figure out what the just


            5    

and reasonable rate would be for that.  And they would


            6    

have a range of choices, and they'd have to justify


            7    

what --


            8              

QUESTION:  So, it could charge more for a hybrid


            9    

than for a pure cable.


           10              

MR. FELDMAN:  It's possible the FCC could do


           11    

that.  And I'll tell you why the FCC didn't and why the


           12    

statute --


           13              

QUESTION:  But I'm -- I'm wondering why that can


           14    

be because it has no jurisdiction over pure Internet.


           15              

MR. FELDMAN:  No.  But this is the point, and I


           16    

think -- I think this is crucial and this is the mistake


           17    

the court of appeals made.  The court of appeals started


           18    

by saying the question in this case is whether the FCC has


           19    

jurisdiction over Internet access.  The FCC doesn't


           20    

purport to have jurisdiction over Internet access.  And if


           21    

you were dealing with a wire that only provided Internet


           22    

access, that would be a completely different question. 


           23              

QUESTION:  I agree, but then my question is why


           24    

can it possibly charge more for the hybrid cable.


           25              

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, you know, I don't want to

            1    

justify that decision because what the FCC decided is that


            2    

that wouldn't be what it would want to do.  If -- it


            3    

decided that if it's a hybrid like that --


            4              

QUESTION:  Well, but --


            5              

QUESTION:  It's even worse.  They're -- they're


            6    

saying even though the section says you charge this rate


            7    

when it's cable only, we're going to say you can charge


            8    

this rate when it's cable plus Internet.  You think that's


            9    

better. 


           10              

MR. FELDMAN:  Yes, because I think that what


           11    

Congress wanted to specify when it said when it's cable


           12    

only is it wanted to ensure that -- and this is actually


           13    

fairly clear -- is when the cable companies went into --


           14    

into the business of providing telephone service to


           15    

people, that they would be charged the same rate as the


           16    

telecommunications providers who were newly added to the


           17    

act. 


           18              

But that was not their intent.  With -- with


           19    

respect to Internet access, they didn't have a specific


           20    

intent like that.  They had an intent that Internet access

What you do know is that if, at one and the same

            1    

attachment by a cable television system.  And the fact


            2    

that the cable television system is providing something


            3    

else through that wire doesn't preclude the application of


            4    

-- of -- doesn't preclude the FCC's jurisdiction.


            5              

QUESTION:  If you ignore the doctrine inclusio


            6    

unius, exclusio alterius, and you say these are the rates


            7    

when it's cable only.


            8              

MR. FELDMAN:  But that's --


            9              

QUESTION:  And the FCC has come and said, these


           10    

are also the rates when it's cable plus.


           11              

MR. FELDMAN:  But that's again -- that could


           12    

lead --


           13              

QUESTION:  It seems to me a little strange. 


           14              

MR. FELDMAN:  If that were true, that could lead


           15    

to the conclusion that the FCC's choice of rate here was


           16    

wrong and maybe it should have chosen the (e) rate or some


           17    

other rate.  But that couldn't lead to the conclusion that


           18    

an attachment by a cable television system is outside the


           19    

act.  And in fact, if it were outside the act, it's --


           20    

it's not -- it's very difficult to understand why Congress


           21    

didn't take that solely by a cable -- solely to provide


           22    

cable television services and put it right here in (a)(4)


           23    

in the basic coverage provision. 


           24              

QUESTION:  Mr. Feldman, do I understand your


           25    

argument that if we should reverse the Eleventh Circuit

            1    

and say there is FCC jurisdiction, then it would go --


            2    

then it would have to await your ongoing rule making to


            3    

determine which category this is, or would there be


            4    

something for the Eleventh Amendment to do on remand once


            5    

we say you have jurisdiction to do something? 


            6              

MR. FELDMAN:  I think that -- that if the issue


            7    

was preserved before the Eleventh Circuit, they would have


            8    

jurisdiction to determine what the right rate is, and look


            9    

at what the FCC's reasoning was and whether -- you know,


           10    

the various conclusions the FCC reached in coming to the


           11    

(d) rate. 


           12              

I'd like to reserve -- well, maybe I should


           13    

address the other issue just for a minute.  The other


           14    

issue seems -- is -- really rests on the same basic


           15    

premise, which is an attachment by a wireless


           16    

telecommunications provider is an attachment by a


           17    

telecommunications provider.  The statute defines the


           18    

provision of telecommunications service as the offering of


           19    

telecommunications to the public regardless of the


           20    

facilities used, and it therefore precludes making a


           21    

distinction between wireless and wireline


           22    

telecommunications providers. 


           23              

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.


           24              

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Feldman. 


           25              

Mr. Keisler, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER


            2             

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 00-832


            3              

MR. KEISLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


            4    

please the Court:


            5              

The central feature of the provisions of this


            6    

act that define its scope, sections 224(a)(4) and (b)(1),


            7    

is that the threshold question of whether an attachment is


            8    

covered by the act turns on the nature of the facility not


            9    

on what service is provided over that facility.  Section


           10    

(a)(4) defines pole attachment as any attachment by a


           11    

cable television system.  And, Justice Scalia, cable


           12    

system is a defined term in the act.  Section 522,


           13    

subsection 7 defines a cable system as the physical


           14    

equipment that constitutes the cable network.  It's on --


           15              

QUESTION:  You say the attachment of a cable


           16    

system.  It says an attachment by a cable system.  You


           17    

make a big deal of that in -- in the brief, and I don't


           18    

see that it makes any difference whether it says cable


           19    

company or cable system.  It is still an attachment by a


           20    

cable either company or system.  It doesn't say the


           21    

attachment of a cable system. 


           22              

MR. KEISLER:  Well, it's an attachment by a


           23    

cable television system to the pole, and the system itself


           24    

is defined as a set of closed transmission paths and


           25    

associated signal and generation/reception control

            1    

equipment that is designed to provide cable services which


            2    

include video programming.  These wires which are attached


            3    

to the poles are one of those closed transmission paths


            4    

that constitute the cable system under that definition. 


            5              

Now, it's -- it's not the case I think, Justice


            6    

Scalia, that Congress could have divided the world solely


            7    

into cable services and telecommunications services


            8    

because there are lots of services that don't fit either


            9    

definition.  Telecommunications service is the offering of


           10    

telecommunications, which is defined in section 153 of the


           11    

act as the transmission of information of the user's


           12    

choosing without change in the form or content. 


           13              

Internet access, the commission has found,


           14    

changes the form of the information.  An Internet service


           15    

provider engages in something called protocol conversion


           16    

so that the message that goes out from your computer can


           17    

actually talk to the service and computers that comprise


           18    

the worldwide web.  So, it is not a telecommunications


           19    

service.  The commission correctly found that. 


           20              

And applying telecommunications service


           21    

regulation to everything that's not a cable service would


           22    

mean applying a whole host of legacy telecommunications


           23    

statutes and rules to a whole sector of the economy that


           24    

has always been unregulated, information service


           25    

providers.

            1              

And, Justice Souter, I don't think a remand to


            2    

the FCC would be appropriate.  Essentially -- unless you


            3    

conclude that they're wrong on the theory of the case on


            4    

which they resolved it. 


            5              

But you suggested, Your Honor, that the


            6    

commission could have reached the same result through an


            7    

alternative path.  It could have said, well, this is a


            8    

cable service, therefore the (e) rate applies. 


            9              

But I think the question for this appeal is was


           10    

it arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law for the


           11    

commission to resolve the case the way it did.  If the


           12    

commission's legal interpretation of section (a)(4) is


           13    

correct, that it applies to any attachment by a cable


           14    

television system, and a cable system includes wires that


           15    

commingle Internet access and video programming, then it's


           16    

not arbitrary or capricious or contrary to law for the


           17    

commission to resolve the case the way it did.  And I


           18    

think beyond that, it was perfectly reasonable. 


           19              

The question of whether this is a cable service


           20    

is a very big question with immense regulatory


           21    

consequences that determines again whether a whole host of


           22    

regulations that go well beyond the Pole Attachment Act


           23    

will be applied to this service.  The commission said we


           24    

don't need to decide that here since we would choose to


           25    

apply the (d) rate anyway.  We'll postpone that to a later

proceeding where we can gather a record.  That proceeding


            2    

is going on now, and that's going to be resolved in that


            3    

proceeding. 


            4              

QUESTION:  But -- but that means that they can


            5    

get away with it only if they are correct that -- in


            6    

choosing to apply the (d) rate. 


            7              

MR. KEISLER:  It means --


            8              

QUESTION:  If that selection of the (d) rate is


            9    

wrong, then their assumption that they don't have to get


           10    

into that question is also wrong.


           11              

MR. KEISLER:  It could only be wrong in two


           12    

circumstances.  It could be wrong if this were a


           13    

telecommunications service, and no one has sought cert on


           14    

the ground that the commission erred in finding this


           15    

wasn't a telecommunications service.  Or it could be wrong


           16    

because it was arbitrary and capricious for them to


           17    

exercise their authority under subsection (b) to choose


           18    

this particular rate rather than another rate.  But again,


           19    

nobody has sought review on that question before the court


           20    

of appeals or before this Court. 


           21              

The sole claim that respondents made in their


           22    

petition for review is that we are out of the statute


           23    

entirely, completely unregulated, that we get kicked off


           24    

the system the instant we provide any service other than


           25    

cable only or telecommunications.  And that's just not a

            1    

plausible reading of the statute.  They have not been able


            2    

to posit a single plausible purpose for that result.  In


            3    

fact, their brief actually refers to it as an


            4    

unanticipated consequence of the way the statute is


            5    

written.


            6              

But we know the Congress wanted to promote


            7    

Internet access.  It said so in the statute itself,


            8    

section 230.  We know that Congress believed that cable


            9    

television systems needed continued rights to access


           10    

poles.  It said so in 224.  The only way to serve both


           11    

objectives is to cover commingled attachments. 


           12              

QUESTION:  You say they haven't sought cert on


           13    

it, but -- but they're -- they're the respondents here.  I


           14    

mean, they --


           15              

MR. KEISLER:  Oh, I'm sorry.  They didn't


           16    

petition for review before the Eleventh Circuit.  There's


           17    

no claim ever in this case that the utilities have made


           18    

that the commission chose the wrong rate. 


           19              

QUESTION:  Well, but it seems to me they're --


           20    

they're entitled to defend the -- the outcome below on any


           21    

-- on any ground.


           22              

MR. KEISLER:  But they haven't defended on that


           23    

ground, Justice Scalia.  They've said, we're out of the


           24    

statute entirely.  They haven't said, choose a different


           25    

rate.  They said the commission has no authority to set

any rate at all. 


            2              

And that can't have been Congress' purpose. 


            3    

Congress has always understood that the cable wire into


            4    

the home is potentially capable of carrying many, many


            5    

services other than simply television programs.  That's


            6    

why they were so careful to define cable system as a


            7    

facility designed to provide cable services which include


            8    

video programming, not which are exclusively video


            9    

programming, but which include video programming.  There


           10    

was testimony before Congress, findings of the FCC that


           11    

the cable wire had potential of becoming a broadband


           12    

communications gateway.  And the packing of multiple


           13    

services into this wire was considered a good thing, good


           14    

for consumers and good for competition. 


           15              

QUESTION:  Can we talk for a minute about the


           16    

attachment of wireless --


           17              

MR. KEISLER:  No.  The National Cable & --


           18              

QUESTION:  You don't care about it.


           19              

MR. KEISLER:  We don't have a position. 


           20              

QUESTION:  You don't care about it. 


           21              

(Laughter.) 


           22              

MR. KEISLER:  But the packing of multiple


           23    

services into this wire -- that was considered a good


           24    

thing.  And every one of those services is equally


           25    

dependent on access to poles.  That's why the coverage in

            1    

the statute turns on the nature of the facility and not


            2    

what service is provided over that facility because


            3    

whatever the service is, if it's provided over a wired


            4    

facility, the poles are going to be an essential


            5    

communications pathway to reach the home.  And Congress


            6    

could not have wanted us to be kicked off the system


            7    

simply because we ventured beyond the two specific


            8    

services that they enumerated in subsections (d) or (e). 


            9    

That doesn't make sense. 


           10              

And, in addition, I think it has --


           11              

QUESTION:  As far as Internet is concerned, you


           12    

wouldn't be kicked off.  If -- if Internet were


           13    

telecommunications, you wouldn't be kicked off.


           14              

MR. KEISLER:  No.  That's right.  But if


           15    

Internet were neither telecommunications nor a cable


           16    

service or if we came up with another service in the


           17    

future that was neither telecommunications nor a cable


           18    

service, then we'd be kicked off.  And Internet access is


           19    

not a telecommunications service because the form of the


           20    

signal is changed by the Internet service provider.  So,


           21    

the consequence of this really would be that we would be


           22    

kicked off.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS P. STEINDLER


            2                   

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


            3              

MR. STEINDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


            4    

please the Court:


            5              

I'd like to, with the Court's permission, just


            6    

say a few words about the wireless issue first so it


            7    

doesn't get lost here.  It's a very important issue to the


            8    

industry. 


            9              

I'd like to turn again straight to -- to the


           10    

text of the statute, which is reprinted at the back of the


           11    

appendix to the petition, turn first to section 224(b)(1),


           12    

which provides that the commission --


           13              

QUESTION:  On page what? 


           14              

MR. STEINDLER:  I'm sorry.  It's at page 206a of


           15    

the appendix to the petition. 


           16              

QUESTION:  What is --


           17              

MR. STEINDLER:  It's 47 U.S.C., section


           18    

224(b)(1). 


           19              

QUESTION:  Thank you. 


           20              

QUESTION:  And the page reference again?  Excuse


           21    

me.


           22              

MR. STEINDLER:  It's 206a of the appendix to the


           23    

petition. 


           24              

(B)(1) says, in pertinent part, that the


           25    

commission shall regulate the rates, terms, and conditions

for pole attachments.  That's the general grant of


            2    

authority. 


            3              

Pole attachments is then defined on the previous


            4    

page in section 224(a)(4) as any attachment by a cable


            5    

television system or, in this case the pertinent -- of


            6    

pertinence, a provider of telecommunications service,


            7    

which is elsewhere defined to include wireless companies.


            8              

Now, the Government asks you to stop reading the


            9    

statute right here and say that any attachment means


           10    

literally any attachment and that that would include


           11    

wireless equipment.


           12              

QUESTION:  It's even funnier than that.  They


           13    

acknowledge that it doesn't include billboards.  It


           14    

doesn't include billboards. 


           15              

MR. STEINDLER:  Indeed.


           16              

QUESTION:  But it includes nailing up a wireless


           17    

thing. 


           18              

MR. STEINDLER:  Well, the Government, on this


           19    

issue and also on the Internet issue, they've -- they've


           20    

ignored some of the basic rules of reading a statute, and


           21    

what they've ignored here is the basic rule that you have


           22    

to read the whole statute and the meaning that any of the


           23    

phrases, like any attachment here, is informed by context. 


           24    

If you keep reading this statute, it tells you what any


           25    

attachment means, and it tells you that, if you turn to

section 224(d) and (e), which are the rate sections --


            2              

QUESTION:  But before you turn to the next


            3    

section, staying with (a)(4) for a minute --


            4              

MR. STEINDLER:  Sure. 


            5              

QUESTION:  -- it's any attachment to a pole,


            6    

duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by a


            7    

utility. 


            8              

MR. STEINDLER:  Correct. 


            9              

QUESTION:  Does that language apply to what


           10    

we're talking about? 


           11              

MR. STEINDLER:  Of course. 


           12              

QUESTION:  Oh, okay.


           13              

MR. STEINDLER:  Of course.  The utility --


           14    

there's a jurisdictional predicate here in (a)(1), which


           15    

is a utility -- this is a -- I'm here representing the


           16    

utility companies, and they own and control poles, ducts,


           17    

conduits, or rights-of-way.


           18              

QUESTION:  So that literally the definition does


           19    

apply regardless of the purpose of the attachment.


           20              

MR. STEINDLER:  If -- if you stop reading -- if


           21    

you stop reading the statute there, you could come to that


           22    

conclusion, but you need to read the whole statute, and if


           23    

you do, sir, with respect, in (d) and (e) are the two rate


           24    

formulas.  (D) is the rate formula for cable only, and it


           25

QUESTION:  May I just -- may I just cut you


            2    

short because I want to get one thought out of my mind.


            3              

MR. STEINDLER:  Sure. 


            4              

QUESTION:  Do you read it as saying provided


            5    

that the attachment is used either for a (d) or an (e)


            6    

purpose? 


            7              

MR. STEINDLER:  Correct. 


            8              

QUESTION:  So, those are exclusive uses.


            9              

MR. STEINDLER:  Correct. 


           10              

QUESTION:  Okay.

to there in a second, but it's under the --


           13              

QUESTION:  And -- and no other uses.


           14              

MR. STEINDLER:  And no other.  Correct.  Under


           15    

the exclusio unius principle, (d) and (e) are the only


           16    

purposes that are authorized here, and others are intended


           17    

to be excluded.  You have to ignore that fundamental canon


           18    

of reading a statute --


           19              

QUESTION:  I just wonder why. 


           20              

MR. STEINDLER:  Say that again? 


           21              

QUESTION:  I just wonder why.  I mean, as far as


           22    

I read (d) and (e), they address a typical, but not most


           23    

important, regulatory problem.  How do you divide fixed


           24    

costs among several different uses?  It's the same problem


           25    

with oil wells that produce natural gas.  It's the same

            1    

problem with chickens under price control.  And (d) and


            2    

(e) provide two ways.  Nothing there purports to be the


            3    

exclusive way.  Indeed, I think an economist would say


            4    

that neither (d) nor (e) is the economically correct way. 


            5    

They're approximations. 


            6              

So, why don't we have simply here two ways among


            7    

-- I could give you 50, frankly.  So, could you.  So, what


            8    

is it that says if you happen to have this, you use this


            9    

way; if you happen to have that, you use that way?  If you


           10    

happen to have something we're not too interested in


           11    

because it's not that common, but if you should have it,


           12    

you can try yet a third, a fourth, or a fifth way.  That


           13    

would make this statute consistent with every other


           14    

regulatory statute I know, and moreover, it would make


           15    

sense. 


           16              

MR. STEINDLER:  I think there are several


           17    

answers to that question.  The first is that, indeed, you


           18    

know, you have the expressio unius doctrine, and in this


           19    

case, you've got Congress -- and now we're off to the


           20    

Internet issue.


           21              

QUESTION:  We're off on the other issue. 


           22              

MR. STEINDLER:  We've gotten off to the issue,


           23    

but let me just answer the question quickly, if I could. 


           24              

You've got Congress providing very detailed


           25    

formulas for two specific kinds of services that go

            1    

through a wire:  cable service and wire service.  You have


            2    

to ignore the expressio unius doctrine to conclude that


            3    

they also have authority for another type of service.


            4              

QUESTION:  Well, you -- you don't if -- if you


            5    

characterize (b) the right way.  You began by -- by


            6    

saying, before we started questioning, that (d) provides


            7    

the exclusive -- I think you used the word formula.  But


            8    

that's different from the exclusive authorization to set


            9    

rates, and the authorization is in (b).  (D), as Justice


           10    

Breyer pointed out, are two specific formulae that the


           11    

commission must use.  But that's -- that's not necessarily


           12    

to cover the whole universe of rate setting.  So, I don't


           13    

see why the exclusio unius even applies.


           14              

MR. STEINDLER:  You'd have to -- in order to


           15    

come to that reading, you'd have to separate this -- this


           16    

very detailed set of rate formulas from their general


           17    

jurisdiction to regulate.  In other words, you'd have to


           18    

assume that -- that Congress intended to give jurisdiction


           19    

that was undefined, that was under a bare just and


           20    

reasonable power for anything other than cable and wire


           21    

service.  But --


           22              

QUESTION:  More than that.  As one of the briefs


           23    

points out, you'd have to assume that for services that


           24    

are beyond the ordinary regulatory bailiwick of the FCC,


           25    

the FCC has been given unrestricted powers to set rates --

MR. STEINDLER:  Right. 


            2              

QUESTION:  -- whereas for those areas that are


            3    

within its special expertise, cable and


            4    

telecommunications, Congress has specified the rates.  But


            5    

if it's beyond that in areas that you don't know squat


            6    

about, you can -- you can pick whatever rate you like. 


            7              

QUESTION:  I'm glad you agree with that.  I just


            8    

wonder what's so odd about Congress giving regulatory


            9    

authority to set just and reasonable rates to a regulatory


           10    

agency and then taking out two areas, it happens to be,


           11    

that the industry is particularly interested in and


           12    

negotiating a specific formula, while leaving others --


           13    

I've seen it a thousand times in regulatory statutes --


           14    

leaving others for the agency to proceed under normal,


           15    

ordinary, just, and reasonable rate setting authority. 


           16              

MR. STEINDLER:  I think another answer -- and


           17    

again, I do want to return to the wireless issue because


           18    

it does tend to get lost in the shuffle here. 


           19              

Another answer is this.  This is not an ordinary


           20    

agency case.  This is not a case where an agency is


           21    

regulating an industry under its organic statute.  This is


           22    

not Iowa Utilities.  This is a case where the electric


           23    

industry here, which is principally regulated by other


           24    

agencies, is now being regulated also by the FCC.


           25              

Congress -- people were very concerned about

            1    

giving the -- the communications agency jurisdiction over


            2    

the electric industry.  The White House's Office of


            3    

Telecommunications Policy wrote two letters to Congress


            4    

expressing that concern when the act was being considered,


            5    

and Congress said, in the legislative history, quite


            6    

clearly we're giving the FCC a very narrow grant of


            7    

jurisdiction.  And one of the ways that you give an agency


            8    

a narrow grant of jurisdiction is you constrain their


            9    

discretion.  They've given them very detailed formulas to


           10    

-- to govern the exercise of their discretion in these two


           11    

particular circumstances. 


           12              

QUESTION:  Yes, but it's very narrow because


           13    

they're only talking about attachments to utility poles. 


           14    

They aren't talking about much else in the -- in the


           15    

utilities business.  It's a very narrow aspect of the


           16    

utilities' overall operations. 


           17              

MR. STEINDLER:  Not only are they talking about


           18    

attachments to utility poles, but they're only talking


           19    

about attachments to utility poles for two kinds of


           20    

services. 


           21              

And remember this.  Not everybody that has an


           22    

attachment --


           23              

QUESTION:  Well, that's an assumption.  The


           24    

statute doesn't really say that.  It doesn't say that only


           25    

these two kinds of services --

            2              

QUESTION:  It says if you have two kinds of


            3    

rates, these are the formulas for those two.  But I don't


            4    

see where it totally forecloses attachments for other


            5    

purposes. 


            6              

MR. STEINDLER:  If -- well, certainly if you


            7    

read this canon -- if you read the statute with the canon


            8    

of expressio unius, you -- there needs to be some --


            9              

QUESTION:  Well, the expressio unius relates to


           10    

rates.  It doesn't relate to regulatory authority. 


           11    

Justice Kennedy pointed out. 


           12              

MR. STEINDLER:  Well, again, you would end up --


           13              

QUESTION:  And it not only fixes rates, it


           14    

requires access.  There are two things that the commission


           15    

can do.  It can say you've got to let these people hook up


           16    

to the pole and you can only charge them so much.  There


           17    

are two different things. 


           18              

MR. STEINDLER:  Indeed.  The statute provides a


           19    

mandatory access provision and a rate provision.  But


           20    

again, you have to come to the conclusion that for these


           21    

specific types of services that are enumerated in the


           22    

statute, there's a very detailed set of formulas that come


           23    

to it.  But for unenumerated services which --


           24              

QUESTION:  It's only detailed on rates.  It's


           25    

not detailed on the access provision.

MR. STEINDLER:  Indeed, indeed.


            2              

If I could just return quickly back to the


            3    

wireless issue, the -- the -- (d) and (e) provide, in a


            4    

sense, formulas for these two types of rates.  In (d), the


            5    

attacher pays either somewhere between an incremental cost


            6    

and a proportionate share of the useable space.  In (e),


            7    

it's a higher rate.  It's a proportionate share of the


            8    

usable space on the pole and the unusable space on the


            9    

pole.  And that's reflected on page 209 of the -- of the


           10    

appendix in -- in 224(e)(3), which reads, a utility shall


           11    

apportion the cost of providing usable space, and then the


           12    

immediately preceding section, 224(e)(2) talks about the


           13    

portion of the cost of providing the space other than


           14    

usable space. 


           15              

Now, the operative term in both (d) and (e) is


           16    

usable space, and the statute defines usable space. 


           17    

Usable space is where attachments go.  If you look at


           18    

224(d)(2), on the -- on page 208a, the statute defines


           19    

usable space as the space above the minimum grade level,


           20    

which can be used for the attachment of wires, cables, and


           21    

associated equipment.  That's what this statute is about: 


           22    

wires, cables, and associated equipment. 


           23              

QUESTION:  Now, what you mean by associated


           24    

equipment, I suppose, is -- I don't know -- joint boxes,


           25    

lightening arresters, things of that sort.

            1              

MR. STEINDLER:  Associated equipment is


            2    

equipment that is used to make the wires and the cables


            3    

work.


            4              

QUESTION:  Why couldn't associated equipment


            5    

mean for the -- for a wireless company -- I guess very few


            6    

of these wireless companies are entirely wireless.  Some


            7    

-- some portions of their system go over wire. 


            8              

MR. STEINDLER:  Correct. 


            9              

QUESTION:  So, why couldn't the wireless boxes


           10    

that they nail on these -- on these poles as pole


           11    

attachment be deemed associated equipment of these wires


           12    

that they use elsewhere? 


           13              

MR. STEINDLER:  Well, again, it's wires, cables,


           14    

and associated equipment, and not equipment and -- and


           15    

associated wires and cables. 


           16              

The FCC has never until its -- the Government's


           17    

reply brief --


           18              

QUESTION:  You think it has to be associated


           19    

with the very wires and cables that -- that are attached?


           20              

MR. STEINDLER:  Of course.  Under just familiar


           21    

ejusdem generis principles, in that phrase, wires, cables,


           22    

and associated equipment, the associated equipment is


           23    

subordinate to the words that precede it and is delimited


           24    

by those two words. 


           25              

The Government argues for the first time, in its

            1    

reply brief, that -- that wires and cable -- or that --


            2    

that wireless equipment ought to be able to come within


            3    

the scope of associated equipment here.  And they argue,


            4    

well, much like Justice Scalia just -- just mentioned,


            5    

they could be the -- the same shape.  You might have a


            6    

piece of wireless equipment that's the same shape as the


            7    

kinds of things like mounting brackets or splice boxes


            8    

that are used as associated equipment. 


            9              

But leaving aside the fact that this just


           10    

occurred to the Government here in its reply brief, a


           11    

toaster is the same shape.  It has a box-like shape, but


           12    

no one would really argue that it is associated equipment


           13    

within the meaning of the phrase. 


           14              

This -- this issue with the wireless issue


           15    

really boils down to the question here of whether


           16    

associated equipment is wireless.  We submit to you that


           17    

it can't be.  That conclusion is buttressed by the


           18    

definition of utility in this act.  The definition of


           19    

utility --


           20              

QUESTION:  I'm lost.  Can you just tell me,


           21    

where does the term, associated equipment -- what section


           22    

was that in? 


           23              

MR. STEINDLER:  It's in section 224(d)(2) on


           24    

page 208a of the --


           25              

QUESTION:  I've got you.

            1              

MR. STEINDLER:  You've got it?  Okay. 


            2              

If you turn to the definition of utility, which


            3    

is in -- at the beginning of the statute, 224(a)(1) on


            4    

page 205a, it reads in pertinent part that a utility is a


            5    

person who owns poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way


            6    

used, in whole or in part, for wire communications.  It


            7    

doesn't say wireless communications.  It doesn't say


            8    

communications.  It says wire communications.  And that


            9    

certainly supports the negative inference that the court


           10    

below drew from this language that we're talking about


           11    

wire communications in this statute, not wireless


           12    

equipment. 


           13              

QUESTION:  Yes, but when -- given -- given the


           14    

fact, as somebody pointed out -- I guess Justice Scalia


           15    

pointed out earlier -- the wireless companies always have


           16    

some wires.  Why isn't the existence of -- of that wire


           17    

portion of their equipment sufficient to fit within the


           18    

statute?


           19              

MR. STEINDLER:  Two things.  First of all, again


           20    

we're talking about wires, cables, and equipment that's


           21    

associated with that.  And the -- the -- the particular


           22    

wires that are associated with a wireless antenna, which


           23    

run down the pole --


           24              

QUESTION:  You mean it's going to be a wire on


           25    

the pole or -- or associated --

MR. STEINDLER:  Correct.  It's got to be a --


            2              

QUESTION:  Yes. 


            3              

MR. STEINDLER:  Right.  That's our argument.


            4              

And I think also one last quick point on -- on


            5    

wireless.  What the Government is doing here -- the FCC is


            6    

making a revolutionary expansion in its jurisdiction. 


            7    

Wireless antennas are ubiquitous, and what the FCC has


            8    

said is that we're going to regulate a very narrow portion


            9    

of the wireless siting market, i.e., just those wireless


           10    

sites that are owned by utility companies.  So that a


           11    

wireless antenna that goes up on a -- on a rooftop --


           12              

QUESTION:  Non-wireless sites that are used by a


           13    

utility.


           14              

MR. STEINDLER:  Say that again? 


           15              

QUESTION:  Non-wireless sites that are owned by


           16    

utility companies.  If a utility company only -- only has


           17    

permitted the stringing of wire, it has opened itself up,


           18    

has it not, under this rule --


           19              

MR. STEINDLER:  Yes. 


           20              

QUESTION:  -- to mandatory carriage of -- of


           21    

wireless? 


           22              

MR. STEINDLER:  Correct.  That's the -- that's


           23    

the Government's argument.


           24              

This -- under this FCC's -- under the FCC's


           25    

reading of this statute, which is impermissible if you

            1    

read the whole statute, they have -- they have decided to


            2    

take this revolutionary expansion of their jurisdiction to


            3    

regulate this tiny piece of the wireless siting market. 


            4    

But if Congress had intended the FCC to regulate the


            5    

wireless siting market in this peculiar kind of way, just


            6    

utility sites, clearly they would have said something


            7    

about it.  And they didn't here, which is another part of


            8    

the context here of the statute which informs the reading


            9    

of the phrase, any attachment, in the statute. 


           10              

QUESTION:  Mr. Steindler, could I ask you a


           11    

question that gets you to the other -- to the other issue? 


           12    

Is it -- is the Government correct that you lose if the --


           13    

even if the rate applied by the FCC is wrong, that the


           14    

only thing you're asking us is to say that the FCC has no


           15    

jurisdiction?  It wouldn't even matter if the FCC should


           16    

have been treating this under (e) as telecommunications. 


           17    

That isn't what you're asking for.


           18              

MR. STEINDLER:  Well, no, it's not.  If the FCC


           19    

had gone through the exercise that you had suggested and


           20    

classified cable modem surface -- service, as either a


           21    

cable service or a telecommunication service or neither,


           22    

as an information service, if it had gone through that


           23    

exercise and that exercise had survived a challenge, then


           24    

this -- the game would be over.  It would be if it's a


           25    

cable service or a telecommunications service, it would

fall within (d) or (e). 


            2              

What the FCC has done here -- and the reason


            3    

that we're in this awkward posture -- is they've refused


            4    

to make that classification, but they've decided that,


            5    

nonetheless, cable modem service, even though we don't


            6    

know what it is, is going to be treated under (d), which


            7    

Congress has said will be applied solely to cable service. 


            8    

The statute --


            9              

QUESTION:  Well, they -- they didn't say it


           10    

would be treated under (d).  They said under (a) we're


           11    

going to proceed the same way -- or under -- under


           12    

whatever it is --


           13              

MR. STEINDLER:  (A) and (b), correct. 


           14              

QUESTION:  Under (a) and (b), we're going to --


           15    

we're going to use the same rate that Congress specifies


           16    

in -- in (d).  They don't say it's under (d).


           17              

MR. STEINDLER:  That's correct.  That's correct. 


           18    

A distinction I think without a difference from our


           19    

perspective.


           20              

QUESTION:  From your perspective. 


           21              

MR. STEINDLER:  But that's indeed what they --


           22    

what they've done. 


           23              

A couple of points to make here quickly.  One is


           24    

that -- that indeed what Congress was doing here, as the


           25    

petitioners have pointed out, was dealing with the fact

            1    

that cable companies were going to be getting into the


            2    

telephone business.  And this Texas Utilities case, which


            3    

the Government mentions in its brief, stands for the


            4    

proposition in the pre-'96 era -- in the pre-'96 statute


            5    

-- that if you're a cable company in the telephone


            6    

business, you get a regulated rate for your attachment,


            7    

and -- and therefore can compete against the ILEC's, which


            8    

is what the larger purpose of much of the '96 act was


            9    

about. 


           10              

But if you're -- if you're a CLEC, if you're a


           11    

telephone company, a communications company, that's in the


           12    

same business and providing the same service, you don't


           13    

get a regulated rate.  That was a regulatory anomaly, as


           14    

the legislative history calls it, and Congress dealt with


           15    

that head on in the statute.  And it provided in section

(d) and section (e) -- it -- that -- that where you have


           17    

-- it added telecommunications carriers to the statute,


           18    

although it exempted the ILEC's.


           19              

Remember this.  The cable companies' biggest


           20    

competitors in high-speed services business, the DSL


           21    

lines, or the local phone companies, don't have regulated


           22    

pole attachments.  And that's what, in many respects, is


           23    

driving the cable companies. 


           24              

QUESTION:  Say it again.  The local phone


           25    

companies --

            1              

MR. STEINDLER:  The local phone company is


            2    

exempted from the statute.  Let me show you where.  If you


            3    

turn to the definition of a telecommunications carrier on


            4    

page 205a, in section 224(a)(5), for purposes of this


            5    

section, the term telecommunications carrier does not


            6    

include any incumbent local exchange carrier as defined in


            7    

section 251.


            8              

QUESTION:  Is that because they have their own


            9    

poles? 


           10              

MR. STEINDLER:  They have very few of their own


           11    

poles.  I think largely -- Congress didn't say exactly why


           12    

they were -- why they were doing this. 


           13              

But remember what the larger purposes of the '96


           14    

act were.  The '96 act was designed to create competition


           15    

to the local telephone companies. 


           16              

QUESTION:  I thought the purpose of this -- and


           17    

I'm really asking this question because I want to hear


           18    

what your argument is on the main point in this case, if


           19    

it's different from what you've already said.  I mean,


           20    

you've been talking about wireless for a long time, and


           21    

now maybe you're back to the main point. 


           22              

MR. STEINDLER:  Indeed. 


           23              

QUESTION:  All right.  And if you're going to be


           24    

right on the main point, my main question on the main


           25    

point is I thought that the purpose of this act basically

            1    

is that Congress discovered that the utilities have poles


            2    

everywhere.  There are new competitors coming along that


            3    

could use those poles to transmit their networks at lower


            4    

cost, but the utilities have a monopoly.  And we want to


            5    

make sure that a monopoly, a monopoly into -- a monopoly


            6    

does not charge a monopoly price and, therefore, we want


            7    

them regulated.  And, therefore, they wrote very broad


            8    

language to throw into what is going to be regulated


            9    

virtually everything related to communications that will


           10    

meet that kind of problem.  Now, that's my -- I'm -- I'm


           11    

saying this to get you started on what I consider the main


           12    

point. 


           13              

MR. STEINDLER:  Right, and I understand that.  I


           14    

think the answer is that this statute is not written in


           15    

very broad language.  This statute is written very


           16    

narrowly.  Congress said it was to be construed narrowly,


           17    

and it provides, with great specificity, what services are


           18    

regulated and how they're to be regulated.  And -- and I


           19    

think that really addresses the fundamental question here.


           20              

QUESTION:  Yes, except the jurisdictional


           21    

language is broad.


           22              

MR. STEINDLER:  Well, let's talk about the


           23    

jurisdictional language --


           24              

QUESTION:  And the language that you point to as


           25    

narrowing is language that picks out two categories of

rate setting. 


            2              

MR. STEINDLER:  The jurisdictional language is


            3    

not as broad as it may appear to be.  The --


            4              

QUESTION:  It doesn't include toasters and it


            5    

doesn't include billboards, I agree. 


            6              

MR. STEINDLER:  Yes, but it also doesn't include


            7    

commingled cable and Internet service.  And the reason


            8    

that it doesn't include that is that Congress specifically


            9    

-- as Mr. Keisler pointed out, Congress specifically


           10    

defined a cable system in the statute.  It's -- it's


           11    

reprinted.  The definition is reprinted at page 19 of the


           12    

brief of the respondents, American Electric Power Service


           13    

Corporation. 


           14              

But remember -- remember what we're talking


           15    

about.  We're talking about a pole attachment definition


           16    

which is any attachment by a cable television system. 


           17    

Congress has defined this term.


           18              

Now, Justice Scalia remarked earlier that it was


           19    

-- it's an attachment by a cable -- a cable system, not of


           20    

a cable system.  And, indeed, there is awkwardness in this


           21    

language, but I would submit to you that the express


           22    

definition of cable system will trump any awkwardness in


           23    

grammar. 


           24              

QUESTION:  Well, there's an awkwardness that I


           25    

don't understand.  The '96 act was extending the benefit

            1    

of attachment a group that hadn't had that benefit before. 


            2    

What is there that makes sense of saying, cable company,


            3    

if you dare to go into the Internet business, you are


            4    

going to be, in the words that were used before, kicked


            5    

off the pole.  That's it.  If Congress was trying to


            6    

encourage development of Internet service, it also wanted


            7    

the cable system to get onto that pole at a rent that was


            8    

not a monopoly rent.  What sense would it make to say,


            9    

cable company, you dare to go into the Internet access


           10    

business, you are off the pole entirely? 


           11              

MR. STEINDLER:  Well, Congress has talked sort


           12    

of out of both sides of its mouth about the Internet.  It


           13    

wants to promote it on the one hand, indeed.  But it also


           14    

wants to be sure that it keeps its hands off the Internet


           15    

and has -- has said -- announced its policy that it's


           16    

going to -- the Internet ought to develop unfettered by


           17    

Federal and State regulation. 


           18              

Remember this, that -- that the pole attachment


           19    

statute was designed originally to help cable companies in


           20    

their infancy, when they were mom and pop cable shops.


           21              

QUESTION:  It doesn't fetter the Internet.  This


           22    

fetters the utility companies. 


           23              

(Laughter.) 


           24              

MR. STEINDLER:  Indeed.  Indeed.  But -- but


           25    

you've got the -- you've got a statute that says the

following very clearly.  We're going to give you -- it


            2    

makes it clear now that we're going to give you one rate


            3    

if you're providing cable only, and we're going to give


            4    

you another rate, a much higher rate, if you add a service


            5    

to that wire, which is the telecommunications service. 


            6              

It's not incomprehensible or unclear that if --


            7    

if the cable company makes a decision to step into the


            8    

Internet business, that it -- that it simply opts out of


            9    

the statute.  These cable companies --


           10              

QUESTION:  Well, that's your position.  That's


           11    

how you read the statute. 


           12              

MR. STEINDLER:  Correct.


           13              

But these cable companies are -- are not mom and


           14    

pop shops anymore.  They're some of the biggest companies


           15    

in the United States. 


           16              

QUESTION:  But is there anything in the


           17    

legislative history, anything that indicates that Congress


           18    

wanted to take this benefit away from the cable systems if


           19    

they were also offering Internet access?


           20              

MR. STEINDLER:  Let me -- the answer is yes, and


           21    

it comes in the definition of a cable system.  A cable


           22    

system is a set of facilities, but where you're a common


           23    

carrier -- that is to say if you're in the phone business


           24    

and you're regulated as a common carrier -- the definition


           25    

says you are a cable system only to the extent that you

provide traditional video service.  That dovetails here


            2    

with what Congress has done with respect to cable service


            3    

in 224(d).  It gives this lower rate only if you're


            4    

providing cable service.


            5              

The cable system definition -- let me say that


            6    

again.  You're --


            7              

QUESTION:  You're not arguing about the lower


            8    

rate anymore.  I mean, you --


            9              

MR. STEINDLER:  Well, what I'm arguing here --


           10              

QUESTION:  You're arguing --


           11              

MR. STEINDLER:  -- is -- is about --


           12              

QUESTION:  You're arguing that you're off the


           13    

pole entirely. 


           14              

MR. STEINDLER:  Well, you're -- you're


           15    

unregulated.  That doesn't make you off the pole.  The --


           16    

the phone company is unregulated --


           17              

QUESTION:  You can charge anything you want. 


           18    

That's -- you take the cable company that is getting this


           19    

low rent because the FCC has specified that rent.  If it


           20    

gets into -- into the Internet business, then it's subject


           21    

to whatever the utility wants to charge. 


           22              

MR. STEINDLER:  If -- if the -- if it gets into

QUESTION:  Right.  And that's the price of


            5    

getting into the Internet for a cable system.  It has to


            6    

give up --

MR. STEINDLER:  For a cable company.

QUESTION:  -- the tremendous advantage that it


            9    

has.

           11    

regulations here. 


           12              

QUESTION:  Is its main competitor the local


           13    

phone system? 


           14              

MR. STEINDLER:  Yes, yes.

QUESTION:  So --


           16              

MR. STEINDLER:  But there are two -- there are


           17    

two big competitors in this business:  the local phone


           18    

company which is unregulated, and the cable company which


           19    

is seeking this regulation. 


           20              

QUESTION:  How many -- how many poles do the


           21    

local phone companies own in relation to the utilities


           22    

that you're representing? 


           23              

MR. STEINDLER:  About 80 or 85 percent of poles


           24    

are owned by the utility companies; 15-20 percent are


           25    

owned by the telephone companies.

QUESTION:  So, the effect of what Justice


            2    

Ginsburg is talking about is going to be significantly


            3    

different in relation to the utilities from what it is in


            4    

relation to local phone companies.  You say, well, it just


            5    

puts them in the same relationship to the utility as they


            6    

are to the phone company, but in economic terms, there's a


            7    

tremendous difference because you've got most of the


            8    

poles.


            9              

MR. STEINDLER:  Indeed, but the -- the -- I

there is -- these attachers have, if they're unregulated, 


           22    

a remedy if they feel they're being overcharged under the

essential facilities doctrine.  They go into court and

            5    

utility within the meaning of the statute?


            6              

MR. STEINDLER:  Indeed.


            7              

QUESTION:  Indeed, that I'm wrong, or indeed, it


            8    

is?


            9              

MR. STEINDLER:  They're both.  Indeed, it is. 


           10    

They are both. 


           11              

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Steindler. 


           12              

MR. STEINDLER:  Thank you. 


           13              

QUESTION:  Mr. Feldman, you have 2 minutes


           14    

remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN


           16            

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 00-843


           17              

MR. FELDMAN:  I think it might be worthwhile to


           18    

point out that the -- the FCC's construction of the act is


           19    

entitled to deference and is at least a reasonable


           20    

construction of the act. 


           21              

But let -- let me go to the -- the point that


           22    

Mr. Steindler was just making.  Congress, in 1978 as a


           23    

premise of this act, decided that the telephone companies


           24    

and the utilities had a lot of -- and we cite the -- the


           25    

committee report that makes this point -- had -- had

            1    

interconnection agreements.  Some owned -- the utilities


            2    

owned some poles; the telephone companies owned other


            3    

poles.  They had a longstanding agreements by which


            4    

everybody used everybody else's poles because everybody


            5    

had to get a complete network to all the houses. 


            6              

Now, under -- so, therefore, that is why


            7    

Congress did not include the so-called ILEC's, the old-


            8    

fashioned telephone companies, in this act.  They already


            9    

had access to poles.  They either owned them or had


           10    

agreements with longstanding arrangements with -- with the


           11    

utility -- electric utilities.


           12              

On the other hand, there were CLEC's, which are


           13    

new entrants in the telecommunications business.  Those


           14    

were protected by the (e) rate regardless of whether they


           15    

do or don't provide Internet access. 


           16              

Similarly, cable companies, the FCC decided,


           17    

should be protected by the (d) rate similarly so that if


           18    

they provide Internet access, they're not penalized


           19    

thereby and kicked off the pole.  Under Mr. Steindler's


           20    

rule and under the Eleventh Circuit's decision, if a cable


           21    

company provides Internet access, it's off the pole.


           22              

QUESTION:  I guess that isn't quite -- I mean,


           23    

in fairness to what he was arguing, I mean, a person, were


           24    

this statute not to apply, could still go either to the


           25    

local telephone company regulators, which I imagine they

            1    

would do in the case of the local phone company, could go


            2    

to the local public utilities commission, or could go to


            3    

the Federal Power Commission and ask them for the same


            4    

kind of protection that the FCC might give them if this


            5    

act does apply. 


            6              

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, I guess --


            7              

QUESTION:  Is that right? 


            8              

MR. FELDMAN:  I'm not -- I'm not aware of what


            9    

the basis of the Federal Power Commission's ability to


           10    

order --


           11              

QUESTION:  Well, if it were some kind of high


           12    

tension wire that was used in transmitting interstate


           13    

commerce. 


           14              

But the fact is these areas are all regulated by


           15    

somebody, and this is really a question of who has what


           16    

jurisdiction.


           17              

MR. FELDMAN:  Right, but what -- what Congress


           18    

wanted was --


           19              

QUESTION:  Am I right about that? 


           20              

MR. FELDMAN:  I'm not -- I'm not sure about what


           21    

the -- what the authority of local utility agencies is


           22    

over the poles as opposed to the rates --


           23              

QUESTION:  Could they not --


           24              

MR. FELDMAN:  -- for the service.  I just don't


           25    

know.
