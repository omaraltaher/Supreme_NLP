CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We’ll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 09-497, 

Rent-A-Center West v. Jackson. 

Mr. Friedman. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT F. FRIEDMAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

The agreement between Antonio Jackson and 

Rent-A-Center should be enforced as written.  There is 

no statutory impediment to the enforcement of the clear 

and unmistakable agreement that gives the arbitrator 

exclusive authority to decide Jackson's challenge to 

enforceability, nor is there any language in the Federal 

Arbitration Act that would prohibit the court from 

making the determination -- prohibit the arbitrator from 

making the determination of Jackson's challenge to 

unconscionability. 

Through frequent holdings of this Court 

going back 50 years to the Steelworkers trilogy, this 

Court has plainly recognized that parties may delegate 

issues as to scope and validity to the arbitrator in the 

first instance.  The district court and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But not to the 

question of which parties have agreed to arbitrate? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not the question of 

which parties have agreed to arbitrate? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Which parties can be 

potentially scope issues and which parties potentially 

as well.  In this case, the issue is enforceability. 

And through the holdings of First Options, Howsam, and 

Bazzle, going back to previous decisions, this Court has 

held that parties through clear and unmistakable 

delegation can give that to the arbitrator in the first 

instance. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if -- if fraud in the 

inducement, I take it, is considered -- even if you have 

a very broad arbitration clause, as we do here, fraud in 

the inducement is considered a question for the court, 

not the arbitrator; is that right? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So why should 

unconscionability be treated differently? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, fraud in 

the inducement, pursuant to Prima Paint, goes to the 

making of the agreement, and under section 4, the court

retains decisions over the making of the agreement. 

Unconscionability is a post-formation attack.  It does 

not go to the very limited inquiry that is anticipated 

under section 4, of the making --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why is it post-formation? 

Arguably, the -- one of the parties has such a strong 

hand that it forces the other party just to decide. 

It's almost like -- duress would certainly be for the 

court, would it not, if it’s a formation issue like 

Justice Ginsburg indicated? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  In some instances, 

Justice Kennedy, duress could be; for example, a gun to 

somebody's head.  But procedural unconscionability does 

not go to the same issues of making.  And, in fact, under 

Nevada law and this State's laws --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'm not sure what 

procedural unconscionability, but this is -- as Justice 

Ginsburg indicates, it's not clear to me why this isn't 

a formation issue. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Formation is a very basic 

existential analysis.  It goes to mutual assent.  Did 

the parties sign the agreement and indicate the desire 

to be bound by the agreement?  Though --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I guess you could argue 

that on its face the agreement is so one-sided, so

unconscionable, that one of the parties must have been 

coerced into signing it.  I guess you could make that 

argument, can't -- couldn't you? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Justice Scalia, you could 

make that argument --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Has -- has that argument 

been made here? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  There was an argument made 

that it was one-sided, but it was the same type of 

argument that pertains --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was the argument made that 

because it was so unconscionable, the employee must have 

been coerced into making it? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  No, Justice Scalia.  That 

argument was not --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I didn't think it -- it had 

been made. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Getting back to 

Justice Ginsburg's question about making --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'm a little puzzled. 

What was the argument that was made?  Why was it 

unconscionable, if not for that reason? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Justice Stevens, the argument 

was that there was unequal bargaining power because 

Mr. Jackson was the -- a putative employee and Rent-A-Center

was the employer.  He also complained about a couple of 

the provisions in the agreement, one pertaining to 

discovery, one pertaining to an alleged fee-splitting 

provision in the agreement.  He did not complain as to 

the terms that Justice Scalia just referred to. 

With respect to making, it is a very limited 

inquiry, and section 4 is the provision in the Federal 

Arbitration Act that gives a court the power to 

enforce the arbitration agreement.  Once the court is 

satisfied that the making is not an issue and the making 

is a very basic issue, the court, pursuant to the plain 

language of section 4, must submit the dispute to 

arbitration. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You have --

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Now, in some instances, the 

courts will make decisions as to attacks such as 

unconscionability.  But in this sense --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, is your problem 

with unconscionability being -- as described by the Chief 

Justice or Justice Scalia, being forced to or coerced 

into signing something -- that's okay for the courts, but 

this type of argument that goes to the unfairness of the 

process, that's for the arbitrator; is that your 

position? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  That's -- that’s right, Justice

Sotomayor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why -- isn't that an 

unwieldy rule?  Isn't your quarrel with what the court 

defined as remissible unconscionability as a legal 

matter, as opposed to trying to parse out what 

unconscionability means otherwise? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, 

unconscionability and fairness attacks go to 

post-formation issues that -- that are --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We just gave you one 

that didn't:  If someone was forced into signing the 

agreement in an unconscionable way. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  But, Justice Sotomayor, if 

for example it's fraud in the inducement, such as in 

Prima Paint, that does go to the section 4.  It does go 

to the making of the agreement because there would not 

be mutual assent if somebody was forced to enter into 

the agreement. 

In contrast, unconscionability, and 

certainly the allegations we've seen here against the 

agreement, go to post-formation complaints, complaints 

about the fairness of the agreement.  They do not go to 

the actual, very limited making of the agreement. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I suppose that 

the substance of the agreement -- maybe this is just the

same question as Justice Scalia's.  I suppose the 

substance of the agreement is evidence -- could be 

evidence on the unconscionability at formation. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And that is for the 

court. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  If -- if there is something 

in the agreement that would indicate that there was not 

mutual assent, as in somebody put a gun to somebody's 

head, somebody forced them to do it, that would be for 

the court. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, the point is --

it's not that.  It would be the -- the provisions are so 

one-sided that you may assume from that that the 

formation was not voluntary. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  No, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Attacks on the fairness and simply pointing to 

provisions and saying, well, these are very unfair; it 

must be an indication of it being forced -- no, that would 

be for the arbitrator to decide, because it’s simply an 

attack on the fairness and there’s speculation as to why 

somebody entered.  And in this agreement --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't agree with that.  I 

mean, if -- if the argument is made -- I gather it 

wasn't made here, but if the argument is made that this

agreement was not voluntary, and the evidence of that 

involuntariness is how outrageously unfair it is -- now, 

I'm not sure that that's enough evidence.  You may need 

some other stuff as well to -- to persuade a court. 

But if that is the argument, that the 

one-sidedness is evidence that the agreement was not 

voluntary, I don't see how that's for the arbitrator. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Justice Scalia, under the 

section 4 analysis, in the making there needs to be some 

evidence that it was forced, the gun to the head 

example.  Simply pointing to the language in the 

agreement as evidence of that would not be enough.  That 

is an attack on the language of the agreement after it's 

been formed. 

The section 4 analysis is very, very limited, 

and it goes to these most basic elements.  So the 

language of the agreement, while certainly the party 

opposing it will have the opportunity to make the 

argument it's unconscionable, but that would be for the 

arbitrator. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't think that could 

be used along with other evidence?  I think all you’re 

saying is that it is not in and of itself enough, that 

every unfair agreement is not a coerced agreement. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  It certainly would not in and

of itself be enough --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you could use it as 

evidence if there’s other evidence supporting that. 

Couldn't you? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Your Honor, you would have to 

look at the objective manifestation of mutual assent. 

For example, in this agreement --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think you can answer that 

yes or no.  Can you use that in addition to other 

evidence to show that the agreement was not voluntary? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Justice Scalia, I don't think 

so.  I think you would have to look to what transpired 

at the time the agreement was actually entered into and 

was made. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  And that's no matter how 

one-sided?  I mean, suppose the agreement provided that 

the employee shall pay all the costs of arbitration no 

matter who wins and also at the end of the arbitration 

shall pay a penalty if he fails to -- it seems to me you 

could have a really one-sided -- that would not be 

admissible on the issue? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Justice Stevens, if there is 

an issue about arbitral access, as in there is a block 

at the door, you cannot get a ticket to the show, 

because of some impediment in getting to arbitration in

the first place, under the Court's principles announced 

in Randolph and in First Options, you must have access to 

the arbitrator.  So in your example, if there is 

something prohibiting access to the arbitrator, that 

would be a different story. 

Getting back to Justice Scalia's question 

about the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the specific 

examples he gave, that the -- just take that the -- that 

the employee must bear all the costs of the arbitration, 

win or lose, that's the provision.  Would that provision 

be enough to make the issue one for the court rather 

than the arbitrator? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, if it's 

simply a complaint about the fairness, it would not be. 

If the parties --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But is it?  We don't need 

the "if."  Tell me whether you think a provision saying 

the employee under any and all circumstances pays all 

costs -- would that provision make this question of 

unconscionability one for the court rather than the 

arbitrator? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  It could, Justice Ginsburg. 

It would not be a question of arbitrability if the party 

opposing arbitration can meet the very heavy burden

established in Randolph to show that the fees would 

be -- would prohibit them from actually getting to 

arbitration.  It would not be simply an attack as we saw 

here, with no evidence, that we think a term is unfair. 

The party opposing arbitration would have to 

meet their burden.  They would have to put evidence in. 

And, for example, in Randolph the Court stated that in 

certain instances Mrs. Randolph could have put evidence 

in, and had she put evidence in, which she did not, much 

as in this case, if she had met her burden to show that 

she could not have access to arbitration -- in other 

words, if arbitration is an illusory remedy -- that 

could be for the court to decide, because, after all, 

even in the First Options decision, the anticipation is 

you have a clear and unmistakably delegation that the 

arbitrator will make a decision, and implicit in that 

that there is an arbitrator to make that decision. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, that's -- that’s true. 

The thing I was wondering in this case is there's a -- a 

dispute that's about racial discrimination and so forth. 

There’s a clause, and the clause says this is 

arbitrable, but that is being disputed because the 

plaintiff in the case says that's an unconscionable 

provision, so it doesn't really apply.  And then you say 

but now that dispute is referred to the arbitrator to

just read the language.  But the plaintiff says that 

that language, too, is unconscionable, and as long as 

that language is unconscionable, then how is it clear 

and unmistakable that they, he, agreed to do it, because 

an unconscionable provision is not a provision? 

So if we apply First Options -- I mean, it's 

complicated because of the language; it's not 

complicated once you think it out, and -- I hope.  But 

just applying it very literally, it would seem to say 

that you do not have clear and unmistakable evidence 

that they agreed to submit this kind of dispute to 

arbitration for the reason that what you point to is 

itself according to them a product of unconscionability. 

How do you -- how do you respond to that? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Justice Breyer, under section 

4, which is the enforcement mechanism, the court is 

limited to make decisions about the making.  Once the 

making issue is not an issue -- and it has never been an 

issue in this case; there has never been an allegation 

the making has been affected -- the court at that 

point should enforce the agreement pursuant to its 

terms. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, making itself 

could be, but I think that's a harder question, 

whether a -- certainly if the person says you see my

signature there; that's not mine; that's Joe Banana's, 

who tries to imitate me -- there is no contract, and no 

matter what it says, it doesn't go to the arbitrator. 

All right? 

Now, we can argue about whether it is or is 

not analogous to that when he claims it's 

unconscionable.  There's a very good argument it is 

analogous.  There's a very good argument it is like 

fraud in the inducement, and there are some arguments 

the other way. 

But First Options I think cuts through that, 

by saying whether that's true or not, unless it's clear 

and unmistakable that they wanted this matter, the 

matter of whether the arbitration clause itself is 

unconscionable referred to the arbitrator, whether or 

not they wanted that referred to the arbitrator has to 

be clear and unmistakable.  And they are claiming no, 

because the lack -- the provision that says that is 

itself a product of unconscionability.  That's to repeat 

my question.  But, having repeated the question, why 

isn't that the simplest, most direct, and four-sentence 

ground for deciding this case? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Justice Breyer, Jackson, first 

and foremost, did not ever complain that the arbitrability 

provision, the clear and unmistakable delegation provision,

is unconscionable. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  He’s not saying that this 

whole arbitration clause is unconscionable? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  He’s complaining that 

generally it's unconscionable --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, all right.  So he's 

-- he’s complaining the whole clause is unconscionable, 

and that's part of the clause. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Justice Breyer, this is really 

very similar to First Options, in which the party said: 

I'm not party to the agreement; the scope does not 

cover --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, and in First Options, we 

said it wasn’t clear and unmistakable. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  The Court said it was not, 

but in First Options the Court set out the rule --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And the rules were what I 

just described. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  The rule is -- in this case, 

there is language that has never been contested, and that 

language clearly and unmistakably says that the 

arbitrator has exclusive authority.  That language has 

never been attacked. 

And as to the issue of unconscionability, 

pursuant to section 4, which gives the court the

authority to send the arbitration to the arbitrator, the 

court should do exactly that.  It should send it to the 

arbitrator once the making issue is satisfied, and then 

the arbitrator can make that decision. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So your position is 

that the arbitrator gets to decide questions of 

unconscionability, but the court gets to decide whether 

the arbitrator can do that? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  In some instances, Justice 

Roberts -- Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct.  The court 

must decide whether the agreement is made.  The court 

must also decide whether there was a clear and 

unmistakable delegation.  So under First Options and the 

cases that interpret it and the cases before it, the 

court must make the initial determination of whether 

there is a clear and unmistakable delegation. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, do you understand --

and we can ask the Respondent.  But, as you understand 

Jackson's case, is he saying that part of the clause, 

part of the arbitration clause, is unconscionable, that 

the whole clause is unconscionable or that the whole 

contract is unconscionable? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  He has made generalized --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because the complaint is a 

bare-bones complaint, and I don't know if there’s

anything in the pleadings that reflects what his answer 

to that question would be. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Justice Kennedy, he has 

attacked certain provisions specifically of the 

agreement.  He is arguing about the discovery provision. 

He is arguing about the fees provision.  And he is arguing 

about certain terms excluding claims, that bilaterally 

exclude claims.  So he has attacked about three 

provisions of the agreement specifically. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But all of the 

arbitration agreement, not the employment contract as a 

whole. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, it is a 

stand-alone four-page arbitration agreement.  And --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So let's go back to that. 

Maybe the other way is simpler.  You say you agree that 

if my defense to this contract, which you are trying to 

enforce against me or which gives me a right to sue you, 

look at the argument, you put up this four-page 

document, and I say:  Look, that is not my signature; 

that is the signature of Joe Bananas.  We agree that's

drunk, told me a bunch of lies, and I signed it.  I 

grant it's my signature, but look at how squiggly it is. 

And my will was not a free one because I was under the 

influence of alcohol and lies. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  We agree --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Same.  Okay. 

That’s Prima Paint. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  -- because that’s part of 

the fraud issue. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay?  Now, he 

says the reason that I did not sign this contract -- I 

agree it's my signature; I agree it is not squiggly -- but 

still my will was overborne.  What was it overborne by? 

It was overborne by those very situations that lead 

courts to label contracts unconscionable.  The reason we 

don't enforce unconscionable contract is because the 

person who was the victim had no free will.  He did not 

sign it of his own accord.  And that doesn't -- there’s 

no other reason, and that's the basic reason, and 

therefore assimilate it to the other two.  What's your 

response? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  No, Justice Breyer, that 

would be a very different situation.  That would be 

allegations of procedural unconscionability, unequal 

bargaining power, and in fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you agree that a 

contract cannot be unconscionable unless it was coerced, 

that a finding of unconscionability is the same as a 

finding of coercion?  You don't agree with that, do you? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  No, there could be other 

types of unconscionability. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but that's what I want 

the answer to.  I know you don't agree with it.  What I 

want is a list of reasons why. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  With respect to procedural 

unconscionability, issues of unequal economic bargaining 

power, which is essentially what we have here -- those are 

non-issues that cannot be addressed by the arbitrator. 

And, in fact, under Nevada law, Justice Breyer, an 

allegation of procedural unconscionability, no matter 

how procedural --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But I'm not interested in 

arbitration law.  I’m interested in contract law, and I 

want to know why as a general matter of contract law an 

allegation of unconscionability, defense of 

unconscionability, is why is it not enough like the 

coercion defense or the inducement defense or the "I was 

in Alaska" defense?  Isn't it enough like that that they 

should be treated alike?  And now you're going to say no, 

and I want to know why not.

MR. FRIEDMAN:  It does not rise to the same 

level as something that's fraudulent or something that 

is forced with a gun to your head. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would have thought 

the answer to your -- the answer to your answer would be, 

well then, the -- you’re more likely to win on that 

question.  Obviously, you are going to lose on the gun to 

the head, but if it’s simply the economic inequality or 

whatever, under the State law you’re probably going to 

prevail, and they will say there is a valid contract.  I 

thought the -- your -- your whole point was simply it's 

all or nothing. 

The courts get to decide is there a valid 

contract or is there not.  And once they decide there 

is, then everything else about unconscionability of 

particular clauses is for the arbitrator. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, most 

everything is for the arbitrator, and I want to 

distinguish between unconscionability, as Justice Breyer 

is referring to, and access issues and issues that go to 

the making, because there is a very bright line.  Making 

issues go to the actual formation, mutual assent, and 

there is obviously no mutual assent if you have a gun to 

your head.

may have to do this, speculation is simply not enough 

to -- to pertain to the making of the agreement, nor is 

an issue about an impossibly burdensome access to the 

arbitration. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can you --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Friedman, this 

contract is -- is unusual in that, as Judge Hall said, 

it was more employee-friendly than most.  It had a 

clause -- it had a provision for back-end review with 

the court.  The review -- at the end of the line, there 

was to be court review, and as the parties said, it 

should be just like review of a district court decision, 

a much -- much more focused review than would be in the 

case of an arbitration agreement. 

Now, that clause comes out because of our 

decision in Hall.  That leaves the -- the arbitration 

agreement in -- in an imbalance.  There was court review 

assured at the back end.  So why isn't it reasonable to 

say the parties contemplated vigorous court review; if 

it can't be had at the back end, it should be had at the 

front end? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, there will 

be court review at the end pursuant to section 10.  As a 

result of Hall Street, section 10 is now the exclusive 

basis on the tail end --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it was very limited 

review.  But the parties to this agreement put in a 

clause that provided for the standard review, not the 

very limited review that the Arbitration Act calls for. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  That's correct, 

Justice Ginsburg.  But by operation of law and because 

of this Court's decision in Hall Street, now the parties 

will receive the section 10 review, much as they would 

in the First Options case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Once again, has this 

argument been made here?  I thought that the only basis 

was unconscionability.  I suppose you could have made 

the argument that the contract is void because one of 

its essential provisions has been rendered unlawful and, 

therefore -- and is not severable, and, therefore, the 

whole contract fails.  I suppose you could make that 

argument.  That hasn't been made, has it? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Justice Scalia, that's 

absolutely correct.  There has been no argument, in 

fact, at no time -- and it would have -- the proper 

place would have been the district court -- was any 

evidence ever put into the record --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How could it be in the 

district court?  We didn't decide Hall Street until 

after the district court was finished in this case.

MR. FRIEDMAN:  But, Justice Ginsburg, at the 

district court no evidence of any sort attacking any 

provision.  The only attacks here on the provisions are 

the arguments that were made by my colleague in the 

brief --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought you were 

making, in answer to Justice Scalia, the question -- he 

said, well, they didn't raise it.  They didn't raise 

that with this provision out, it was an essential 

provision, so the contract was void.  They had no reason 

to make that in the district court because Hall Street 

was not yet decided. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, my point 

simply is they put in no evidence of any sort attacking 

anything.  We’re simply --

Can they make -- I mean, even if they had -- you know, 

even if there was no reason to make it in the district

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that since they didn't 

have an opportunity to make it in the district court,

arbitrator could make that decision.  Under the clear 

and unmistakable delegation, that issue, like other 

issues, should be decided by the arbitrator. 

Nobody is contesting -- at least certainly 

nobody contested prior to us getting to the Supreme 

Court -- both the district court and the Ninth Circuit 

held that the language was clear and unmistakable. 

There was never any contest to that issue until we got 

here.  And because of the clear and unmistakable language 

and because the agreement does not implicate the making, 

we asked the court to enforce the terms of the agreement 

as written and pursuant to Bazzle and Howsam.  In 

particular, in Bazzle the Court recognized that issues as 

to scope and issues as to validity can go to the 

arbitrator in the first instance. 

Here, there can be no doubt -- and certainly 

there was no doubt at the district court level and Ninth 

Circuit -- that the parties clearly and unmistakably gave 

the arbitrator exclusive authority.  And we’re asking 

the Court to give effect to that language. 

The -- the -- the primary purpose of the 

Federal Arbitration Act is to enforce arbitration 

agreements pursuant to their terms.  Here, there's no 

real dispute about what the terms are.  Under section 4, 

a limited inquiry, once we have satisfied section 4 the

court should proceed to send us to the arbitrator. 

Nobody is arguing that Mr. Jackson can't 

make these challenges once he gets to arbitration.  In 

fact, he certainly can.  And the arbitrator will make 

that decision.  And the arbitrator may decide that it is 

unconscionable, in which case he’ll set it down.  Or 

he may decide -- or he or she may decide that it’s not 

unconscionable, or he or she may decide that certain 

terms are problematic and to sever those. 

At this point, if there’s no other 

questions, I’d like to reserve my remaining my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN E. SILVERBERG 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

The Petitioner would have the Court adopt a 

rule whereby agreements to arbitrate are presumed 

enforceable before their validity has been determined by 

a court under section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act. 

They would have people like Mr. Jackson waive their 

right to go to court through the use of a clause 

delegating this judicial function to the arbitrator.

us what is unconscionable about this contract?  What is 

your claim of unconscionability?  He says it's not 

arbitration per se; it's just certain of the provisions 

here; if you change the provisions, I'm happy with 

arbitration. 

Is that your position? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Yes, Your Honor, that --

that what is unconscionable about this is it's unusually 

one-sided in that the issues that are most important to 

Mr. Jackson, such as his racial discrimination case, he 

is required to arbitrate, but those issues that might be 

most important to the Petitioner, such as trade secrets 

and unfair competition, they are not bound to arbitrate. 

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would have thought 

the issue would be -- it's odd to say, I think, that if 

you have 10 provisions, some are unconscionable and 

some are not.  The issue would be whether there is 

unconscionability in the making of the whole contract. 

In other words, it's the same question I asked your 

friend:  Why isn't it all or nothing?  If it was -- if 

there was no unconscionability in the making, then the 

arbitrator decides.  If there was unconscionability in 

the making, then -- then the arbitrator doesn't decide 

anything.  Questions 1 through 10, not simply, you know,

1, 8, and 9. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  If I understand Your 

Honor's question, the -- the threshold determination 

must first be made by the court under section 2 as to 

whether there is unconscionability either of the entire 

agreement or any of the provisions.  It would then, 

assuming that were found, that some provisions were in 

fact unconscionable, it would be on State law to 

determine whether or not the entire agreement gets 

thrown out --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, my point is that 

once you get past that gateway question of whether the 

formation of the contract was not unconscionable, then 

claims that particular provisions were unconscionable 

are by definition for the arbitrator to decide. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  No, we would disagree with 

that, and here's why, Your Honor, and I think this goes 

to something that Justice Sotomayor asked, which is it 

creates a very difficult rule to deal with.  The 

Petitioners here, one, they have made a huge concession, 

we believe, in their reply brief by saying that if there’s 

an illusory remedy, that that is a section of 

unconscionability that the court can hear and must hear. 

But all these other --

that a big concession, because I thought, as the First 

Circuit said, if argument is the -- the contract is 

illusory, that goes to the court, but here the only 

claim is unconscionability.  That's a question of 

fairness.  It doesn't go to the court. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  The -- the reason it's a 

concession is because that's not their original position 

and that's not the question that they presented to this 

Court. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if they -- if they 

made that concession, so what, under the First Circuit's 

reading? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  The First Circuit, Your 

Honor, we believe did not interpret this correctly. 

They have, we believe, carved out a section of 

unconscionability law at the exclusion of all other 

unconscionability law. 

We know that States and Federal courts have 

routinely applied State unconscionability law, and they 

would have a rule whereby all this jurisprudence of the 

States delineating unconscionability law would in 

essence be preempted. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that -- is that right? 

Is the arbitrator free to decide unconscionability in a 

vacuum without taking into account State law at all?

And doesn't he get reviewed afterwards by the State 

court on the basis of a much more lenient standard 

than -- than if the court decided it de novo.  But can 

he really disregard State law regarding 

unconscionability? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Well, the problem is, Your 

Honor, and if I understand Your Honor's question 

correctly, that determination must of course be made by 

the court, because the arbitrator doesn't have any 

authority to do anything until the requirements of 

section 2 are met.  And I hope I’m understanding Your 

Honor's question. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No -- I mean, you -- I 

thought you were saying that if we allow this to go to 

the arbitrator, the arbitrator can simply disregard the 

question of unconscionability. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  That -- in essence, yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's not my 

understanding.  My understanding is that he's -- he is 

obliged to take account of State law regarding 

unconscionability, but it's going to be his call, as it 

would be the district judge's call if this had gone to 

court, whether in fact this is unconscionable. 

Afterwards, there will be court review.  And if he has

unconscionability, wouldn't -- wouldn't you have a basis 

to set aside the -- the arbitration? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Respectfully, I -- I 

disagree with that, and here's why, Your Honor:  The 

back-end review -- presumably it would be, I believe, 

under section 10(a)(4) that he exceeded his authority. 

And once the arbitrator is empanelled under the 

Federal -- under section 2, once he is authorized to 

make any decisions at all, including the issue that the 

Petitioner would have him decide of unconscionability 

and arbitrability, it would be impossible for anyone to 

say he has exceeded his authority. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That doesn't mean -- does 

that mean he can disregard -- let's assume the contract 

is a contract to maim.  I mean, it -- you know, it's --

it's like -- it's a Shylock contract, okay?  He's going 

to be able to exact a pound of flesh.  Now, there are 

State laws which invalidate contracts to maim.  Do you 

think that the arbitrator can ignore that, and say, 

well, you know, I don't really think it's so bad; a 

pound of flesh sounds reasonable to me? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  I think the concern is, 

Your Honor, and it's hard to draw the line --

adequate review if he chooses to without the court's 

review of --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that right?  You don't 

think a State court would in the blink of an eye set 

aside an arbitration that allowed a -- a pound of flesh? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Your Honor, I would hope 

they would, but I -- in reading the narrow review of 

section 9, 10, and 11, I don't think we have that 

guarantee. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think you have a

happen in that case. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What is -- what I'm not sure 

about what you are arguing now is my -- as I came into 

this, I thought there were three situations.  Situation 

1 is common in labor arbitration.  It's an arbitration 

agreement that says wages, hours, and working conditions 

disputes will be arbitrated, and we have a question 

about whether a particular dispute is or is not full 

within the definition. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Right.

that the parties intended the question of arbitrability

to be arbitrated; we assume it.  Normally, that's the 

rule.  It's the scope of the arbitration agreement. 

That's a little hard to distinguish, but sometimes 

that's not the argument.  The argument could be:  Well, 

there are four different provisions in the arbitration 

section, and we think one of them is void because it's, 

say, unconscionable, but the others are okay.  Now, that 

one, I mean, normally, you could if it's clear enough 

say I want that one to go to arbitration. 

And the third one is that you have a 

contract, and it's an arbitration contract, and it's on 

four separate pieces of paper, and what you’re saying 

is, I was in Alaska, or the equivalent, and maybe 

unconscionability is the equivalent.  On that one I'm 

with you. 

I don't see how you can submit -- agree to 

submit that to the arbitrator, because there’s no 

agreement, or at least no valid one, at least no valid 

one under State law. 

But what are you arguing?  That this is that 

case or this is the other case I just mentioned, that 

middle case where you have 10 provisions and you’re 

saying that this one over here is unconscionable but 

that one isn't; and -- but I did sign a valid 

arbitration agreement. I agree with that.  It's just that

certain provisions of it are invalid because they’re 

unfair.  What are you arguing in this case? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  That -- Your Honor, it 

would be the second one.  That there are issues --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, the second one -- I 

don't see how you get there, because if it's the second, 

one you concede that there is an arbitration agreement 

that’s valid.  And if you concede that there is a valid 

arbitration agreement between you and your client, and 

you’re arguing over the scope of different provisions 

or whether certain provisions within it are valid or 

invalid, why can't you submit that to an arbitrator if 

it’s clear enough? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  But we don't concede that, 

Your Honor.  That's the whole point, is that the court 

must make that threshold determination. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  As to each provision?  As 

to each bit of -- why? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Because that's the mandate 

of section 2.  The arbitrator derives his authority --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But suppose you and your --

your client -- rather, your client and the other side have 

absolutely agreed, clear as could be, under the 

arbitration agreement:  We want arbitrated too whether

MR. SILVERBERG:  Your Honor, the parties are 

-- don't necessarily have to take every issue to court, 

but should a party challenge that issue as 

unconscionable, that door should remain open. 

This case is not so much -- it is about our 

case here, but there’s a bigger picture here. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Let me say it more 

easily.  We have agreement number one, four pages, and 

within it is a question of -- which just looks like this 

one.  Agreement number two:  The two parties agree that 

if any dispute should arise as to whether any words in 

agreement number one are unconscionable, they will go to 

the arbitrator.  Agreement number two is concededly 

valid.  Now do you want to say that agreement number 

one -- those words have to be decided by the court? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Your Honor, it is our 

position that -- that the threshold determination as to 

the validity of the contract --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right, but if you’re going 

to say yes --

MR. SILVERBERG:  -- would go the court. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- then I think if you’re going 

to say yes to that, then it’s contrary to First Options, I think. 

I'm not sure, but I don't see why not.

MR. SILVERBERG:  Well, Your Honor, I think 

that what Your Honor is describing is the first part of 

First Options that looked -- and that's what the 

Petitioner would like to rely on, is objective contract 

language.  But then the Court adds the entire other 

section which says we don't presume that parties intend 

to arbitrate certain matters and -- because we’re not 

yet at that scope -- but we want clear and unmistakable 

language, not just objective language in the contract. 

And there's an important reason for that, 

because it's impossible to draw the line.  You’re 

carving out certain issues of unconscionability --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  After this --

MR. SILVERBERG:  -- saying both --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  After this suit was filed 

and both parties are going up the steps to the court, 

could the attorneys and the parties stop and say let's 

arbitrate this issue of unconscionability and pick an 

arbitrator?  Could they do that? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  They -- I think the answer 

there would be yes, but the door needs to be open in 

case there is a challenge, Your Honor.  Certainly, 

nobody is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, then -- then the --

MR. SILVERBERG:  -- required to go to court.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then the employee loses. 

He says:  Oh, you have to have an open door; this was --

this was not properly before the arbitrator. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  I think if Your Honor is 

asking --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because, you see, if 

you say yes, that they can arbitrate this, then the 

question is why can't they do it when the contract's 

signed? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Again, Your Honor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let's assume that the 

answer to my question is yes, they can put that to an 

arbitrator.  If that's so, how can you prevail in this 

case if the agreement clearly comprehends submission of 

this issue to the arbitrator? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Well, we don't concede that 

it clearly does that.  We -- what our position is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm -- I'm asking, assume 

you do? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  I don't think that gets us 

around the requirements of section 2, Your Honor, that 

says the court and the doors to the court must always 

remain open for that.

question. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Silverberg, the 

section 2 on which you place much emphasis just says 

that agreements are enforceable save on such grounds as 

exist in law or equity for revocation of a contract. 

But the section 2 doesn't say any -- anything about who 

decides that question. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  That's true, Your Honor, 

the -- but the logical reading of that statute would 

indicate that these three elements -- a writing, in 

interstate commerce, and not revocable at law and 

equity -- would have to be met before the arbitrator has 

any authority to do anything. 

And as Your Honor mentioned in the -- in the 

Doctor's Associates case, there are certain issues that 

are certainly involved, and unconscionability is one of 

those issues that can be presented to the court without 

violating section 2, as well as fraud and duress, I 

believe, were the other ones that the Court had -- had 

delineated in that case. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I read your -- I promise 

you I’ll go back to First Options, which I thought was 

of gem-like clarity --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And I am apparently the

MR. SILVERBERG:  That's because it was well 

argued. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- the only one in the 

world who thinks that.  And I’ll go back to --

Didn't you write that opinion?

MR. SILVERBERG:  Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- it seemed to me you 

said here that -- that because of your -- your position, 

your client's position, that the whole thing is 

unconscionable.  You didn't say that? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Well, we said that -- it 

was certainly my position that the entire agreement was 

unconscionable based on Nevada law --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  And that it was so 

incredibly one-sided, and also the limited discovery 

provisions, and also because, frankly, we are not

looking to treat this anything other than like we would 

ordinary contract law that also strikes one-sided 

provisions in -- for example, in Nevada, the Fick case, 

which would strike down a one-sided prenuptial 

agreement, or lease agreements that have one-sided 

attorney fee provisions are routinely struck down as 

one-sided.  So their position --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But which is the stronger 

case for arbitration?  Case one, you attack the 

arbitration clause only, part of the arbitration 

contract only, as being unconscionable.  Case two, you 

attack the whole agreement as being unconscionable.  Do 

those both stand on the same footing, or is one a 

stronger case for submission to the court than the 

other? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  I think this Court has made 

clear in the severability cases that challenges to the 

contract as a whole would go to the arbitrator to 

decide.  We have here, as Petitioner admits to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I find that somewhat 

paradoxical, but I -- I agree that that -- that that's 

the law. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  So the stronger one would 

be an -- as this case, which we believe is very 

strong, an attack --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So if you do go to the 

State court, suppose the State court says:  I can't 

really decide this question about the one clause unless 

I determine the conscionability or the unconscionability 

of the entire contract, and I now proceed to do that. 

Do you have to wait and say:  Stop, you 

can't do that? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  I think that’s what 

sections 3 and 4 contemplate, is for -- and they have 

been in existence since the passage of the Act -- for 

parties to come in and make their case as to whether or 

not the FAA would apply or not apply. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But suppose the State 

court judge says that he has to look at the whole 

contract.  Do you say:  Oh, I'm sorry to bother you; we 

have to go back to the arbitrator now? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  That's not the situation in 

this case, but assuming it were --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's your -- no, it's a 

hypothetical case. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  I understand. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What would your position 

be in the hypothetical case, representing your client?

is Mr. Jackson, I would want the court to look at the

whole thing, but if I were in the Petitioner's shoes I 

think I would have an argument that, based on this 

Court's precedent --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And what do you think the 

judge should decide as between those two possibilities? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  If it's an attack on the 

contract as a whole, it should go to the arbitrator.  I 

think that's clear from many of the Court's cases; 

whereas, if the attack is to the arbitration clause 

itself, that is something for the court to decide and 

determine. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I think I heard 

Justice Kennedy's question to be -- let's not confuse 

the contract as a whole.  There’s only one contract 

here. 

arbitrate. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's an agreement to 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So an attack on the --

as I think Justice Breyer noted, you -- an argument that 

it's one-sided goes to the entire arbitration agreement. 

I don't want to arbitrate because that's not what I 

chose to do freely.  Correct? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Correct.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That, you say, is for 

the court. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The difference here is 

that there are provisions within how the arbitration is 

going to be held that, standing alone, you think are 

unconscionable, even though the agreement to arbitrate 

is not.  Am I correct in understanding your allegation? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  No, Your Honor. 

Respectfully, it’s our position that both are present. 

There are certain elements of the arbitration agreement 

that are unconscionable and, under Nevada law, which 

would render the entire arbitration agreement 

unconscionable. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You see, that's what I'm 

confused by, because when I first asked you this 

question, you said:  I would be happy to arbitrate if 

the court struck the discovery provision and, I guess, 

the fees provision.  Which answer are you giving me? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  I’m giving you the one I 

just gave you, I think, Your Honor, which is we’ve got 

both certain provisions that are unconscionable, that 

under Nevada law render the entire agreement 

unconscionable --

MR. SILVERBERG: -- and that's what the Court 

is to rely on. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.  That -- now I 

understand that part of your argument.  But let's assume 

that that wasn't Nevada law, that Nevada law would say 

severability works, and there is an agreement to arbitrate, 

and all we have to or could do is strike the unfair provisions. 

Let's assume that situation.  Who decides 

whether to strike the unfair provisions? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  That would be the court 

under our position, Your Honor, and that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, that can't be 

right.  The -- how can you say there's no problem 

agreeing to arbitrate, no imbalance in bargaining 

authority whatever, but then say, oh, but these 

procedures are unconscionable? 

It seems to me that the procedures are 

there, and the party, the employee, whatever, can look 

at those.  And if he says, well, that's unconscionable, 

you don't sign the agreement as a whole.  But once you 

are -- in for a penny, in for a pound.  If you agree to 

arbitrate, then it's at least for the arbitrator to 

decide particular provisions, whether they’re 

unconscionable.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know you’re 

arguing in the alternative.  But the one argument that 

we get to pick out the provisions we don't like and say 

those are unconscionable, but the agreement as a whole 

is not -- that seems to me illogical. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Your Honor, that is our 

position.  I hope I am understanding your question.  But 

this is a matter of State law as to which provisions 

would render the entire agreement unconscionable.  And I 

think that body of unconscionability law is not so 

varied that we would have unwieldy results.  I think 

State --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's a matter 

-- it may be a matter of State law, but the open 

question is who gets to decide it. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Right, and our --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Arbitrators decide 

matters of State law all the time. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Certainly, they do. 

Certainly, they do.  But before they have that authority 

to even do that, the requirements, again, of section 2 

have to be met.  And that is our position in this 

matter.  That’s --

says you cannot -- you cannot fire somebody for coming

in late to work any fewer than 10 times, all right? 

And an individual is fired.  He goes to arbitration, or 

at least the company tries to take him to arbitration on 

it.  And he says, no, because I was fired in violation 

of Nevada law. 

Now, is it your position that that -- that 

that case would have to go immediately to court and 

could not submit to the arbitrator the issue of whether 

indeed he was fired for coming less than 10 times, and 

indeed whether if he was coming in less than 10 times, 

that would be an invalid basis for a dismissal? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  No, Your Honor, and here's 

why:  I think Your Honor has described a situation 

similar to -- I believe that was the Green Tree 

situation, where there was an allegation that the entire 

contract was illegal, the usurious contract.  But there 

was no question as to the making of the agreement to 

arbitrate. 

So, in Your Honor's hypothetical, if there is 

no dispute as to the arbitration agreement being subject 

to a ground of revocation at law or at equity as 

defined in section 2, then I would -- I would concede 

that that was something that would go to the arbitrator, 

Your Honor.

seems to be that unconscionability is the same as 

coercion in the making of the agreement.  And I don't 

know that that's true. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Well, Your Honor, 

respectfully, in Doctor's Associates, I think the Court 

spoke very clearly that fraud, duress, and 

unconscionability are there and are part of something 

that can be raised under section 2.  And also the 

Court's hold in Prima Paint --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I don't care what we --

MR. SILVERBERG:  -- where fraud --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don’t care what we said in 

dictum.  It doesn't seem to me that unconscionability is 

the same as duress or the same as fraud --

MR. SILVERBERG:  To -- oh, I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that you can -- you can 

be a stupid person who voluntarily signs an unconscionable 

contract.  Now, the courts may protect you because you’re 

stupid, but you haven't been coerced.  Is there no 

distinction between unconscionability and coercion? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Not under section 2, Your 

Honor.  I think the -- the definition that the 

Petitioner would have this Court adopt, that narrow view 

of making -- again, something Justice Sotomayor 

brought up -- would create a rule where certain

unconscionability challenges went to the court --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is that? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  -- and other 

unconscionability challenges didn't go to the court. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is that?  I would say 

all unconscionability challenges, if you have an agreement 

that’s as clear as this one, would go to the arbitrator. 

Which ones would have to go to the court? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  All of them should go to 

the court, Your Honor, based on this Court's holding 

both in Doctor's Associates and Prima Paint, in that 

both fraud in the inducement, like in Prima Paint, and 

unconscionability envision a situation where you’ve 

got a formed contract that people can choose to opt out 

of.  I may be subject to a contract that was induced by 

fraud, but I may like the benefit of that bargain.  So I 

may be able to go ahead with that. 

And same with an unconscionability challenge. 

We’ve got an agreement that was made that -- that the 

innocent party can decide to opt out of.  And I think 

that’s very consistent with this Court's holding and 

with what the various State courts have been doing in 

reliance on those holdings.

about that argument.  I’d like to know what really 

is the underlying, which I’ve never looked up. 

What is the underlying rationale in contract 

law of setting aside contracts as unconscionable?  Why 

do courts do it?  What's the theory?  I’d like to 

know that. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  My understanding is that 

it's so unfair that it couldn't really be said that a 

party assented to -- to that.  And I think that's what --

JUSTICE BREYER:  See, that's what I wonder, 

that last part -- is it that the basic theory is we want to 

protect a group of people by -- who voluntarily entered 

into contracts by giving them the right to opt out, or is 

is that we don't think that they really meant to do it? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  It's the latter, Your 

Honor.  I think if they really chose to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  On that 

question, or any other question, is, I would imagine, 

where we have agreement one, and the argument is maybe 

agreement one was unconscionable.  And then we enter 

into agreement two, and the parties in agreement two 

agree to -- to arbitrate their unconscionability dispute 

in agreement one, and there’s nothing wrong with 

agreement two, I would think that's then the question of 

unconscionability is for the arbitrator.

why I asked the question.

unequal bargaining power, where people are presented

clauses but not in its -- in its entirety?

MR. SILVERBERG:  I believe so, Your Honor. 

I think in Nevada you would -- if we had maybe just one 

unconscionable clause, that the court might sever and 

send the rest to the -- and validate the rest of the 

arbitration agreement.  But then when -- certain -- any 

number of clauses, depending on State law, would make 

the entire agreement to arbitrate unconscionable. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does it make a 

difference in response to Justice Stevens's hypothetical 

that there is a provision saying the arbitrator will 

decide the conscionability of all clauses?  The 

arbitrator may decide that clauses 2 and 8 are 

unconscionable, but if there’s an agreement and it's 

not unconscionable that the arbitrator will decide, then 

the arbitrator decides all of them, right? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  If the agreement -- I think 

I understand your question.  If the agreement to 

arbitrate itself is not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  -- there’s no 

unconscionability challenge to that, and there’s no 

other fraud in the inducement or any other thing that 

the court has mentioned it would go to the broader view 

of making the grounds for revocation, if those grounds 

for revocation are not present, then I believe the

arbitrator would be empowered to make those decisions, 

Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can I ask you just a 

follow-up on Justice Breyer's hypothetical to you where 

he had the first agreement and then the issue to the 

second?  You said you’ve got to leave the door open. 

The door open on the second agreement or on the first 

agreement? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  I think the door should be 

open on all the agreements, because until that door is 

open under section 2 -- as long as that door is open 

under section 2, then we don't have the concern about 

parties making the terms of arbitration so onerous or 

burdensome that they would not be able to even access the 

arbitral forum.  And that's really a huge concern in --

in not just in this case, but in the bigger picture. 

Courts must remain open to protect people. 

I would venture to say that there are many 

people in this room who are subject to arbitration 

agreements, and they don't even know, through --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Silverberg --

MR. SILVERBERG:  Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBERG:  -- on that, underlying 

your whole case I think is the notion that this is an 

adhesion contract; it's a take-it-or-leave-it contract,

very common in consumer, credit card agreements, in 

employment contracts, that one party has no say except 

to sign or not to sign.  Are all those contracts subject 

to the unconscionability argument that you’re making or 

only some of them?  And if only some, which ones? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  I would suggest, Your 

Honor, that they all are subject to that.  And then we 

look to State law to determine, whether, for example, in 

Nevada if you’ve great procedural unconscionability 

they have the sliding scale approach based on the D.R. 

Horton case, which we have briefed, where you would 

require less of a showing of substantive 

unconscionability. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not much use signing an 

arbitration agreement then, not much use for the employer. 

He’s going to end up in court anyway.  Every one of them 

will be acknowledge as unconscionable.  So what’s the 

use? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, kiss good-bye to 

arbitration. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  Not at all, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No?

advocating the status quo be maintained here, Your Honor, 

and there is no reason to suggest that there will be some 

rush to court on this.  Courts are quite capable to do this 

in a summary fashion. 

If a party comes before the court with a 

baseless unconscionability challenge, I would imagine 

not only will the court dispose of it quickly, but if an 

attorney makes a routine practice of bringing baseless 

motions to the court, he’ll have his own issues to 

deal with.  So, I don't -- I -- I disagree that there 

will be some floodgates or that this will in any way --

to the contrary --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The amici certainly claim 

the contrary.  The Chamber of Commerce claims that this 

is what’s happening and that it has been a snowballing 

effect. 

MR. SILVERBERG:  We disagree with them and 

Your Honor, and I would cite that we have some of the 

most prestigious arbitrators in this country that have 

joined our position and recognized the courts' vital role 

in maintaining the fairness of the arbitration process 

so the public can trust it and so the weaker parties to 

these agreements can be protected, because should that 

disappear, there will be nothing to stop stronger 

parties from again sending Mr. Jackson, who lives in

Reno, to Minnesota to arbitrate his claim. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, this --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  There --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This clause is not of that 

kind, and you’ve singled out three things that made it 

unconscionable.  One, the fee provision, the splitting 

fees, that the court rejected.  So the only two left is 

the one-sided aspect of it and the limited discovery. 

It seemed to me that the limited discovery 

clause, that that was quite common to say we’re not --

we don't want to get involved in the massive discovery 

you can get in a -- in a civil proceeding.  Is there 

something unusual about limiting discovery to documents? 

MR. SILVERBERG:  There -- there is something 

unusual.  They’ve gone well beyond the AAA and limited 

discovery to one deposition and one expert, which in an 

employment case is very difficult. 

Thank you, Your Honor.

Justice Scalia, I’m hearing my colleague state that 

there is concern that the arbitrator is not going to 

apply State law. 

This is merely distrust of arbitrators. 

This Court has rejected this bias that arbitrators cannot 

make these decisions.  And, in fact, this Court and many 

others have sent very, very complicated issues to the 

arbitrator to decide.  There is no reason to believe that 

an arbitrator, as well as a judge, cannot decide State 

law issues of unconscionability, and the arbitrator will 

have the discretion and the ability to either strike the 

entire arbitration agreement or strike certain clauses 

as he or she sees fit. 

Furthermore, this type of speculation, this 

fear as to what the arbitrator may do, that was rejected 

in this Court's decisions in Vimar and PacifiCare, where 

the Court stated we are going to enforce this, and the 

arbitrator may do something wrong, may do something 

right, but at the tail end there will be an ability 

under section 10 to address it.  There is no difference 

there. 

Additionally, this -- this analysis of 

unconscionability -- I want to reiterate 

unconscionability is based on a policy decision that --

that attacks an agreement that unquestionably has

already been made. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  What is the 

one-sentence answer, one sentence, to the thing, this is 

a very interesting case, lots of stuff in it that we 

needn't reach because irrespective of everything else, 

they in their reply, the district court, and the court 

of appeals all said these whole four pages, the whole 

four pages were unconscionable, so none of it’s 

enforceable, and all we have to decide is whether that's 

an issue for the court.  And the answer to that 

being not an issue for the court is what, in a sentence or 

two? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Justice Breyer, I'm sorry. 

I’m going to ask you to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  They said, look, there’s a 

four-page document.  They said this four-page document 

is unconscionable, the product of unconscionability, and, 

therefore, don't enforce it.  That's their claim.  That 

issue is at least is for the court, because there is no 

valid agreement here at all, if that's right. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  No, Justice Breyer, the 

determination of unconscionability is for the 

arbitrator.  The -- the limited role of the court goes 

only to the making, not to the issue of 

unconscionability.  So the court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem -- I -- I 

keep going back to my initial question to you, is you 

want to parse out what making is from unconscionability, 

and you want us to say, well, if it's too onerous a fee 

for arbitration, that goes to the making, because you’re 

depriving the party of -- of an arbitration forum. 

If it's discovery, that doesn't go to depriving them 

of anything because the arbitrator could give them more 

discovery if he or she chose.  Am I correct, this is 

your argument? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  No, Justice Sotomayor, our 

argument about the onerous fee -- and it would have to 

be evidence put in by the party opposing counsel -- by 

the party opposing arbitration, that there was an actual 

barrier, an impossibly burdensome barrier.  So it does not 

come under making; it would be under a -- a Randolph 

standard or under a First Options standard. 

There’s two areas that we agree are for the 

court.  One is to determine whether or not there’s an 

issue with the making of the agreement.  The other one, 

if it's challenged, is to determine whether or not there 

is indeed access to arbitration. 

The First Circuit in Awuah applied this test 

very neatly in a very reasonable manner and applied both 

First Options and Randolph, harmonized those cases, and

made a determination that unconscionability is for the 

arbitrator based on a clear and unmistakable delegation. 

But issues as to whether or not --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  If there’s no access to 

arbitration, there’s no way that you can leave that 

issue to the arbitrator, is there? 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Exactly, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because you never get to 

the arbitrator. 

MR. FRIEDMAN:  Exactly, Justice Scalia.  It 

fails the First Options test.  There can't be an ability 

under First Options for the arbitrator to make a 

decision if there’s no access to the arbitrator.  So 

those are the two tests.  In -- in this case, what I 

think I’m hearing is my colleague is saying that the 

arbitrator can decide nothing; the arbitrator should 

decide nothing, notwithstanding this Court's regular 

holdings sending very, very complicated matters to the 

arbitrator.  In this case, the arbitrator can absolutely 

decide these issues of unconscionability as well as a 

judge can. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Friedman, Mr. Silverberg.
