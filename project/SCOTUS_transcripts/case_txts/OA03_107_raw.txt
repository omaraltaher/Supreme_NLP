CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 03-107, the United States v. Billy Jo Lara.


Mr. Kneedler.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


14 years ago in the Duro decision this Court


held that under the state of Indian law, as it then stood,


and Indian tribe could not prosecute an Indian who was not


a member of that tribe.  The Court recognized, though,


that its decision might create a jurisdictional gap on


many reservations, but the Court concluded that if the


present jurisdictional regime proves insufficient to meet


the needs of reservation law enforcement, the proper body


to address that concern is Congress, which has plenary


power over Indian affairs.


Congress responded immediately to this Court's


decision.  It -- it conducted an extensive inquiry and


heard hearings about the consequences of the Court's


decision and heard strong expressions of concern by many


Indian tribes, by the Federal Government, and by numerous


States about the law enforcement vacuum that would be

created over many misdemeanor offenses on Indian


reservations.  And there was widespread support for


Congress to restore the power to Indian tribes to exercise


their sovereign power to prosecute non-member Indians.


QUESTION:  Why didn't -- why didn't they extend


it to non-Indians?  I mean, if it's a problem when a -- a


non-member Indian commits an offense on an Indian


reservation, why isn't it an equivalent problem when a --


a white man commits the same crime on an Indian


reservation?


MR. KNEEDLER:  I think the answer lies in -- in


the longstanding jurisdictional regime on Indian


reservations.  Going back to 1817, the general Indian


crimes statute has authorized prosecutions by the Federal


Government over crimes committed by non-Indians, including


misdemeanor crimes, and so there was not a jurisdictional


void.  The difficulty came -- the -- the most acute


difficulty came from the fact that that statute, again


since the earliest times, had -- has exempted crimes


committed by one Indian against the person or property of


another.


QUESTION:  Well, why couldn't they have changed


that?  They could have solved the problem by simply


treating non-member Indians the same way they treat non-


Indians.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Congress could have done so, but


Congress, with the plenary power over Indian affairs,


chose -- decided that the proper course or the most


appropriate course was to have that jurisdiction exercised


by the Indian tribes.  And Congress heard considerable --


considerable evidence that that power had long, in fact,


been exercised by Indian tribes over other Indians who


were not members of the particular tribe.


QUESTION:  What's --


QUESTION:  There's some ambiguity about what


Indian refers to.  Is it -- must it be someone who is


enrolled in an Indian tribe or can it be anyone who is the


child of Indian parents?


MR. KNEEDLER:  It -- generally, it has been


understood to require a tribal affiliation.  First of all,


the definition under -- under the Indian Civil Rights Act


for tribal power, Congress adopted the same meaning of


Indian that is applied under the Federal criminal statutes


for the purpose of having the two mesh completely.


QUESTION:  Yes, but what is that?  What is that


definition?


MR. KNEEDLER:  And under that, obviously,


someone who is an enrolled -- formally enrolled member


would be an Indian, but as this Court pointed out in


footnote 7 of its Antelope decision, the -- that provision

has not been construed to require that strictly, that


ordinarily someone who is an Indian and has a tribal


affiliation and is recognized by the tribe is also


regarded as an Indian.


In this case, though, we have a situation where


someone who is an enrolled member of another tribe.  So


questions about the -- about the -- how the statute should


be construed or applied in situations where there's not


one -- someone who's formally a member are -- are not


present in this case.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, is it the case that the


Bill of Rights is -- has not been thought applicable to


criminal defendants who are members of the tribe in a


tribal court or to non-tribal Indian -- non-tribal member


Indians?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  Under this Court's


decision, this --


QUESTION:  In -- in tribal court.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  This Court's decision in


Talton v. Mayes said that the Fifth Amendment did not


apply to the exercise of powers by Indian tribes, and


that's been understood to apply to --


QUESTION:  Would that be perhaps one reason why


Congress didn't go ahead and subject non-Indians to tribal


prosecution?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it -- it may be, but -- but


it's important to recognize what -- what Congress has also


done here was to enact the Indian Civil Rights Act which


extends to Indian tribes many of the requirements of the


Bill of Rights.


QUESTION:  But not all.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Not all of them, but Congress in


1968 examined the question of the -- of the rights of --


of Indians and others subject to tribal jurisdiction and


-- and applied the -- the provisions of the -- of the


Indian Civil Rights Act.  So there -- the -- the --


QUESTION:  Should we consider in this case the


due process and equal protection arguments that are --


MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't -- I don't believe they


are before the Court.  What was before the -- those --


those questions go to what restraints are on the tribe


itself when it's exercising its own power.  That was not


the basis of the court of appeals decision in this case. 


The court of appeals decision was really on the separate


ground of what happens when you have, first, the tribe


exercising its sovereign power and then the United States


exercising power after that under the Double Jeopardy


Clause. 


QUESTION:  Well, I suppose under one view of the


case -- and it's -- it's not your view -- if this were

deemed to be a delegated power, then the absence or the --


the presence of obligations under the Bill of Rights would


become very important. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I -- it depends what one


means by delegation.  The word delegation is -- is used in


a variety of ways.  I mean, for -- for example, it's


common to speak of Congress delegating power to an


executive agency to carry out a certain function, but when


the executive agency does this, it's not exercising


congressional power.  It's exercising power that Congress


in its plenary authority has -- has conferred on the


executive branch to --


QUESTION:  But -- but it --


MR. KNEEDLER:  -- to then execute those laws.


QUESTION:  But it is exercising the power of the


United States as distinct from the power of some other


sovereign.  And -- and the issue in this case is whether


the -- as I understand it, is -- is whether the tribe is


exercising its own power or the power of the United


States. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  I -- I was using that by


analogy to say that the word delegate is -- is often used,


including in this Court's opinions I think, in a -- in a


somewhat looser sense in terms of -- of authorizing


someone else to act.  But I think -- I think --

 QUESTION:  Well, if it's authorized --


exercising its own power, how then can Congress make the


Bill of Rights applicable.  As -- as a condition to the


exercise of sovereignty?  Is that the way it works?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  And that's -- I think


that's exactly what Congress did in the Indian Civil


Rights Act.  It -- it require -- and -- and this Court


said in Wheeler and has said in numerous other decisions


that Congress has plenary power over the exercise of a


tribe's own sovereign powers.  And what Congress did in


the Indian Civil Rights Act was precisely to regulate


that.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, may I raise the -- the


point that is -- is the greatest trouble for me so -- so


you perhaps could address that?  Because it follows from


what Justice Kennedy has raised. 


As I understand what we held -- forget our


language about delegation for a minute.  As I understand


what we held in Oliphant, which we followed in Duro, was


that the very concept of -- of this dependent or


subordinate sovereignty that tribes are -- are understood


to have, the way we look at Indian issues, is inconsistent


with the exercise of tribal jurisdiction over a -- a non-


member.  Whether that notion of subordinate or -- or


dependent sovereignty is constitutional or common law

doesn't really matter.  As long as we're going to have


that concept, that concept is inconsistent with the


exercise of the tribe's own sovereign jurisdiction over a


-- a non-tribal member.


If we are going to stick with that concept then,


it seems to me that we have got to understand the statute


in question here as a statute that confers Federal power


on the tribe as distinct from one that restores the


tribe's sovereign power because the tribe can't have the


sovereign power as long as we are going to understand that


tribe to have this subordinate sovereignty.  And


therefore, for me the concepts that we're using pretty


much force the conclusion that the -- that the power


that's being exercised is Federal not Indian. 


Could you comment on -- on that analysis? 


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  I -- I think there -- there


are several responses to that point. 


First of all, I think it matters a lot whether


one views the limitations on tribal power as mandated by


the Constitution or as a product of Federal common law. 


And in -- and --


QUESTION:  Well, it may have a great deal to do


with whether we can change our conceptualization about


dependent sovereignty, but as long as we keep that


conceptualization, it seems to me we've got to accept the

conclusion that -- that I suggested.


MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  I -- I -- with respect, I


don't think that's correct because I think if it -- if it


is not -- if this conception is not constitutionally


mandated, then Congress has the authority, the plenary


authority, over Indian affairs to regulate, to modify


tribal jurisdiction.  And -- and in fact, I think that --


that --


QUESTION:  Okay, but if it does so, we have to


accept the -- if we're going to follow that route, we will


have to accept the conclusion that the whole concept of


dependent sovereignty has -- has been modified in -- in


some way because you can't have it both ways.


MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  I -- I believe that's --


that's an expression of the dependency or a manifestation


of the dependency, not in derogation of it, because


dependent means that your ability to exercise authority --


in this case, the Indian tribe is always subject to the


overriding powers of the Federal Government.  And what


this Court said precisely in the --


QUESTION:  Well, if that -- if that were all we


meant in Oliphant, we would have said the -- the Federal


Government could take away this power by statute.  We


didn't say the Federal Government could take away the


power by statute.  We said it is gone by virtue of the --

the sovereignty relationship. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  But it -- if -- if one looks back


at the Oliphant decision, what the Court there described


its -- its undertaking was was essentially a -- a -- an


articulation of what it called Indian law which is a -- a


combination of judge-made law but against the backdrop of


treaties and statutes.  Those treaties and statutes are


not themselves embodying constitutionally mandated rules. 


They are the product of the political branches.  They


sometimes don't answer precise questions, and this Court


is required to articulate judicial principles as best it


can against the backdrop of those principles.  But because


those principles themselves are traced to treaties and


statutes, it must be up to -- Congress must have the


authority to modify those rules, and that's consistent


with its plenary power over Indian affairs.


What this Court said in the Montana decision,


which -- which has been identified as the path-marking


decision over -- concerning jurisdiction over non-tribal


members, was what tribes lost by virtue of their dependent


status was the power independently to determine their


external relations. 


This is not what we have here --


QUESTION:  Well, isn't -- isn't that what we're


talking about --

 MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  No, it isn't --


QUESTION:  -- when we talk about sovereign


power?


MR. KNEEDLER:  This is not a unilateral


assertion of tribal power.  This Court held in -- in


Oliphant and Duro, by looking at the -- at the backdrop of


-- of statutory enactments, that its power had been


limited, but -- and the tribe did not unilaterally


overcome that.  What Congress did was lift the limits so


that the tribe -- the tribe would then be authorized to


exercise sovereign power that it previously had -- had


had. 


And it's in that -- it's directly analogous to


two important examples that I think are very instructive


here.  One is that Constitution itself in the Commerce


Clause has been held to, of its own force, preempt State


laws in the interstate commerce and also in the Indian


Commerce Clause area.  But Congress can, in the exercise


of its authority over commerce under either one, lift


those restrictions and authorize States to regulate in


areas they otherwise could not do.


QUESTION:  And that has always been thought to


be a great anomaly that a constitutional requirement could


be eliminated by a Federal statute.  I -- I hope you're


not urging that as -- as a rule which should be followed.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  No, but -- but the point is that


in that situation, even when the Constitution itself has,


as a matter of constitutional law, limited State


authority, Congress can lift that. 


The other -- the other example --


QUESTION:  Well, let's -- let's apply that


across the board then.  I guess Congress can lift the


Fifth Amendment?


MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  It's --


QUESTION:  Clearly you're not going to urge --


MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  It's --


QUESTION:  Congress can lift the Double Jeopardy


Clause? 


MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  I'm -- I'm not speaking of


Bill -- Bill of Rights provisions.  I'm speaking of


Congress' Article I power.


QUESTION:  There's -- there's a distinction


between the Bill of Rights and the rest of the


Constitution. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, under -- under this Court's


decision -- decisions, Congress has been authorized to


allow States to regulate in areas it -- it would otherwise


not be able to, and when it does so, it's exercising its


own sovereign power, not power delegated by the Federal


Government.

 The other -- the other instructive example is


Public Law 280.  Since the outset of the Constitution,


really by the -- by carrying forward arrangements of -- in


Indian law prior to the adoption of the Constitution,


States have not been able to exercise jurisdiction over


matters involving Indians in Indian country absent an


affirmative authorization by Congress.  In Public Law 280


Congress lifted those limitations and authorized tribes to


exercise jurisdiction over Indians and others in Indian


country.


QUESTION:  Authorized States.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Pardon me?


QUESTION:  Authorized States. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  Excuse me.  Authorized States. 


And in doing so, those States are not exercising


delegated Federal power.  Congress lifted a barrier to the


exercise by States of their own sovereign power to


prosecute according to their laws.


QUESTION:  So in saying that, what you're doing


-- is what you're doing taking the word dependent in


domestic dependent nation and saying that Congress has a


degree of leeway to define what is and what is not


encompassed by the word dependent so that if Congress


wants to, it can say that whereas previously an exercise


of pre-1650, your Indian jurisdiction, because they could

have, you know -- which was removed by the word dependent


is not removed --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- because Congress -- Congress can


redefine the term dependent? 


MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I agree with your result. 


I 

-- I think conceptually what I would say is dependent


defines the relationship between the tribe and the


National Government --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. KNEEDLER:  -- in this case Congress.  And --


and Congress in the -- in the exercise of its superior


sovereignty is -- is defining the contours of the


dependent sovereign's authority.  So it -- it is a


manifestation of the dependent relationship. 


QUESTION:  So when you look at Duro, it -- it


said that what it found the exercise of criminal


jurisdiction inconsistent with was the notion of


dependency in the phrase, domestic dependent nation.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  And --


QUESTION:  And -- and therefore -- and -- and


there -- so Congress has the authority to say no, at least


as to future, it is not inconsistent.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Is that right?

 QUESTION:  And -- and since this has nothing to


do with prior Indian tribal power but simply with


arrangements that Congress chooses to adopt, it


necessarily follows that Congress could provide that


anyone in this room, whether an Indian -- whether an


enrolled Indian or not, could be subjected to trial by a


-- a tribal court and then subjected to a second trial,


despite the Double Jeopardy Clause, by a court of the


United States.  Right?  Congress could provide that.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  I -- I think that's right. 


And --


QUESTION:  I -- I find it hard to think that


that's all that the Double Jeopardy Clause means.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the -- this Court held in


Wheeler that prosecution by an Indian tribe of a -- of a


member of the tribe in that situation, followed by a


prosecution by the Federal Government for what would --


the same conduct, was not the same offense because the


ultimate authority to prosecute derived from different


sources.  And we think the same --


QUESTION:  But derived from inherent tribal


authority, which had not been taken away.  What's


different here is that it had been taken away and was


given back, and it's hard to decide -- it's hard to


consider that inherent tribal authority, even though the

in Duro was original sovereignty that has continued


unlimited or unrestricted down to the present day.  In


other words, it -- it has been -- it has been allowed to


continue, and in that sense it's inherent in being --


QUESTION:  That provides a limitation.  That


provides a limitation to -- you know, to jurisdiction over


the -- over the tribal members, and that was a very


important limitation.  Now you're saying that limitation


doesn't exist.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I -- I --


QUESTION:  It doesn't matter what has been


allowed to -- to continue down to the present day. 


Congress can change all of that and permit jurisdiction


over non-tribal members and, it necessarily follows,


permit jurisdiction over non-Indians without violating the


Double Jeopardy Clause. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  If -- if we -- if we look at the


reality of the nature of the prosecutions here, this was a


prosecution brought by tribal officials in a tribally


constituted court enforcing provisions of tribal law, not


title 18, under a tribal constitution.  That --


QUESTION:  Are you saying that Congress could

require the trial of non-Indians before a -- an Indian


tribal court?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  I -- I believe the -- this


Court's decision in -- in Oliphant says so in several


respects.  What the Court -- in several locations.  What


the Court said in Oliphant is that the -- the tribes


necessarily lost their dependent -- excuse me -- by virtue


of their dependent status, lost their ability to prosecute


non-Indians except in a manner acceptable to Congress.  So


the -- the Court necessarily assumed that Congress could


revest this authority in the Indian tribes.


QUESTION:  This is maybe -- it's very


interesting.  Suppose -- I would think on your approach


then that the rights that the individual tribe gets is a


function of the Due Process Clause.  And -- and is there


any basis?  After all, Indian tribal members are persons


within the United States to whom the Due Process Clause is


applicable.  Imagine a tribe that does not give you


counsel in a criminal trial.  That could happen.  All


right?  Now, is there a basis under the Due Process Clause


for distinguishing between whether the defendant in such a


case is, A, a member of that tribe; B, a non-tribe member


but an Indian; C, a non-Indian?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, several things.  First of


all, the -- the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment

under this Court's decision in Talton probably would not


apply of its own force to the tribe.  But what does apply


is the Indian Civil Rights Act.  What -- Congress filled


that void by -- by -- as a statutory matter requiring that


certain rights be --


QUESTION:  Well, the statute isn't going to help


in terms of my question because I'm interested in


Congress' power.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  I -- I think --


QUESTION:  And -- and maybe we don't have to


reach that in this case.


MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I think --


QUESTION:  And maybe the answer to this case


makes no difference in respect to that.


MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I think -- I think in asking


a due process question, you might be asking -- a


procedural due process question, you might be asking an


equal protection type question. 


QUESTION:  I'm asking a question in respect to


right to counsel, for example. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  Right -- right to counsel is not


-- is not expressly guaranteed by the Indian Civil Rights


Act.  If there is a particular prosecution that is found


to violate fundamental fairness because of the absence of


counsel, the Indian Civil Rights Act would -- would

provide a vehicle for that argument. 


QUESTION:  Well, except -- except with respect


to the Indian Civil Rights Act, you can -- you can -- and


I think this solves due process problems.  You -- you can


assert the maxim of volenti non fit injuria.  You -- you


are not subject to -- to this kind of trial unless you


choose to be an enrolled member of the tribe.  You can


withdraw from that at any time.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  But to now extend the Government's


power to subject people to this kind of trial beyond


members of the -- of the tribe that -- that has the tribal


court to members of other tribes and, as you necessarily


acknowledge, even to non-Indians, that's a -- that's a


step I'm -- I'm not prepared to contemplate.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, with -- first of all, with


respect to members of tribes other than the prosecuting


tribe, Congress in the exercise of its plenary authority


over tribes we think certainly should have the power to


regulate the relationship among tribes, tribes with each


other, and relationships of tribes and their respective


members with each other.


QUESTION:  Well, would it --


MR. KNEEDLER:  That's what Congress has done


here.

 QUESTION:  Would it be a defense, say, to

MR. KNEEDLER:  No, it would not.  And that's --


that is another -- there -- there are really two different


questions.  One, can someone be subjected to the


jurisdiction of a court when he's not participating in the


-- in the process there?  And that happens all the time


when people are prosecuted in another jurisdiction.


There's a separate question of -- of what


procedural protections would be afforded in such a trial,


and that's where the Indian Civil Rights Act steps in.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, just to bring it back


to this case, as I understand it, there was no due process


or equal protection challenge by Mr. Lara.  He's


contesting the second proceeding.


MR. KNEEDLER:  That's -- that's correct.  In


fact, it's a necessary -- he has to accept the validity of


his -- of his prior prosecution and -- and leave it


standing in order to --


QUESTION:  Because if it's not valid, then he's


being prosecuted for the first time.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  That -- that's correct. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but all these questions are very


relevant to whether we should accept your -- or -- or the

Government's assertion of what Congress can do.  Those --


if -- if your -- your proposal raises all of these serious


constitutional questions, we're less inclined, it seems to


me, to adopt that proposal.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, there -- there's I think


another important point to be made about the nature of


Congress' powers in this area.  To say that an Indian


tribe could only prosecute a non-member -- a non-member


Indian through the exercise of delegated Federal power


would itself be a -- a substantial constitutional anomaly.


I think it's important to -- to consider the


scope of Congress' plenary powers within the framework of


the structure of the Constitution itself.  The --


QUESTION:  But -- but -- so -- so what you're


saying is that if the Court has very substantial concerns


over the Government's proposition that within the


territorial United States a non-constitutional entity can


be allowed to try a United States citizen, if we have


concerns about that, you're giving us no ability to draw a


line so that you can prevail in this case.  You are -- it


seems to me that you are conceding, by your last


statement, that if we rule in favor of your position, it


must necessarily apply to non-Indians.


MR. KNEEDLER:  No, I -- I --

proposition.


MR. KNEEDLER:  I did not -- I did not mean to


say -- to say that.  I mean, first of all, I think


Oliphant contemplates that.  What rights would attach is


-- is a separate question.


But I -- but I do think that there is a distinct


authority for Congress to regulate or to permit a tribe to


exercise jurisdiction over members of other tribes.  This


is a power that has historically been left to tribes by


the Federal statutory regime in Indian country since 1817


down to the present time.  There is still an exception --


QUESTION:  Yes, but that was before Indians were


citizens of the United States. 


MR. KNEEDLER:  But -- no.  That has continued up


to the present time.  There is still an exception in the


statutory regime for tribes to --


QUESTION:  Yes, but one wonders if you go beyond


members of the tribe itself to outsiders, whether that


distinction between citizens of the United States is


valid.


MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I believe it is.  In -- in


Duro itself, the Court said that citizenship does not


detract from Congress' plenary power over Indian affairs.


The -- the last point I wanted to make and then


I would like to reserve the --

 QUESTION:  But that was -- that was not in the

MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  Here we're talking about --


this case involves non-member Indians, and as I said, the


ability of Congress to regulate relationships between


tribes and -- and their members would seem to be at the


core of the power. 


And as this Court has said in its federalism


cases, it would be a -- a mixing of sovereignty to regard


the States as mere agents of the Federal Government.  They


are separate sovereigns, and we think the same is true --


QUESTION:  Yes, but they are also not dependent


sovereigns.


MR. KNEEDLER:  That's --


QUESTION:  I mean, there's an entirely different


conceptualization involved.


MR. KNEEDLER:  But again, in our -- in our view,


the dependency describes Congress' power to regulate and


limit and prescribe the rights available in tribal courts.


If I may reserve the balance of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Kneedler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDER F. REICHERT


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. REICHERT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:


When Congress amended the Indian Civil rights


Act in response to this Court's invitation in Duro,


Congress exceeded its power by overruling this -- this


Court's determination on the limits of tribal sovereignty. 


The tribal power that Congress can give and take away


cannot by definition be a sovereign power.  The tribal


court, acting without its own sovereign authority,


prosecuted Billy Jo Lara using this Federal authority, and


his subsequent Federal prosecution, therefore, double --


violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. 


QUESTION:  If we take your approach then in


trying to carry out what was the will of Congress, I think


we'd have to say that the first prosecution doesn't count


because the one thing is -- seems to me pretty clear from


this record, that Congress did not want to have a


situation where there was a delegation of Federal


authority.  The whole idea was that you would have the


Federal -- the possibility of the Federal prosecution and


the tribal prosecution.  I -- I think that it's -- it's


inescapably clear that that's what Congress wanted to do,


to preserve the possibility of a U.S. attorney


prosecution.


So if you're right, then I think making the --


the bottom line what would Congress do if it couldn't

accomplish what it set out to accomplish, one would say,


well, all bets are off and not adopt your position that


Congress chose to delegate Federal authority when it seems


to me pretty clear that it didn't. 


MR. REICHERT:  Your Honor, I believe that


Congress' intent was clear on two points.  The first point


was that they were attempting to restore tribal


sovereignty, which they cannot do by its definition.  But


they were also clearly trying to close a jurisdictional


gap, a jurisdictional loophole.


Under the Government's contention, the entire


statute should be thrown out and neither one of those


clear intents from Congress can be saved.  But under the


-- under what the Eighth Circuit did and under what I'm


asking this Court to do, the -- one of those intents can


be saved and that is --


QUESTION:  But you can't do that.  You can't --


you can't achieve the end by a means other than the means


which Congress provided to that end.  It did, indeed,


intend to close a gap, but the means which it selected to


close that gap was the reconferral -- the attempted


reconferral of inherent sovereignty upon the Indian


tribes.  There's no delegation language in that.  They


clearly chose the means to the end of -- of covering the


gap, the means of reconferring sovereignty.  And if that

is invalid, then the statute is invalid.  We -- we have no


power to transmogrify it into a -- a delegation when it


clearly is not that. 


MR. REICHERT:  And if this Court was to


determine that this is a -- that this is not a delegation


and that this Court determines that the statute cannot be


saved, then Mr. Lara still was prosecuted in the tribal


court.  He was still prosecuted under color of law.  He


served 90 days in the tribal jail on this offense, 155


days total. 


The tribal court believed it was acting


properly.  It was told by Congress.  Congress is the body


which tells the tribe what to do.


QUESTION:  Do you -- do you have authority for


the proposition that if you're tried by a court without


jurisdiction, it's nevertheless sufficient to invoke


double jeopardy, if we have to reach that here?  Do you


have authority for that or is that a novel proposition? 


MR. REICHERT:  I don't believe that it's novel. 


There is -- this Court has not ruled that a court without


jurisdiction can, therefore, subject some -- can subject


somebody to initial jeopardy in the double jeopardy sense.


But the Fifth Amendment clearly -- the Fifth


Amendment does not protect against dual investigations or


dual prosecutions.  It protects against dual punishment,

and Mr. Lara has been punished.  He served 90 days in

QUESTION:  What if -- what if he'd been


prosecuted in France and served 90 days there and then he


was tried here?  Would that be double jeopardy?


MR. REICHERT:  I don't believe so, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Well, and -- and furthermore, you


have a habeas remedy after the first -- after the first


trial to -- to object to the sentence.


Getting back to the -- to the point, why is it


-- let's assume for the moment -- it's just an assumption


-- that the -- that the tribes had as a historical matter


the sovereign authority to try non-member Indians and that


Congress took that away.  Could Congress then give it


back?


MR. REICHERT:  Congress can -- could always give


it back under a delegation.  Congress always has the power


to --


QUESTION:  Why -- why would it be a delegation? 


Why couldn't they say we -- we define the scope of Indian


sovereignty and we -- we ratchet it up and we ratchet it


down?


MR. REICHERT:  What Congress takes away and


Congress gives back is a power of Congress.  It can't be a


reaffirmation of a tribal sovereign power.  That which --

 QUESTION:  May -- may I interrupt you on that? 


Supposing they had a -- a procedure for electing their


chiefs and Congress said that's unfair to women or


something, so you can't do it anymore, and then 10 years


later just repealed the statute.  Would they then have


delegated the power to elect the chiefs the way they did


it for 100 years?


MR. REICHERT:  I think technically they would,


but in that situation it's -- it's not so important


whether they're using a delegated power or a sovereign


power because this case presents unique facts where


sovereignty becomes of paramount importance because of


this Court's adoption of the dual sovereignty doctrine. 


In many instances, Congress delegates authority and it --


the importance of whether it be a delegation or whether it


be a -- a re-recognition or a restoration of inherent


tribal sovereignty is not nearly as important.  And in


that case, I think it would be a delegation of Federal


power, but I don't think it would affect the election of


the tribal chairmen.


QUESTION:  Mr. Reichert --


QUESTION:  They could do it with Puerto Rico,


couldn't they? 

Sorry.  With Puerto Rico, can't Congress,


for example, define the sovereign relation between the


United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  I

would have thought it had considerable power there.  And


if it can do it there, why can't it do it here?


I mean, you could enter into a treaty changing


the nature of the sovereign power and the House of


Representatives and the Senate have basically taken to


themselves through statute the treaty-making authority. 


And so what's -- why is this any different from -- from


redefining the nature of the sovereign relationship


between, say, Guam, Puerto Rico, a whole -- you know,


those entities that are not States?


MR. REICHERT:  When Congress acts with -- as it


acts towards Puerto Rico, it can use its treaty powers and


not be conferring sovereign power on Puerto Rico.  And


Puerto Rico is considerably --


QUESTION:  Suppose it does.  Suppose it says the


commonwealth, which is a totally uncertain concept,


henceforth means A, B, C, D, and E.  All right?  Now --


now, whether that's wise or not wise I have no idea, but I


don't see anything in the Constitution that would stop


Congress from doing that.  And if there is nothing there,


why is there here where, in fact -- I don't want to repeat


myself.


But my understanding of this is that over the


years Congress has, through legislation -- or Congress has


changed the making of the treaty to define the

relationship into a situation where we define the


relationship with the Indian tribes through legislation. 


QUESTION:  What about Philippines? 


QUESTION:  At least I don't see why they --


QUESTION:  I assume we did precisely that with


the Philippines, and I -- I guess Justice Breyer is


suggesting that we can simply revoke Philippine


independence, which we -- which we graciously gave them,


and now, since it was all done through the treaty power,


we can just revoke it.


QUESTION:  But this is the opposite.  I suppose


we could --


MR. REICHERT:  To address that, Puerto Rico is


different than a State and Puerto Rico and States are very


different from tribes.  Tribes are dependent nations. 


They are a unique body within our constitutional


framework. 


And when Congress acts in relation to tribes,


they can act in a number of different ways.  In fact,


Congress can completely take away a tribe's sovereignty,


but it cannot restore that sovereignty once it's -- it has


taken it away.  The reason that this -- the reason that


this is --


QUESTION:  Can I just -- it seems to me that's a


critical part of the case where the -- supposing the tribe

had a -- a criminal statute and saying you cannot cut


trees above 5,000 feet on the mountains because that's


sacred land or something like that.  And Congress decided


they wanted to build a road up there, so they preempted


the -- the Indian statute and said we cannot enforce that


statute.  Then after they built the road, they decided,


well, they'd let them go back to the way they did, and


they said we repeal the preempting statute.  Now, would


that be a delegation of power to -- to protect those


religious grounds, or would that be just a restoration of


a preexisting sovereign power? 


MR. REICHERT:  I believe that that would be a


delegation of Congress' power.  Once it has taken


something away, it cannot give it back.  And powers which


are -- which are sovereign cannot be defined as sovereign


when --


QUESTION:  Where -- where do you get the


authority for that one-way ratcheting when we've said that


Congress has plenary power over the tribes?  What opinion


of this Court do you look to for that proposition?


MR. REICHERT:  I would look to Oliphant or to


United States v. Sioux Nation or the Alcea Band of the


Tillamook Tribe wherein this Court said Congress' plenary


power is not absolute.  Congress -- this Court has often


said Congress has plenary power, but that plenary power is

not absolute.  And one of the -- one of the most important


limitations on Congress' power with regard to Indian


tribes is that it must be subject to the limitations of


the Constitution. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  Mr. Reichert, may I interrupt


you there?  Because I -- I think -- I think there are two


different arguments in play in -- in what's going on here,


and I thought you had started out with one and now you


seem to be going to a different one.


One argument is Congress didn't take away this


power over -- the tribal power to -- to prosecute non-


tribal members.  There's no act of Congress that said they


can't do that.  The reason they can't do that is there's a


sovereignty relationship.  There's no act of Congress that


articulated that sovereignty relationship.  It's just the


way we understand things.  The tribes are dependent


sovereigns.


And on that theory -- that's where I -- I


thought you were coming from originally, and -- and on


that theory, Congress can't restore it because it can't


change that relationship, or at least it hasn't changed


that relationship of -- of dependent sovereignty.


A second way that -- that is being explored here


is -- is on the assumption that Congress by some act took


away the sovereignty to prosecute non-tribal members and

now wants to give it back.


I'm not sure what the answer should be in the


second case, but I thought your argument depended on the


first case or the first example.  Is -- is that correct?


MR. REICHERT:  The --


QUESTION:  In other words, it's -- it's the


sovereign relationship rather than an act of Congress that


takes away that is crucial for understanding the issue


here.


MR. REICHERT:  If I could just -- it's this


Court that said that that -- that recognized -- and its


role is to say what the law is -- looked at the dependent


nature of the Indian tribes and said this does not exist. 


This power to prosecute --


QUESTION:  We said that in Oliphant, among other


things.


MR. REICHERT:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  Yes, okay.


QUESTION:  So it's a power always to take away,


but never to give back that's --


MR. REICHERT:  Yes, but Congress can always give


back using their plenary power.  Congress can always


delegate powers back to the tribes.  It simply cannot make


sovereign that which is not.  That which is --


QUESTION:  But do we -- I'm sorry.

QUESTION:  What transformed the tribes from


independent sovereigns to dependent sovereigns was not a


decision of this Court and the act of Congress.  It was


the acts of the legislature and they took over a lot of


things that were previously independent sovereignty of the


tribes.  And if you go back a couple hundred years, they


clearly had their own inherent power to try non-members. 


Maybe they lost it in the change in the relationship


between the United States and the tribe, but that's not as


a result of an act of Congress or a decision of this


Court.  It's the result of historical events. 


MR. REICHERT:  It's a result, Your Honor, of


their accepting the dependent -- accepting the protection


and the benefits and the burdens of the United States. 


And that boils down to the essential question which is who


has the -- who has the final authority on what the limits


on inherent sovereignty are.  Is it this body or is it


Congress?  And --


QUESTION:  Essentially the trouble I have with


your case is that it depends on making a distinction


between the status of -- of Indian sovereignty which


hasn't yet been taken away but which exists totally the

whim of Congress.  And that, you say, is not -- is -- that


does not allow the Double Jeopardy Clause to be invoked


because -- I don't know what.  You call that sovereignty,


that dependent sovereignty?  But you say, however, if


Congress acts to take it away, then it can't give it back.


It seems to me in both cases whatever power the


Indian tribe has is power that exists at the pleasure of


the United States, and I don't know why in -- the one case


is any better than the other as far as the Double Jeopardy


Clause is concerned.  Whatever power they exercise, they


exercise because we let them exercise it.  Isn't that


right?


MR. REICHERT:  That's right, and --


QUESTION:  Well, why shouldn't the -- I mean, I


-- I -- if the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't apply in one


situation, it seems to me it shouldn't apply in the other.


MR. REICHERT:  And Billy Jo Lara was prosecuted


using Federal power, and that's -- and that's the premise. 


He -- when he was prosecuted by the tribe, he was


prosecuted using Federal power.  And then his subsequent


prosecution in the Federal court --


QUESTION:  Why -- why doesn't Gideon v.


Wainwright and all the other provisions of the Bill of


Rights apply? 


MR. REICHERT:  To Billy Jo Lara as a non-member

of the tribe?  I think that it should apply.


QUESTION:  To -- to any Indian tribal


prosecution of its own -- even of its own members.


MR. REICHERT:  Because this Court said in United


States v. Wheeler that the -- the member of a tribe has


accepted the benefits and the burdens of being a member of


that tribe, and one of the burdens is that the Bill of


Rights does not apply.  And at any time that tribal member


can decide to leave his or her tribe and no longer be a


member, no longer accept the benefits and no longer accept


the burdens, which is the fundamental unfairness of either


placing a non-Indian or a non-member Indian before a


tribal court which does not give that person their full


constitutional rights.


QUESTION:  So -- so the answer then to the due


process problem, which you've just given, is that the --


the member -- the tribal member, the non-tribal Indian,


and the non-Indian are all persons subject to the Due


Process Clause, but what counts is due process may vary


between whether you are a tribal member or not because of


the argument you just gave.  Now, if that's so, that


solves that problem. 


Then we're back to the question of why not allow


Congress to define sovereignty.  I thought Justice


Scalia's point was a very good point to mention the

Philippines.  If you reverse it, don't we have the


authority in the United States to give the Philippines


independence?  And if in fact, we get into the habit of


making that kind of decision through a congressional law,


why could we not do the same to the Indian tribes? 


And if there is a boundary there, it must have


to do with the nature of a Constitution of the United


States, not some language.  And I can't find anything here


that would suggest that in doing this, that boundary is


passed. 


argument? 


So what's -- what's the answer to that kind of


MR. REICHERT:  Your Honor, as I understand your


question, you're looking for where in the Constitution


Congress has the power or this -- or this body has the


power.


QUESTION:  To the contrary.  I'm saying


naturally Congress has the power to take, let's say,


something that is not a State -- it is like Puerto Rico or


the Philippines -- and to say we are changing the status


of that entity. 


Now, I would think you'd start from the


proposition that they do have the power to define the


relationship of entities that are not States to the United


States.  Now, if there is a limit on that, it must be

found either explicitly, which I can't find, or implicitly


in the nature of the constitutional document itself.  So I


am looking to you to tell me any kind of limit like that


which might prevent what Congress tried to do here.


MR. REICHERT:  Congress has specific enumerated


powers in the Constitution.  Nowhere in those specific


enumerated powers -- and the Government has pointed to no


specific enumerated powers that allows Congress to take


the action they did.


QUESTION:  I want to turn the question then. 


Which is the power that allowed us to give independence to


the Philippines?  Which is the power that allowed us to


pass the Federal Relations Act or the Commonwealth


Relations Act that defines the relationship with Puerto


Rico?  Which is the power -- where -- where are these


powers in the -- I'm not saying they're not there.  I'm


saying that I'm not an expert in this area and I -- I'd


like you to make this argument of where they are.


MR. REICHERT:  In the Treaty Clause.  And


Congress and the executive branch can have relations with


other nations through the Treaty Clause and can define


their relation. 


But this Court has said that dealings with the


tribe is more than treaties and more than statutes, that


it also depends on the relationship of the tribes to this

dependent nation.  And in giving their -- in -- in


accepting the protection of the United States, the tribes


accepted the burdens and necessarily gave up certain


aspects of their sovereignty.


QUESTION:  Now, my impression is that we used to


do this through treaty, but at some point the House of


Representatives was somewhat unhappy about not having a


role in this and therefore it became changed such that the


relationship with the Indian tribes is defined through


agreement ratified and enacted into law by both houses of


Congress.  Now, was that unconstitutional to do that?


MR. REICHERT:  I'm not sure that it was -- if it


was unconstitutional or not, but I don't think that's the


important distinction, Your Honor.  What the important


distinction is is where does this power to now deal with


Indian tribes and to -- what they're trying to do is


define sovereignty and take any role that this Court has


in defining sovereignty away.  Under the Government's


analysis --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I suppose that if this


Court said that the nature of sovereignty is such that it


has certain limits and that this is imposed because of the


Constitution and because of long use, perhaps Congress


couldn't change it.  But we haven't said that.


MR. REICHERT:  But Congress --

 QUESTION:  We have not said that.  Duro didn't


say that.  Duro said we'll look at the statute.  Congress


didn't give this power.  End of case.  That's all. 


Insofar as the territories, because that's under


Article IV of the Constitution, it has nothing to do with


this case. 


MR. REICHERT:  And Congress is already


attempting to -- with the Hicks fix to overrule Hicks,


Montana, and Oliphant.  And if this Court gives to


Congress all the powers that the Government is asking them


to --


QUESTION:  That may well be a different case


because then we're concerned with the powers of -- of


Indian tribes as a historical matter of their sovereignty


over citizens of the United States who have direct


relations, responsibilities, obligations, and rights both


with their States and with the National Government, and


under the insular cases, the Constitution applies with


full force to the territory of the United States.  So


that's a very different -- that's a very different case.


MR. REICHERT:  But Mr. Lara owes no allegiance


whatsoever to the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe.  He's a member


of a different tribe.  Using -- he is a citizen of the


United States just like any other Indian.  He receives no


benefits from the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe.

 QUESTION:  Then you're making a -- then you're


making a constitutional argument and it's an appropriate


argument.  But I -- I don't think it follows from that


that within the realm where Congress does have authority,


i.e., the relations of Indian tribes with their own


members, that it can't give in one year and take away the


-- the other year.  I -- I just don't think you need that


argument to prevail in your case.


MR. REICHERT:  In -- and thank you. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. REICHERT:  The -- and it is -- it is


critically important to look at what a tribe -- what


powers a tribe exerts over its members and what -- what


somebody who is a member of a tribe traveling across the


country, traveling across an interstate highway and is not


a member of that tribe, comes onto a reservation for no


reason other than to get through that reservation --


QUESTION:  What about someone who lives on the


reservation, marries a woman who is a member of the tribe? 


Why doesn't the tribe have at least the sovereign


authority -- it's always at the sufferance of Congress,


but to say when things go wrong on our reservation, when


our people are hurt, we are entitled to prosecute the


wrongdoer?


MR. REICHERT:  Because if the Court were to

adopt that position, then there would be no reason not to


subject non-Indians to tribal jurisdiction as well. 


That's a contact --


QUESTION:  Well, how do you distinguish Brendale


with a zoning ordinance and so forth?  Is criminal


jurisdiction different? 


MR. REICHERT:  Criminal -- criminal jurisdiction


is significantly different than civil jurisdiction. 


QUESTION:  And -- and what's -- what's the


authority for that?


MR. REICHERT:  I believe that that's in my


brief, Your Honor.  I don't have that cite in front of me.


The -- but in -- in Duro this Court said that in


the criminal -- that the criminal context is unique, and


that in the -- in the realm of criminal law, we must first


look -- no matter what we think of history, no matter what


our interpretation is of history and statutes and


treaties, this must be examined under the guise that Billy


Jo Lara, or in that case Albert Duro, is a citizen first


and foremost of the United States. 


QUESTION:  But then you've given the answer to


your own question.  If you're right -- if you're right


that this does -- is absolutely, you know, a violation of


due process to subject the non-tribal member, say, to a


trial without a lawyer, well, then you would win, but not

this case.  What you would win is a case where there was


an appeal from the tribal prosecution, and under those


circumstances, they had raised the question just as you


phrased it, say it may not violate due process, for the


reasons you gave, not to give the tribal member a lawyer,


but it does violate due process for Congress to pass a law


which subjects me to this criminal trial without a lawyer


because I am not a tribal member.  So if you are right,


there is a vehicle to make that claim and you will win or


your client will.  But he didn't take advantage of that


vehicle in this case. 


MR. REICHERT:  And -- and it's interesting.  The


Government says in numerous instances that habeas relief


is an appropriate remedy.  This Court recognized in Duro


that habeas is not an appropriate remedy, and it's not for


two reasons, the first being habeas relief requires an in-


custody -- has an in-custody requirement.  Mr. Lara is


quickly out of custody.


And without a lawyer, how can one be expected to


raise complex Federal rights such as habeas?  When one


walks into a courtroom, one does not walk in and say --


QUESTION:  Well, we do it all the time.  We have


a lot of pro se applicants that make very complex


arguments.  That's not new.


MR. REICHERT:  But it's not required to step

into a courtroom in the United States and say before this


proceeding starts, I want to invoke all of my rights. 


Those rights must be waived.  And at no point were these


-- were these rights waived by Mr. Lara.


QUESTION:  Of course, he'd be subjected to the


same thing on his own reservation, on the reservation of


his own tribe, and you say that's okay.


MR. REICHERT:  This Court has said that -- that


prosecuting a member on his own tribe is okay because he


has -- he has consented to that.


QUESTION:  Mightn't there be such a thing as,


you know, when -- when you enroll in any tribe, you


subject yourself to what might be call Indian law --


MR. REICHERT:  No --


QUESTION:  -- the law of your tribal council and


the law of -- of other tribal councils?  And just as


you're not entitled to an attorney before your own tribal


council, you're not entitled to an attorney before another


one.  Why -- that -- that would be a sensible resolution


it seems to me. 


MR. REICHERT:  It would be wonderful if tribes


were the same, but tribes are not.  Tribes are distinctly


different.  To say that the -- that somebody in -- an


Indian in Alaska is going to know what the criminal laws


in the State of Florida are going to be is simply not the

council, what the laws were, who the judges --


QUESTION:  How does that differ from somebody


from Virginia who caused some trouble in Louisiana and


doesn't want to go to the Louisiana courts because they


have this mixed civil/common law system? 


MR. REICHERT:  Because a criminal defendant in


Louisiana under your -- under your example would have the


full benefit of the Bill of Rights which a -- which an


Indian does not have in tribal courts.  And that's the


difference.  They would -- he would -- that person would


have a Louisiana lawyer who understood Louisiana law and


could speak on his behalf.  Gideon v. Wainwright is --


there is wonderful language in there, talking about how


important it is to have a lawyer.


QUESTION:  But this is --


QUESTION:  Yes, but if -- if --


QUESTION:  -- this is so hypothetical because


there's nothing in this record to show that he asked for a


lawyer, was denied a lawyer.  We have to assume that --


that's -- that's not an issue in this case.  You're --

the basis for double jeopardy?


MR. REICHERT:  Because Mr. Lara was prosecuted


under the color of law.  He was prosecuted.  He went to


jail for 90 days, and he --


QUESTION:  Yes, but there's no valid judgment if


you're right. 


MR. REICHERT:  And Mr. Lara never attacked his


-- his judgment.  The Government is attacking his


judgment, coming in -- he -- he never attacked his


judgment.  Now the Government is coming in attacking his


judgment collaterally in order to exact a more harsh


sentence in Federal court. 


QUESTION:  No.  They're relying on the dual


sovereignty doctrine.  And you -- you don't seem to me to


challenge that either, do you?  You're not asking us to


reexamine the basic double jeopardy doctrine.


MR. REICHERT:  No, I am not, Your Honor.  No, I


am not. 


And -- and the tribe, acting under the direction


of Congress which has control over the Indian


reservations, acting under what they thought was a valid


statute, acting under a statute that would not be invalid


until this Court speaks, was placed in jail and has


suffered the constraints of being in jail, then was

was indicted and now is going to be prosecuted a second

He was there and he -- and the fact that he was punished


is clear.


For these reasons, I ask this Court to affirm


the decision of the Eighth Circuit and to find that Billy


Jo's -- Billy Jo Lara's subsequent Federal prosecution


violated double jeopardy.  Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Can I ask just one question?  Of what


tribe is Lara a member?


MR. REICHERT:  The -- the --


QUESTION:  Well, it will be in the record.


Do you know if there is a -- any kind of an


agreement between his tribe and the prosecuting tribe?


MR. REICHERT:  No.  In fact -- no, there is not. 


And historically there wouldn't have been.  They are two


tribes that were bitter enemies throughout history and --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. KNEEDLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


The first point I'd like to make is that this


case only involves the question of whether Congress can


authorize tribes to exercise jurisdiction over Indians who

are members of other tribes or affiliated with other


tribes, not non-member Indians.  And that -- that point is


significant because it calls into -- into play additional


powers that Congress has in this area particularly


defining the attributes of membership in a tribe. 


Congress has -- among those attributes are the eligibility


for special benefits, educational benefits, health


benefits, housing benefits.  So someone from another


tribe --


QUESTION:  And I take it tribal membership is


always consensual in the context that we're talking about?


MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I think -- I think it would


-- yes, it would be.  Someone always would have the -- the


ability to disavow his -- his Indian affiliation.  I think


that would be an important part of it.


But -- so what Congress has done here is simply


to identify another attribute of membership or affiliation


with a tribe, which is that if you're on another tribe's


reservation, you will be subject to that tribe's criminal


jurisdiction.  And that is important to law and order on


many reservations, as Congress itself realized when it


enacted this statute in 1991.


QUESTION:  Is it correct that a defendant in the


case right before the trial starts could disavow his


Indian status?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  He could not -- I -- I think


he -- as long as he was affiliated at the time of the


conduct, I think -- I think the -- the consequences would


-- would flow from that.


QUESTION:  I wonder if that -- why that would


follow?  If he had that absolute right, it seems to me


anytime before judgment he should -- he could say I'm


stopped being an Indian.


MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  I -- I think -- I think


Congress at least under the Necessary and Proper Clause


could allow a tribe to maintain jurisdiction over


something that happened while the person was tribally


affiliated.


The -- another fundamental point is the one that


Justice Breyer mentioned is that there is nothing in the


Constitution that prohibits, the places a limit in this


situation on Congress' exercise of its plenary power over


Indian affairs.  And in fact, there's much in the


Constitution that points to the contrary.  The


Constitution refers to the Indian tribes, and as this


Court has said, that reference to tribes and to the


treaty-making power recognizes tribes as sovereigns, not


simply voluntary organizations, but in the Constitution


itself recognizes them as sovereigns.  And the Court has


said that because of those powers and implicit from that

is the power of Congress to exercise protective authority


over Indian tribes.  And here that protection includes


protection of tribal -- tribes from crimes committed by


other tribal members. 


In solving this serious law enforcement problem,


Congress was entitled to be guided by the Constitution


itself which recognizes the tribes as sovereign and to


vest authority in them as sovereign rather than act in


derogation of the Constitution by deeming the tribes to be


agents of the Federal Government when a tribal prosecutor


is bringing a prosecution under tribal law in -- in tribal


court. 


And Congress could rationally reach this


conclusion for another important reason, and that is the


lesson in history.  History is very important in Indian


affairs, and Congress throughout history, since 1817 under


a jurisdictional regime that remains in effect, has left


to tribes the power to exercise jurisdiction over members


of other tribes, as this Court said in United States v.


Rodgers where it construed the Indian against Indian


exception as intended to allow tribe matters not -- and it


expressly said, not only with -- with their own tribe but


other tribes, to be left to the tribe.


QUESTION:  Could the Congress define a -- a


criminal offense between one Indian as another Indian and

require that the trial be in a tribal court?


MR. KNEEDLER:  A title 18 offense?


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I think that --


QUESTION:  Because my next question would be if


they did, could there then be double jeopardy if there was


a second trial.


MR. KNEEDLER:  That -- that would -- that --


that might present a -- a separate problem, but if the --


because there -- it might be the same offense.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Kneedler.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:09 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
