 There's no doubt that AEDPA changed Federal 
22  habeas law in many important ways, but it did not change 
23  habeas law with respect to retroactivity, for under this 
24  Court's Teague jurisprudence, States already had comity, 
25

Any decision announced from this Court 
before a State prisoner's conviction becomes final 
constitutes clearly established law for purposes of 
applying section 2254(d) of AEDPA.  For decades, in 
fact, it has been a bedrock rule under Teague and 
Griffith that State prisoners are entitled to the 
benefit of decisions from this Court that come down 
before finality, and that rule has delivered fairness 
and clarity to an area that that this Court has 
acknowledged previously lacked it.  There's no 
compelling reason to chart a new course now. 

as opposed to other areas.  Now --

 MR. FISHER:  If this Court had GVR'ed the 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, if he had sought 

cert. 

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I -- well, I'm not 

our normal practice would have been to GVR it, because 

1
2  wouldn't have this problem, at least not in this case, 
3  if your client had -- had sought cert, right?  Because 
4  then presumably when his petition came before the Court, 
5
6  the decision would come out the other way under -- under 
7  Gray, right?

 MR. FISHER:  Of course. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And I think it's 

State collateral review.  I mean, if he had tried one of 

request, if he'd had counsel that would have advised him

GVR it until he seeks cert. 

 MR. FISHER:  Well, let me take those one at

in procedural arguments, harmless error allegations, 

responsibility of deciding every single case that falls 

1  to seek cert, he may well have done it, and this Court 
2  may well have GVR'ed, but realize that this Court isn't bound 
3  to do that.  This Court has discretionary jurisdiction, 
4  and I don't think this Court wants to take on the 
5
6  into a twilight zone situation. 
7
 You're going to have cases, like this one 
8  very well would have in light of what the Pennsylvania 
9  -- the State filed in its own supreme court, wrapped up 
10
11  perhaps alternative State grounds.  And this Court often 
12  has decided that habeas is the better place to work that 
13  out, not GVR.  Now, it may well have GVR'ed, but I don't 
14  think the Court wants to take on that responsibility. 
15
JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  I mean, normally a 
16  lawyer just looks to see what the docket is.  And when 
17  there's a case that seems to affect his case, he asks 
18  for cert.  And our practice normally, since I have been 
19  here, is where it implicates a case, you hold it until 
20
the case is decided.  Then the writing judge or other 
21  people look through it and see if in fact it really does 
22  affect it, and if it does, we GVR. 
23
24  you discovered instances where we've failed to do that, 
25

 I mean, as a practicing lawyer here, have 

do you think?

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I can think of -- let me 

And, in fact, I can think of one case right 

1
2  take it one step at a time.  I think there are cases 
3  that this Court doesn't GVR.  Because they are so 
4  procedurally complicated, the Court leaves it. 
5
6  now in California.  After Melendez-Diaz, there was a 
7  case called Geyer that came out of the California 
8  courts, that this Court did -- held for Melendez-Diaz 
9  but did not GVR, in part because I think the State was 
making harmless error allegations there.  And now the 
10
11 
States and California are trying to figure out what to 
12 
do in light of that. 
13
14  normal --
15
16 
17
18  it looks like a mess procedurally, or whatever, the 
19  normal assumption is you let the lower court figure it 
20
21  that in actually most cases in which we GVR, the court 
22  reinstates the judgment below for one reason or -- or 
23  another.  But the idea that we parse through them 
24  carefully -- I think if it's arguable, send it back and 
25

out.  Send it back, and I -- I think the research is 

let the lower court sort it out. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would think our 

MR. FISHER:  So, that's just one example,

problem. 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. FISHER:  Okay.  So let me address that. 
 So there -- I don't think it is a given, 

would have been able to bring this claim in the 
Pennsylvania State courts.  The -- the justices on -- the 
judges on the Third Circuit disagreed about that, and 
it's unsettled under Pennsylvania law.  But what is 
clear is that --

1
2  rules had been that you would seek cert to the 
3  Pennsylvania Supreme Court, then you might have had an 
4  argument about finality, but now you don't.  But you can 
get to that later, because the -- the Chief Justice had 
5
6  a second part of his question which was collateral.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The problem is 


1  procedural posture of somebody going back in the 

2  situation, and we haven't found one --

3
4  that --

5
MR. FISHER:  -- that either decides it or 

6  the State takes a position one way or the other.  But 

7  there are many States -- you don't have to dwell on --

8  just on Pennsylvania, because there are States -- we 

9  cite them in our brief -- that would not let somebody 

10
like Mr. Gray go into State court.  And, indeed, the 
11  amicus brief from the group of States I think is telling 
12  in its silence, that none of the 12 States that signed 
13  on to that brief are willing to say you could bring a 
14  claim like this in collateral review in our own 
15
16
17  I appreciate your point that you may or may not have 
18  been able to bring it.  My -- my concern is that you have, 
19  I guess as someone put it, the perfect storm here.  You have a 
20
21  gotten relief if he had through the GVR process, and who 
22  did not seek State collateral review, and he could well 
23  have -- you say probably wouldn't.  The State said 
24  certainly would have.  Somewhere in there.  At least

State courts. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You would be – 

he'd have had a fair chance --

scenario. 

 MR. FISHER:  I think that's a fair 

argument with respect to 2254(d). 

 And this Court has never held either that 

 MR. FISHER:  Right. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- or a chance.  But 

1
2
3  because he didn't seek cert and he didn't file State 
4  collateral relief, we have this more complicated 
5
6
7  statement, Your Honor.  And the way you frame it, 
8  though, frames what sounds to me more like an exhaustion 
9  argument than it does about a statutory construction 
10
11
12  you have to seek cert in this Court in order to exhaust 
13  State remedies, nor to take a -- to take a claim back to 
14  State collateral review that you've already taken up 
through the State direct review system.  So if we had an 
15
16  exhaustion case in the future, maybe somebody would make 
17  that argument. 
18
19  What's before you today is the hypothetical that -- that 
20
21  this didn't GVR, or he did seek review in the 
22  Pennsylvania courts and they refused to hear it. 
 And under the State's position, even then 
23
24  you would bar him from getting the reliance on Gray, 
25

because Gray came down after the Pennsylvania Supreme --

 But that's not what's before you today. 

Mr. Greene actually did seek cert and for some reason

 MR. FISHER:  Well, he very much had raised

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, apparently the

2
3  Pennsylvania Supreme Court thought that he hadn't 
4  properly raised it.  I mean, they initially granted 
5
6  improvident most likely because Greene had not raised 
7  the -- the Gray issue below.

absolutely right that the State, faced with really no 
alternative but to try to argue waiver, did argue waiver 
in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which did dismiss the 
case.  But, of course, the order doesn't say why it 
dismissed the case.  And we litigated that very issue in 
the lower courts, and the Third Circuit squarely held 
that Mr. Greene had, in fact, preserved this claim in 
the Pennsylvania courts, and on top of that, the 
Pennsylvania Superior Court had reached it and resolved 
-- understood him to be raising a Gray-type argument and 
resolved it by citing a Pennsylvania case that had 
previously held that just putting an X in place of -- in 
place of the defendant's name was good enough to satisfy 
Bruton. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  How can you -- how can you 
square your position with what 2254(d) says, that there

unreasonable application of clearly established law when 

it's a backward-looking statute.  There is a 
retroactivity cutoff.  The question is, where is it? 
 And we don't contend, Justice Alito, that 

1  must be an unreasonable application of clearly 
2  established law?  What the intermediate appellate court 
3  did was not an unreasonable application or -- let's 
4  assume for the sake of argument it was not an 
5
6  they did it.  So, how do you get around that? 
7
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And just to follow up on 
8  that question, the statute says it was "adjudicated," 
9  past tense, and the decision "resulted in," past tense. 
MR. FISHER:  Right.  We don't disagree that 
10
11 
12 
13
14  it's an unreasonable application.  We contend that

that, and I didn't hear -- was an unreasonable?  I just 

there's more statutory language that it's contrary to --

MR. FISHER:  That's not the date they made 
it, no.  But the question of contrary to, as this Court 
said in Williams and has repeated many times, is whether 
the lower court either did one of two things:  decided a 
case -- decided the case with a question of law and 
decided the question of law opposite as how this Court

Pennsylvania Superior Court, Justice Scalia, that's

 MR. FISHER:  Justice Kagan, no, we don't 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, how do you square your 

argument with Pinholster?  Because I thought that what 

1  has decided it, or decided the case differently than 
2  this Court has in another case on materially 
3  indistinguishable facts. 
4
5
6  we said in Pinholster just last year is no Monday 
7  morning quarterback.  We put ourselves in the position 
8  of the court at the time.  We look at what the court 
9  looked at.  We know what the court knew, and we make a 
decision on that ground.  And it seems to me that your 
10
11  argument just runs smack into that holding. 
12
13  think it does, because there has always been a 
14  difference between facts and law.  So, this Court of 
15
16  record that existed before the State court, but ordinary 
17  appellate review and principles have always allowed new 
18  law to be considered up to a certain point. 
19
20
21  trial court, but that new law up to the point of 
22  finality is -- can be considered. 
23
24  can be a distinction between facts and law for many 
25

 And so, it's consistent with Pinholster to 
say you take the set of facts, just as you would from a 

course held in Pinholster that you look at the factual

1  statute, which was basically the view that Justice Alito 
2  gave you, which said everything in this statute is 
3  framed in the past tense.  What the statute is getting 
4  at is -- is the decision at the time the State court 
5
6
7  disagree at all that it's in the past tense.  The 
8  question is where in the past is the cutoff?  And so, 
9  what we say is -- and it's important what this Court did

13 
14 
15
16 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why? 
17
 MR. FISHER:  For a few reasons --
18
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because the statute says 
19
adjudication resulted in a decision.  And the decision, 
20
21  the only decision, is the Pennsylvania Superior Court, 
22  because there was a non-decision by the Pennsylvania 
23  Supreme Court.  Resulted -- that is -- in a decision 
24  that was.  It didn't say "is." I mean, you would have a 
25

say in Pinholster.  In Pinholster, it didn't say that 
the plain language of 2254(d) resolved this.  It said 
that -- I think I'm going to get this quote right --
that the structure of the statute compelled the 
conclusion that for facts you leave the window.  Well, 
the structure of this statute as to law compels the 
opposite conclusion. 

much stronger argument if it had read "resulted in a 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. FISHER:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, if I 

was made.  And so, that's the question you have. 

 And if you look to the structure of the 

then there would be no -- there would be no 

1  decision that is contrary."  But when it says "was," 
2  that sounds like at the time of the adjudication. 
3
4  can get this point across.  I'm not saying "is," because 
5
6  retroactivity cutoff whatsoever.  I agree that the 
7  statute says "was," but it's was as of when?  We say 
8  "was" as of the time of finality.  The State wants to 
9  read into the statute "was" as of the time the decision 
10
11
12  statute, you'll see lots of clues that Congress didn't 
13  intend to change the previous clear retroactivity cutoff 
14  at Teague.  And, of course, that's the barrier the State 
15
16  law.  If you look at the limitations provision, it 
17  references finality.  If you look at various provisions 
18  of the statute that reference retroactivity law, they 
19  reference new rules in retroactivity.  And this Court 
has held in Tyler v. Cain that Teague is what Congress 
20
21  had in mind when it did that.  So --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, how do you --
22
23  how do you get past Horn?  Horn says that Teague and 
24  AEDPA are two different analyses that each case must 
undergo, that you start with, okay, what does Teague 
25

has to overcome here, a clear and specific change in 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

adjudication and whether at its time it was contrary to 

 MR. FISHER:  Justice Sotomayor, we think 

1  say, but you then look at what AEDPA says, and that each 
2  can serve as an independent bar.  So, if that's the 
3  case, how do you get around AEDPA's requirement of a 
4  past-looking statute being one that involves the 
5
6  Supreme Court precedent? 
7
8  Horn is another structural component of the statute that 
9  shows why we win.  And let me explain why.  Again, we

12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19

22  retroactivity.  Now, in light of Horn on the books, if 
23  the State were right that what 2254(d) is actually 
24  trying to do is also do retroactivity work and prevent 
25

don't disagree it's a backward-looking statute, but 
backward-looking to finality.  Now, what Horn held --
Horn rejected a form of the very same argument that the 
State is making today, which is 2254(d) changes 
retroactivity law to establish the cutoff at the time of 
the State court decision, not as of finality.  This 
Court rejected that argument and said, no, Teague and 
2254(d) are distinct.  And we think the best way to 
understand them as distinct is to understand that 
2254(d) deals with the standard of review, and Teague 
still continues to control finality. 

the State courts from, as it put in its brief, being 

 Now, in light of Horn -- I'm sorry --

17
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

the last State court decision for retroactivity 

1  "blind-sided," then Teague would serve -- no 
2  longer serve any purpose, and Horn would have had to 
3  come out the other way, because once you say 2254(d) is 
4  actually concerned with setting a cutoff at the time of 
5
6  purposes, you don't need Teague anymore.  So, Horn would 
7  have had to come out the other way if the State is 
8  right. 
 Now, let me go back to one other structural 
9
feature of the statute that -- that shows that Congress 
10
11  had in mind that Teague would continue, and that's the 
12  one I referenced earlier with respect to retroactivity. 
13  Keep in mind the State's argument would bar not just 
14  somebody like Greene from relying on a new case like 
Gray, but it would also -- the implication would be it 
15
16  would bar him from relying on a new case like Roper v. 
17  Simmons, Graham v. Florida, or other cases that alter --
18  that say the Constitution can no longer cover or punish 
19  substantive conduct in a certain way.  Because, again, 
20
21
22  are ongoing injuries where the person continues to be 
23  confined.

 And it's not an abstract problem.  If I give 

1
2  ongoing injury here.  All we're doing is talking about a 
3  trial error.  That's -- that's different than --
4
State's view of AEDPA, Justice Kennedy.  Remember, the 
5
6  State's view of AEDPA is that if a decision comes down 
7  after the latest State court's decision on the merits, 
8  then the defendant cannot seek relief based on it.  And 
9  on page 38 of the red brief, in footnote 12, they try to 
10
11
12  this Court a few citations -- if you'll permit me to 
13  give you three citations of cases working through the 
14  lower courts right now that raise Roper, Graham, and 
15
16  have reached them is by saying that Teague still has a 
17  role to play with respect to 2254(d).  And the three 
18  citations, if I can give them very quickly, are Arroyo, 
19  362 F. Supp. 2d 869; Holladay, 331 F.3d 1169; and Simms 
20
21
 Again, that's another structural feature of 
22  the statute that the State simply can't get around with 
23  its -- with its view.  Now, some of the lower courts 
24  haven't quite focused on this, and, in fact, it's 
25

Atkins claims that the lower courts -- the only way they

1  States didn't even make the argument that you have 
2  before you today.  All the way through Smith v. Spisak, 
3  which came to this court just a couple of years ago, the 
4  State of Ohio, for example, was not even making this 
argument, which is quite odd if you step back for a 

5
6  moment and realize that the State's position today is 

7  that the plain text of AEDPA is so clear there's no 

8  possible way you could read it in any other direction. 

9  So --

10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19
20
21  AEDPA, because before AEDPA, under Caspari and Teague, 
22  there's no doubt whatsoever that that's what a Federal 
23  habeas corpus court would have done, is say the cutoff is 
24  finality.  Because, remember, finality doesn't exist in 
a vacuum.  It exists against the Griffith rule.  And so, 
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Fisher, what about 
the -- well, the purpose of AEDPA was to require the 
Federal courts to respect the State courts' decision. 
And there's only been one decision in this picture, and 
that decision was the Pennsylvania Superior Court.  And 
we are not giving much respect to that decision, which 
did not have the benefit of Gray, if we're going to say, 
no, we have to look at that decision as though Gray were 
already on the books. 

 MR. FISHER:  So, Justice Ginsburg, let me 

answer that question by starting, if I may, before 

20
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And so, the question is:  Did AEDPA change 
that rule?  And, Justice Ginsburg, you asked about the 

1  what Federal courts had always asked is, did the 
2  defendant not get credit for a case that he's entitled 
3  to under Griffith? 
4
5
6  purpose or spirit of AEDPA.  We think what the spirit of 
7  AEDPA is, is to give States deference and to give them 
8  comity where they otherwise didn't have it at the time. 
9  And so, it changed the standard of review, it changed 
the statute of limitations, but it didn't need to change 
10
11  Teague.  It didn't need to change retroactivity because, 
12  as this Court had explained in Teague itself, in Justice 
13  Kennedy's long opinion in Wright v. West concurring, the 
14  very purpose of Teague was to give States the comity 
15
16
17  situation, which is -- I think we called it earlier the 
18  twilight zone or perfect storm situation.  But this is 
19  something that this Court saw coming under Teague and 
long ago, even though even under those cases this Court 
20
21  said the purpose of retroactivity law is not to hold the 
22  States responsible for something new. 
23
24  twilight zone under Teague and why should it continue 
today?  And the answer again is because Teague doesn't 
25

 And so, the question is why did we have this 

that -- of not foisting new law upon them. 

 And so, you do end up, of course, in this 

21
 

Alderson Reporting Company

announces before his State conviction becomes final. 
 And so, Teague is necessary as the other 

Linkletter or something else, is going to really cause 
problems.  Let me give you one other image that the 
States' situation --

1  exist in a vacuum; it works in tandem with Griffith. 
2  Remember, what Griffith said is that it violates basic 
3  norms of constitutional adjudication for a defendant to 
4  not get the credit for a decision that this Court 
5
6
7  side of the coin to make Griffith work.  And to undo all 
8  of that and to go back to an unsettled state of 
9  retroactivity law, whether it's -- whether it's 
10
11 
12 
13
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, I don't -- I don't 
14  understand the problem.  If you look at the Pennsylvania 
Superior Court decision and say, as of that time, the --
15
16  there was no violation of any clearly established law, 
17  period.  Why is that complicated? 
18
19  Take the typical case, and maybe you'll put in your 
mind, for example, the Martinez oral argument you had 
20
21  last week.  A typical case works its way through the 
22  State courts.  There's going to be an appeal as of right 
23  in the State intermediate court, where all of the claims 
24  the defendant brings can be addressed. 
25

 MR. FISHER:  Here's why, Justice Ginsburg: 

Then what might happen quite often is the 

22

assistance of counsel claim, and maybe whatever other 


 Under the State's rule, you have three 


1  State Supreme Court is going to hear, like this Court 

2  does, maybe one or two of those claims and address them 

3  on the merits.  Then he's going to go into State 

4  collateral review and bring an IAC claim, an ineffective 

5
6  claim he couldn't have brought earlier. 

7
8  different retroactivity cutoffs for different claims 

9  that are brought and adjudicated at the different part 

10
of that regime.  You have a retroactivity cutoff at the 
11  intermediate court for certain claims, a retroactivity 
12  cutoff at the Pennsylvania -- I'm sorry -- the State 
13  Supreme Court for the -- for certain other claims, and a 
14  retroactivity cutoff at finality for certain other 
15
16  that, it's just difficult. In Cullen v. Pinholster --
17
18  to me that AEDPA contemplates that.  It refers to any 
19  claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court 
20
21  result with respect to claims that were adjudicated on 
22  direct review and any claim that was pushed over to 
23  collateral review.

4  you have to go claim by claim with different dates and

7  was brought, or the State supreme court decided this

6  interpretation of something that's new.  All right. 
7  Now, there are going to be a wide range of people that 
8  that many might apply to whose convictions became final 
9  or just about final in State courts at different times. 
10
11 
12 
13
14  reading of the statute on the other side says:  I'll 
tell you who it applies to or who it doesn't apply to. 
15
16  It doesn't apply to people where the last State court 
17  decision was made before the Supreme Court made its 
18  decision.  That's it.  Now, that's arbitrary somewhat, 
19  but you have to cut and draw a line somewhere.

24  that there's arbitrariness built into any cutoff.

Alderson Reporting Company 

arbitrariness that we think is undesirable and 

the merits.  And many State supreme courts might take 
the view that, well, hey, if the State supreme court --
if the U.S. Supreme Court has just decided this issue 
and we don't have any new law to make here, this isn't 
worth our time.  So, we're just going to let it go.

take a hard look, not just at fairness and equity, but 
10
11 
at this Court's right to counsel jurisprudence and ask 
yourself whether somebody under the Halbert test who has

a right to have a decision on the merits of that claim

 MR. EISENBERG:  Your Honor, as we addressed

23  believe that Teague exceptions clearly would survive

process.  Number one, in most States -- and perhaps

8
9  States that do.

13
14  Sotomayor.  As to those relatively few States that 
15
16  court, and because this is a Teague exception -- and 
17  they are exceptions because they are exceptional -- he 
18  has a number of existing habeas doctrines to rely on: 
19  cause and prejudice, actual innocence, inadequate State 
grounds.  And he is quite likely in the Teague exception 
20
21  case to be able to get through the default of not having 
22  had an adjudication in State court, and he'll have not 
23  only review in Federal court, but he'll have de novo 
24  review in Federal court, because there was no ruling on 
25

the merits.  So, not only will he have Federal court

 If the State did allow the review of the
 

1  review, but it won't be deferential review in that 

2  circumstance. 

3
4  Teague exception, then he will have deferential review. 

5
And, in fact, this question has been debate by the Court 

6  before.  It came up at oral argument in Whorton v. 

7  Bockting.  One of the amicus briefs in that case 

8  actually addressed the question empirically, looked at 

9  one of the most recent candidates for first Teague 

10
exception status, which was the mental retardation rule 
11  of Atkins v. Virginia and, in an appendix to the brief, 
12  found that no State had barred review of the Atkins 
13  claim even though it was not even officially declared 
14  yet to be a Teague exception. 
15
16  Teague exceptions.  Of course, this case doesn't concern 
17  a Teague exception.  And so, really the only question 
18  here is whether a ruling in favor of the State would 
19  inadvertently determine that question for future

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What if it was a -- what if

2  That is well established.  And the first Teague

4  essentially didn't commit the crime.  The nature of the 
5
6  constitutional power to make that a crime. 
7
8  it was case like Gideon v. Wainwright? 
 MR. EISENBERG:  That would be the watershed

10
11  States would generally and have empirically entertained 
12  those claims.  If the State did not, I believe that the 
13  defendant would have the right to say that because of 
14  the watershed nature of the rule, the State's failure to 
15
16  blocking review in Federal court.  And I think that

 I think, as Justice Kagan stated earlier or 

 Petitioner argues that facts and law are 

presented here.  And Pinholster did not simply tell us 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1  that new facts couldn't be considered, but the premise 
2  of the decision was that since new law couldn't be 
3  decided, neither could new facts.  The -- the statute is 
4  phrased in the past tense.  As the Court said, the 
entire statute is backward-looking.  There was no --
5
6  nothing about the statute that made --
7
8  could just go back to your Pinholster point.  Your 
9  friend makes the argument that, of course, in a typical 
appellate case, you don't go back and revisit the facts, 
10
11 
but that appellate court is expected to apply the law at 
the time it renders its decision.  So, there is that 
12 
13 
distinction between law and facts that seems to cut in 
his favor. 
14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  more generally about the idea that Pinholster 
automatically applies to this situation.  It applies to 
20
21  facts; therefore, it applies to law.  The distinction in 
22  that context between law and facts, the general context, 
23  strikes me as one that supports his argument that

33
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. EISENBERG:  Your Honor, I think that 
1
2  Pinholster was somewhat more specific than that.  It 
3  stated that -- the statute was backwards-looking in its 
4  entirety, certainly with no exceptions for law.  After 
all, (d)(1) is about law.  It doesn't mention the word 
5
6  "facts" or "evidence"; it mentions only the word "law." 
7  And the Court had to move from that to its decision 
8  about facts. 
 Number two, in Pinholster, the Court 
9
specifically stated that it was relying on prior 
10
11  precedents.  And it used the word "precedent" to 
12  describe the prior decisions for the proposition that 
13  our cases "emphasize that review under 2254(d)(1) 
14  focuses on what a state court knew and did."  State 
15
16  precedent as of the time the State court renders its 
17  decision.  That was the jumping-off point, so to speak, 
18  for the Court's extension of the principle in effect 
19  that we're debating today to the area of new facts.  And 
I don't think there's any way to reconcile that holding 
20
21  with the Petitioner's argument or with the language of 
22  the statute. 
 Now, the Petitioner argues that this is 
23
24  necessary in order to give the defendant his rights 
25

under Griffith v. Kentucky.  But, as I think the Chief 

court decisions are measured against this Court's

situations where the State has agreed with such a 
request?

2  was entitled to seek review on direct appeal as long as

good arguments that those kinds of rules would not

and it's upheld.  And then at some time thereafter --

2
3  let's imagine Smith is convicted of some kind of 
4  disorderly conduct, and he goes through the State courts 
5
6  I leave vague how -- how much time.  Maybe it's a couple 
7  of months or something.  The Supreme Court says that 
8  particular kind of conduct is protected by the First

 MR. EISENBERG:  Yes, Your Honor, and that's 

If the State court does so, then the State court's 

habeas corpus. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So this is quite far out, but 

1  Sotomayor's question, Your Honor.  And the answer is 
2  that, in that case, the defendant can argue that the 
3  State's failure to provide review constituted a bar that 
4  he is allowed to circumvent by the existing doctrine of 
5
6
7  conceivable.  You'd argue that in the State court, the 
8  State -- you'd have to go to collateral review in State 
9  court and argue that they now have to apply the new 
10
11
12  appropriate because, of course, AEDPA wants the State 
13  court to have the first chance to review.  If the State 
14  court refuses to do so, then he can circumvent the bar. 
15
16  review on the merits of the new rule becomes the law 
17  that will be applied, the clearly established law that 
18  will be applied. 
19
20
21  Teague has not been abolished by 2254.  Its role has 
22  certainly been reduced, but that is true of many aspects 
23  of AEDPA. 
24
25

 Your Honor, I think it's -- Your Honors, I 
think it's important also to remember here that -- that 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What's left of it? 
MR. EISENBERG:  What's left of it primarily, 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  Your Honor, is the situation where there's no merits 
2  decision in the State court.  And we've just described 
3  one example of that in the Teague exception case where 
4  the State court refuses to provide merits review, but 
there will be many others where the State asserts a 
5
6  default and the defendant is able to overcome them 
7  through cause and prejudice, et cetera. 
 In those cases, the defendant, for purposes 
8
9  of 2254, wouldn't be barred because there is no merits 
determination.  But Teague might still bar him if the 
10
11 
new rule on which he seeks review is one that came down 
12 
after the point of finality. 
13
 Teague is not a guarantee of rights to the 
14  defendant.  Griffith was the guarantee of rights to the 
15
16  rights.  Teague is a bar to review.  AEDPA is a bar to 
17  review.  They are two separate bars that overlap to some 
18  degree but work in different ways.

 Another example of a situation where --

States upwards of 10 years to figure this out?

 MR. EISENBERG:  Your Honor, I'm not sure I 

agree with that factually.  In the Spisak case, for

a case that actually supports our position. 

 In that case, the State court applied on 

1  example, I don't know that it was necessary for the 
2  State to make that argument.  The State thought it had a 
3  strong argument on the merits.  That's exactly what 
4  happened in Horn v. Banks, as well, Your Honor, which is 
5
6
7  collateral review the rule of Mills v. Maryland.  Now, 
8  this Court later held in that same case that Mills was a 
9  new rule that would be Teague-barred, but the State 
didn't know that at that time, and the State had a 
10
11 
well-established body of law applying Mills and thought 
-- the State thought it could easily dispose of the 
12 
13 
claim on the merits of the Mills issue.  So, it did so. 
14
review.  It wouldn't have been barred, review on the 
15
16  merits would not have been barred by 2254 because the 
17  State collateral review court applied Mills and made a 
18  merits determination.  So, the defendant would have been 
19  entitled to merits review under the deferential 
20
21
22  the independent bar of Teague comes into play.  The 
23  Third Circuit refused to apply that independent bar; 
24  that's why this Court reversed in Horn v. Banks.  And 
25

so, it neatly illustrates another example of a situation 

 The problem is Mills was a new rule, and so 

 The case came to Federal habeas corpus 

standard.

4  even greater extent than Teague was.  Abuse of the writ,

Justice Stevens's position in dissent, arguing in 
dissent, that the statute really only embodied Teague. 
When the statute said clearly established, all that 
Congress meant to do was to codify Teague.  He said it 
was perfectly clear that that was the case.  And he 
argued, particularly in footnote 12 of his dissenting 
portion of his opinion in Williams v. Taylor, just as 
Petitioner argues today, that the fact that Congress in 
other portions of AEDPA, particularly in section 2244, 
used language talking about finality of judgment and 
talking about retroactivity -- the fact that Congress 
did that in 2244 meant that it was thinking about Teague 
and that it really meant to extend the Teague rule 
throughout the entire statute, that Teague really 
flavored the entire statute. 

43
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 The Court necessarily rejected that 

Williams v. Taylor that the deference rule, 2254, 
constituted a new rule which sat side by side with 
Teague and operated in different ways, even if in some 
cases, many cases that would mean you never had to get 
to the Teague bar, because the 2254 bar came into play 
first or more easily. 

1
2  argument.  And, in fact, in reference to another prior 
3  case of this Court, Wright v. West, that had been argued 
4  by Justice Stevens in his dissent, Justice O'Connor 
speaking for the Court said Congress need not mention a 
5
6  prior decision of this Court by name in a statute's text 
7  in order to adopt a rule.

everything he can do, but it just so happens that this 
Court's decision has come down after the last State 
court decision on the merits, and the State on 
collateral review has refused -- if it's been given a 
chance -- to remedy that. 

The three cases I cited to you -- at least 

 But this case is all about a situation where 

1  footnote 12 and today, says actual innocence, cause and 
2  prejudice, or something, would let you get around the 
3  problem that I've raised.  But that doesn't work, 
4  because all those doctrines do is allow you to bring the 
case forward.  They just allow you to get out from under

be granted on any claim unless the language we've been

one of them involves a situation where the defendant did 
go back to the State -- and I believe it's the Graham

Virginia said, no, you're barred from State collateral 
review. 

 So, all those doctrines do is allow the

 The second thing is, as to this Court's GVR 


1  talking about today.  So, the only way out of the

3  what is clearly established law, not the language of the

14  you out from the problem of being able to get in the 
door, because what would happen in that situation is the 
15
16  State would say this is waived because he didn't make it 
17  earlier.  And then you'd go to the Teague -- you'd go to

the merits would have been earlier in the proceedings, 
when you argued I can't be executed because I was 17 
when I committed the crime, and a State would have 
rejected that before Roper, and then you end up, after 
Roper, a State saying we won't hear this on collateral 
review because we've already heard it once.  And then we 
have the situation we have today, and the only way out
