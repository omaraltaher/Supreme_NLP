CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 01-1757, Marion Reynolds Stogner v.


California.


Mr. Najera.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERTO NAJERA


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. NAJERA:  Thank you.  Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


Petitioner comes before the Court asking one


thing and one thing only, that the State of California be


bound by its decrees and its laws that have guided it


throughout the history of California, that the State and


the Federal Government be bound by the laws of the land 

that have been in place essentially since the State's


foundation.


Since early on in this country's history, Chief


Justice Marshall looked at a matter similar and said it


would be repugnant to the genius of our laws to allow the


prosecution to continue after the statute of limitations


had expired.


Such has been the law that only a few times in


the history of this Nation has any State had the


trepidation to attempt to revive an expired cause of

action in a criminal matter.  In each such instance, the


States have been -- the State has not been permitted to do


so.  In each such instance, such as in State v. Sneed,


Moore v. State, and other such cases --


QUESTION:  Were those State law cases and State


constitutional cases?


MR. NAJERA:  They were, Your Honor.  And --


however, as I said, in Adams v. Wood, it involved a


Federal matter and it involved a matter that we might


consider equally repugnant.  It had to do with the


prosecution of an individual who was involved in the slave


trade and laws that prohibited that.  However, the attempt


to punish that occurred after the statute had run, and Mr.


Chief Justice Marshall indicated in that particular case


that even if the case had been treason, it could not be 

prosecuted, for under the Federal law, treason was only


prosecutable for a 3-year period.


QUESTION:  Did he base his decision, the one


that you're referring to, on the Ex Post Facto Clause?


MR. NAJERA:  No, Your Honor.  He based it on the


law that the statute of limitations in that case, the


Federal law had in fact called for an expiration of the


cause of action, and the Court there decided that, no, it


could not be prosecuted.  But no, he did not decide it on


the ex post facto basis, Your Honor.

 As the Court knows, we raise two issues here,


the Ex Post Facto Clause and the Due Process Clause, and I


would like to point out that the two clauses, while they


both deal with arbitrariness and unfairness, are not


coextensive and that similarly, in addressing the matter,


neither is petitioner's claim as to each, for under the Ex


Post Facto Clause, we are not looking at to whether or not


rights have vested.  Such is not a concern of the Court


for ex post facto concerns.


However, in this particular case, Mr. Stogner


has been vested with a right.  The State of California has


given him a substantive right, a defense that is neither


waivable nor forfeitable.


QUESTION:  We've said in Graham against Connor


that if a provision of the Constitution speaks directly to 

a subject matter, such as I think the Ex Post Facto Clause


does to your case here, then we don't go to substantive


due process.  We analyze it just under that provision.


MR. NAJERA:  That is correct, Your Honor. 


However, as I indicated, the two claims are -- are not


necessarily coextensive, and I would like to point the


Court out to the case of Sacramento v. Lewis.  There, the


Court may recall, involved a high-speed chase.  The police


were after individuals on a motorcycle.  The motorcycle


crashed.  There was in that case no Fourth Amendment claim


5

because no seizure had occurred of the person prior to the


crash taking place.  The Court, nevertheless, was able to


analyze that case under the substantive due process


principles because it fell outside of the Fourth


Amendment.


Here we clearly believe that the case falls well


within the -- the Ex Post Facto Clause.  However, should


the Court decide otherwise, it strikes me that it should


not render this Court impotent to examine the matter as a


substantive due process.  It seems --


QUESTION:  That -- that would render the rule


quite pointless.  I mean, the rule is if it is analyzable


under -- under a very specific provision of the


Constitution and is not valid under that one, you then


don't move on to analyze it under another one.  And -- but


you're saying unless you win under the narrow one, it's


not over.  If you lose under the narrow one, you then can


go on to the Due Process Clause.


MR. NAJERA:  Well --


QUESTION:  That doesn't make it much of a --


much of a safeguard, it seems to me.


MR. NAJERA:  Well, Justice Scalia, as I've


indicated, the causes are not -- are not absolutely


coextensive.  We have in this case a vested right.  The


State of California has guaranteed to the petitioner the

right that he be free from prosecution, the right that he


be free from conviction, and the right that he be free


from punishment.  This is vested to him under State law. 


As such, that can be analyzed, whether or not the Court


deems it sufficient, under the Ex Post Facto Clause.  As


the Court said in Weaver, we are not concerned under the


Ex Post Facto Clause with vested rights.  That's not


necessary for analysis under the Ex Post Facto Clause.  It


is an additional factor that the Court certainly should


and, we urge, must consider under the Due Process Clause.


If I may continue, analyzing the matter first


under the Ex Post Facto Clause, I think the first question


perhaps that should be addressed is whether or not this is


a rule of evidence and whether or not it falls within


Calder four. 


Clearly this is a rule of evidence as the 

State of California has defined it.  It is a rule of


evidence because it is required of any finder of fact,


whether it be a judge sitting pretrial examining the


matter as a demurrer or in analyzing the matter as


sufficiency of evidence under Penal Code 995.


QUESTION:  But it doesn't -- it doesn't go to


the kind of evidence necessary to prove the substantive


offense certainly.


MR. NAJERA:  Yes.  I -- I would beg to differ,


Your Honor.  And the reason is, is California has injected

the statute of limitations into every offense in which it


applies.  In such cases it becomes a material ingredient


of the offense, and in such cases the prosecution is


barred if that material ingredient is not proven by the


prosecution.  And if the matter should proceed to trial, a


jury must acquit if the prosecution is not able to


overcome its burden in that particular case.


QUESTION:  But that -- that simply says there is


another substantive element there.  It doesn't say what


rule of evidence you follow to decide how that was made


out.


MR. NAJERA:  It does, Your Honor, in this


respect.  If the evidence comes before a jury, for


example, and the evidence shows that the prosecution is


barred, that no public offense is stated, the jury must 

acquit.  It is a rule that guides the jurors, as much as


it would guide a court, in deciding what must be done with


the particular facts.  If the facts before the court show


that the case is barred, then the prosecution cannot


continue.  The jurors must acquit.  It -- it would seem to


me to be one of the most clear rules of evidence and


applicable throughout, not just to California and not just


to the Federal Government --


QUESTION:  Suppose you have a -- a case in which


the statute of limitations has not yet expired, and the

legislature then extends it.  And it's during the extended


period that the prosecution has brought it.  Is there an


ex post facto violation there?


MR. NAJERA:  I believe not, Your Honor, and the


reason I believe not is that what is promised by the


statute of limitations is not any particular number of


years.  Rather, what is promised --


QUESTION:  And how does that fit in with the


description you just gave of -- about the evidence?


MR. NAJERA:  Because the evidence that must be


shown by the prosecution is that the case has not been


barred.  That does not depend on any particular number of


years.  It depends --


QUESTION:  Well, but that's the ultimate


conclusion they gave. 


The case I put to you is either 

barred or it isn't.  We have to find the answer to that


before we know whether there's evidence.  I -- I just -- I


just don't understand your theory.


MR. NAJERA:  The case is barred only when the


statute has run.  One can liken it to a conditional


promise.


QUESTION:  But why isn't any evidence in -- in


one case or the other in the hypothetical I put?


MR. NAJERA:  Because the evidence of -- of an


extended statute of limitations doesn't go to whether or

not the case is barred.  The evidence is still the same. 


The case has not yet run.


QUESTION:  Except it does if you're -- if you're


right on your theory.


MR. NAJERA:  I am right on my theory because the


-- the State is in fact barred from proceeding, and the


evidence that would come before the --


QUESTION:  Let me ask you another question on


the ex post facto lawsuit.  Suppose the State has a


savings clause and it reserves to itself the right to


extend any statute of limitations.  What result there if


the State then extends the statute?


MR. NAJERA:  I believe if there is --


QUESTION:  And this was -- and then this in


effect at the time the crime was committed, this general 

power in the State to extend.


MR. NAJERA:  I believe if the State has reserved


the right to extend a statute of limitations before the


statute has expired, then there is no ex post facto


problem.  I believe that the problem occurs --


QUESTION:  Well, then you're not arguing for


very much here.  The -- the States -- all the States can


just pass this statute and -- and that's the end of this


case.


MR. NAJERA:  Well, it's not the end of this

particular case because the statute has, in fact, run.


Certainly a State is permitted to set statute of


limitations, decide the terms and conditions thereof, and


go forward in the future under such a premise.  In this --


QUESTION:  What -- what if a State says we


reserve the right to dispense with any of the elements of


-- of crime that are on our books?  I mean, it announces


that.  We reserve the right in the future to dispense with


-- retroactively with any of the elements of the crimes


that we have defined in our -- in our code.  You wouldn't


say that's okay, would you?


MR. NAJERA:  No, I would not, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Why is this any different?  I -- I


don't know.  If it violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, I


can't see how the State can get around it by announcing in 

advance that it's going to -- to violate the Ex Post Facto


Clause.  How does that make it okay?


MR. NAJERA:  Because the Ex Post Facto Clause


violation only occurs when the offense is deemed no more,


and that only occurs when it runs.  So if the case hasn't


run yet -- or the statute has not run yet, we are in a


completely different posture.  No -- in California --


QUESTION:  But it has run.  The State announces


it in advance.  Then the statute runs, and the State says,


hey, we told you.  We told you beforehand that even after

the statutes run, we're going to be able to get you.  And


I thought you said that's okay.


MR. NAJERA:  It's okay in the statute of


limitations context because there they have reserved that


situation that allows them to say the public offense still


continues in this particular situation.  What we have here


is an absolute rule that says once run, not only can no


punishment be had, not only can no conviction be had, but


not even a prosecution can be maintained.  There is no


offense once the statute has run.


QUESTION:  But you're saying a State could have


no statutes of limitations.


MR. NAJERA:  Yes, and -- and the States have


clearly done that in certain instances such as in the case


of murder. 


There is no statute of limitations in -- in 

such a particular case.


QUESTION:  And you have no trouble with


prospective application of either saying we're not going


to have any statute of limitations for this crime or


prospectively the time is going to be longer.  You're only


talking about the retrospective.


MR. NAJERA:  That is correct, Your Honor.  It is


in its retrospective aspect that we run into problems


because the State has clearly said there is no offense


anymore.  It is gone.  It is dead.  It has been

terminated.


QUESTION:  And for the -- the -- you were being


asked before about the difference between extending a


limitation that has not yet expired and reviving a dead


case, and for that there's -- there was a very nice


statement of the difference between the two by Judge


Learned Hand.  I thought in response to Justice Kennedy's


question, you would come back with that.


MR. NAJERA:  That is correct, Your Honor.  It is


clear as -- as His Honor Judge Learned Hand, that we're


not offended in the same manner before the crime has


expired when we extend the matter --


QUESTION:  That -- that was the footnote in the


Falter case?


MR. NAJERA: 


That is correct, Your Honor. 

QUESTION:  Footnote 26 or something?


Now, that has never been approved by this Court. 


Have -- have various circuit courts approved of that?


MR. NAJERA:  Various circuit courts have -- as I


recall, have spoken of it.  Some have objected to such


language recently such as the -- the Brechtel case.  But


every State court that has looked at the matter, not just


in California, has said you cannot maintain such an action


once it has expired.  That's clearly been the law


throughout.

 And it -- it is important to note that this type


of precedent, this history has been throughout the -- the


history of the United States.  We have cases extending


early on, State v. Sneed, a case that was cited, I might


note, in the Kring opinion that was overruled by this


Court.  But nevertheless, it was cited there for the


proposition that -- that a statute of limitations, once


run, did in fact cause ex post facto violations.


QUESTION:  Well, whatever the Federal stopper, I


-- I gather that this Court must have assumed there's such


a distinction when it was dealing with Fifth Amendment


claims and it said, once the statute of limitations has


expired, you can't plead the Fifth.


MR. NAJERA:  That's absolutely correct, Your


Honor.  And State opinions are, of course, in accord.  And


it is striking to note that as late as 1993 in a case in


California called Blackburn, an accused in a civil matter


attempted to rely on the Fifth Amendment in order to avoid


questions concerning child molestation.  And the court


there said, well, you haven't made a sufficient showing,


and the reason being?  Because the statute of limitations


essentially replaces the Fifth Amendment.


And I would note in that regard, in California


in particular, that the statute of limitations has been


viewed as such a powerful matter that it's been likened

not only to the Fifth Amendment, but it has been likened


to the Fourth Amendment in that it prevents unlawful


seizures of a person.  It has been likened to the Double


Jeopardy Clause in that one cannot prosecute a person


again once the statute of limitations has run.


And so this statute of limitations is not a


matter of minimal import.


QUESTION:  Well, the California Supreme Court,


in announcing under State law, didn't give it that


fundamental sweep at all.


MR. NAJERA:  It -- it had --


QUESTION:  We're bound by what -- how California


characterizes its own statute I assume.


MR. NAJERA:  To some extent, yes, and to some


extent, no, because in ex post facto analysis, it is this 

Court that looks at State law and it's this Court that


makes a determination whether or not it violates ex post


facto regardless of what label a State may give it in


particular.  That principle was announced in -- in


Lindsey, and it certainly was reaffirmed in -- in Carmell.


QUESTION:  But we -- we have to -- we have to


take the State law as we -- as we find it.  I mean, if the


Supreme Court of California says a law meant one thing, we


don't come in and say it meant another.  We can say you've


changed the law and therefore it's ex post facto, but we

don't decide for ourselves over the -- overruling a State


court what that particular law said at a particular time.


MR. NAJERA:  Well, the Court looks at -- at the


substance of the matter I believe.  The Court looks at


whether or not the law violates the Ex Post Facto Clause,


and it would seem to me that simply changing labels would


be an easy way for a State to get around the Ex Post Facto


Clause.  As the Court said, as early as Cummings, it's a


matter of substance, not a matter of form.


And California, throughout its history, up until


Frazer granted, had always considered statute of


limitations to be matters of substance.  They were not


simply remedial matters or not simply procedural matters. 


They were matters of substance and they were matters of


rights for the defendant or the person accused. 

QUESTION:  Your -- your claim doesn't fit very


comfortably under any of the four Calder v. Bull factors,


or categories I should say, of ex post facto violations. 


You're trying to shoehorn it under the rule of evidence


category, number four?


MR. NAJERA:  Whether -- Your Honor, whether


comfortable or not, I believe it fits, and I believe that


it fits within each of the four categories, not only


because of the nature of the Ex Post Facto Clause, but


because of the multifaceted nature of the statute of


16

limitations at issue here.


For example, if we look at Calder category


three, which deals with punishments and the laws that are


annexed to the punishment, in the case of Lynce, which I


believe was authored by Your Honor, in that case what was


at stake was not what the State had defined as the


punishment per se, the number of years.  What was at stake


there was that the State itself had granted credits,


overcrowding credits.  They did not even intend to -- to


give a benefit to the defendant there.  And yet it fell


within Calder three because the punishment had been


reduced by laws that were annexed to the crime, the laws


dealing with the overcrowding.


And in that way, one can say if the Court


rejects the principle that this is a material ingredient 

of the offense itself, as California has defined it,


certainly as a matter of punishment, it is a law that's


annexed to that punishment and says, after a certain


period of time, no punishment shall be had.


And that's quite clear under California law


because it is not a waivable right.  In other words, a


person can go ahead and proceed to trial or go ahead and


plead guilty and be languishing in prison and suffering


the punishment and years later discover that he has a


statute of limitation right and assert it then and

punishment shall be had no more.  He must be released. 


And so in that way I do believe it fits within Calder


category --


QUESTION:  That -- that's the law in California,


what you just said, that even though you never raise it as


a -- as an issue in your trial, and you're in -- you're in


prison, many years later you could then come in and under


California law if it -- if the statute had run, you would


be released?


MR. NAJERA:  That is correct, Your Honor.  That


-- that has been held over and over in California since


its early days and reaffirmed in particular in the McGee


case which was seminal in California and which defined it


not just merely as a matter of defense, not just merely as


a -- as a right of the defendant, but also as a matter of 

jurisdiction for the court.  And in that case, they made


it very clear that since no offense could be stated, no


jurisdiction could be had by the court.


QUESTION:  Then -- then what was the effect of


the Frazer case?


MR. NAJERA:  Well, the Frazer case certainly


tried to redefine the history, I believe, of -- of the


California law.  And I might note, of course, that it


dealt with a subsequent statute of limitations enacted


well after the statute of limitations applicable to

petitioner in this case and reinforced by 805.5 in 1985.


QUESTION:  So did the Frazer case overrule some


of this California doctrine on statute of limitations that


you've just told us about?


MR. NAJERA:  It certainly overruled cases such


as Sobiek which had held that, in fact, this was a


violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  While calling it a


matter of legislative grace, they did not touch cases such


as Zamora which occurred in 1976, the same year that the


statute of limitations would have expired here, that


reaffirmed that this was in fact a substantive right.


And I might note that even while using the


language legislative grace, this Court in Weaver said even


if good-time credits are given as a matter of legislative


grace, it does not bar application of ex post facto, and 

so such credits cannot be taken away, even though they had


not, in that particular case, been earned.


QUESTION:  Mr. Najera, could -- could you


explain to me -- I -- I understand your argument that this


falls within the fourth category of Calder because you


have to produce more evidence under the -- or I'm sorry --


less evidence.  It alters the amount of evidence necessary


for conviction.  Before the statute, you -- you had to


show that the crime was committed by an earlier date and


after this, you don't have to show it was committed by


19

that earlier date.


But if that's the case, what I don't understand


is why it makes any difference whether this increase -- or


decrease in the amount of evidence necessary to convict


occurs before or after the old statute of limitations has


run.  In either event, it -- it amounts to a decrease in


the amount of evidence necessary to convict.


MR. NAJERA:  Well, there's certainly an argument


that can be made, and -- and I know that amicus has -- has


in a footnote addressed that.


My -- my belief is that what must be shown is


not a particular number of years per se, because that can


be altered I believe.  What must be shown by the evidence


before the -- before a court is that because the number of


years requisite of the statute of limitation has in fact 

passed, therefore the case is no more.  So, yes, one does


consider the number of years, but the number of years only


matter as to whether or not the statute has, in fact, run


in that particular case.


QUESTION:  Well, I hear you but I -- I don't --


I don't really --


QUESTION:  I suppose you could also say that


even though literally it would apply to both situations,


there's a longstanding tradition of not applying it in the


case where the statute has not run, and so you would

construe that exception rather narrowly.


MR. NAJERA:  That is correct.  The State of


California throughout has told all of its citizens you no


longer need to keep your guard up because the statute has


run.  If you have evidence, you don't have to preserve it. 


If you have letters that might be of some support in your


case, you don't have to maintain them.  If you have


witnesses, you no longer need to know where they are or --


or how to get a hold of them.  And that only --


QUESTION:  Am I correct -- just so I get your


view on it -- am I correct that with respect to an


unexpired statute of limitations where there's an attempt


by the legislature to extend it, the law is really very


well settled that that's permissible?


MR. NAJERA: 


Yes, and in particular in 

California because in the same year that the Sobiek case


was decided, in which the court said it is a violation of


ex post facto to revive an expired cause of action, in


that same year they decided People v. Snipe, which was an


extension case.  The statute had not yet run, and the


court there had no problem saying there is no ex post


facto problem there.


If -- if I might continue, and I would like to


attempt to address all -- all the relevant categories.


Turning to category number two, for example,

there we deal with a situation in which a crime is


aggravated or enlarged and the opposition says, well, this


only deals with punishment.  Well, in one respect all


Calder categories deal with -- ultimately with punishment. 


Nevertheless, it is a situation that is simply not


redundant to the other categories.  It is a category unto


itself.  And -- and even though there does not appear to


be a great deal of case law on the point, one must still


ask the question, when is a -- when is a case aggravated


in a fashion that doesn't merely mirror one of the other


Calder categories, and I believe it's when the


jurisdiction is increased, when persons who fall outside


of the statute become ensnared in it.


And if I might, unless there is an additional


question, at this point I would like to reserve the 

remaining time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Najera.


Ms. Gaard, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANET GAARD


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. GAARD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


Based on new evidence that children who have


been sexually abused often delay reporting the crimes for


substantial periods of time, the California legislature

extended the statute of limitations for the most serious


of these offenses and it expressly made the law


retroactive.  This law does not violate the Ex Post Facto


Clause or the Due Process Clause.


Turning first to ex post facto, this law does


not criminalize conduct that was innocent when it was


done.


QUESTION:  Before you go through the four


categories, might I just ask this general question?  What


if the defendant had been pardoned, would it be an -- an


ex post facto violation to -- for the legislature to say


we're going to now make it subject to prosecution?


MS. GAARD:  No, Your Honor, it would not violate


the Ex Post Facto Clause.


QUESTION:  And why not?


MS. GAARD:  Because what we're looking at with


those four categories is what the law was in effect at the


time the crime was committed, whether or not it was an


innocent act that was later criminalized.  A pardon has no


effect on the -- whether or not the act was innocent at


the time it was committed.  So I would say that is like an


ex -- a statute of limitations, that there would not be a


change in the ex post facto.


QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  I really didn't


understand.  You say that the pardon would be treated

differently than the statute of limitations.


MS. GAARD:  No.  It would be treated the same


for ex post facto purposes.


QUESTION:  Oh, it would be treated the same.


MS. GAARD:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And what about a general amnesty for,


say, illegal aliens coming into the country and then


Congress passes a statute saying we will forgive the crime


and you cannot be prosecuted?  The same analysis there


too?


MS. GAARD:  With an amnesty, I don't -- I


believe it would be the same with the ex post facto. 


There may be some separation of powers issues.  There may


be double jeopardy issues, and there may be due process


issues. 
 I suppose it would depend on the circumstances. 

QUESTION:  Well, why would those issues be


different in that situation than in this situation?


MS. GAARD:  I believe that they actually would


be very similar, but it would depend.  I think sometimes


amnesties are conditional or some --


QUESTION:  No.  Unconditional in my hypothesis.


MS. GAARD:  An unconditional?


QUESTION:  Just like a pardon but a legislative


decision.


MS. GAARD:  Then what you would look to would be

due process there, which you also can look to with an ex


post facto change.


QUESTION:  Then why can't we look to due process


in this case?


MS. GAARD:  I don't think that you look to


substantive due process.  I believe that what was


expressed earlier is when we have an explicit textual


source of protection, which we have here, you don't look


to substantive due process.  The protection comes by way


of procedural due process.


QUESTION:  But that would be the same for the


pardon and the amnesty.


MS. GAARD:  Yes, I believe it would be, Your


Honor.


QUESTION: 


And another preliminary question. 

You started out by saying these are very troublesome kinds


of cases.  But the argument that you're making, I take it,


is across the board.


MS. GAARD:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Doesn't -- it could be -- it could be 


pickpocketing and -- and the argument would be the same.


MS. GAARD:  Without violating the Ex Post Facto


Clause --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. GAARD:  -- yes.

 And the Ex Post Facto Clause has been


interpreted in terms of the four Calder categories.  What


I'd like to do is -- is focus primarily on categories one


and four which this Court has said are mirror images of


each other.


The first category prevents the State from


making an act that was innocent when it was committed


criminal at a later time.  It provides fair warning so


that citizens are able to assess whether or not to engage


in certain conduct.  And it's related to guilt or


innocence.  The statute of limitations has no relation to


guilt or innocence.  It's a defense that's raised that


says whether or not the defendant committed the crime, the


State is not going to be able to prosecute.


And when you look at whether or not the crime 

existed, what you look at is the definition of the crime


as set forth by the elements.  And I would refer the Court


to the Frazer opinion, footnote 22, where the California


Supreme Court has said, whatever its nature for various


State law purposes, the statute of limitations is not an


element of the offense insofar as the definition of


criminal conduct occur.


The California Supreme Court has said that the


crime that's at issue in this case is set forth in Penal


Code section 288, and the statute of limitations has no

relation to that.


Interplaying with the category one is category


four.


QUESTION:  May I ask you before you get to four? 


May I ask you just to spend a -- a moment on something


that -- that hasn't been the focus of much?  And that is


category two that -- that refers to ex post facto as


something that makes greater or more serious a -- a crime


that was previously defined.


It seems to me that there are two sort of


indexes of seriousness in a crime.  One is the -- the


penalty in the strict sense that is -- is provided for it,


but another index seems to me, the period of time after


its commission that a person who committed it is liable to


be prosecuted.  That is a judgment about seriousness.  And


that judgment is being changed here.  Why doesn't it


offend the second category?


MS. GAARD:  I believe when you're talking about


increasing the punishment, what -- what the -- the cases


have looked at is the punishment that exists at the time


of the crime.  And it really is the actual punishment


whether or not the term of a punishment is 1 year or it's


20 years, and I don't think that there's authority --


QUESTION:  But -- but that isn't exactly the


term that at least that -- that Calder used.  I mean, it

-- it -- Calder states -- I'm -- I'm looking at the


quotation on page -- page 6 of the -- 8, rather, of the --


the Government's brief.  It -- it refers to every law that


aggravates a crime or makes it greater than it was when


committed.  And it seems to me that the -- that the


aggravation greater concept isn't necessarily limited to


the index of punishment, and it -- it could refer to the


-- to the index of seriousness that -- that exists in the


period of liability to prosecution.


MS. GAARD:  The second Calder category, if we


look back at the historical basis for that, comes from the


creation of a new punishment that wasn't in effect at the


time.


QUESTION:  Well, that just replicates the third.


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  That makes it totally redundant.


MS. GAARD:  Well, I -- I don't think so because


the second one was, for example, where the new punishment


that was imposed was banishment which didn't exist at the


time as a penalty for the prescribed crime.  The third one


is the increase in the punishment.  But creating a new


punishment, I don't think that holding a defendant liable


for a longer period of time is the type of punishment that


this Court has looked at when it has applied those cases.


What we're looking at is the purposes of the Ex

Post Facto Clause, which is to provide fair warning so


that he knows whether or not he should commit the crime.


QUESTION:  Well, the same -- that's here. Isn't


that here?


MS. GAARD:  Excuse me?


QUESTION:  I mean, isn't that present here, at


least in respect to the evidence?  I mean, a person as --


as -- for example, this particular defendant you would


like to prosecute, among other things, for crimes that


were committed in your view 43 years before the present --


before the time of indictment and 22 years anyway since


the statute of limitations expired.  It's quite possible


that during that time people would have thought that they


didn't have to keep records, that they didn't have to keep


all the evidence, that they might not have to defend 

themselves.  And of course, there's something to be said


on the other side, but also memories can be revived


through hypnosis.  Is this such a case?


MS. GAARD:  This is not such a case, and in


fact, the California --


QUESTION:  Yes, all right.  So -- so then I --


but -- but there -- they could be, and sometimes those are


inaccurate.  So people feel that they are free not to keep


the evidence after 22 years.

 MS. GAARD:  If you're --


QUESTION:  -- what I'm -- I'm trying to trigger


your reaction as to some of these fairly obvious points as


to --


MS. GAARD:  I guess you have -- you have touched


on a couple of things.  First is repose and second is


potential for prejudice.  And the potential for prejudice


exists because of the passage of time, not necessarily


because of the retroactive change.  So the fact that the


evidence may be somewhat stale is a function of the mere


passage of time, and as the Court is aware, there -- the


State could impose no statute of limitations so we could


have a case that was 40 years out and that would be the


same issue.  But in terms of --


QUESTION: 


But the point -- the point, of 

course, is that -- that in Calder v. Bull, the Justice


says, all these and similar laws are manifestly unjust and


oppressive.  And some of the purposes here, particularly


the ones on evidence and so forth, seem to be about the


kinds of things you're talking about.


MS. GAARD:  The Court has said, and similar, but


this Court has repeatedly held, most recently in Carmell


in 2000, that the four Calder categories are the outside


parameters, and that a law, to be ex post facto, needs to


fall within one-fourth of -- one of those four.

 And in terms of the prejudice, there is


protection --


QUESTION:  But the Calder category in -- in


Carmell, the opinion of the Court said that category


covers instances where the Government refuses after the


fact to play by its own rules, altering them in a way that


is advantageous only to the State to facilitate an easier


conviction.  If that was the Court's most recent


description of the fourth category, this case would seem


to fit in it.


MS. GAARD:  But I believe what the Court said


there was that what was impermissible or unfair was


undermining a presumption of -- of innocence, and that's


not relative when you have a statute of limitations. 


Innocence is of no import.


So what the Court said was in Calder category


one, you cannot change the elements of the crime


retroactively, and in Calder category four, it said you


can't change what the prosecution has to prove with


respect to those four -- or those elements.  So you can't


change the presumption of innocence, which the Court spoke


to in the Cummings case, and you can't lower the


sufficiency of the evidence required to prove the elements


of the crime, which is what the Court was saying in


Calder.

 And in fact, if you find that changing this


would -- would implicate the fourth Calder category, then


you may want to look at Gut v. Minnesota where the Court


held that a change in a venue did not implicate any of the


four Calder categories.  And if you were to change venue,


that would also change the fourth Calder category which


this would.


And also --


QUESTION:  May -- may I ask you this -- this


question?  Obviously, the -- you know, the -- we're


engaged in kind of a definition of what the categories


mean, as well as an analysis of what you have.  Would you


agree that if we do not fit this case within one of the


Calder categories, that -- and -- and we accept your


position, that we will have to overrule Hale and -- and 

Henkel, the -- the case holding that -- that in fact, the


-- the Fifth Amendment cannot be pleaded once the -- once


the statute has expired?


MS. GAARD:  No.  I think what that would be is


so long as the statute of limitations has expired and not


been revived, that there is no present threat of


prosecution --


QUESTION:  Oh, in other words, the -- one could


be required to present evidence against himself and then


the next morning the State could say, hey, we've had a

great idea.  We're going to extend the statute of


eliminations -- the statute of limitations and prosecute


you for what you just admitted to under the authority of


Hale and Henkel.  Is -- is that your position?


MS. GAARD:  Yes, but I think that you would have


to suppress that statement because it would be unfair. 


That would be an act of misleading by the State to say you


would have to -- to testify and then we're going to use it


against you.  So as we said, we don't believe this fits


within the -- one of the four Calder categories, but the


protections come by way of -- or the procedural component


of the Due Process Clause, that if in fact there has been


actual prejudice, the -- the defendant may raise that as


he may in any instance where there is a pretrial delay,


and then the court will weigh that versus the reasons for 

the delay, which is the test that this Court --


QUESTION:  Would -- would that -- and I -- and I


think this is your position.  That would equally be true


if the statute is extended before it has expired.


MS. GAARD:  Yes, it would be.  Whenever there's


pretrial delay, you use the test that the Court enunciated


in Marion and reiterated in Lovasco, and that's where we


believe the protections come here.  This case is before


the Court on a demurrer.  There has been no allegation by


the defendant that he's been prejudiced in any way in his

ability to present a defense.


QUESTION:  But your strongest argument against


Justice Souter's initial point, which I thought was --


that the word aggravated -- every law that aggravates a


crime, treating that as a kind of catchall where, in fact,


it isn't literally within the other three, but from the


point of view of purposes, it's the same.  The argument


against treating that aggravating a crime as a kind of


catchall is?


MS. GAARD:  I don't think that that was the


intent at the time that this was --


QUESTION:  And the evidence that it wasn't the


intent?


MS. GAARD:  If we look at the historical basis


for this, it was the creation of a --


QUESTION:  It -- it was the banishment matter.


MS. GAARD:  It was the creation --


QUESTION:  But you could treat the banishment


that they were referring -- that one thing or that they


were treating it as a catchall.


MS. GAARD:  Yes.  It was the creation of a new


punishment.  I don't think they had -- that it was meant


to be a catchall, and this Court has never interpreted it


to be a catchall.

it isn't?


MS. GAARD:  It has not said it is not, as far as


I'm aware.


QUESTION:  Thank you.


MS. GAARD:  And I think that Justice Kennedy


mentioned about the extensions, and one of the things that


you need to look at is when you're -- you're deciding


whether or not an extension of the statute of limitations


that isn't applied retroactively violates the Ex Post


Facto Clause, we look to a defense that existed at the


time the act was committed.  And if he had a 3-year


statute of limitations at the time the act was committed,


you would be changing the evidence, if you followed his


theory, from 3 years to an extended period, whether or not


it was an extension or a revival.


So we don't think that that would work, and this


Court would actually have to overrule a long line of cases


saying that extensions are also permissible.  And the --


the Federal district -- or courts of appeals, several of


them have spoken about the fact that the statute of


limitations is not the type of element that we're looking


for to determine whether or not there has been a change in


the --

criminal area.  In the civil area, you can very easily


waive the statute of limitations if you don't plead it at


the right time or if you make a counterclaim based on the


same facts, et cetera.  In -- in the criminal system, are


statute of limitations routinely held waived?

QUESTION:  Or -- or on the other hand, after the


fact and a prisoner could say I forgot there's a statute


of limitations here and -- and bring collateral attack?


MS. GAARD:  May I answer?


QUESTION:  Yes, briefly.


MS. GAARD:  In California, the defendant has the


right to a pretrial hearing on the statute of limitations,


and if the court finds that the statute of limitations'


exceptions have not been met, the defendant gets a 

dismissal.  If it goes to trial, the court makes a


determination -- or the jury makes a determination.  They


first find guilt or not guilt, and then they make findings


by a preponderance of the evidence --

please the Court:


California's statute of limitations does not


violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because it does not


violate any of the four Calder categories.


QUESTION:  Mr. Gornstein, may I interrupt you to


ask the same question I did of your co-counsel?  Do you


agree that the rule in this case will apply to pardons and


general amnesties as well?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Insofar as we're talking about


the Ex Post Facto Clause, correct, yes.


QUESTION:  What other clause might apply other


than --


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Well, the -- the legislature


could not undo a -- an executive pardon --


QUESTION:  Why not?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  -- under this Court's decisions. 


Under the Pardon Clause, it has finality that the


legislature can't undo it.  I think the case is Ex parte


Garland.


QUESTION:  What -- what provision of the


Constitution prevents the legislature from authorizing the


-- the prosecution of someone who has been pardoned?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  The provision of the


Constitution that grants the President the power to


pardon.

 QUESTION:  The legislative amnesty.


QUESTION:  And -- and what's the difference with


an amnesty too?  Legislative amnesty.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Can I -- let me -- let me do the


pardon first.


QUESTION:  Sure.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  And then I'll move to the


amnesty.


With respect to a presidential pardon, it is


final with respect to the legislature by virtue of the


Pardon Clause.  The Pardon Clause gives the President the


power to issue a final pardon that the -- the legislature


can't undo.


QUESTION:  Does the word final appear in the


Pardon Clause?  Does the word final --


MR. GORNSTEIN:  It is not, but that's how the


Court interpreted the Pardon Clause in, I think it's Ex


parte Garland, but I'm not sure of the decision.


QUESTION:  And what's the -- what's the answer


with respect to a State pardon?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  There would be a State


constitutional provision usually analogous to that.


QUESTION:  Well, but I mean, I --


MR. GORNSTEIN:  There would not be a Federal --


QUESTION:  Let's -- let's assume the State says

no.  Then -- then there's no problem here.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  If the State -- if the State


says no, then the only question that would arise in a


pardon is if you start to analogize it to a agreement


situation like Santobello because in some pardon


situations, it's like an offer and it has to be accepted. 


You can't just force a pardon on somebody.  And if there's


an offer and an acceptance, you could potentially


analogize it under the due process principle of Santobello


where the government can't withdraw from an agreement


without implicating the Due Process Clause.


With respect to an amnesty, there would not be,


again, an Ex Post Facto Clause violation, and there would


not be a -- any other sort of due process violation,


again, once again, unless it fell into the Santobello kind 

of situation or the Raley kind of situation where the


Government offers something, it's accepted, and then it --


QUESTION:  You -- you assert there would be no


ex post facto violation, but why is it different from the


-- from a statute of limitations running?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  There's no -- there's no Ex Post


Facto Clause violation with a statute of limitations


running either.  That's our position because it does not


violate --

someone after granting them amnesty.  I misunderstood you.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  Yes, yes.


Now, with --


QUESTION:  What is your position on -- on Hale


against Henkel and Brown against Walker?  The Fifth


Amendment.  Can -- can the State say the statute of


limitations has expired, therefore you have to speak, and


then revive the time in which the prosecution can be


brought?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  The premise of that decision is


that you cannot assert the Fifth Amendment when there's no


present threat of prosecution, and there is no present


threat of prosecution when there's an expired limitations


period.  But if the person speaks under compulsion in that


situation, and a statute of limitations is subsequently 

retroactively amended, the Government could not use the


testimony that was secured through compulsion.


QUESTION:  So what is your -- I mean, starting


your basic argument -- I look back.  I see Learned Hand


says that after the period is run, it is unfair and


dishonest to prosecute a person.  It violates the Ex Post


Facto Clause.  After the Civil War, Roscoe Conkling, a


Hawk I think, said when they wanted to revive treason


against Jefferson Davis, he said that the offense is dead


if the statute has run.  It would be ex post facto.

Hornbook law like American Jurisprudence until recently


said absolutely contrary to the Constitution.


So what's changed?  Or are -- in -- in the


Government's view, were all those people -- they weren't


supreme courts, I agree.  But it seemed to be accepted. 


So has something changed or were they all wrong or what's


the view?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  The -- in this Court's decision


in Collins, it recognized there had been some disagreement


about the scope of the Ex Post Facto Clause in prior


cases, and with some courts saying that it goes beyond the


four categories to capture laws that operate to the


disadvantage of the defendant in some important way and


with other courts saying it's limited to the Calder


categories. 


In Collins, the Court resolved that debate 

and said that the Ex Post Facto Clause is limited to the


four Calder categories.  There is not a fifth category of


things that operate unfairly to the disadvantage of the


defendant.


Now, that was the analysis that Judge Hand used


in the opinion that you refer to.  He did not say that


this violates any of the four categories.  He essentially


said this operates to the disadvantage of the defendant in


an unfair way, a line of analysis that this Court ruled


out in Collins and reaffirmed ruling it out in Carmell.

 The same thing is true of the State court


decision that Judge Hand referred to in the first in the


line of those decisions, Hart v. Moore.  It frankly


acknowledged that this law, changing an expired


limitations period, does not violate any of the four


Calder categories.  It said, though, we are going to go


with the spirit that underlies the Ex Post Facto Clause. 


Well, again, this Court's decision in Collins absolutely


rules out that line of analysis.  In order to find an Ex


Post Facto Clause violation, you must find that it


violates one of the specific Calder categories.


QUESTION:  I didn't think that Hand or American


Jurisprudence or the cases or Roscoe Conkling or the civil


or any of these things said one thing one way or the other


about whether it fell within the categories.  I'm not sure


I'm right on that, which is why I'm raising it.  And --


and if I -- if I -- but if I am right, can you use the


second category, anything that aggravates a crime?  It


seems to aggravate a crime to say that this crime would


have been prosecuted for 3 years and then we change it


retroactively and say it could be prosecuted for 50 years. 


I mean, that seems to aggravate the -- so what is your


response to those --


MR. GORNSTEIN:  On the --


QUESTION:  Am I right in thinking they were

silent?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.


QUESTION:  And two -- no.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  In Hart v. Moore, which is the


key precedent that Judge Hand referred to, it's just an


1880 case, the -- the Court said that it doesn't violate


the four Calder categories.  And so it -- it relied on the


spirit underlying the clause.


In the case of Judge Hand, he didn't undertake


an analysis under the four categories, but he undertook


the kind of a catchall fifth category analysis that some


of this Court's cases suggested was possible at the time,


but that the Collins case said is not.


Now, with respect to the question of category


two, category two, this Court explained in the Carmell 

decision, is traced to Wooddeson's discussion.  Wooddeson


said that there are two kinds of laws that affect


punishment.  One of them creates new punishments, another


one increases the severity of the punishment.  And what


the Court said in Carmell is that Justice Chase precisely


adapted those concepts into his category.  Category two is


changing -- creating a punishment.  Category three is


increasing the severity of the punishment.  And that is


the limit of what those two categories involve, and


neither of those are implicated in this case because the

punishment is exactly the same in form and amount as that


which was prescribed at the time of the offense.


QUESTION:  It is odd, Mr. Gornstein, isn't it,


that we take as gospel something that was said en passant


in -- what year was Calder against Bull?  Very early on. 


And the case in fact decided it wasn't an ex post facto


law.  So this was dictum en passant, and it didn't dispose


of the case one way or another.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  But -- but the situation is not


that the -- it is stare decisis from that case.  It is


stare decisis from subsequent cases like Collins and


others which have concluded that Justice Chase accurately


determined the limits of the Ex Post Facto Clause based on


the historical evidence of what the Framers thought,


including Wooddeson and Blackstone and -- and State 

constitutions, and the Framers and other sources that he


relied on.  He was right.  He got it right, and subsequent


decisions of the Court have held that, including Collins.


QUESTION:  What --


QUESTION:  Which Collins also said something --


the recitation in Collins included, nor deprive one


charged of -- with crime of any defense.  It used the word


any defense available according to the law at the time the


act was committed.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.  In -- in Collins, what the

Court said is that -- that prior cases had used that


formulation of any defense and in particular Beazell.  And


what Collins did was to clarify that the only defenses


that are available are those that go to excuse or


justification at the time the offense is committed.  And


it merges it then with the first category which deals with


changing laws and criminalizing conduct that was innocent


when done.  The defenses that -- that are prohibited that


you can't change under the Ex Post Facto Clause are those


that have the effect of criminalizing conduct that would


have been innocent when it was done.


I want to move to the fourth category where some


of the questions have been, and it's critical to


understand the fourth category is closely connected to the


first category. 


It -- it changes what evidence is 

sufficient to show that the defendant's conduct was a


crime at the time he acted, and a statute of limitations


does not operate in that way.  It changes what evidence is


sufficient to show that there has been a timely


prosecution, but it has no effect whatsoever on what


evidence is sufficient to show that the defendant's


conduct was a crime at the time he acted.


QUESTION:  So suppose on that particular point,


the State had a law that said that oral evidence can no


longer be used for conviction after 10 years passes.  And

then it later changed the law to say it can be.  Would


that fall under the fourth category?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  It -- it would, Justice Breyer,


if you said no evidence is sufficient to sustain a


conviction unless it meets certain specifications because


that's going to the crime.  You can't prove up the crime


that way.


QUESTION:  So you just -- what you'd say is


you'd say no oral evidence of child abuse can be admitted


after 10 years, though you can use other forms of


evidence.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  No.  Admissibility is a


different question, Justice Breyer.


QUESTION:  So -- so it wouldn't apply at all


here.


MR. GORNSTEIN:  It wouldn't apply to


admissibility.  Under -- Carmell draw -- drew a


distinction between admissibility and sufficiency of the


evidence rules.  Changes in admissibility rules are


permissible.  Changes in sufficiency of the evidence rules


are not.


Now, explaining further why the fourth category


needs to be read in this way, there are several reasons. 


The first is that's the way the Court has applied the


fourth category.  In situations where there's been a


46

change in what evidence is sufficient to prove the first


-- to prove the defendant committed a crime, it found a


violation, as in Carmell and as in Cummings.  But where


the change was -- there was a change in what was


sufficient to establish some other precondition that


doesn't go back to whether the defendant acted criminally


at the beginning, the Court hasn't found a violation.


And -- and the example is Gut v. Minnesota where


there was a change in the venue rule.  What was changed


there -- change was -- was sufficient to prove venue,


which was a precondition to guilt, but it didn't change


what was sufficient to prove that the defendant acted in a


criminal manner when he acted.  And the Court said that


there was no fourth category violation.


Also, the statutes of limitations for over 100 

years -- all the courts have concluded that if you


retroactively amend an expired limit -- I'm sorry -- an


unexpired limitations period, there's no Ex Post Facto


Clause violation, and in terms of the Calder category


four, there's absolutely no difference between those


statutes and this one.  In both cases, it changes what's


sufficient to show that there is a timely prosecution.  In


neither case does it change what's sufficient to show that


the defendant committed -- when he acted, he committed a


crime.  And that is what category four is about.

 Finally, in Carmell, this Court noted that


category four is a mirror image of category one, and it


said they both work together to prevent subversions of the


presumption of innocence.  And that description of


category four supports the conclusion of the linkage


between four and one that the -- what you're talking about


are rules that change what evidence is sufficient to show


that the defendant's conduct was a crime when he acted.


And that's not -- and the statute of limitations


here doesn't do that.  It changes what's sufficient to


show that there's been a timely prosecution.  It doesn't


change in any way what's sufficient to show that the


defendant committed a crime when he acted.


If the Court has no further questions --


QUESTION:  I have one question. 


Other than the 

reference to the language in the four categories, is there


any precedent of this Court supporting the Government's


position?


MR. GORNSTEIN:  The -- the only precedent -- and


it's mild precedent -- is the Stewart v. Kahn decision


where the Court was examining a retroactive tolling period


during the Civil War, and the Court -- the issue actually


before the Court was the civil component of that.  But in


the course of discussing that, Justice Stevens, the Court


mentioned that the criminal component of it was also

criminal, the Court said there's no constitutional problem


with that.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.


Mr. Najera, you have 4 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERTO NAJERA


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. NAJERA:  Thank you, Your Honor.


I'd like to, first of all, answer one question. 


It's clear by California law that post-conviction, a


person can raise, either by habeas or other appellate


relief, the statute of limitations claim.  That's been


clear since Ex parte Vice and was reaffirmed in the McGee


case.


Turning to the Collins question, the real import


in Collins was not to get caught up in distinctions or


labels such as substantive versus procedure, and it would


seem that if we began to draw such distinctions here, we


run ultimately into the same problems.  And it would seem


to me that if Collins stands for the proposition that


affirmative defenses, defenses which the defendant has the


burden of establishing, are protected, why are not


defenses that the district attorney must disprove such as


the statute of limitations?  For this has always been, in


49

California, the burden upon the prosecution to show that


the statute has in fact not run.


Also, it seems that the State wishes to shift


the burden and foist it upon the petitioner and says,


well, we can address this in procedural due process, while


in fact that, as I said, foists the burden onto the


petitioner when the burden in fact lies with the


prosecution.


And in the Marion case, Supreme Court case, the


Court reaffirmed that an irrebuttable presumption of harm


occurs by such delay, and that's by way of the legislative


act.


Finally, I'd like to note that not only would


finality be upset in these particular cases, but really


what we're talking about is respect for the laws.  Every


day in this country citizens make bargains with -- with


the State, and the State makes bargains with its citizens. 


It did so by creating a statute of limitations.  And every


day, particularly in the criminal field, most, the vast


majority of the accused enter into bargains.  They plea


bargain.  They give away their rights and accept a


bargain.  And we hold them to that.  We hold them


accountable for what they bargain.


Are we here -- if we accept the State's


position, are we here to hold the State to a lesser


50 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005 

standard than we hold to what many consider the meanest


and lowest amongst us?  I would think not.  I think we


would expect the State and the Federal Government to stand


for something more, to be the leader and not the follower,


to have a standard higher or at least equal to that of


which we expect of each of our accused, each person who


pleads in this particular case.


I would ask, as I said in the beginning, that


this Court hold the State to the bargain that it chose to


make, to the terms that it chose to define by creating the


statute of limitations.


And if there are no further questions, I will


submit the matter.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Najera.


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 12:16 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
