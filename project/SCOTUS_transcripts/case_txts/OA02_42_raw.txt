CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in number 02-42, Franchise Tax Board of California


versus Gilbert Hyatt.


Mr. Leatherwood.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF FELIX LEATHERWOOD


ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it


please the Court:


Respondent has prompted the Nevada courts to


extend their authority over California's tax process.  The


Nevada court has said at Joint Appendix 138, the entire


process, of FTB audits of Hyatt, including the FTB's


assessment of taxes and the protests, is at issue in this 

case, end quote.  This has been said to mean, at Joint


Appendix 138, that the tax process is under attack.


This lawsuit interferes with California's


capacity to administer these taxes.  The administration of


taxes is a core, sovereign responsibility from which all


functions of State Government depend on.  It is protected


by immunity laws of common-law tort lawsuits, like the


kind presented by Respondent.


California has invoked the protection of its


immunity laws, but the Nevada courts have allowed

respondents laws to proceed, not by extending full faith


and credit.  And this refusal threatens our constitutional


system for cooperative federalism in violation of Article


IV, Section 1 of the United States Code.


QUESTION:  Mr. Leatherwood, may I ask you a


threshold question?  Some of your friends in this case


have invited an overruling of Nevada against Hall.  Of


course, California was favored by that decision.  Do you


join in the plea to overrule Nevada v. Hall, or do you say


this case is different because it involves core sovereign


functions?


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Justice Ginsberg, we do not


join in the chorus to overrule Nevada v. Hall.  This case


is different.  This case goes to footnote 24 of Nevada v.


Hall. 


It's our feeling that Nevada v. Hall is good law in 

the sense that it does -- it does not implicate another


state managing another state's core sovereign function. 


It's -- Nevada v. Hall was strictly an automobile


accident.


QUESTION:  But the comparison would be between


the university, education, which was the -- which was the


defendant, and the tax authorities.  Both of those,


education and tax, seem core.  Or if you're going to


compare the tort itself, it would be a comparison between


negligent driving, on the one hand, and going into another

state and committing -- you know, peering through windows,


going through garbage, totally wrongly getting all the


neighbors to reveal private information, et cetera.  So


comparing the particular acts, what's the difference, or


comparing sovereign functions, what's the difference?


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  I mean, compared -- I thank


you, Your Honor -- in comparing the sovereign functions --


QUESTION:  Education versus tax.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Yeah, and driving an


automobile in another state's -- on another state's


highway --


QUESTION:  That's not the sovereign function.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  That's not --


QUESTION:  I'm saying that --


MR. LEATHERWOOD: 


-- the sovereign function. 

QUESTION:  -- it seems like that's apples and


oranges to me.  That is, in the one case, we're looking at


the acts they're complaining of, and here the plaintiff is


complaining of acts that took place in Nevada that were


miles outside what would be reasonable.  I'm not saying


he's right, but that's his complaint.  In Nevada v. Hall,


they were complaining about negligent driving.  So what's


the difference there?


Or, alternatively, in Nevada v. Hall, it was a


driver who worked for a university, and here it is an

investigator who works for the tax board.  So what's the


difference there?


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Well, to answer the Court's


question directly, the most significant difference is that


the tax function is -- is much more significant than the


education function.


QUESTION:  Well, that's -- that -- that --that


would be a very difficult premise for us to say, that


education is somehow secondary.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Well --


QUESTION:  You're -- you're saying Nevada can't


have a great university -- can have a great university by


keeping its people within its own borders.  They can't go


to California to get information to solicit, to recruit


students? 


That -- that would be a very difficult decision 

for us to write on that premise.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  No, Your Honor, I would agree


with you that that would be a difficult --


QUESTION:  For the State of California to argue


that education is not a core state function is, to me,


rather astounding.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  No, Your Honor, I'm not


arguing that education is not a core sovereign function. 


What I'm arguing is that taxation is an essential core


sovereign function since that education cannot move

QUESTION:  Well, Mr. --


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  -- to provide taxation.


QUESTION:  -- Leatherwood, we -- this Court


tried to follow a core state function test under the Tenth


Amendment.  And in Garcia, kind of gave it up, didn't it,


as being an unworkable thing.  Now, why would we want to


resurrect that here?  And why is it that you don't say,


well, if the Court wants to overrule Nevada v. Hall,


that's fine; I'll win.  I mean, I don't understand your


position.  You're asking us to go back to a test that we


rejected under the Tenth Amendment in Garcia, but you


don't want to say, sure, if you want to overrule Nevada v.


Hall, be my guest.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Yes, Your Honor.  Justice


O'Connor, what we are attempting to say here is that this


case is more analogous to this Court's jurisprudence in


the area of the Federal Tax Injunction Act along the line


of fair assessment -- the fair assessment cases, where the


Court has directed that the Federal Government will back


off on trying to manage state taxes.


QUESTION:  There you have a specific act of


Congress that tells the Federal Government to back off. 


And I don't believe you have any such thing here.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  But we do have the Full Faith

and Credit Clause, which directs that a state is to


recognize the public acts of another state.  And we do


have an immunity law applicable here, and this directs


that Nevada should respect the immunity laws of the State


of California.  And the immunity law, in this particular


instance, provide absolute immunity for conduct as


undertaken in a -- in a tax audit.  Anything that's


associated with tax audit, is protected.


QUESTION:  But Nevada did recognize California


law to the extent it was similar to Nevada's -- that is,


saying you had immunity from the negligent acts.  And then


it went on to say, no, you don't have immunity from


intentional acts, even though California law does give


immunity from intentional acts.  But surely you wouldn't


go to the extreme that you would say someone could come 

over to Las Vegas from California and just beat up


somebody because they haven't paid their taxes, would


they?


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Absolutely, I agree with the


Court on that point.  The --


QUESTION:  Why not?


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  -- the extension of that --


QUESTION:  Why do you agree on that point?  I


don't understand that?


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Because the extension of our

immunity law does not cover physical torts or torts --


QUESTION:  Oh.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  -- outside the scope --


QUESTION:  I see.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  -- of course, the scope of --


of the -- the acts that are incidental to --


QUESTION:  I see.  So under California law,


there would be -- that would be actionable; whereas, under


Nevada law, here, what they're doing is actionable.  You


just want to use the California standard rather -- rather


than the Nevada standard.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Well, in fact, Your Honor, if


they would use the Nevada standard, use the same standard


that Nevada applies to its own taxing agencies, then this


case would be on a hold. 


What Nevada has done in this 

particular case is that it has gone outside its own


precedent and applied a different standard to California


taxing agencies, and it's not --


QUESTION:  But that's not what they're -- the


Nevada court said, we're going to treat the tax collectors


from anywhere who come in to our state and act here, and


we're going to -- the Nevada Supreme Court said, we're


going to apply our rule, and our rule is negligence,


there's immunity; intentional, there isn't.  So you're


asking us to discredit or disbelieve the Nevada Supreme

Court when it said, the law we apply to tax collectors who


act in this state is the same as we apply to Nevada tax


collectors.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Your Honor, I am not asking


this Court to not believe the Nevada Supreme Court.  But


what I'm saying is that Nevada has published precedent, as


recent as 1989, where it requires that a taxpayer forego


bringing a lawsuit until they -- until there has been --


until there's a resolution of all statutory procedures.


QUESTION:  Oh, but this -- but Nevada Supreme


Court, I thought, made very clear that what they were


dealing with is tortious conduct, harassing conduct. 


They, in fact, refused -- Nevada Supreme Court refused to


decide where this man was domiciled, because that would


interfere with the ongoing procedure in California on the 

tax liability.  I thought that the Nevada Supreme Court


had made it clear that they were dealing with the way


their resident is being harassed and not with where he was


domiciled on a magic date.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Your Honor, what has happened


in this particular case, 97 percent of the conduct that


occurred during the course of this audit occurred in


California.  And, quite naturally, what Nevada is -- what


Nevada is doing is permitting Mr. Hyatt to go behind the


actual tort and make a collateral attack on the tax

itself.


QUESTION:  Well, that may be, but the that isn't


the issue that we've got in front of us here.  I mean, the


question in front of us is not how far can the Nevada


courts go in reviewing California's tax practice.  The


issue before us is, among others, in a claim of tort


against your -- your operative in Nevada, for the manner


in which the tax is collected is their absolute immunity. 


And, you know, maybe the Nevada courts are going too far


in discovery, but that's not the issue in front of us.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  I would absolutely agree with


the Court that the issue is whether or not Nevada was


obligated to apply our immunity laws with respect --


QUESTION:  All right.


MR. LEATHERWOOD: 


-- with respect to conduct 

undertaken incidental to this audit.


QUESTION:  May I go back to Justice Stevens'


question, because I'm not sure of your answer to it.  What


if the State of California passed a statute tomorrow


morning saying the use of thumbscrews in tax collection is


authorized?  Is -- would your answer to Justice Stevens'


question be that -- or wouldn't your answer to Justice


Stevens' question be that if you went into Nevada and you


used thumbscrews, you would be entitled, on your theory,


to absolute immunity?  Isn't that correct?

 MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Your Honor, no.  What I'm


saying is that, under that particular theory, I do not


think that you could pass law in the State of California


that will essentially sanction a crime, and there was no


crimes committed within the course of this audit.


If the  -- if an auditor commits an intentional


tort, such as a burglary or a trespass in Nevada or in


California, it's -- it's our position that that particular


conduct is not incidental to --


QUESTION:  It doesn't matter.  I mean, we're


trying to get the -- we're trying to get the analysis of


it, and I'm having exactly the same problem.  Imagine that


there, California did say there is absolute immunity, even


if you beat somebody up, absolute tort immunity.  Okay? 


Even for beating people up. 


Now, suppose they did have 

that; you could prosecute it as a crime.  Now you're in


Nevada, and they say, the plaintiff, he beat me up, he


came across the state line, down from Lake Tahoe.  He was


in a bad mood, lost too much money at the casino, and he


beat me up.  All right?  Now, can Nevada bring that


lawsuit or not?  That's, I think, what Justice Stevens'


question was.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Well -- well, I understand


that, Your Honor.  My position is that even though that


law does not exist in California --

 QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  -- but applying --


QUESTION:  If it did.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  -- applying it -- my -- our


particular theory --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  -- that, yes, we -- then


Nevada would be obligated under the Full Faith and Credit


Clause to apply that particular law.  But --


QUESTION:  And, therefore, you could not bring


the lawsuit in Nevada about somebody beating somebody up.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  If --


QUESTION:  If that were the law in California.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  -- if that were -- if that was


the case.  But --


QUESTION:  Yeah, okay.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  -- in this particular case,


that's illegal in California and that's illegal in Nevada.


QUESTION:  So how, then, do we reconcile that


position, where we're back to our starting place, with the


fact that he could bring an action if on his way down from


Lake Tahoe in the state car, he happened to drive a little


negligently and ran somebody over?  I mean, that's Nevada


v. Hall, just reverse the states.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  No, and we're agreeing with

Nevada v. Hall.


QUESTION:  I know.  So this is why we're having


a problem.  It's clear that if our tax collector, on his


way down from Lake Tahoe, runs over a Nevada resident, the


Nevada resident can sue and apply Nevada law.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Yes, I --


QUESTION:  You say, if, in fact, that same tax


collector beats up somebody, and the California law is


that you cannot sue, Nevada cannot apply its own law.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  That's not what I'm saying,


Your Honor.  I'm saying if that conduct -- if that conduct


is connected to the actual audit itself, then it's


protected.  But what I'm saying, I cannot possibly see,


under any possible theory, that a beating, that it -- that


breaking into someone's house could actually be part of 

the assessment -- tax assessment process.  If an auditor


engages in that kind of behavior, the auditor is not


covered under the absolute immunity.  That is outside the


scope of that --


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  -- of that statute.


QUESTION:  And is the reason that the answer is


different in the two cases, the reason that there is


something special about tax collection or is the reason


that there is a closer connection in the hypo of the

beating up for tax collection than the driving the


automobile for tax collection?


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Well --


QUESTION:  Which is it?  Is it the nature of the


tax collection or the nature of the activity which leads


to the tort liability?


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Well, I think it's both, Your


Honor.  Well, first of all, tax -- tax collection, by


definition, is an intrusion of someone's life.  The


allegations alleged here are principally invasion of


privacy, disclosure of information, that sort of thing. 


Ninety-seven percent of that conduct occurred in


California.  You cannot possibly investigate or prosecute


Mr. Hyatt's case without intruding into that tax --


QUESTION: 


Mr. Leatherwood, if I understand your 

position, it would be exactly the same if a hundred


percent of the conduct had occurred in Nevada.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  That


-- but -- but --


QUESTION:  But the problem I have -- may I just


ask this question.  Assume there is a -- there's a


difference between Nevada law and California law, as I


understand it.  Some things are actionable against a tax


people in one state and not the other.  Why is it, in your


view, that if the same conduct had occurred six months

later, but by Nevada tax collectors instead of by


California tax collectors, because he's been in both


states and probably is subject to tax in both, Nevada


would allow the suit against its own tax people but not


allow it against the California tax people?  Why does that


make sense?


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Well, Your Honor, in this


particular case, as I've indicated, according to our


reading of Nevada precedent, published precedent, that


they would not permit this lawsuit to proceed until the


tax process has been concluded.  With respect to -- to


directly answer your question, it does not appear that


Nevada would prosecute its own -- would permit a


prosecution of its own agents in the case where the


allegations are principally that there is an intrusion 

into Mr. Hyatt's life or that there --


QUESTION:  Well, we understood the reasoning of


the Nevada Supreme Court to say they would.  I think -- I


must have misread the opinion.  Is that --


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  No, absolutely not, Your


Honor.  I don't think you misread the opinion.  What I


think the Nevada Supreme Court said is that they will


permit intentional tort prosecution of government


employees.  This case does not involve a government


employee.  This case involves a government agency itself,

a tax agency.  And under Nevada law, you cannot proceed


against the Nevada tax agency without first exhausting


your administrative and statutory remedies to contest the


underlying tax itself.


QUESTION:  But certainly this sort of thing


isn't the kind of thing you could have exhausted your


remedies on, is it?


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  In


our -- in our -- it is our position that this entire --


the entire lawsuit is linked up to our tax process,


because the conduct that the Respondent is complaining


about here is that the tax itself is -- the tax itself and


the tax process is engaged in bad faith.  And I would --


QUESTION:  Now, what is -- was your answer to


the question? 


Suppose that this tax collector were 

driving negligently in Nevada --


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Part --


QUESTION:  Suppose the tax collector were


driving negligently in Las Vegas.  It's very important for


the tax collector to go examine the record, and he's


driving negligently.  What --


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  I think, under Nevada v. Hall,


he would be -- he would be subject to negligent liability. 


It's not connected to a core silent function because the


function here is -- the function here is a tax

investigation, whereas, driving is something that you can


investigate independent of the tax process itself.


QUESTION:  So suppose that we -- we conclude


that footnote 24 does not provide sufficient guidance for


us to have a stable jurisprudence and that you will lose


unless Nevada versus Hall is overruled.  Would you then


ask us to overrule Nevada versus Hall?


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  I know you don't want to entertain


that possibility, but suppose that's what we conclude.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Well, we -- we've thought


about this, Your Honor, of course, and we would accept a


win, if that's the Court's direction, through overruling


Nevada v. Hall, but it's our contention that the Court


doesn't have to go that far to get -- to get to this 

point.  The Court can literally analogize to the special


protections that are provided to state tax systems within


the federal system itself.


QUESTION:  But then that, as I suggested


earlier, is a difficult thing to do, because there are


congressional statutes that mandate that here.  And all we


have is the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  Now, perhaps


you say that's sufficient, but isn't it possible that


there might be other emanations of the Full Faith and


Credit Clause, other than just footnote 24, or whatever it

is, in Nevada against Hall.  I'm not talking about


overruling it, but developing it, perhaps.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Yes, Your Honor.  I would


agree with that.  Of course, we think that Nevada's


failure to recognize or give dignity to California's


immunity statute is not only a violation of the Full Faith


and Credit Clause, but is a hostile act, and this kind of


hostility is contrary to our whole concept of --


QUESTION:  What -- what about a congressional


statute?  That is, suppose the opinion read -- what would


your objection -- I know you'll object to this possible


opinion, and I want to hear what your objection is -- the


opinion says they're complaining here, as far as we're


concerned, with a serious tort, invasion of privacy, you


know, a whole lot of really bad behavior, et cetera --

they're complaining about that taking place by a


California official in Nevada, and we can't really


distinguish that from the automobile accident taking place


in Nevada.  They're both torts.  They're both very bad --


you know, this is worse conduct.  Now, it's true that our


investigation of this may interfere with California's tax


authority's ability to sort of run investigations in


general.  But if that turns out to be a problem, a big


problem, Congress can legislate.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Well, that still creates --

that still creates the situation where Nevada is


supervising and managing California's tax practices.


QUESTION:  Back to activities happening in


Nevada.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Yeah.  In this lawsuit -- this


lawsuit is -- is being prosecuted -- is being investigated


almost exclusively in California.  The -- the intrusion


here, the interference here, is that Nevada has permitted


Mr. Hyatt to use this lawsuit both as a -- as a wall and a


battering ram.  It has almost suppressed the entire


California tax investigation.  It's creating an entire


class of possible plaintiffs that can sue California just


for literally going across the state line and making an


inquiry as to whether or not a former California resident,


a former California taxpayer, actually owes any taxes. 

QUESTION:  Well, they would have to show its an


intentional -- whatever that means under Nevada law -- not


just negligent wouldn't they --


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Well, the intentional act here


is that California created a tax system in bad faith to --


bad faith to extort an exit -- an exit tax from -- from a


taxpayer.


QUESTION:  I thought that, again, the Nevada


Supreme Court said, we are not going to touch the question


of where this man was domiciled.  That's for California to

decide.  What we are dealing with is this new thing.  One


allegation was trespass and going through the man's trash,


and another was calling -- maybe the calls emanated in


California -- calling people in Nevada insinuating bad


things about this person.  And that has nothing to do with


where the man is domiciled.  It's a question that


California is deciding and Nevada says it won't touch.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Yeah, and I would -- I would


direct the Court to Joint Appendix 133, where -- where the


Court would -- the Nevada courts have indicated that


almost all the action in this -- in this lawsuit occurred


in California.  And --


QUESTION:  Well, you -- you recognized that


there were two trips into California.


MR. LEATHERWOOD: 


Actually, Your Honor --

QUESTION:  I mean, to Nevada.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Actually, Your Honor, I


believe there were three trips, and they were short trips


-- they were trips of extremely short duration.


QUESTION:  And what was there about -- on one of


those trips, there was a trespass on his property and


rummaging through his trash.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Well, that's not part of --


that's not part of the allegations of the -- of the


complaint itself.  The complaint is saying that --

 QUESTION:  It was a more -- a more general


interference with his privacy, but those were examples


that were alleged, if not in the complaint, somewhere.


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  No, there has been deposition


testimony that there -- on one of the trips, that the


investigator looked at the timing of Mr. -- of


Respondent's trash delivery and also looked at --


determined whether or not Respondent was receiving any


mail at that particular location.  That does not justify


the pervasive nature and the extent in which this lawsuit


has reached into California and literally attacked the tax


process.


And, once again, I will refer the Court to the


Joint Appendix at page 60, where it is alleged that the


California tax system itself is a -- is a fraud -- that 

is, put together in bad faith for the specific purpose of


extorting an exit tax from former residents who -- as they


leave California.


Well, if the Court has no more questions in this


regard, I would like --


QUESTION:  Do you want to reserve your time, Mr.


Leatherwood?


MR. LEATHERWOOD:  -- reserve the balance of my


time, thank you.


QUESTION:  Very well.

 Mr. Farr, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR


ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT


MR. FARR:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may


it please the Court:


In our federal system, it's recognized that the


states will sometimes have overlapping jurisdiction.  When


that happens, the Constitution allows each state to apply


its own laws against the background principle of comity


where they believe it would be appropriate to defer to the


laws of another state.  And I submit that the Nevada


courts here have applied these principles very carefully.


Nevada, of course, correctly held that they were


not required to apply California's legislative-created law


of immunity. 


At the same time, however, they have applied 

principles of comity to strike out the declaratory


judgment count that would have gone to the very issue that


is being contested in the Florida -- excuse me -- in the


California tax proceeding, which is the date that


Mr. Hyatt moved to Nevada.  And they have also given


California complete immunity for any negligence that it


has committed.


So in this case, it seems to me, the system is


working --


QUESTION:  Mr. Farr, can I ask you, do you think

they were compelled by the Full Faith and Credit Clause to


grant immunity on the negligence claim?


MR. FARR:  That's an interesting question,


Justice Stevens, because Nevada officials themselves have


immunity.  There would be a question, I suppose, of


whether the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires that. 


My general feeling is probably not, but that is really not


a question so much of whether -- a choice of law between


California law and Nevada law, but simply a question of


what Nevada law would apply.  So I don't think that the


Full Faith and Credit Clause itself speaks to that issue,


but I do think principles of comity will traditionally


reach that result.  And, in fact --


QUESTION:  Well, are principles of comity


dictated by the Constitution?  Suppose --


MR. FARR:  They are --


QUESTION:  -- suppose Nevada said they were not


going to grant comity?


MR. FARR:  That's correct, yes.  And I don't


think there is a federally enforceable law of state


comity, but I think that is the system that has existed


essentially between sovereigns for much longer than the


United States is --


QUESTION:  Well, is it your position then the


private plaintiff can always bring suit against a state in

the courts of another state?


MR. FARR:  Well, the first question, of course,


is whether the court has legislative -- the first Full


Faith and Credit question is whether the court in which


the suit is brought has legislative jurisdiction.  So


there is a requirement that that state have


constitutionally sufficient contacts with the law --


QUESTION:  Well, then under due process.  Well,


that's easy to satisfy.


MR. FARR:  So assuming that they've satisfied


that, they are entitled to bring a suit.  Then the


question is whether the state -- and I -- and I believe at


that point the state is free to apply its own laws to


protect its own interests.  I think that's what the Full


Faith and Credit Clause allows. 


And it is the doctrine of 

comity that provides the acknowledgment of the state --


the other state's interests.  And that's typically, in


fact, what's happened since Nevada --


QUESTION:  It's very --


MR. FARR: -- versus Hall --


QUESTION:  -- it's very odd to me that


California can't be sued in its own courts and it can't be


sued in a federal court, but it can be sued in a Nevada


court, which, if we follow that declension really has the


-- has the least interest in maintaining the dignity of

the State of California.


MR. FARR:  Well, there are two -- two factors


here, Justice Kennedy.  First of all, there is the fact


that Nevada has some very real interests of its own, its


own sovereign interests to protect here.  I mean, there


have been torts which were both committed in Nevada and


directed at a Nevada resident.  So, to begin with, before


one gets to the immunity question, Nevada, as a sovereign


state, has important interests in assuring compensation


and also in deterring that kind of conduct.  So the idea


that a legislatively created immunity by another state


should be able to prevent Nevada from protecting those


interests seems inconsistent with the federal system.


Now, if one goes beyond that to the question of


inherent immunity, the very idea that a state should have 

to be subject to sue in the courts of another state, I


think, first of all, as you know, we don't believe that


issue is properly presented on the question presented in


this case.  But if you would like me to address it just


for a moment, I think there -- there are differences if


one looks to the -- to the way that the -- essentially


immunity has been resolved in -- in the course of -- of


the United States.


First of all, in its own courts, it has the


common-law immunity based on the idea that it is both the

king being sued in its own court, and also typically it is


also the progenitor of the law, so to speak, to Justice


Holmes' point.


In the United States, there's -- the courts of


the United States, there's a very specific situation.  At


the time of the convention, the states were, obviously,


forming a new sovereign, and the question of whether that


sovereign was going to grant them the immunity they had in


their own courts or whether that sovereign would be in the


same position essentially as foreign sovereigns typically


were, which is that they did not have to provide


sovereignty except as a matter of comity.  That's The


Schooner Exchange opinion.


But -- so the states, at that point, had a very


real interest in deciding that question, and they did, in 

fact, decide that question, as the court has recognized. 


That is not true with respect to the immunity that they


have had in the courts of other states.


QUESTION:  Is -- how does Alden fit into this? 


In Alden, I take it the court now -- we've held that a


citizen of Maine suing in the State of Maine's courts


alleging that Maine had violated a federal law can't do


it.  Sovereign immunity.  Right?  That's Alden.


All right.  Suppose the citizen of Maine walks


into a New Hampshire court and brings the same lawsuit

against Maine, assuming New Hampshire has appropriate


jurisdiction under its own laws.


MR. FARR:  Uh-huh.


QUESTION:  Do we get a different result?


MR. FARR:  Okay, I think that is not a question


that is within the notion of the question in this case. 


QUESTION:  No, no, well --


MR. FARR:  I'm sorry.  I --


QUESTION:  -- you see, what I --


MR. FARR:  Excuse me.


QUESTION:  -- nonetheless, although --


MR. FARR:  No, I --


QUESTION:  -- what I'm trying to do is -- is


sort out what, in my mind, are a set of impossible


anomalies, and that's why I ask you that question. 

MR. FARR:  I'm sorry.  I started to answer in


the wrong way.


QUESTION:  Go ahead.


MR. FARR:  What I -- I reserve, of course, the


point, always, that I don't believe this is within the


question presented.


QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah, of course.


MR. FARR:  But I actually was going -- what I


meant to say is that I don't think it's the same kind of


question in the sense that I think still when you're

question.


QUESTION:  See, but --


MR. FARR:  That's still --


QUESTION:  -- your answer, then --


MR. FARR:  -- an evolving question.


QUESTION:  -- your answer to my question is


Alden cannot be avoided simply by the Maine citizen


walking into a New Hampshire court and bringing the same


case.


MR. FARR:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  All right.


MR. FARR:  I think that is --


QUESTION: 


And I would guess that's right. 

MR. FARR:  -- still a federal-state --


QUESTION:  All right, assuming that's right --


MR. FARR:  -- I think that is still a federal-


state issue. 


QUESTION:  -- assuming that's right, now, look


at the tremendous anomaly, which you were just about to


address, and I want to be sure you do.  Our citizen of


Maine walks into the New Hampshire court and sues the


State of Maine under federal law.  And the answer is, he


can't do it because of sovereign immunity.  Our citizen of

Maine does the same thing, but this time his cause of


action is state law.  And now you say he can do it.


MR. FARR:  That's right.  And --


QUESTION:  And the only difference between the


two cases is that his cause of action is federal law in


the first case, and he can't sue the state; but state law


in the second case, and he can, which, of course, means


that the law of New Hampshire binds Maine in a way that


federal law cannot.  Now, that, to me, I just can't --


that, to me, seems so anomalous that -- that I'd like an


explanation --


MR. FARR:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- if you can give it.  And you see


how I'm thinking of it as connected here, because the


facts here are just part of that general anomaly. 

MR. FARR:  That's correct.  Actually, Justice


Breyer, I think that's something that the court, to some


extent, addressed in Alden itself --


QUESTION:  Uh-huh.


MR. FARR:  -- in distinguishing the opinion in


Nevada versus Hall, when it noted that when you get into


the situation of a state being sued in the courts of


another state and, as in Nevada versus Hall, under a state


cause of action, you have now implicated the sovereignty


of a second sovereign.  So when one is now looking at the

-- at the issues of sovereign immunity, one is looking at


a different platform of issues and also at a different


historical base.


QUESTION:  But that seems to make their case


even harder.  It would be difficult to conceive that the


framers thought that Virginia could be sued in


Pennsylvania but not in a federal court.  I would think


that the presumption would be that this was an even


stronger case for the exercise of sovereign immunity than


when all of the citizens of the union are involved as in


the Alden situation --


MR. FARR:  Well, I think that --


QUESTION:  -- in the Eleventh Amendment.


MR. FARR:  I mean, I think that there are two


things going on. 


I mean, first of all, the question is 

not whether they can be sued, but if not, why not.  For


example, with Pennsylvania and Virginia, as I'm sure the


Court is aware, had a -- Nathan versus Virginia is a case


in which that very situation came up.  But in the courts


of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Attorney General urged


its own courts to recognize sovereign immunity.  So that


could naturally fit within the idea that Schooner Exchange


has made clear, which is that when you're talking about


co-equal sovereigns of that nature, one is talking about


sovereignty that -- excuse me, immunity that is extended

as a matter of comity, not as a matter of absolute right


of the other sovereign.  And the reason is -- excuse me --


the reason is that if you don't allow the sovereign to


execute its own laws within its own territory, you're


depriving that sovereign of part of its sovereignty.


QUESTION:  Well, doesn't our original


jurisdiction as the states between states bear something


on this question?


MR. FARR:  It bears a little bit.  But, of


course, Article III itself is not a exclusive jurisdiction


provision.  The Section 1251 provides exclusive


jurisdiction with respect to suits between states.


QUESTION:  The idea that the framers would


provide for its original jurisdiction in the Supreme Court


in -- for suits by one state against another suggests they 

thought it might be pretty hard to bring such a suit


anywhere else.


MR. FARR:  Well, and they -- certainly as a


practical matter, they would have been right, Mr. Chief


Justice.  I mean, as a practical matter, it has always


been difficult to bring a suit against a state, either in


its own courts or in the courts of another state.  I mean,


even since Nevada versus Hall, typically states have


granted immunity to other states for when they're sued in


their own courts.  And if they haven't granted absolute

immunity, what they have done, which I think is an


important principle emerging -- emerging principle of


comity, is they have tended to look at their own immunity


to see what kinds of suits could be brought against them


and to try, then, to grant to the -- to the outside


sovereign that same type of immunity.


QUESTION:  Mr. Farr, have you found other


examples around the country of suits by citizens of one


state against another state in the other state's courts?


MR. FARR:  I --


QUESTION:  Is this relatively rare, or is it


happening?  And in what context is it happening?


MR. FARR:  It's relatively rare, and -- but


there have been some suits.  There are a few of them cited


in our red brief, if I can find the page number, pages 38 

and 39.  The -- there are suits, for example, negligence


suits involving the release of dangerous persons within


another state who have created injury to citizens --


QUESTION:  Uh-huh.


MR. FARR:  -- of that state.  There are more


commercial-type things involving contracts or -- one, in


particular, is a it for invasion of privacy when someone


who wrote a book disclosed information.  In general,


though, Justice O'Connor, as I say, some of those suits,


the courts have just said, we're not going to hear them

whether you have a valid cause of action or not.  We're


simply not going to -- going to recognize that in our


courts because of the sovereignty of the defendant.  Other


courts have said, yes, we will open our courts, but we are


going to look to our own immunity to try to have


essentially a baseline to measure the sort of immunity


that we are going to --


QUESTION:  Mr. Farr, are you saying --


MR. FARR:  -- accept.


QUESTION:  -- that that, too, is just a matter


of comity?


MR. FARR:  I do think that that's --

QUESTION: 


-- doesn't the Privileges and 

Immunities Clause of Article IV have something to say?  If


you can treat a tax collector from California differently


from the tax collector in Nevada, you're not giving their


tax collectors equal privileges and immunities in Nevada.


MR. FARR:  If one granted lesser immunity?  Is


that the question --


QUESTION:  Yes.  If one -- you said that the


only stopper was a notion of comity, and I'm suggesting


that you might not be able to treat two officials, one


from out of state, one from in state, to treat -- to favor

to invoke Privileges and Immunities against the courts of


another state, I would think that's right.  Certainly in


the case --


QUESTION:  Is it?


MR. FARR:  I --


QUESTION:  I mean, I thought --


MR. FARR:  I would have thought not.


QUESTION:  -- that would go to individual


liability, but it would -- it would not affect this


question, but I may be wrong.


MR. FARR:  Well, no, I -- that would be my


assumption, also, Justice Souter. 


I think that the -- the 

Privileges and Immunities and Equal Protection are -- are


provisions that apply to individuals who are claiming


discrimination in -- in another state.  I don't think they


would apply directly to a state.


But, as I say, the -- the notion that comity is


-- is something that -- that doesn't have a force, even


though it's not federal enforceable, it seems to me is a


little bit of a misperception.  Because, again, if one


goes back to the notion of the law of nations or separate


sovereigns, comity essentially has been the provision that

governs their relations since well before the convention.


QUESTION:  Well, there is some reluctance to say


that California officials can run amok in Nevada without


Nevada being able to do anything about it.  I suppose if


it were a pervasive practice, Nevada might be able to sue


California in the original jurisdiction under some parens


patriae theory.  I'm not sure about that.


MR. FARR:  Well, I mean, let me suggest a couple


of other possibilities, Justice Kennedy, as well.  I don't


-- I don't know whether the court would take original


jurisdiction of that question or not, but, I mean, the


most direct example of something states could do,


obviously, is they could reach agreements between


themselves.  I mean, there have been two cases before this


court involving suits against states in the courts of 

other states.  One was Nevada in California's courts. 


This is California in Nevada's courts.  If those states,


who are neighboring states, feel that this is an issue


that they need to address, they could reach some sort of


agreement and, therefore, have reciprocal legislation.


And, for example, under the Full Faith and


Credit Clause for years, as the Court may know, there is a


doctrine that said that states didn't have to enforce the


penal laws of another state, even though Full Faith and


Credit, on its face, would make you feel that maybe they

would have to.


But, in fact, states eventually began, through


reciprocal agreements in decisions, and I think in


legislation also, to say, you know, we essentially will


enforce the penal laws or the tax laws of other states, so


long as they do for us.  So, again, the states --


QUESTION:  Penal laws or penal judgments?


MR. FARR:  No, no, penal judgments, the court


said in -- in Milwaukee County, have to be enforced, but


they -- they distinguished at that point, Mr. Chief


Justice, the idea that a law itself would have to be


enforced before it had been reduced to --


QUESTION:  Right, but what -- what -- what is


the -- I don't want to -- I don't want you to get


distracted, because I thought Justice Ginsberg and maybe 

Justice Kennedy and I were driving at the same problem,


which is that imagine Nevada v. Hall is good law.  All


right, now, the question comes up, How do you prevent


Nevada from going wild?  All right.  And so now we have


several answers:  (a), Congress can pass a statute --


MR. FARR:  Correct.


QUESTION:  -- (b) interstate compacts -- that


was what you were suggesting.


MR. FARR:  And -- and --

MR. FARR:  Excuse me.  I don't -- I certainly


don't mean to minimize the theoretical possibility that

a problem, generally.  What I'm suggesting is that there


is nothing, first of all, in the history of the Full Faith


and Credit Clause that would suggest that once a state has


proper legislative jurisdiction, as I think everybody


concedes that Nevada does here, that somehow that clause

was intended to displace the law of that state simply


because another state had made different policy choices


about, let's say, here, compensation and immunity.


QUESTION:  But can you say that categorically


and absolutely?  I mean, there are all sorts of


permutations of facts that could come up.


MR. FARR:  Well, what -- the permutations of


facts, I think, go particularly to what constitutes


legislative jurisdiction.  So perhaps in that sense, my


statement is broader, or seems broader in the context of


this case than I mean it to be.  But I do -- but I do


think, in general, that I don't see any warrant in the


Full Faith and Credit Clause, given the fact that it was


enacted with very little debate, and almost all of the


debate was about judgments and not about enforcement of 

other states' laws, I think it would be stretching the


clause beyond recognition to say that at some point it was


-- it was telling states, you're going to have to set your


laws aside and apply the laws of another state.


QUESTION:  There was a time in the '30s and '20s


when this court came pretty close to that, the cases that


preceded Pacific Employers.


MR. FARR:  That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  Clapper and Bradford.


THE COURT  Yes.

 MR. FARR:  That's correct.  And as I think that


as my argument might suggest, I think the Court was


correct to essentially back away from that kind of


balancing test and essentially go back to the principle of


saying when a state is competent to legislate, then it may


apply its own laws, leaving the additional questions about


what might happen at that point to questions of comity


where a state is the defendant.  And, as I've suggested,


Nevada courts have shown considerable comity already here,


and the case, of course, is not yet concluded.


QUESTION:  Comity is something like a hearty


handshake.  I mean, it -- it's something that you can't


put any -- any force to.


MR. FARR:  That's -- that's true in one sense,


Mr. Chief Justice. 


I mean, when I say it's not -- that 

there's no federally enforceable state law of comity, I --


that's true.  But at the same time, I mean, the Court's


decisions about comity since back in the late 18th century


have emphasized that it is a serious doctrine.  It's a


doctrine built of respect for -- for other sovereigns. 


And in particular -- and I think this -- this is -- also


goes to the practical problem that Justices Kennedy and


Breyer are asking about -- it also does have a healthy


measure of self interest in it.


I mean, when -- when you are talking about co-

equal sovereigns, any sovereign that is exercising


jurisdiction over another sovereign understands that


that's -- the first sovereign -- or the second sovereign


has the same power and authority over it.


QUESTION:  Is -- is the question of comity one


that has a federal component so that this court should


weigh in on when it has to be exercised?


MR. FARR:  I don't believe so state versus


state, Justice O'Connor.  Or course, in the -- in the


types of cases that the board was referring to this


morning, like McNary, there are comity elements.  And


there -- and there is a jurisprudence of this court with


respect to federal and state relations which does depend


on comity, and that is, of course, federally enforceable. 


I don't believe that there is a concomitant enforceable 

doctrine 


--

QUESTION:  But you're arguing --


MR. FARR:  -- state to state.


QUESTION:  Even in the face -- even in the face


of some development by state -- a state court that seems


totally out of whack with our constitutional structure?


MR. FARR:  Well, Justice O'Connor, I suppose I


should --


QUESTION:  Are there no extremes?  Is there no


limitation?

 MR. FARR:  Well, I -- I mean, I'm -- I suppose I


should pause in the sense that -- that if there is


something that is so threatening to the constitutional


structure and something for which there is no historical


basis in -- in terms of the -- the way that sovereigns


deal with each other.  Now, see, that's -- that's where I


think this case is very different, because even though


there was certainly a practical tradition that states were


not to be sued in other states, as I say, since Schooner


Exchange, and, indeed, in Verlinden in 1980, this Court


has always taken the position that when you're talking


about relationships between sovereigns, and they're co­


equal sovereigns, and the issue is immunity between them,


that is a matter of comity.


QUESTION: 


All right, but leave -- say, this 

case, I can easily see on your theory writing the part of


the opinion that says the acts in Nevada, the acts in


Nevada that were arguably torts are certainly up to Nevada


to pursue.  But the discovery commissioner here, they say,


went way too far in ordering discovery and ordered


discovery that would have been relevant only to negligent


action and only negligent action, really, that took place


in California, though a Nevada resident was at issue.  And


they can't do that, says the opinion, because -- because 


-- and now this is where it seems to me there -- something

-- what do I fill that blank with.  They can't do that. 


They can't go over and, in Nevada, complain about


negligent action as this discovery commissioner may have


done, negligent action in California aimed at a Nevada


resident where it's a tax action.  They can't do that


because -- and now what?  You see -- do you see what's


bothering me?


I -- at this point, it seems to me there has to


be something in the Constitution that limits that, and


this case may raise that problem because of the actions of


the discovery commissioner.  And, therefore, I think I


need something to fill that blank with.


MR. FARR:  Well, as -- I don't think, to start


with, that the answer is the Full Faith and Credit Clause.


QUESTION:  All right, what is it?


MR. FARR:  I mean --


QUESTION:  I -- it's an odd -- an awkward


vehicle, Full Faith --


MR. FARR:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- but what is the answer?


MR. FARR:  Well, I mean, I still think that, in


the end, the answer is that this is a matter that one


trusts to the judgment of states --


QUESTION:  So the answer is if they want to do


that, they can do it.

MR. FARR:  -- I mean, that I -- accepting the


characterization, although I dispute it to some extent,


but to the extent there's a question about discovery, that


is simply part and parcel of the states being able to


exercise their jurisdiction.  I don't --


QUESTION:  I thought discovery was --


QUESTION:  Okay.


QUESTION:  -- interlocutory.  I thought that we


couldn't write in an opinion, as Justice Breyer has


suggested, if I didn't think that that question was


currently reviewable.


MR. FARR: 


Well, there's certainly nothing 

specifically in the question presented about discovery. 


The -- the -- the -- again, to come back to the question


presented, because we've discussed a wide range of issues,


most of which I don't think are within the question


presented, but when we come back to the question


presented, the question is basically was the Nevada or the


Nevada courts required to dismiss this action on summary


judgment because of California's law of immunity?  And --


and the reason for that is because, according to


California, the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires

Nevada to enforce California's law of immunity.


QUESTION:  Mr. Farr --


MR. FARR:  Our view is -- yeah?


QUESTION:  -- do I understand -- your comity


argument basically is -- it's kind a self-executing thing,


because each time a state has to answer the comity


question, it asks the question, what would I do if the


tables were reversed?  And as history teaches us, they


generally treat the other sovereign the way they would


want to be treated themselves.  And that's --


MR. FARR:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- well, that's the rule that seems


to have been developed without any overriding


constitutional command order here.


MR. FARR: 


That's correct, Justice Stevens. And, 

in fact, they have become more specific in applying


comity, I believe, in saying we want to treat the other


sovereign as we do treat ourselves, not just as we want to


be treated.  We are treating the other sovereign the way


we treat ourselves.


QUESTION:  What if the -- what if the case came,


and they didn't do it?  Justice Breyer's question, how do


I fill in the blank?  I -- if, let's say, through this


intrusive discovery process, systematically applied, they


really were interfering with California's taxation,

couldn't California bring an original action to enjoin


this interference?


MR. FARR:  I certainly think that's possible. 


And, of course, as I've said, I mean, California can try


to talk to Nevada and try to reach agreement at a


sovereign level about this, or if, in fact -- the Full


Faith and Credit Clause has a specific express commitment


to Congress of the right to declare the effects of other


laws.


QUESTION:  What would be the underlying --


QUESTION:  Underlying --


QUESTION:  -- substantive law in Justice


Souter's proposed original action?


MR. FARR:  The -- I suppose, I mean, based on


what California has said before -- said up to now, it 

would bring it under the Full Faith and Credit Clause,


that it would say that there is some requirement --


QUESTION:  Well, but we wouldn't need an


original action for the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  If


that's so, it could apply in this case.


MR. FARR:  That's correct.  I mean, whether


they're --


QUESTION:  So what's the -- what would an

substantive standard to apply?

MR. FARR:  -- that says --


QUESTION:  -- in boundary cases, though,


adopted, as a federal rule, something maybe different from


the law of either state.


MR. FARR:  That's correct.  Now, you do have --


there are certain cases, in fact, in which you can't have


overlapping jurisdiction, where you can't own the same


water, you can't own the same land, you can't escheat the


same property.  So that's true.  The court has addressed


those kinds of cases.


In a situation where you're simply saying 

another state is applying its laws, I prefer that they


apply our laws, and I'm troubled by the discovery that


they have -- they have allowed in applying their own laws,


I'm not sure what the federal principle --


QUESTION:  It's not simply that --


MR. FARR:  -- is that entitles you to stop it.


QUESTION:  -- it's a prior action pending. 


That's what makes this case different, and one of the


things that makes it different from Nevada v. Hall.  Why


is it -- is the California proceeding ongoing?  Isn't it

normal for a second court to stay its operations so it


won't interfere with that prior action?


MR. FARR:  It -- in fact, the Nevada court


dismissed the declaratory judgment action precisely


because it didn't want to get into the question that was


at issue in the California proceeding.


QUESTION:  Yes, but what about the intrusive


discovery?


MR. FARR:  Well, most of the -- most of the


other material -- with one exception, most of the other


issues involved things that have nothing to do with the


merits of the California inquiry.  I mean, whether


confidential information has been improperly disclosed has


-- is not -- does not require you to adjudicate the


California tax liability in order to understand that.  The


only thing that has any bearing that is close to that, I


submit, is something that is roughly akin to like a


malicious prosecution suit.  And tort law itself, over


time, takes care of that.  We've not gotten to that issue


yet in the Nevada Supreme Court.

 MR. LEATHERWOOD:  Thank you, Your Honor.


In this particular case, I'd like to go back to


Justice Breyer's thumbscrew example.  I don't think the


Full Faith and Credit Clause would actually force Cal --


force Nevada to apply -- apply a California thumbscrew


statute, because that would actually be outside the tax


function.


What I'm saying in this particular case what has


happened is that Nevada's failure to give us back to


California's immunity statute has resulted in interference


with California's tax system.  If this court does not


intervene and give us back to our particular proposed


test, which would look into California to see whether or


not we would grant immunity, then essentially that would


permit any defendant any form of taxpayer to run to the 

border and literally sue the State of California or any


other state to prevent the enforcement of that particular


statute.


In addition, I pointed out that this gives


another state the power to intrude into the actual


operation of another state, and that's what has happened


here.


There has been some -- some discussion as to


whether or not Nevada has legislative jurisdiction.  We


concede that they have legislative jurisdiction over the


50 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005 

tort.  But we -- what we complain about is that they won't


respect our legislative jurisdiction or our tax process


over our immunity laws, and that is our particular


complaint.


We submit the case.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,


Mr. Leatherwood.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
