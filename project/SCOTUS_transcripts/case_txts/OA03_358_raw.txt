 Mr. Kneedler. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr.  Chief Justice,  and may  it 

10  please the Court: 

11

 In  February  of  2001,  an 

international 

12  arbitration panel, convened under the North American  Free 

13  Trade  Agreement,  concluded  that  the  United  States' 

14  continuation  of a  blanket  ban or  a  moratorium on  the 

15  operation of Mexican domiciled  commercial carriers beyond 

16  the border zone in the United States violated NAFTA. 

17

 Soon  thereafter, the  President  made clear 

--

18  excuse me -- his intention to comply with the arbitration 

19  decision by invoking  power specifically vested in  him by 

20  Congress to lift the moratorium in order to comply with an 

21  international trade agreement.  And  the President in fact 

22  did lift the moratorium in November of 2002. 

23

 In this case,  the Ninth  Circuit held that  the 

24  Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration,  an agency in 

25  the Department of Transportation that is limited to a -- a 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

3 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  safety mandate, was  required to conduct an  elaborate and 

2  complex environmental analysis of the President's  foreign 

3  trade and foreign policy decision before it could enter or 

4  issue procedural safety regulations that were necessary to 

5  implement the President's decision.  The Ninth Circuit set 

6  aside  the  procedural  regulations  on  that  ground  and 

7  thereby prevented  the agency from  granting certification 

8  to  carriers  that  under the  President's  decision  were 

9  eligible to receive it. 

10

 The Ninth Circuit's decision is incorrect and it 

11  has frustrated  the  President's ability  to  comply  with 

12  NAFTA. 

13

 Congress  and the  President,  the two  entities 

14  whose  joint  action  brought  about  the lifting  of  the 

15  moratorium,  are  not  subject  to  either  NEPA  or  the 

16  provisions of the  Clean Air Act that  respondents rely on 

17  to require an  environmental analysis.  Accordingly,  the 

18  agency acted entirely  reasonably in choosing to  take the 

19  President's  action as  a  given, including  any increased 

20  traffic or  trade  that might  occur as  a  result of  the 

21  President's  decision  and  to,  instead,  focus  its  own 

22  environmental  analysis  on  the  effects  of  its  own 

23  procedural regulations. 

24

 FMCA's government -- governing statute  requires 

25  it to  grant registration to  any carrier that  is willing 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

4 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  and able to comply with applicable safety, safety fitness, 

2  and financial responsibility requirements.  The agency has 

3  no authority to  deny operating  permission to a  carrier, 

4  foreign  or domestic, based  on environmental  concerns or 

5  foreign  trade  concerns. 

It  has  no  authority  to 

6  countermand the President's decision or to refuse to issue 

7  the  regulations that  were  necessary  to  implement  the 

8  President's decision. 

9

 QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, just  a -- a background 

10  fact.  Perhaps I missed it,  but was there any parallel in 

11  Canada?  We're  talking about Mexico or  Mexican vehicles. 

12  I understood that originally there was the same limitation 

13  for both. 

14

 MR.  KNEEDLER:  There  was.  And  -- and  soon 

15  thereafter,  the  -- the  moratorium  was imposed  in 1982 

16  originally, but it conferred on the President the power to 

17  lift the moratorium, and an agreement was arrived  at soon 

18  thereafter  with  Canada. 

So  since  the  early  '80's, 

19  Canadian  carriers  have been 

--  

have been  permitted to 

20  enter. 

21

 The 

--  

the  moratorium  was  remained  in 

--

22  retained  in effect  by the  President through  subsequent 

23  actions into  the '90's.  In the North American Free Trade 

24  Agreement, the United  States included a reservation  to a 

25  complete opening of the border for  transporter operations 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

5 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  by carriers subject to a  phase-out, initially a phase-out 

2  that would allow carriers from Mexico to operate in any of 

3  the border  States -- that was 3 years after the agreement 

4  was  signed -- and then  by the  year 2000, to  allow the 

5  carriers to  operate anywhere in  the United States.  The 

6  President decided  not to go forward with  that because of 

7  concerns  about whether  the safety  regulatory  regime in 

8  Mexico was sufficient  to prepare the Mexican  carriers to 

9  come into the United States.  So that is the reason why it 

10  was held up. 

11

 And -- and  the basis  of the NAFTA  arbitration 

12  panel's decision was  that a  blanket prohibition on  that 

13  ground was not -- was  -- was not permissible under  NAFTA 

14  and that the  United States  had to consider  applications 

15  from Mexican  carriers on a case-by-case basis.  It could 

16  adopt special procedures  to ensure that the  carriers who 

17  would  be  permitted  to  come  in under  the  President's 

18  lifting  of the moratorium  would satisfy  the substantive 

19  safety standards.  And that is the set of regulations that 

20  are at issue here. 

21

 But it's important to  recognize that these  are 

22  not substantive safety  standards.  The substance -- the 

23  standards  that  -- that  Mexican  carriers, like  -- like 

24  other foreign and  domestic carriers in the  United States 

25  have to  comply with, are -- have already been  in place.

1  All  that  we  are  talking  about  here  are  essentially 

2  procedural or administrative regulations. 

3

 QUESTION: 

Mr.  Kneedler,  can  I  ask  you  a 

4  question?  Because I'm really kind of confused about this. 

5  I'm  trying  to  think  through  the  case. 

Assume  the 

6  President wasn't involved at all  and Congress had decided 

7  to lift the moratorium and enact it and did everything the 

8  President did and said, but before you do  it, we want you 

9  to,  as a  precondition, adopt  these safety  regulations. 

10  Would your position be any different? 

11

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Oh, yes, yes.  And it  -- I think 

12  it's  the  same situation.  The  FMCSA, as  a subordinate 

13  agency in the executive branch, I think would have to take 

14  as a  given that act of Congress just -- just as it was -­

15  it was --

16

 QUESTION:  It  wouldn't be any different.  I -­

17  you -- you -­

18

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

 MR. KNEEDLER:  No, no.  I -­

 QUESTION:  I thought you were saying it's -­

 QUESTION:  Your position would be the same. 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  The same.  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  Oh, well -­

 MR. KNEEDLER:  That's what I -- I'm sorry. 

 QUESTION:  You scared me for a minute. 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  No, no.  I -- I misspoke. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  I'm  sorry.  I  misspoke.  The 

3  position  would be exactly  the same  and -- and  for very 

4  similar  reasons,  that  that's  essentially  a  political 

5  decision, in  the one case by Congress in your example, or 

6  -- or by the President. 

7

 And  -- and  that's  why Congress  traditionally 

8  vests  an authority such as this  in the President because 

9  he is responsible for foreign relations and foreign trade. 

10

 QUESTION:  But -- but in either  event, it would 

11  not have been the kind  of major Federal action that  must 

12  be preceded by an EIS. 

13

14

15

 MR. KNEEDLER:  That's correct. 

 QUESTION:  That's your basic position. 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  That's -- that's correct.  It's 

16  part of  the context in which the agency is operating, but 

17  it would be presumptuous of the agency to take upon itself 

18  a -- a  determination  to evaluate  or  to  second  guess 

19  effectively the President's determination. 

20

 QUESTION:  Well,  but -- but it wouldn't  be a 

21  question  of  second  guessing, would  it,  if  the agency 

22  regulations in question  could reduce  somehow the -- the 

23  impact  that the  -- the  known action  by the  President, 

24  who's pretty  sure this was going to  happen, would cause? 

25  And -- and so  it's  sort of  relevant, it  seems to  me, 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

8 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  whether these rules issued by  the agency could, if  there 

2  had  been an  environmental  impact  statement, have  been 

3  adjusted  in  such  a  way  as  to  reduce  the 

--  

the 

4  environmental  impact.  Is  there any relationship between 

5  these  rules  and  the  environmental  impact  that  the 

6  respondents are concerned about? 

7

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Two things  I'd like to say about 

8  that.  The first  one is  that the  -- that  respondents' 

9  claim in this case and the Ninth Circuit's holding in this 

10  case are  not premised on the  sort of tinkering  with the 

11  application and monitoring rules  that -- that you may  be 

12  referring to.  The -- the premise of the Ninth  Circuit's 

13  decision was that  -- that the President's lifting  of the 

14  moratorium  was  foreseeable  and therefore  FMCSA  had to 

15  evaluate  the 

--  

the much  broader  question  of whether 

16  Mexican trucks should be permitted to come in at all. 

17

 QUESTION:  No, but I mean, my point is it -- it 

18  seems to me obvious  that you don't have to evaluate in an 

19  environmental impact statement something that you have  no 

20  power -­

21

22

23

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Right. 

 QUESTION:  -- to  -- to remedy. 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  As to your second point, 

24  though, that  -- that the agency  might have been  able to 

25  refine  the  regulations  in  some way,  that  is  not  an 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

9 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  argument that respondents made to  the agency.  And  under 

2  Vermont Yankee -- and this is critical to the operation of 

3  -- of NEPA and the corresponding  Clean Air Act provisions 

4  is that  an agency  can only  evaluate or  -- or  identify 

5  errors if they're called to its attention. 

6

 QUESTION:  When did respondents first make this 

7  point?  You say they didn't make it in -­

8

 MR. KNEEDLER:  The -- the first place  that this 

9  point -- it  was really  just in  a sentence -- was in  a 

10  reply brief in the court of appeals that they -- that they 

11  -- that they -- they said that the agency  might have been 

12  -- been able to come  up with some modified version  of -­

13  of the regulations. 

14

 But it's not  very realistic to think  that what 

15  the agency  could do -- could permissibly do -- could have 

16  a significant effect on -- on emissions because -­

17

 QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Kneedler, on -- on  that -­

18  going to  that  point,  I mean,  that  goes  to  something 

19  Justice Scalia raised and I wanted to raise it too.  He -­

20  he  expressed, as a premise  to his question  -- and I had 

21  assumed when I started out on this case -- that the agency 

22  does not have  to prepare an impact statement  which takes 

23  into consideration effects that the agency itself does not 

24  have the authority to avoid. 

25

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Right. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

10 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

 QUESTION:  And -- and I'm looking -- by the way, 

2  I'm on page -- what is it -- 2a of -- of your brief  where 

3  you set out  the statute down  at the bottom of  the page, 

4  Roman  (i).  One of  the  things the  agency  has got  to 

5  disclose  is  the  environmental  impact  of  the proposed 

6  action.  That  I understand.  They could  avoid that in -­

7  theoretically in  -- in the general rule.  They could say, 

8  well, we won't take the  proposed action if it has a  very 

9  bad effect.  And that's consistent  with what he  assumed 

10  and what I assumed. 

11

 But then  you get to  Roman (ii) and  Roman (ii) 

12  says  they've got  to  disclose any  adverse environmental 

13  effects which  cannot be  avoided should  the proposal  be 

14  implemented.  And that seems to be broader.  That seems to 

15  say  if  your  proposal,  which  in  itself  may  be 

16  environmentally benign, is the trigger for action by other 

17  agencies  or  other people,  which is  not environmentally 

18  benign, you've got  to disclose the effects that will come 

19  about  when  you take  the  triggering action  even though 

20  you're  triggering  action  is  clean. 

Am  I 

--  

am  I 

21  misreading that? 

22

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, respondents have not relied 

23  on that  provision, but -- but  my -- my  understanding of 

24  that is that that refers -- that refers to effects that -­

25  that are within the agency's control. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

11 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

 The -- the critical point -- and this -- this is 

2  reflected  in the -- in the  regulations on page  4a, the 

3  things that an agency is responsible for taking account of 

4  under  NEPA, are direct -- things that are directly caused 

5  or  indirectly  caused. 

And caused  is  the 

--  

is the 

6  operative word.  And this Court said  in the Metropolitan 

7  Edison  case that  it's  -- that 

--  

that strict  but-for 

8  causation is not enough under NEPA. 

9

 QUESTION:  But if  -- if that's the -- if -- if 

10  the -- if -- I'll call it (C)(ii) here -- is  -- is being 

11  read in that  way, then I take  it what it means  -- let's 

12  forget  the  presidential action  here.  Let's  just take 

13  conventional government action.  If  you had, let's  say, 

14  six Government agencies,  each of  which on a  coordinated 

15  basis was going to do  something to bring about a  result, 

16  and the effect of the action of each one of those agencies 

17  by itself  really didn't amount to much, but the action of 

18  all  six  together  amounted  to  a  very  great  deal 

19  environmentally,  there never  would  be an  environmental 

20  impact  statement  that  would  take  into  effect  the 

21  cumulative action. 

22

23

24

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Right. 

 QUESTION:  Is -- is that fair to say? 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  And -- and  I was just  going to 

25  say there is a separate  requirement under the -- CEQ  has 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

12 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  elaborate regulations that -- that flesh this out.  And -­

2  and  CEQ has  a regulation  that the Ninth  Circuit relied 

3  upon and -- and respondents  have -- have abandoned  any 

4  reliance on  it, which is that  an agency has  to evaluate 

5  cumulative impacts.  It has to  -- it has  to essentially 

6  evaluate  the incremental contribution that its own action 

7  will make toward a -­

8

9

 QUESTION:  Then why doesn't that apply here? 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Because the -- the -- first  of 

10  all, the agency did that.  It evaluated its incremental -­

11  its incremental impact.  What -- what it did -­

12

 QUESTION:  But I'm talking about the  cumulative 

13  effect.  I -- I thought  -- maybe  I misunderstood  what 

14  you've said. 

15

16

 MR. KNEEDLER:  It -- it --

 QUESTION: 

I  thought  under  the  Council  of 

17  Environmental Quality reg, at some point they had  to take 

18  into effect -- they had to disclose the cumulative effect. 

19

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, if you mean -- if you mean 

20  with the -- the -­

21

 QUESTION: 

The  effect  of  all  the  agencies 

22  together in my hypothesis.  You've got six agencies.  Each 

23  of them does a little thing.  Add the six together.  You 

24  get a big thing.  I thought you were saying that under the 

25  Council on Environmental Quality regs, somewhere along the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, and -- and --

 QUESTION:  -- the cumulation. 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Right, and  -- and what  -- what 

 QUESTION:  So why wasn't it done here? 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the -- the agency  here was 

9  the only one  taking action, and all the cumulative impact 

10  requirement requires  it  to do  is  to isolate  what  its 

11  incremental contribution will be -­

12

 QUESTION:  Well,  that's  under Roman  (i), but 

13  under  Roman (ii) it's  broader, and you  said, I thought, 

14  under the Council  on Environmental Quality regs,  at some 

15  point you've got to disclose the cumulative effect of  all 

16  of it.  So on my  hypothesis, it's -- when -- who  -- what 

17  agency and when has to disclose the cumulative effect -­

18

19

20

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, if -- if there are -­

 QUESTION:  -- and why wasn't it done here? 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  If there are -- if there are two 

21  agencies  working  in tandem 

--  

see, the 

--  

again, the 

22  President -­

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

14 

Alderson Reporting Company

1  but for the fact that the President is not an agency. 

2

 MR.  KNEEDLER: 

If  two  agencies 

--  

if  two 

3  agencies are taking parallel action,  they are supposed -­

4  or  coordinated  action,  they're supposed  to  coordinate 

5  the -­

6

 QUESTION:  Right, and you're saying because the 

7  President is not an agency, that doesn't apply here. 

8

9

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  Right.  And -- and --

 QUESTION:  Now,  does the -- does the Council on 

10  Environmental Quality regulation say that  the -- that the 

11  disclosure of cumulative effect depends upon the action of 

12  many agencies as opposed to the actions of many persons to 

13  which an agency contributes? 

14

 MR.  KNEEDLER: 

It  is

it's 

15  addressed -­

18  more -­

 QUESTION:  Yes, but what is it? 

 MR.  KNEEDLER: 

--  

more -- it -- it includes 

 QUESTION:  But is it --

 MR. KNEEDLER:  It's not  just limited to  other 

21  agencies, but there's an -­

22

 QUESTION:  Then why didn't it apply here?  We'll 

23  assume the  President is not an  agency.  Why  didn't that 

24  requirement apply here? 

25

 MR. KNEEDLER:  The agency did comply  by saying 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

15 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  this is  the context in which  we were acting.  What they 

2  said is we have no control.  And this is the --

3

4

 QUESTION:  Yes. 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  -- literally language.  We have 

5  no control over  what the President  is going  to do.  It 

6  projected -- it  projected increases in  traffic or -- or 

7  increases in trade that might -- might result or discussed 

8  that. 

So  that's  really  what  the  cumulative  impact 

9  analysis requires is to  -- for the agency to  put its own 

10  action in context. 

11

 But  where the agency's  own action is marginal, 

12  which is  the case here, it  can be expected  -- these are 

13  basically  administrative  undertakings  by  the  agency, 

14  application forms, and  -- and on-site inspections.  That 

15 

--  

that  where  the  agency's  own  action  is  going  to 

16  contribute  so marginally  to  environmental impacts,  the 

17  rule  -- the general  rule of  reason under -- under NEPA 

18  does not require an agency to, for -- for example, conduct 

19  a -- a nationwide study of Clean Air Act possible effects 

20  of  Mexican trucks  in  order to  determine  that its  own 

21  contribution is going to be minimal. 

22

 And -- and what -- what -- as I mentioned,  the 

23  agency's contribution  here arises simply  from developing 

24  an application form, a -- a preapproval analysis, on-site 

25  analysis, of -- of the carrier in Mexico in most cases, or

or  on  paper,  and  then  follow-up  monitoring  and 

2  inspections.  And the only  real contribution to emissions 

3  that any of  that would have  are the -- are  the roadside 

4  inspections where  the engine might be -- will be idling a 

5  little bit  while the  truck is  inspected and  the agency 

6  fully evaluated  its contribution  to increased  emissions 

7  for  that  and concluded  that  they would  be negligible, 

8  looked at in that way.  And neither  the Ninth Circuit nor 

9  respondents have ever challenged that. 

10

 And as  I -- as I mentioned, although the -- the 

11  Ninth Circuit treated the President's action as -- as a -­

12  a consequence of what the agency did, the respondents have 

13  receded from that position as well. 

14

 And  they  have 

--  

they  have relied  on  this 

15  appropriations  provision,  section  350,  as  it's  been 

16  referred to in this litigation, which required FMCSA to do 

17  certain things before it could spend any money  to approve 

18  individual applications of carriers that would be eligible 

19  under  the 

--  

under  the  President's  lifting  of  the 

20  moratorium.  But  section  350  reinforces  our  position 

21  because it  reinforces the  proposition that the  agency's 

22  role was limited to safety matters. 

23

 QUESTION: 

Did  350  limit  itself  in  its 

24  directions to the agency to safety matters? 

25

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  There's not  -- there's no

2  in it.  And in fact, what it did is it further constrained 

3  FMCSA's discretion.  Whatever discretion -- and it -- and 

4  it  overrode  or  made more  strict  the  agency's initial 

5  proposed regulations  by requiring  safety evaluations  in 

6  Mexico and stringent evaluations afterward.  It added some 

7  very strict requirements because  Congress wanted to  make 

8  sure that the agency was going to impose -­

 QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler? 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  -- stringent qualifications. 

 QUESTION:  Mr.  Kneedler, can I ask  you another 

12  kind of preliminary question?  I  was just reexamining the 

13  statute that Justice Souter was calling your attention to. 

14  And the  President, of course, is not an agency within the 

15  meaning of  the introductory  paragraph.  Does that  mean 

16  that an  action  taken by  the President  is  not a  major 

17  Federal action within the meaning of subparagraph (C)? 

18

19

20

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, because it -- it -­

 QUESTION:  Because if I'm an agency -­

 MR. KNEEDLER:  They kept  it -- the duty -- the 

21  duty is imposed on the agency.  That's the way it has been 

22  understood.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  And the agency shall  include in

 QUESTION:  It  should  read  any major  Federal 

2  action undertaken by the agency -­

5

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  -- is implicitly -­

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Because it  says include in every 

6  -- the agency in -- in the introductory part shall include 

7  in every recommendation  or report  on proposals or  major 

8  Federal  action. 

I  think  it's  referring  to its  own 

9  proposal for a major -- a major Federal action. 

10

 QUESTION:  And -- and we've  held that?  It's 

11  certainly a  permissible reading of it.  I'm not sure it's 

12  a necessary reading. 

13

 MR.  KNEEDLER:  I don't know that this Court has 

14  ever specifically addressed  it, but  I think that's  been 

15  the common  understanding.  And I think it follows in this 

16  case from the exemption of the President from -- from NEPA 

17  at all. 

18

 And the -- I -- I mentioned before that section 

19  350 serves to confine the  agency's discretion here.  And 

20  the 

--  

the  agency's  decision  that  an  environmental 

21  assessment was  all that  was necessary  and a  full-blown 

22  environmental  impact  statement  was  not  required  is 

23  reinforced in this case by the -- by decisions of a number 

24  of courts of appeals that  have said that where an  agency 

25  does not have discretion, it  does not have to prepare  an 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

19 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  environmental  impact statement  because  the purposes  of 

2  NEPA are really to inform the agency's own decision-making 

3  process and  to inform the public so it can participate in 

4  the agency's decision-making process. 

5

 Where the  agency essentially has  no discretion 

6  about whether to -- to go forward, as the agency here  did 

7  not,  then to  require a  full-blown  environmental impact 

8  statement of -- of clean air issues, which are exceedingly 

9  complex, before the  agency would go  -- could go  forward 

10  would  not further the  purposes of  -- of NEPA  and would 

11  only serve, in fact, to slow down the process of complying 

12  with NAFTA. 

13

 QUESTION: 

Well,  in  fact,  an  agency  could 

14  produce  an  EIS that  said  what  we  propose  to  do  is 

15  disastrous and nevertheless go ahead, could it not? 

16

 MR.  KNEEDLER: 

Yes,  yes.  NEPA  imposes  no 

17  substantive requirement.  But -- but in this  case there 

18  was really a need for  expedition, and it's -- and  that's 

19  -- that's made evident here  by the fact that the  statute 

20  that authorized  the  President  to  lift  the  moratorium 

21  provided for the President to give notice and allow public 

22  comment  for that,  but allowed  him  to waive  that where 

23  expeditious action was  required.  And when  the President 

24  looked  at  the  moratorium  in  November  of  2002,  he 

25  specifically  invoked  that  provision,  dispensed  with 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

20 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  further  opportunity  for  public  comment  because  he 

2  determined that expeditious action was required. 

3

 It's  very  much like  this Court's  decision in 

4  Crosby  several  terms ago  in  that  way  because the 

--

5  although  here it's  a  subordinate Federal  agency rather 

6  than a  State, but  the result  is to  interfere with  the 

7  ability  of  the  President  to  respond  promptly  to  an 

8  international  disagreement  that  had  arisen  out  of  a 

9  foreign trade agreement. 

10

 I did want to spend  just a moment on the  Clean 

11  Air  Act  conformity  analysis  point  which  the 

--  

the 

12  conclusion  on  that we  think  follows directly  from the 

13  conclusion on NEPA. 

14

 Under 

--  

under  EPA  regulations  that  were 

15  promulgated  in  1993, respondent  doesn't  challenge them 

16  here, and the D.C. Circuit  has upheld them.  Under  those 

17  regulations  an -- an  agency is  required  to conduct  a 

18  conformity analysis and  to conform its action  only where 

19  its action  causes emissions,  but beyond  that, where 

--

20  where  the  emissions  are  subject  to  the  agency's 

21  practicable  control and  where the  agency  will maintain 

22  that control through continuing program authority -­

23

 QUESTION:  That is -- that is set forth in  the 

24  regulations? 

25

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  That  -- that -- and that 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

21 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  regulation is set forth in our -- in our brief on  page 8a 

2  of -- of the brief,  the definition of the term,  indirect 

3  emissions, which elsewhere  is described as the  emissions 

4  for which the agency is responsible. 

5

 And in this  case, it's -- it's  very clear that 

6  the  FMCSA does  not have any  control over  or continuing 

7  responsibility for  the President's  decision to lift  the 

8  moratorium, for the determination of whether carriers that 

9  get  registration  will  actually bring  trucks  into  the 

10  United States, what routes they  will travel while in  the 

11  United  States,  and what  emissions  they will  have once 

12  they're in the United States.  Those are all things  that 

13  are beyond the agency's control. 

14

 QUESTION:  Mr. -- Mr. Kneedler, I -- I read the 

15  regs the same way you do.  The -- the interesting thing to 

16  me was,  although it's probably  -- I guess  it's academic 

17  here is that the statute seems to be broader than the regs 

18  because  the 

--  

the  statute  would 

--  

would  require 

19  attention -- and I'm reading from page 45  of your -- your 

20  brief where you set it out in the carryover paragraph. 

21

 The 

--  

the  statute  would 

--  

would  require 

22  attention to -- to anything by -- done by the agency which 

23  would not only cause but  contribute to a new air  quality 

24  -- to an air quality violation.  And I -- I would suppose 

25  even on  the kind of the -- the low-level effect that the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

22 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  agency has disclosed here, idling  motors and so on,  that 

2  the -- that the statute would cover it, although the regs 

3  are narrower and the regs wouldn't cover it.  Do  you read 

4  the statute the same way?

 QUESTION:  Yes, yes. 

 MR.  KNEEDLER:

that  the  agency  adopted 

9  through  notice  and comment  rulemaking,  and the  -- the 

10  preamble to that regulation contains  a very extensive and 

11  persuasive discussion by  EPA about why it's  necessary to 

12  draw a line between the things that -- for which a Federal 

13  agency can be  reasonably held accountable  or responsible 

14  and those  for  which the  -- after  all,  the States  are 

15  primarily responsible in developing -­

17

18

 QUESTION:  Yes. 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  -- implementation plans. 

 And one of the -- one of the things that -- that 

19  EPA specifically concluded, that it's unrealistic to think 

20  that Congress meant that just because you need a permit at 

21  the very outset -- we -- we quote this in our reply brief. 

22  Just because  you need a permit to do something should not 

23  render the  agency responsible for every  subsequent thing 

24  that somebody who gets a  permit might do, get a  driver's 

25  license, for example, doesn't -- yes, it's a precondition

4

 QUESTION:  But  they would have to  disclose it. 

5  I mean, if -- if  you read the statute literally,  without 

6  the narrow -- I  -- I don't mean to  load the dice when  I 

7  say narrowing  -- without  the agency interpretation,  the 

8  statute would  be broad enough at  least to -- to require 

9  this agency to disclose its contribution. 

10

 MR.  KNEEDLER: 

Well,  I  suppose  under  the 

11  broadest reading,  but I think even that might -- might be 

12  a extensive  reading of the regulation.  And let  me also 

13  just say again  that respondents  have not challenged  the 

14  validity of the regulation. 

15

16

 QUESTION:  I know. 

 QUESTION: 

May  I  -- may  I  ask  this  other 

17  question  just  in displaying  my  ignorance of  the whole 

18  problem?  But is it not conceivable that consistently with 

19  the statute, that the agency could be compelled to prepare 

20  an  environmental impact  statement  but nevertheless  not 

21  suspend the -- or nevertheless let the trucks come in? 

22

 MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- it -- it  could voluntarily 

23  do that, but the -- but the -- the case law -­

24

 QUESTION:  No.  Assume you read  the statute to 

25  require  it to  make  a statement. 

Does it  necessarily

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  No,  it -- no, it would  not

 QUESTION:  Which  the converse  of that is  that

10  remain.

14  President, so it's a very unusual case. 

15

 MR.  KNEEDLER:  But

but even  in  the non­

16  presidential  case  where  an  agency  does  not  have 

17  discretion,  because  the EIS  is  designed to  inform the 

18  agency's decision-making power, and if it really has no -­

19  no  latitude  in  its  decision-making,  it  would  be 

20  essentially pointless to prepare it. 

21

 QUESTION:  Yes,  but assuming  it was an  agency 

22  that had some  discretion in the matter,  my understanding 

23  is  it  -- it  can't  go ahead  without  first making  the 

24  environmental impact statement.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  No, that's true, but -- but we do 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

 QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Kneedler. 

 Mr. Weissglass, we'll hear from you. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN WEISSGLASS 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and  may it 

12  please the Court: 

13

 Congress  gave FMCSA  important choices  to make 

14  about safety before  any trucks come over  the border from 

15  Mexico.  Those choices will determine which trucks come in 

16  and how many. 

17

 The reason  for that  is because  as the  safety 

18  rules  are made more stringent,  fewer trucks will be able 

19  to meet the requirements and those that do will be newer. 

20

 QUESTION:  But this wasn't  your argument.  Your 

21  argument was,  as -- as I  understood it, that  the reason 

22  the EIS had to be prepared was not because  there would be 

23  any substantial  environmental impact  from the  nature of 

24  the  safety standards,  but because no  trucks at  all can 

25  come in  until -- until the agency  comes out with this -­

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

26 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  with these standards.  Isn't that right? 

2

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  The  -- the  argument is  that 

3  because Congress promulgated section 350 -­

4

5

 QUESTION:  Right. 

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  -- no  trucks can come in until 

6  the agency makes these safety choices. 

7

 QUESTION: 

Okay. 

Therefore,  that's  a 

8  consequence of the  agency action.  Therefore,  the agency 

9  has to do an EIS. 

10

 MR.  WEISSGLASS: 

That  is  correct.  And  in 

11  addition, the -­

12

 QUESTION:  Now, just let me  ask.  The  -- that 

13  happens because the President's action  is triggered by or 

14  cannot occur until the agency takes this action. 

15

 Suppose  you  have  a mad  millionaire  who  has 

16  applied for a -- a license from the Federal Communications 

17  Commission and there are others who are competing  for the 

18  same license,  and he announces that  if he is  denied the 

19  license and the license is  given to somebody else, he  is 

20  going  to unleash  a flood  of trucks around  the country, 

21  pouring out emissions and -- and  greatly affecting the -­

22  the air  quality throughout  the country.  Does the  FCC, 

23  knowing that  this is going to be the consequence of their 

24  granting the license to this particular individual -- does 

25  it have to do an environmental impact statement?

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  The -- the question -­

 QUESTION: 

Concerning,  you  know,  what  the

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  The -- the only question  is

16  he's going to do it.  He really is crazy. 

17

18

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  The -- the critical point is -­

19  is  whether  the agency  has  a choice  about  the -- the 

20  options that  it is  going to  take.  If  the agency  has 

21  control over  what it's going to do, and in the reasonably 

22  foreseeable -­

Then -- then  the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

28 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  question  just  becomes  foreseeability,  and  if  it's

 QUESTION:  That's absurd. 

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  But that -­

 QUESTION:  Fine.  Now, suppose -­

 QUESTION:  That is so absurd. 

 QUESTION:  -- instead of  the mad  millionaire, 

13  what the -- we have the mad millionaire.  But now what the 

14  statute says is every license  that's issued for safety -­

15  safety purposes -- has  to be a stamp that you  put in the 

16  car,  and then there's  a rule  that says, no  stamp shall 

17  issue until the  Post Office Department certifies  it will 

18  be red or blue.  All right?  And moreover, there could be 

19  an  environmental impact just  from the  red and blue.  I 

20  mean, one reflects the --

21

 Now, the Post Office knows that  if it tells you 

22  what  color it is, then they'll  have it, and if they have 

23  it, they give out the license.  And if they give out  the 

24  license, the  mad millionaire is going to  let loose smoke 

25  throughout  the Nation. 

Does that  mean  that the  Post 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

29 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  Office  Department has  to write  an environmental  impact 

2  statement about the mad millionaire?  No.  The answer  is 

3  clearly no.  Isn't it? 

4

 But the only problem is your theory doesn't tell 

5  me why. 

6

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  The -- the reason is this.  In 

7  -- in this case the agency has significant choices to make 

8  about safety.  Congress -­

9

 QUESTION:  And  so does the  Post Office.  It's 

10  going to  be red or blue.  Now, the  relationship between 

11  the red and  blue choice  and environmental being  wrecked 

12  through  the smoke of  the mad  millionaire is zero.  And 

13  now, you  want to  say that's  not true  with this  safety 

14  regulation.  So explain why. 

15

 MR.  WEISSGLASS: 

Because it's 

--  

it's  what 

16  Congress -- it's how Congress set up the -- the situation. 

17  Congress  said that  no  trucks come  in until  the agency 

18  makes  these  choices  and  Congress  gave  the  agency 

19  discretion  about those  choices  and those  choices  will 

20  determine which  trucks come in and how many and therefore 

21  the environmental effects. 

22

 Now,  just because the  -- there is  -- there is 

23  another actor that has to  make decisions and has to  take 

24  action before there will be any environmental effects does 

25  not remove this from major Federal action.

 QUESTION:  But the Ninth Circuit seemed to me to

the  agency's decision  related  to  whether this

upon the 

7  environment.  It has no bearing  upon whether the  -- the

14  of the program to decide  whether the ski resort is  going 

15  to be built. 

16

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  The -- the difference  here is 

17  that  the  agency has  significant  choices to  make about 

18  safety.  It can determine, in fact, how many older trucks 

19  are going to be coming in.  And it's the older trucks that 

20  are more polluting.  And -- and -­

21

 QUESTION: 

No,  but  can't  the -- isn't  the 

22  agency's discretion to determine whether older trucks come 

23  in or not a discretion  which is supposed to be  exercised 

24  on  the  basis  of  safety  considerations  rather  than 

25  environmental considerations?

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  But that's the point  of NEPA, 

2  that -- what  NEPA says is just because you  have a safety 

3  agency  doesn't  mean  it  can  divorce  its  safety 

4  considerations from  the  environment.  It  doesn't  have 

5  to -­

6

 QUESTION:  Those safety  considerations that are 

7  within its  control that would  be affected by  its safety 

8  regulations are minimal.  I don't think anybody  said that 

9  this  would have been a  major Federal action requiring an 

10  environmental  impact  statement  if  there  were  nothing 

11  involved except whether  these safety  rules are going  to 

12  cause more pollution or not.  Your -- what you're using to 

13  require the EIS is the fact that, boom, once they come out 

14  with their  safety rules, floods  of -- of  Mexican trucks 

15  come into the country. 

16

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  That's part of it,  but the -­

17  but it's also true  that what the  agency does can -- can 

18  have  a  huge  effect  in terms  of  how  many  trucks are 

19  actually going to come over.  Even if you assume that some 

20  trucks are  definitely going to come over, what the agency 

21  does is -- is going to have a big effect. 

22

 The agency specifically says  that the rules are 

23  going to target high-risk trucks  -- and this is from  the 

24  environmental  assessment  -- to,  quote, bring  them into 

25  compliance  with United  States  safety and  environmental 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

33 

Alderson Reporting Company

1  laws.  The agency  knew that  there was  this correlation 

2  between safety  and the  environment.  And we're  talking 

3  about tens of  thousands of  trucks, and  a Mexican  fleet 

4  that is skewed much older than the U.S. fleet. 

5

 QUESTION:  Well,  don't -- don't the  rules have 

6  to  be such  that American trucks  and Mexican  trucks are 

7  treated alike? 

8

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  I -- there's -- actually the -­

9  the arbitral  panel in  NAFTA specifically  said that  the 

10  U.S.  could  treat Mexican  trucks  differently  than U.S. 

11  trucks as  long as it  has a good  reason.  But  the Court 

12  doesn't even -­

13

 QUESTION:  But doesn't it -- I mean, would it be 

14  a good reason -- I mean,  I take it you're here not  being 

15  against Mexicans.  You're against environment. 

16

17

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  We're for environment. 

 QUESTION:  So if  in fact -- yes.  I  mean for 

18  environment. 

19

20

 (Laughter.) 

 QUESTION:  You're against bad environment.  All 

21  right.  We're all against that. 

22

 Now, if  in fact it turns out that there is some 

23  kind of problem, is -- does the agency have the  power to 

24  say if  there's too  much smoke  or there's  too much  bad 

25  effect, we want American trucks to have to tighten up too?

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  Was  that your  position in front  of 

5  the agency? 

6

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  The agency  does have that 

--

7  that power.  The -- the -­

8

 QUESTION:  All right.  Then do they also have to 

9  study the impact of the American trucks? 

10

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  If -- if the agency takes major 

11  action with respect to emissions of U.S. trucks, yes. 

12

 QUESTION: 

No, no.  But  I mean,  here you're 

13  saying that this 350 requires them to start looking at all 

14  the smoke  and so  forth that  comes up  from the  Mexican 

15  trucks because  their safety regs could have  an impact on 

16  that.  Well, if  in fact  the overall  framework of  this 

17  inquiry  is to  make  certain that  we  don't pollute  the 

18  environment or that we're safe in a context where Mexicans 

19  and Americans are to be treated alike,  wouldn't they have 

20  to go into the whole thing? 

21

 MR.  WEISSGLASS: 

No,  because  the  agency 

22  rulemakings that we challenge deal solely with the -- with 

23  -- with trucks coming over from Mexico.  Now, if they were 

24  to do a rulemaking about  U.S. trucks, then that might  be 

25  an issue.  But this is relating solely to Mexico.

 And -- and there are numerous -- numerous things 

2  that the agency  can do that -- that -- about safety of -­

4  will cause  the older trucks that  are both less  safe and

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  Yes.

 MR.  WEISSGLASS:  The  -- there  were  numerous 

13  comments to  the agency about safety, and the agency, as I 

14  mentioned before -­

15

 QUESTION: 

But  to  say  there  were  numerous 

16  comments  about  safety  doesn't  certainly  answer  my 

17  question. 

18

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  The -- the agency said that it 

19  was going to target high-risk  trucks to be in  compliance 

20  with safety and environmental laws.  And because the rules 

21  only deal  with safety,  that's a  concession that  safety 

22  choices affect the environment.  Nothing else needed to be 

23  told to the agency. 

24

25

 QUESTION:  Well -­

 QUESTION:  So your -- your answer to my question 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

36 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  is no  I guess, that you did not  press on the agency this 

2  point.  You say the agency already knew it.

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  The -- right.  The agency knew 

4  it and the  public was not required to cause the agency to

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  The -- the agency knew that -­

12  that older trucks are  both less safe and  more polluting, 

13  that there's a correlation -­

14

15

 QUESTION:  Between pollution and age. 

 MR.  WEISSGLASS:  And 

--  

and that 

--  

and it 

16  specifically -­

17

 QUESTION:  And was that  brought to the agency's 

18  attention as  one of the things that they should take into 

19  account in -- in their safety rules? 

20

 MR.  WEISSGLASS:  The -- the agency had  it -­

21  said it in  its environmental assessment  and what I  just 

22  said.  And the public commented that the older trucks are 

23  more polluting.  And the agency  admits it's a  matter of 

24  common sense that the older trucks are less safe. 

25

 QUESTION:  The  agency did take it  into account 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

37 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  in its  environmental assessment and concluded  that there 

2  was  no significant  environmental  impact  just from  the 

3  content of its rules, and therefore they didn't have to do 

4  an EIS. 

5

 And I -- I had thought that it was not that call 

6  that you're  challenging.  I had thought  that what you're 

7  challenging is  that may well be  true, that -- that just 

8  from  the  content of  the  rules, there's  no significant 

9  impact. 

However,  the rules  trigger  the  presidential 

10  action which  lets in the Mexican  trucks and that  is the 

11  significant  environmental  impact. 

Wasn't  that  the 

12  accurate -- an accurate description of your case? 

13

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  Yes, both  that and the choices 

14  that  the  agency  makes  which  will determine  not  only 

15  whether any trucks come in but how many. 

16

 QUESTION:  Not the choices alone.  I do -- I do 

17  not -- I do not understand you to have claimed that purely 

18  on  the basis  of what  safety choices  the  agency makes, 

19  there is a  significant impact upon the  environment which 

20  would be enough to  trigger a requirement for an  EIS.  Is 

21  -- is that claim made in your -­

22

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  We absolutely did -- did make 

23  that claim in -- in -­

24

 QUESTION:  All right.  Can you point to that? 

25  Because that  -- to  me, that's  what your  answer to  the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

38 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  problem, you  know, with the decal color.  It -- it really 

2  depended on that.  And I do believe that they're saying -­

3  and on that one,  it seems to me, look, you  have choice A 

4  at the agency,  B, or C, and  this is more  polluting than 

5  that and the other  isn't.  I don't see why  they wouldn't 

6  have to write  an EIS for that.  But I think  that's what 

7  they're saying you never raised before the agency. 

8

 So could you tell me or could I get somewhere or 

9  is it  in here  the place  that's particularly before  the 

10  agency where all this was gone into and raised? 

11

 QUESTION:  And  too, where it was  raised before 

12  the Ninth Circuit. 

13

14

 QUESTION:  Yes. 

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  If I could, I'd  like to start 

15  with the Ninth  Circuit.  We raised it in our reply brief, 

16  as Mr. Kneedler said.  And the Ninth Circuit passed on it. 

17

 QUESTION:  No, no.  But that's not  the issue. 

18  The issue really is the agency for me. 

19

20

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  Okay. 

 QUESTION:  I mean,  where -- where before  the 

21  agency was it raised? 

22

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  The -- the agency, as  I said, 

23  agreed  there's this  correlation between  safety and  the 

24  environment.  There -- the public did not need to tell the 

25  agency what to  do with that because  Vermont Yankee makes 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

39 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  it  an  obligation  of  the  agency  to  consider  every 

2  significant  aspect of  the environmental  effects of  its 

3  action.  This is not a  situation like in  Vermont Yankee 

4  where someone raised an issue about  unchartered territory 

5  and refused  to clarify.  The  agency has  an affirmative 

6  obligation to take  this into account  because it had  the 

7  predicate facts in front of it. 

8

 QUESTION:  All right.  Are you saying  we didn't 

9  raise  it before the agency?  The reason we didn't is that 

10  we didn't have to.  All we had  to do was raise it when we 

11  appealed from the agency.  Is that your answer? 

12

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  You said it  much better than I 

13  could.  Yes. 

14

15

 QUESTION:  Okay. 

 QUESTION:  But  if that's your answer,  then you 

16  didn't raise  it, and then the  question would be  does an 

17  agency have  to have figured  out here that  its different 

18  alternatives in front  of it  might have had  differential 

19  environmental impacts  that they didn't  take account  of. 

20  Now, how am I going to answer that question?

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  Because -­

 QUESTION:  What -- what -- go ahead. 

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  Because -- thank you, Mr. Chief 

8

 Because in the  joint appendix at page  193, the 

9  agency admits  this correlation,  and it  was also  record 

10  evidence before the agency that the Mexican  fleet is much 

11  older than  the U.S. fleet, that the older trucks are more 

12  polluting.  And so it stands to  reason -- and -- and this 

13  is what  the  agency  has  to  do  when  it's  considering 

14  environmental effects is  look at what its  safety choices 

15  are going to do in terms of the environment. 

16

 QUESTION:  Well, why  did -- why did  you wait 

17  until the  petition for rehearing  in the  Ninth -- Ninth 

18  Circuit to raise it before that court? 

19

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  It wasn't rehearing.  It was on 

20  a  reply  brief. 

It was  in  response  to  the agency's 

21  admission in its  opposition brief that the  stringency of 

22  the standards does have this effect. 

23

 QUESTION:  What -- here  is -- here's  what the 

24  Ninth Circuit said.  DOT's assessment that its regulations 

25  will cause  emissions below  the amounts  specified in  40 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

41 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  C.F.R. 93,  thus excusing  it from  making a  conformitory 

2  determination is based  on the predicted emissions  in its 

3  EA.  As we have already determined, however, DOT failed to 

4  conduct  a reliable environmental  analysis because of its 

5  illusory  distinction  between  the  effects  of  the 

6  regulations themselves, which  is what we've  been talking 

7  about, and the  effects of the presidential  rescission of 

8  the moratorium. 

9

 It seems  to me  it was  essential to the  Ninth 

10  Circuit's decision  that you  have to  take into  account, 

11  before 

--  

before  you  win, the 

--  

the  impact  of the 

12  President's decision.  The  Ninth Circuit did not  base it 

13  just on the effects of the regulations themselves. 

14

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  The -- and the Ninth  Circuit 

15  also said  that the  -- the  environmental assessment  was 

16  inadequate  for,  quote,  not  considering  additional 

17  alternatives  such  as,  for  example,  proposing  more 

18  stringent controls on incoming Mexican  trucks.  The Ninth 

19  Circuit clearly recognized that there was this correlation 

20  between a stringency  of the  rules and the  environmental 

21  effects. 

22

 Now, it's very important  to understand that the 

23  way Congress set this up  was it's not that the  agency is 

24  somehow overriding a presidential decision.  There are two 

25  separate  and independent decisions  here.  The President 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

42 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  has authority over trade issues the way  Congress gave him 

2  that authority.  But the Congress  at the same  time said 

3  that the agency has  authority over safety issues.  These 

4  are two separate things. 

5

 QUESTION:  Yes, it's true that the Ninth Circuit 

6  said just what you  said it said,  but it was quoting  the 

7  general requirement, I think, which  exists in the way you 

8  describe it.  And here, I guess the  question is, is given 

9  their environmental assessment, had they failed to fulfill 

10  that requirement and so it would require somebody to point 

11  out to  them, look at this environmental assessment.  This 

12  environmental assessment  is not adequate  to fulfill that 

13  requirement  that we  all know  exists.  Now,  what about 

14  that? 

15

 MR.  WEISSGLASS:  The -- I'm  not quite  sure I 

16  understand the question. 

17

 QUESTION:  Remember, what  we're talking  about 

18  now is the agency is  considering alternative A, B, or  C. 

19  They  all  involve  safety. 

They're  likely  to  have 

20  differential impacts  on smoke and so forth.  And now they 

21  have in front of them an environmental assessment, and the 

22  environmental assessment  explains to them why  they don't 

23  have to  do more than they've done in respect to just what 

24  we're talking about.  Everyone agrees that the requirement 

25  is what you  said.  The Ninth  Circuit says it.  Who told 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

43 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  the agency  that this EA is  inadequate when it  tells you 

2  you don't have to do more  in respect to that to assessing 

3  one, two, and three, you know, et cetera. 

4

6

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  The -- the agency -­

 QUESTION:  I think that's -­

 MR.  WEISSGLASS: 

--  

issued  the 

--  

the 

7  environmental assessment and then asked  for comment on it 

8  after  it  had  already issued  the  interim  final rules. 

9  There were  comments to the agency, and as I've said, they 

10  didn't  specifically  say  this. 

But  the  agency  was 

11  challenged in the Ninth Circuit and that issue was raised. 

12  And that is enough because the -- the agency had before it 

13  all  the  predicate  facts  to  take  into  account  the 

14  relationship between  the stringency  of the safety  rules 

15  and the  environment.  It knew the effects of its actions. 

16  It specifically said  that high-risk trucks are  both more 

17  -- more polluting and less safe. 

18

 It  had to do that.  That's what NEPA requires. 

19  NEPA  doesn't require a  citizen to  come in and  tell the 

20  agency what  its options are.  It requires the  agency to 

21  take that action. 

22

 QUESTION:  Does this agency have  the authority 

23  to exclude a perfectly safe truck because in its view it's 

24  an older truck and will pollute  more?  Is that within the 

25  scope of what the agency can do? 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

44 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  The agency  is to make  safety 

2  choices. 

3

4

 QUESTION:  Safety choices. 

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  And in doing that it's -- under 

5  NEPA must  take a hard look at the environmental effect on 

6  the safety choices. 

7

 QUESTION:  No.  It -- it has to  describe the 

8  environmental effects  perhaps, but if  -- if it  does not 

9  have any 

--  

any  power on  the  basis  of  environmental 

10  effects  to alter the  safety regulations  -- I  mean, two 

11  trucks are equivalently safe.  Can this agency say,  yes, 

12  you're both just as safe,  but as a safety regulator,  I'm 

13  not going  to let you in  because you pollute more?  That 

14  has nothing to  do with the agency's job as -- as a safety 

15  regulator. 

16

 MR.  WEISSGLASS: 

The 

--  

the agency  is  not 

17  required  to let  any truck  in.  The  agency is  -- must 

18  register -­

19

 QUESTION:  That's true, but it has to exclude it 

20  on the basis of safety considerations. 

21

 MR.  WEISSGLASS: 

That  is  correct.  And  in 

22  looking at the  safety considerations, what it's  going -­

23  what it  is going  to promulgate  for the  broad class  of 

24  trucks, not each individual truck -- it is promulgating  a 

25  broad class of  safety regulations.  Any  truck that meets 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

45 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  that  standard,  yes, the  agency  must let  in.  But  in 

2  deciding  what  that  standard  should  be,  that  general 

3  standard, the agency not  only can, but has  an obligation 

4  to look at the environmental effects -­

5

 QUESTION:  Are  -- are  you saying that  because 

6  there are  varying environmental  effects  as between  old 

7  trucks and new trucks, the  agency's obligation is to find 

8  a safety hook in order to keep out the old rather than the 

9  new? 

10

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  The -- no.  The agency does not 

11  -- does not -­

12

 QUESTION:  And we'll  -- we'll find that  the -­

13  you know,  the signal lights don't  work quite so  well on 

14  the old trucks  and we'll use that as a basis to keep them 

15  out so there -- so we can minimize environmental damage? 

16

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  The agency does not  have that 

17  obligation  because  NEPA  does  not  require  substantive 

18  decisions.  But what NEPA requires is that the agency take 

19  a look at those effects. 

20

 QUESTION:  All right.  Then -- excuse me.  Let 

21  me -- let me ask you this question. 

22

 Let's assume  the agency  concluded that  on all 

23  significant safety  factors, the  old trucks  are just  as 

24  good as  the new trucks.  It also concluded that  the old 

25  trucks pollute more.  There -- there  is an environmental 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

46 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  difference.  The agency cannot keep out the old trucks for 

2  that reason alone.  My  question is, does the agency  have 

3  to prepare an impact statement saying we're letting in the 

4  old as  well as the new, but in  letting in the old, we're 

5  letting in  more highly polluting trucks?  Do they have to 

6  prepare that statement  even though  their action is,  and 

7  legally can be, the same with respect to the old as to the 

8  new? 

9

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  Yes, as long as the agency has 

10 

--  

has  a  significant  choice  to  make about  what  the 

11  standards should be.

 QUESTION: 

Suppose  under  Justice  Souter's 

13  question, the agency has no choice  and it must let in the 

14  trucks.  Does it still have to prepare the EIS? 

15

16

17

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  If the agency has no choice -­

 QUESTION:  Or the EA. 

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  -- then -- then under  a number 

18  of circuit court  cases, which  the Government cited,  the 

19  agency would  not  have to  do  it.  And that's  an  open 

20  question  for this  Court, but  the Court doesn't  need to 

21  reach it. 

22

 QUESTION:  No.  But you're -- you're  saying, I 

23  think, suppose the agency is  trying to choose between two 

24  headlight inspections a year or one.  All right.  Now, if 

25  you have two a year, in fact, there will be  fewer trucks.

1  If you go to one a year, there might be more trucks coming 

2  in and then you will have more pollution. 

3

 Now, if that's a significant  difference, then I 

4  guess  the agency does  have to go  into it.  But if they 

5  have an EA  that tells them, you know, it's not that big a 

6  deal because  they're going to be about the same number of 

7  trucks regardless, then I would  think the burden would be 

8  on the environmentalists to show that that's really wrong. 

9  And I  think that's  the kind  of argument you're  making. 

10  And  you're telling me  that it's so  obviously wrong that 

11  even though you didn't raise it in the agency, they should 

12  have figured it out.  Is -- is that where we are? 

13

 MR.  WEISSGLASS: 

That 

--  

I  think  that  is 

14  accurate about where  we are.  And -- and the fact is that 

15  there  were  numerous  comments to  the  agency  about the 

16  safety things  that it  should have  done and  didn't, and 

17  there are numerous -- there's numerous -- there's a lot of 

18  room  between  the  standards that  are  being  imposed on 

19  trucks  coming  over  the  border  from  Mexico  and  the 

20  standards that are in -- on U.S. trucks. 

21

 The agency  could have  made choices that  would 

22  affect  this, that would affect the safety, and that would 

23  also  affect  the environment. 

And the  agency concedes 

24  that.  The agency concedes  it had the discretion, and  it 

25  concedes that this could affect the environment.

 What  the  agency does  is  say that  that's all 

2  about  the  President  because the  President  lifted  the 

3  moratorium. 

But  where that  is  a  mistake is  because 

4  Congress was the -- was the body that said when trucks can 

5  come over, and it gave  both the President and the  agency 

6  separate authority  over that.  So  it all  goes back  to 

7  Congress in making this -- this foreign commerce decision. 

8

 Now, before I finish my argument, I did  want to 

9  talk  about  the  Clean  Air  Act  because  this  is  very 

10  important.  Justice Souter raised this point.  The way the 

11  agency reads the regulations, it  -- it would -- it  would 

12  be  completely  out of  accord  with the  language  of the 

13  statute which --

14

15

 QUESTION:  Did -- did you challenge the regs? 

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  We -- we did not challenge  the 

16  regs, but we read the regs -­

17

18

 QUESTION:  Isn't that the end of the issue? 

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  No, because  we read the  regs 

19  very differently  than the agency.  The agency -- the -­

20  the  way the  -- the  particular regulation reads  is that 

21  it's not just where -­

22

23

24

25

 QUESTION:  Where -- where are you?  On 46? 

 QUESTION:  8a, page 8a, isn't it? 

 QUESTION:  46 of your brief or where? 

 MR. WEISSGLASS:  Actually the -- the critical -­

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

49 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  the critical regulation that the  Government raised was in 

2  its reply  brief.  It's on page 17 of  the -- of the reply 

3  brief. 

4

 And -- and there is the definition of continuing 

5  program responsibility because once the  -- the -- you get 

6  past the cause  point -- and EPA is  very clear that under 

7  the Clean  Air Act, it's but-for causation.  It says that. 

8  And so we clearly have that here. 

9

 Then the question  is whether  the agency has  a 

10  continuing  program  responsibility.  And  there  are two 

11  sentences that are separate formulations  of when there is 

12  that responsibility.  The -- the Government relies solely 

13  on the  first sentence, which we  do not rely on.  That's 

14  when an agency requires some activities. 

15

 But  the  second  sentence  is  the  critical 

16  sentence, which is  when an  agency, quote, takes  actions 

17  itself or imposes conditions that  result in air pollutant 

18  emissions.  Well, in this case, the agency is -- is taking 

19  action and imposing conditions that are going to result in 

20  emissions because  under 350,  no trucks  come  in at  all 

21  until the agency makes these choices and because in making 

22  the choices, it's imposing conditions that are going to be 

23  absolutely determinative as to what  the -- the pollutants 

24  -- how much pollution there's going  to be.  If the agency 

25  ratchets up  its -- its controls, there's going to be less 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

50

1  pollution.  The agency admits that. 

2

 QUESTION:  I  thought they  were relying on  the 

3  regulation on page 8a of the Government's principal brief. 

4  That's certainly  what they  raised in their  -- in  their 

5  argument here, which  -- which  makes whatever this  other 

6  regulation says quite irrelevant because it's a definition 

7  of emissions.  And it says that to be an indirect emission 

8  within the  act, the Federal agency  must have -- must be 

9  able to practicably control and  maintain control over the 

10  emissions due to a continuing program responsibility. 

11

 MR.  WEISSGLASS: 

That's  right,  and  the 

12  regulation I've just read is  the definition of continuing 

13  program  responsibility. 

The  agency  clearly  has  a 

14  continuing  program responsibility  here  because as  it's 

15  enforcing the regs that it  -- that it writes, it's  going 

16  to determine  how much pollution there is.  And it clearly 

17  practicably  controls  the emissions  because, as  I said, 

18  both  without some choices, there's  going to be no trucks 

19  and once the agency makes  the choices, those choices  are 

20  going to  determine how  much pollution  comes in  because 

21  that's how many trucks and what type are coming in. 

22

 QUESTION:  Well, I -- I  guess that any  -- any 

23  Federal  licensing  agency  for 

--  

for  automobiles  or 

24  anything else would  -- would come  within this and  would 

25  have  to -- you  know, if I  don't issue a  license, I can 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1  practicably control the  -- the amount of  emissions, even 

2  though  the agency  is  not a 

--  

an emissions  approving 

3  agency.  It's -- it's giving driver's licenses. 

4

 MR. WEISSGLASS: 

The -- the  -- this  is  the 

5  tradeoff that Congress  made in  requiring States to  meet 

6  clean air requirements.  It  said, yes, we're going to 

--

7  we're  going to take a stick to  the States, as this Court 

8  has said, but we're not going to make it more difficult as 

9  a -- as  a Federal agency  for the States  to meet its 

--

10  their  responsibilities  under the  Clean  Air Act.  That 

11  would be horribly unfair.  And that's why the statute  is 

12  so broad that if the --

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MR.  KNEEDLER: 

Several  things,  Mr.  Chief 

18  Justice. 

19

 The 

--  

the  critical point  here  is  that the 

20  agency had no discretion to  deny certification to Mexican 

21  trucks that were  eligible under -- under  the President's 

22  lifting of  the moratorium  if they satisfied  the -- the 

23  requirement that they'd be willing and able to comply with 

24  the -- with the statutory standards.  So the  agency was 

25  really  acting  under  two  imperatives. 

One  is  its 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

52 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  preexisting  organic  statute  and  then  secondly,  the 

2  President's lifting of  a moratorium that required  the -­

3  the Government to live up to its obligations under NAFTA. 

4

 QUESTION: 

What 

--  

I'd  like  to  hear  your 

5  response to the argument, which I didn't realize they were 

6  making  independently,  that just  based  on the  agency's 

7  available choices, it  could have made the  safety -- have 

8  different  safety  regulations.  That  was  a  sufficient 

9  effect on the environment that they had to do a -­

10

 MR. KNEEDLER:  They did  not -- they did not 

--

11  what  -- what  they're really  arguing is that  the agency 

12  should have considered some other alternative.  The agency 

13  analyzed  essentially two  alternatives, go  forward under 

14  our existing regulations -- again, these are  procedural, 

15  not substantive regulations, just  regulations designed to 

16  identify whether carriers satisfy substantive standards -­

17  either to go forward under  -- under preexisting or -- or 

18  introduce new ones. 

19

 The  respondents  never  said  to  the  agency, 

20  there's  a  third  alternative.  You  can  make  your new 

21  regulations even more stringent and  here's what you could 

22  do.  And  in fact,  even now,  they  don't identify  what 

23  further strengths -­

24

 QUESTION:  They're  -- they're making  basically 

25  the argument you said they waived.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  You know, I  mean, that's been pretty 

3  much our  whole  discussion.  And I  think  on that,  the 

4  Government  says,  well,  they're  right  in  principle. 

5  They're  saying  -- I  mean, if  in fact  an agency  has a 

6  choice, A, B, or C, and if you choose A, there's a lot  of 

7  smoke; B,  a little  smoke; and  C, no  smoke, well,  they 

8  ought to go  analyze it under an  EIS.  I think  you agree 

9  with that. 

10

11

 MR. KNEEDLER:  But --

 QUESTION:  But you're  saying, well, they never 

12  made that point. 

13

14

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Right. 

 QUESTION:  They said,  but it's  so obvious  we 

15  didn't have to  make it, and besides,  when we got  to the 

16  Ninth Circuit,  at least in the  reply brief, we  did make 

17  it. 

18

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  Well, the  important thing 

19  is -­

20

 QUESTION:  All  right.  So what's  your response 

21  to that? 

22

 MR. KNEEDLER:  The -- the -- first of all,  the 

23  agency -- the agency did an  EA in order  to determine it 

24  didn't have to produce an  environmental impact statement. 

25  If they were wrong on  that, that should have been  called 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

54 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  to  their attention  on this  precise point,  specifically 

2  that the agency should have adopted an even more stringent 

3  alternative. 

And  it's 

--  

and even  now,  they  don't 

4  identify one  that the agency could do that wouldn't be -­

5  essentially  be  a pretext,  Justice  Souter, as  you were 

6  suggesting, that would  be consistent  with their duty  to 

7  let  in  trucks  and 

--  

and  still  have 

--  

have  more 

8  flexibility. 

9

 What they quote for this  is on page 193 of  the 

10  joint  appendix  in the  environmental  assessment.  It's 

11  important to recognize that that is a portion of the -- of 

12  the  environmental assessment  that  repeats that  our own 

13  actions, including the inspections, are  not going to have 

14  a substantial  impact on the environment.  But even so, we 

15  can -- we  can mitigate that tiny impact, and it's in that 

16  context where  the agency says, we  can try to  screen out 

17  the  dirtier  trucks. 

And  there's  a  reference  to 

18  environment.  It's unclear what it means, but I think two 

19  pages later the court identifies that there could be leaks 

20  from a truck that would be identified during an inspection 

21  they  could  turn over  to  environmental people  from the 

22  State.  So it's focused on a very narrow question, whether 

23  -- whether  the inspections  would -- would increase  the 

24  emissions. 

25

 And respondents have never really challenged the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

55 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  notion, which is what's being addressed here, that -- that 

2  the increased inspections under these  rules would have an 

3  impact on -- on the environment. 

4

 I did want to address  the -- the Clean Air  Act 

5  regulations. 

We  did not  raise  the  regulation that's 

6  quoted  on page 17  of our brief.  We relied,  as Justice 

7  Scalia  pointed  out,  on  the 

--  

under  the  indirect 

8  emissions.  As  I mentioned,  the -- the  agency has  no 

9  continuing  control.  It isn't  the control at the outset. 

10  It's control over the subsequent  activities, which is the 

11  word in  the regulation, and the -- this agency, a safety­

12  certifying agency,  has no continuing  control over  where 

13  these trucks  will travel in the U.S., even whether the -­
