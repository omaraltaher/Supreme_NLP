 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 07-499, Negusie v. 
Mukasey.

 Mr. Pincus.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PINCUS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 A father forced at gunpoint to engage in 

incest with his daughter because of his religion, race, 
or political views, and told that he and his daughter 
will be killed if he refuses, is far outside the class 
of persons brought to mind by the ordinary meaning of 
the phrase at issue in this case, which is reprinted on 
page 1 of our brief, quoting from section (a)(42):  "Any 
person who ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise 
participated in the persecution of any person" on 
account of a prohibited factor.

 The same is true if -- of someone who, as 

part of the religious persecution directed against him, 
is forced on threat of death to disrupt a prayer meeting 
and injure his co-religionists.  The father and the 
co-religionists are victims of persecution.  They would

not be described in ordinary parlance as "persecutors." 
And we think that that really under the Government's 
view, the persecutor bar turns solely on what they term 
"objective effect of an individual's acts."  But that 
means that the act need not be accompanied by any of the 
indicia of moral offensiveness that the law typically 
requires, even if the individual acted under duress, 
under threat of death, even if the individual did not 
know that his conduct related to persecution, and even 
if the individual.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do we begin with the 

assumption that this is a Chevron deference case?  And I 
think Aguirre, INS v. Aguirre, would tell us that it is. 
It was a different statute.  Do we begin with that 
assumption?

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, I think under Chevron 
that, one, the first question is is there a gap to be 
filled here?  The language --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, do I begin with 

Chevron?

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, yes.  We think Chevron 

supplies the framework.  The first question is, is there 
ambiguity.  We would -- we argue that here and our 
principal submission is that there is no ambiguity here 
and that there is therefore no occasion for deference.

If the Court were to disagree with that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I take it your 

position is that there's no ambiguity in the way the 
term is used in the statute, as opposed to no ambiguity 
in some abstract sense?

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes, our submission, 

Mr. Chief Justice, is that the phrase here, using the 
principle that the Court applied in Watson and looking 
at the phrase and looking at the picture that it brings 
to mind, would never bring to mind the examples that I 
cited as conduct that would be captured by this 
provision.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Pincus, could I ask 

about your description of the Government's position as 
saying that it's purely objective and that there's no 
mental factor whatever.  Is it clear that the Government 
not only would not take into account coercion, the fact 
that it was done under coercion, but also would not take 
into account the fact that the individual even knew?

 MR. PINCUS:  There are cases --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that he was persecuting 

somebody?

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes, Your Honor, there are 

cases, some of which that determination has been 
reversed by a court of appeals.  But the BIA has taken

the position that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Has the Government taken 

that position here in in this case?

 MR. PINCUS:  The -- well, we pointed out 

that that is the position that the BIA has taken and the 
Government has not disavowed it.  So I don't know 
whether they're --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I guess I should ask the 

Government?

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes, Your Honor.  But there 
certainly have been a number of decisions along that 
line, including one, for example, where an individual 
was told, you know, "Stand here. "

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I could think that that's 
wrong without thinking that you also have to take into 
account whether there was coercion.

 MR. PINCUS:  You could, Your Honor, although 
the underlying -- the Government's underlying theory for 
all three of its positions, both that coercion doesn't 
matter, that knowledge doesn't matter, and that 
subjective intent doesn't matter, is its view that these 
words require only objective acts.  Once you've 
determined that the words require something more --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but it's very -- -

it's very common in -- in criminal statutes to require

knowledge of the act.  Indeed, if the person doesn't 
know what he's doing, you know, he may be insane, but 
he's not a criminal.  Whereas, it is not automatically 
clear that the fact that the -- you killed somebody 
because otherwise they'd break your arm would -- would 
be a justification.  I mean, it seems to me the two are 
quite separable.

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, two responses, Your 

Honor.  Certainly in the criminal context, duress is a 
well-recognized defense and this Court has said that in 
Dixon and other cases.  But I just want to be clear that 
the knowledge that we are talking about here that the 
Government has disavowed is not knowledge that you 
engaged in an act.  They don't -- they don't take the 
position that sleepwalking is -- can be a persecutive 
act.  But their view is even if you don't know that your 
act is contributing to persecution -- you're kept in the 
dark by the actual persecutors; they just ask you to do 
something that in fact is contributing to persecution --
- they say that doesn't matter, and that it all rests on 
what we think is their wrong-headed construction of the 
statute.

 I just want to return to --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Your position is that any 

threat of serious injury is sufficient?

MR. PINCUS:  Excuse me?
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Your position is that any 

threat of serious injury is sufficient?

 MR. PINCUS:  No, Your Honor.  I mean, 

obviously --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But that's what your brief 

says:  "Being forced upon threat of death or serious 
injury to participate in the persecutory acts of his 
oppressors."

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes, and our position is that 
that's a logical starting point.  There is of course a 
body of law that's been developed in the criminal 
context about the parameters about the defense of duress 
and that would be a pretty logical starting point, we 
think.  The Attorney General would have discretion, once 
the Court corrected the view that the statute doesn't --
that coercion is irrelevant, just to, within the limits 
of Chevron, define what the coercion test is.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If someone said, if you 
don't -- there are 500 men, women and children in a 
shed; if you don't administer lethal gas to them, we are 
going to administer 20 lashes, that would be sufficient 
in your view?

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, under some -- under some 
conceptions of this defense, there is a balancing test

between the threat that is directed against the 
individual and the threat -- and what the injury that he 
is asked to carry out.  That could be part of the test.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's not very 

helpful.  How would the balancing be struck?  How would 
you strike it there?

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, what the courts have said 

in the criminal context is that there are three 
criteria:  An immediate threat of death or serious 
bodily injury; a well-grounded fear that it will be 
carried out; and no reasonable opportunity to escape. 
That's the general standard.  So in the criminal context 
--

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you wouldn't balance. 
So, you know, gas these 20,000 people or we will kill 
you?

 MR. PINCUS:  It might be appropriate --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You gas the 20,000 people, 

right, and that's okay?

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, some courts have said 

that murder is a different kettle of fish and that there 
is a question unanswered in the Federal system about 
whether or not there is a direct defense for murder. 
The States are divided.  The Model Penal Code has said 
yes, there should be.  That is one of the issues that

would be open for the Attorney General to the extent he 
wishes to exercise his discretion to decide.

 What's clear, though, is, we think, the 

rule -- the current construction of the statute is not 
right.  There is a body of law out there that is well 
developed in the criminal context that could be a very 
logical starting point.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why shouldn't the 
starting point be what this Court decided in the 
Fedorenko case?  The wording of this provision is very 
close to the wording of that statute, much closer than 
the UN covenant that you have referred to.

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, Your Honor, two responses 

to that.  First of all, the language in Fedorenko, the 
text was very context-specific and it shows that.  The 
language that applied there specifically referred to the 
enemy and specifically referred to persecution of 
civilians, making it quite clear that that was a statute 
that was targeted in the specific World War II context, 
which was all that it applied to.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  It was also the distinction 

about the use of the word "voluntary," in which the 
operative language which barred those people didn't have 
"voluntary" in it, and I forget what it was, the next 
textual section it was there, so it was reason to infer

that voluntary activity was not a criteria for the bar. 
Isn't that right?

 MR. PINCUS:  Exactly, Your Honor, and the 
Court said the deliberate omission -- it specifically 
looked at the fact that these sections were adopted at 
the same time, followed on each other immediately, and 
one had "voluntary," and then it said this was a 
deliberate omission and we conclude that that deliberate 
omission provides the basis for interpreting the 
language --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you take the position 
that the Government is wrong in saying that it's bound 
by Fedorenko and that's the reason perhaps for us to 
send it back?

 MR. PINCUS:  Exactly, Your Honor.  I was 

going to get to the second part of your Chevron question 
and respond just that.  If the Court were to conclude, 
contrary to our submission, that the language here is 
ambiguous and there's a gap to fill, our position is --
and we think it's quite well borne out by the decisions 
-- that the BIA's decisions here rested on the mistaken 
assumption that Fedorenko bound it in this case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And do we begin with the 

decision in Rodriguez-Majano, the BIA decision --

MR. PINCUS:  Yes. 

11 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- which cited Fedorenko?
 MR. PINCUS:  Rodriguez-Majano was the first 

one.  The issue was not even raised in that case.  It 
was dicta in the paragraph before citing Fedorenko>  In 
fact, the BIA says:  "The service agreed at oral 
argument that the actions don't constitute participation 
and persecution."  So there really wasn't an issue 
there.  But all that's there is a sentence and a 
reliance on Fedorenko, seems pretty clear that that 
decision just mistakenly believed Fedorenko controlled 
the case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, to give the devil his 

due, it's not just the BIA that took that view, it's 
every court of appeals that -- that has looked at this 
provision has said that Fedorenko is a guide to what it 
means, right?

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you are faulting the BIA 

for -- you are saying it's beyond reasonable 
interpretation for the BIA to adopt the -- the 
resolution of the ambiguity, assuming there is an 
ambiguity, which comports with every court of appeals to 
address the matter has said?

 MR. PINCUS:  I think there are -- there are 

two different questions here, Justice Scalia.  If the

BIA purported to -- if the -- if the BIA said there is a 
gap to fill here, we are going to exercise our expertise 
and discretion and decide that, that would be one 
situation.  We think it's quite clear here that the BIA 
believed erroneously that Fedorenko compelled the 
result, that it thought this was a Chevron step one 
case, and it was merely reciting what it believed to be 
the rule and saying that Fedorenko controls.  So we 
think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why do you think that's 

clear?  What's -- what's the text you rely on?

 MR. PINCUS:  The text that we are relying on 

is -- is the actual decision, which just makes a flat 
statement, again in dicta:  "The participation or" -- I 
am reading from Rodriguez-Majano.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do I have it in front of 

me?

the BIA.

 MR. PINCUS:  You don't.  It's a decision of 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, gee.  I mean, if this 
is central to your case, don't you think I ought to have 
the language in front of me somewhere?

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, actually the language is 

on page 27 of our yellow brief.

MR. PINCUS:  At the very top of the page. 
So all that there is there is a recitation of the rule 
and a citation to Fedorenko.  And our submission is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a "see" citation, 

right?

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I mean, you know, 

it's just not a flat citation which would say that 
governs.  It means this is a relevant case that you 
should look to.  And you don't deny that it's relevant. 
You try to distinguish it, but it's certainly something 
you should consider, no?

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, Your Honor, it is 

certainly --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that's all you have to 

say that they -- they based it on Fedorenko?

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes.  Well, first of all, as I 

say --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not very much.
 MR. PINCUS:  -- the statement in this 
decision is dicta.  Here I'm not sure whether they 
consulted the Bluebook before they picked the "see" 
cite, but -- but it -- it seems to me that -- that all 
we have here is a legal rule and a legal rule that 
generally has been perceived to be the rule that -- that

was announced by Fedorenko, not tied in any way to the 
different statutory language at issue in this case or 
anything else.

 Let me -- let me also turn to the second 
decision that is relied on, which is the decision in 
this case.  And there -- and I am looking at -- at page 
6a of the petition.  And the BIA says, citing to -- to 
its prior decision in Matter of Fedorenko, it -- it 
recites this rule.  Now --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a "see" cite again, 

isn't it?

 MR. PINCUS:  It's another "see" cite.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right, that's good.
 MR. PINCUS:  Which they indicate because 

they are actually directly -- well, anyway.

 The Matter of Fedorenko, that's a case --

and I apologize.  In our brief we said that was the case 
that relied on the DPA.  That's actually a case that 
involved the Holtzman Amendment, again not the statute 
at issue in this case, and therefore just sort of 
reflexively taking a rule in a different case and 
applying it to this very different statute without any 
analysis.  And not to get into too much of a train of 
BIA logic, but I think it is important.

Laipenieks, which is the actually the -- the precedent 
that Matter of Fedorenko relies on, again specifically 
called out the language of Fedorenko and says, as in 
Fedorenko -- and I am quoting from page 464 of that 
decision -- as in Fedorenko, the plain language mandates 
the result.

 So here in -- in all of the BIA analysis, 
there is no analysis in terms of exercising expertise 
and discretion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Where --
the plain language dictates the result, where do I see 
that?

 MR. PINCUS:  I apologize.  It's in a 

different BIA decision.  It's In the Matter of 
Laipenieks decision at page 464.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say "Citing Matter of 

Laipenieks"?

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Citing it.  It says "citing 

Matter of Laipenieks."  Do you know if they cited it 
just flatly or was it a "see" cite?

 MR. PINCUS:  That I don't know, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you want to bet?

that the plain language of the statute dictates a 
particular result, I say -- I suspect that that's a 
concession we are in Chevron step one, rather than two.

 MR. PINCUS:  Exactly, Your Honor.  And 
that's why in -- my response to Justice Kennedy's 
question is that if the Court were to disagree with us 
and conclude, contrary to our submission that the 
language is ambiguous, then we don't have an exercise of 
agency discretion under step one or step two, because 
all the agency decisions rest on the belief that the 
statutory language forecloses that -- the -- the.

 Exercise of that discretion.
 So in that event we submit the appropriate 

result would be to remand the case, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Pincus, can you tell 

me:  What is the consequence of this?  I mean if, 
indeed, your client is -- is denied asylum because --
because he participated in -- in, under coercion or not, 
discriminatory action against others, what is the 
consequence?  He is not sent back to the -- to the 
country that -- that is persecuting him, is he?

 Well, his -- his deportation has been 

deferred under the Convention Against Torture.  So he 
has some -- some protection, not the protection, not the 
full protections that he would be entitled to if he were

found to be a refugee.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what happens to 

him?  Does he -- does he stay here or --

MR. PINCUS:  He gets to stay here --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Until some other country 

other than the one that will persecute him will receive 
him, is that -- is that it?

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes.  Or if -- if he were to --
he gets to stay here as long as sending him back would 
not involve torture.  So the protection is narrower than 
the protection that generally would be available in two 
senses:

 First of all, it only applies to torture. 

If you were sent back and you were going to be 
imprisoned for life for your -- for the acts that are 
protected --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, really?
 MR. PINCUS: -- the CAT would not protect 

you.  And CAT also does not protect you against 
non-state actions.  So especially in the world today, 
where a lot of the bad things that happen in other 
countries are by rebels and non-state actors, the 
Convention Against Torture would not provide protection 
in that situation.  So it's broader protection for a 
broader -- for a somewhat broader group of people.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me ask you -- let me ask 

you about another practical consequence of your 
provision.  I -- I have seen a lot of these asylum 
cases, and usually the evidence consists almost entirely 
of the uncorroborated statement made by the person who 
is claiming asylum.

 So in your view the immigration judges are 
going to have to decide the degree of the threat that 
the asylum claimant underwent and the consequences of 
failing to comply with whatever he was directed to do. 
And they are going to have to do that based solely on 
the credibility determination made about an 
uncorroborated witness who's typically testifying 
through an interpreter and who has all of the mannerisms 
and aspects of speech of someone who comes from an 
entirely different culture.  That's the consequences of 
the position that you are advocating?

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes, Your Honor, just -- just 

as in the initial question about whether someone has 
been subject to persecution in the first place, that's 
-- that is the process that we have.  And immigration 
judges are quite skilled in getting to the bottom of 
what's going on.

 They also have, in addition -- and as relied

on in this case --

JUSTICE ALITO:  You really think that's 

true?  They are quite skilled at getting to the bottom 
of making --

MR. PINCUS:  Well, I think -- I think it is 
their job.  I think they also have the country reports 
that the State Department prepares, and they were relied 
on in this case.  If -- if, for example, someone were to 
come in and say, I am a victim of coercion, and the 
country report does not provide any indication that that 
is happening in the country, that's obviously a reason 
to look quite skeptically --

JUDGE SCALIA:  Well, if I claim I would be 
subject to persecution in Denmark if I were sent there, 
that might be an easy question.  But they typically come 
from a country where there is persecution, and they 
could easily have been subjected to it, or they could 
also just as easily have read about it or heard about it 
in -- along their way here.

 You think that's an easy determination?
 MR. PINCUS:  If -- but -- well, but it's 

true of the initial claim of persecution.  But if -- if 
the refugee, an asylum applicant, comes and says, I have 
been subject to persecution, and there is no issue of 
coercion in the case, that is -- the concern that you

have identified arises there.  If a case-specific, the 
case-specific decision has to be made, this is an 
additional question that will have to be answered.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your unprovable question 

upon unprovable question.  I mean, to say that one 
question is really, really hard to figure out is no 
justification for laying on another one.

 MR. PINCUS:  And -- and we also think it's 

significant in this respect, that the Secretary of 
Homeland Security has in connection with a different 
disability, the material support disability, said that, 
promulgated an exclusion for -- in some circumstances 
for people who are coerced to provide material support.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I am quite curious why -- I 
am curious, why did you answer Justice Alito's question 
"yes"?  I -- I would have thought that if you win this 
case, the Attorney General would still have tremendous 
leeway in deciding where, when, under what 
circumstances, the duress defense applied.  Why isn't 
that so?

 MR. PINCUS:  That's absolutely right, 

Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If that's right, then why 

do you not -- why was your answer yes?

 MR. PINCUS:  My answer was in the absence of

action by the Attorney General.  But I think you are 
absolutely right that the important thing to point out 
here is, as with the standard itself, the Attorney 
General could in the asylum context decide that in 
certain kinds of situations that this coercion is not 
relevant.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Pincus, refresh my 

recollection about something about the Fedorenko case, 
which I should have reread, but I honestly didn't in 
detail.  Am I not correct that the point that 
Justice Alito makes was really part of the background of 
the case there was that nobody really believed his 
testimony?  It was assumed, for purposes of decision, 
that he was telling the truth, but it was pretty clear 
he was not.  Whereas here everybody does assume, for 
purposes of decision, that this man is telling the 
truth?

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes, I think that's -- that's 

correct, Justice Stevens.  And part of what was going on 
there was the sheer -- two things:  The sheer 
administrative burden of millions of refugees and the 
need to process them in some kind of expeditious 
fashion; and the fact that it was known that there was 
sort of an organized effort by people who had been 
participating, especially in the concentration camps, to

come up with this defense.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Pincus, I didn't -- I 

didn't get the bottom line of your exchange with 
Justice Breyer.  Is it your position that there -- there 
has to be some -- some coercion defense, but it's up to 
the Attorney General to say what it is?  I mean, he 
could say only if he were threatened with death?

 MR. PINCUS:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And only if you were 

threatened with torture, not if it was threatened that 
your family would be exterminated?  Where do you get 
that discretion in the -- in the statute?

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, the Attorney General has 
rulemaking authority in the asylum area, certainly.  And 
we think even in -- even with respect --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Any old coercion defense he 

can do -- make.  So long as there is some coercion 
defense, that's all you want.  Some coercion defense?

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, we think the question now 

before the Court is, is there no coercion defense? 
That's the -- that's the Government's position --
flatly, totally irrelevant.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But why does the Attorney 

General have expertise in -- in that area?  I can 
understand why he has expertise when he knows that, from

experience, that certain defenses are harder to prove 
than others, that certain evidence is harder to obtain 
than other evidence.  But does the Attorney General 
really have expertise in determining degrees of duress, 
degrees of culpability?  Is that within the Chevron 
framework?

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, it -- it -- it seems to 
me it could well -- I mean, obviously, that would be a 
question that would come up, but -- but given that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't know why you -- I 

don't know why you concede that.

 MR. PINCUS:  Well, I think once there is a 

coercion defense, it would be fleshed out in the 
administrative process.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You said -- you never get 
past step one of Chevron.  You say that this statute is 
clear.  You say it's not ambiguous.

 MR. PINCUS:  Absolutely.  Well, we --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think it's pretty 

ambiguous if, you know, there is some old coercion 
defense, but we don't really know what it is.

 MR. PINCUS:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me if you are 

going to say step one is clear, there has to be some 
coercion defense that -- you know, of -- of a

substantial nature that the Attorney General cannot 
fritter away.

 MR. PINCUS:  We agree with that, Your Honor, 

and I apologize if I suggested to the contrary.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What would be -- what 

would be the minimum.  You say the statute is clear.  It 
requires some culpability, how would you verbalize what 
is the lowest standard that the Attorney General could 
impose to read statute to infuse in it some element of 
culpability?

 MR. PINCUS:  Because the statutory context 
here was to implement our treaty obligations, and the 
treaty obligations refers -- refer to criminal 
conduct -- we think the logical starting point that --
that you are asking about, Justice Ginsburg, would be 
the criminal law standards, which, as I say, are well 
developed in the Federal system.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Serious bodily harm?
 MR. PINCUS:  Yes, it's a -- it's a 

three-part test:  Threat of serious bodily harm; no 
reasonable well-grounded fear that it will be carried 
out; and no reasonable way to avoid it.

 Unless the Court has any further questions, 

I'll reserve the time.

Pincus.

 Mr. Katsas.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. KATSAS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. KATSAS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In categorical terms, the Immigration and 

Nationality Act provides that persons who assist or 
otherwise participate in persecution may not obtain 
certain immigration benefits.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where you stopped --
you stopped in the part that interests me, "participated 
in persecution on account of race, religion, nationality 
or membership in a particular group.  When these people 
are forced to engage in persecution, it's not because of 
the victim's race or religion; it's because someone's 
got a gun at their head.

 So, you ask them, "Well, why did you do 

that?  Why did you, you know, whip that person?  They 
will say:  Because they were going to kill me.  They are 
not going to say, I -- you know, because I was biased 
against his race or religion.

 MR. KATSAS:  No, but the -- the "on account 

of" phrase, Mr. Chief Justice, modifies the 
"persecution."  The persecution in this case was

directed --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, how do you 

know that?  Why can't it just as easily modify 
"incited," "participated in"?  You have persecution. 
Did they participate in the persecution on account of 
race; or did they participate, again, in the persecution 
on account of what the -- what the force exerted against 
them was?

 MR. KATSAS:  I think grammatically, the 

immediately preceding noun is "persecution."  If the "on 
account of" phrase modified -- modified the assistance, 
Mr. Chief Justice, it seems to me that would prove far 
too much, in that a prison guard who served voluntarily, 
voluntarily in order to get a paycheck, wouldn't be 
within the bar because he would -- he wouldn't be 
assisting on account of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that just 
bring you back to what "assistance" means.  If you --
normal statutory canon, you have got "ordered," 
"incited," "assisted."

 MR. KATSAS:  Right.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  "Assistance" can be 
read in the same sense as ordered or incited with terms 
of an active -- I don't know what it is --
predisposition or desire.  Or it can be read in the

manner you suggested, somebody who's just doing it 
for -- for the paycheck.

 So, if we read it in eiusdem generis terms, 

then I think your response falls short.

 MR. KATSAS:  I don't -- I don't think so, 

Mr. Chief Justice, in that the question here -- the 
question here is the availability of a duress defense. 
One can -- one can order persecution under duress just 
as one could assist in persecution under duress.

 Imagine, for instance, the camp commandant 

at Treblinka ordering the slaughter of thousands of 
innocent people.  He could say:  Well, I'm doing that 
under duress because if I don't, if I don't order 
persecution, someone up my chain of command will kill 
me, which is precisely what's wrong with Petitioner's 
theory here, its -- its unbounded nature.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that 

argument is at one extreme, where if this does apply as 
the way Petitioner suggests we assume the Attorney 
General can exercise his discretion and not afford 
relief.  But on the other hand, it could go to some of 
the horrific examples that Mr. Pincus suggested; and in 
those circumstances the Attorney General could exercise 
his discretion to afford relief.

 MR. KATSAS:  The Attorney General does not

have discretion with respect to withholding.  And 
remember, the persecutor bar in the asylum statute is 
identical to the persecutor bar in the withholding 
statute.

 But in any event, this Court said in cases 

like Phinpathya the fact that the text goes to an 
eligibility requirement is not a ground for the Court 
reading in limitations that aren't there on the theory 
that the Attorney General can address something case by 
case.  That's because immigration is subject to the 
plenary control of Congress, and when Congress writes a 
rule and this Court converts it into a standard, it's 
shifting control over the immigration laws from Congress 
to the Executive and ultimately to the courts.

 It seems to us that reasoning governs here. 
With respect to your question about hard hypotheticals, 
I don't dispute that there are hard, sympathetic --
sympathetic persecutors on Mr. Pincus' side of the case, 
but keep in mind what is at stake here.

 Persecution is not typically a grassroots 

phenomenon.  It's a -- it's a phenomenon typically 
ordered by governments or rebel groups aspiring to be 
governments.  It's typically carried out through 
coercion.  So if Petitioners are correct, not only the 
prison guard in this case who held a gun to keep people

out in the sun until they died, not only would he have a 
colorable defense, but so too would every single guard 
at Treblinka.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And so too would, I 

gather, the person who is threatened with harm if he 
doesn't build the prison walls, right?  He knows they 
are going to be used to persecute people and hold them 
in.  I mean, if -- you know, if you push the extreme 
interpretations they go either way.

 MR. KATSAS:  But the point --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does he -- does he 

persecute people on account of race?

 MR. KATSAS:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We have a prison 

here; we are going to hold members of a particular 
racial group here, and we are going to force you to 
build the walls.

 MR. KATSAS:  Mr. Chief Justice, you are 

absolutely correct that there will, of course, be hard 
cases about how broadly to draw the circle.  But in 
Fedorenko, this Court instructed that the way to deal 
with that problem is not by reading in a -- a 
voluntariness exception into a statute that simply 
doesn't contain it, but rather by --

that it is unbounded.  If the legislature passes a 
statute requiring specific intent, scienter, concepts of 
personal responsibility, we don't say this is unbounded.

 MR. KATSAS:  Of course, Justice Kennedy, 

Congress could pass a statute with whatever --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm saying in the general 

criminal law.  We don't say, oh, this is unbounded. 
This is what courts are for.  This is what adjudication 
is for, is to establish and define what duress means, 
what scienter means, what degree of intent is culpable, 
what isn't.  It's not unbounded.

 MR. KATSAS:  That's true in the context of 

criminal law.  But think about why it's true, 
Justice Kennedy.  It's true because Congress when it 
passes criminal statutes legislates against a background 
of hundreds of years of common law precedent in the 
criminal area; and this Court has said presumptively 
Congress legislates against that common law background, 
and that is the theory for on some occasions reading 
mens rea requirements and common law defenses like 
duress into criminal statutes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not any statute?  I'm 
mean, starting where Justice Kennedy left off, you said 
a hundred years.  It's thousands of years.  You could go 
back into the history of the human race --

MR. KATSAS:  Exactly.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and you will discover, 

of course, that your word "involuntary" is never 
something where the action is involuntary that we praise 
or blame people.  Rather, every action where we praise 
or blame people must be a voluntary action.  The classic 
example is:  "The wind blew my arm."  Now, you are 
saying that if this person's arm was blown by the wind, 
that this statute prevents him having asylum in the 
United States or having -- you know, withholding.  How 
could one assume that involuntary actions are covered by 
this statute -- are not covered?

 MR. KATSAS:  Justice Breyer, the case --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Are covered.
 MR. KATSAS:  Two points.  With respect --

with respect to involuntary actions, this case -- this 
case doesn't present that question.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Then once you 

say that, then let's talk about intentional actions.

 MR. KATSAS:  Okay.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And are you going to have 

intentional actions?

 MR. KATSAS:  Yes.

typically involves a voluntary action, an intentional

action, and an action where there is a degree of 
freedom, which is to say that the choice is not too 
skewed.  And we see that in the criminal law by a 
reading into statutes that say nothing of the word 
"intentional," and by the use of the duress defense.

 Now what reason do we have for thinking that 

Congress didn't mean these words here in exactly that 
way, which traces back at least to Aristotle?

 MR. KATSAS:  Because the thousand-year 

tradition that you correctly identify is a criminal law 
tradition.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, but Aristotle doesn't 

say criminal law.  He says praise or blame.

 MR. KATSAS:  Justice Breyer, this is a 

statute -- this is a statute that allocates immigration 
benefits.  Immigration law is a creature of statute. 
There is no background in common law --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's absolutely right. 
But do you think Congress intended that this absolute 
bar should apply where the person is in no sense 
blameworthy?

 MR. KATSAS:  The question -- with respect to 

intentional conduct, the conduct at issue here, 
Justice Breyer, is knowing and intentional.  So there is 
no question about --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, the reasoning here, Mr. 

Katsas, it seems to me implicates exactly what 
Justice Breyer brings up.  We had a colloquy earlier on 
-- on the extent of the reliance by the BIA for its 
general policy on Fedorenko, and what the does a see 
cite mean and so on.  But in -- in this particular case, 
going to page 6a or 7a from which Mr. Pincus was -- was 
earlier quoting, if you look on page 7a, the reason that 
Fedorenko is thought to be appropriate here is, he --
that is to say, the Petitioner here -- has not 
demonstrated his conduct is distinguishable from that of 
the alien in that case.  The conduct of the alien in 
that case was identified as relevant by the 
voluntary/involuntary distinction.  It was so identified 
because of the text of the statute, voluntary was used 
in one place; it wasn't used in the place where the bar 
was set up.

 So that it seems to me that by the express 
reasoning in this case, this case is governed by a rule 
that in effect says the distinction between voluntary 
and involuntary action is not a relevant distinction.
 So I don't thin k you can get by in this 

case without confronting just what Justice Breyer says. 
And I don't see how you can answer his point in this 
case without admitting that Fedorenko in fact was -- was

improvidently relied upon, because it's not good 
authority here.

 MR. KATSAS:  I -- I don't know why it --

with respect to the BIA's reasoning, this decision is a 
straightforward application of 20 years of BIA precedent 
concluding -- consistent with Fedorenko that 
voluntariness is not relevant matter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  This is not really 

consistency with Fedorenko.  This -- in this case the 
BIA is saying that he cannot say that his conduct in 
effect is different from the conduct in Fedorenko.  And 
what was relevant about the Fedorenko conduct was it did 
not have to be voluntary conduct.

 So it is bringing -- it seems to me, the 

reasoning in this case is relying upon a rule that says 
that the voluntary/involuntary distinction is not 
significant.

 MR. KATSAS:  Right.  That was the 

construction -- with the construction --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Which answers 

Justice Breyer's question.

 MR. KATSAS:  But the -- I may be missing 
some of the subtlety of your point.  But let me try --

MR. KATSAS:  Let me try it this way.  The --
the statutory formulation that we are discussing is the 
concept of assistance in persecution.  Fedorenko in the 
context of the displaced person's act construes that 
provision to make involuntariness irrelevant as a matter 
of law.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Right.
 MR. KATSAS:  Many courts of appeals and the 
BIA repeatedly over the last 20 years have held that the 
reasoning that Fedorenko governs not only the displaced 
person's act, where it is of course directly 
controlling, but subsequent statutes, of which there are 
no fewer than seven, using essentially the identical 
formulation of assistance in persecution:  Congress 
carries forward that formulation in a canonical way 
statute after statute.

 If you look to legislative history, you will 

see that Congress repeatedly expresses an affirmative 
intent that all of these persecutor bar provisions be 
construed in pari materia and against that backdrop we 
have administrative precedent.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But one thing that Congress 
has not done and it didn't do it in this Act, is to make 
the express voluntary/involuntary distinction textually 
that the DPA made in Fedorenko.  And it seems to me that

the reasoning set out in this case says this is exactly 
like the Fedorenko situation; that implies that the same 
rule in Fedorenko should apply.  If the same rule 
applies, presumably it should be on the basis of a 
statute which is identical on the -- on the textual 
voluntariness point to the statute in Fedorenko.  This 
one -- this one is not.

 MR. KATSAS:  Identical or not textually 

distinguishable, to the extent that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, you don't have the 
voluntary/involuntary distinction here in -- or -- in 
textual treatment that you had in -- in the DPA statute 
in Fedorenko, do you?

 MR. KATSAS:  You -- well, you have the same 

operative language of assisting persecution.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  You don't -- you don't 

follow that with the section that uses the word 
"voluntary," whereas the bar does not use the word 
"voluntary," right?

 MR. KATSAS:  Except you do.  Throughout the 
-- throughout the INA are provisions that are expressly 
keyed to voluntariness.  So you have the same -- the 
same contrast can be made with respect to the INA bars 
as Fedorenko made with respect to the DPA bar.

MR. KATSAS:  And they --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Can you give me a couple of 
examples of the voluntariness that creates in effect the 
same distinction here as under the DPA?

 MR. KATSAS:  Sure.  Let me give you one: 
The asylum -- the asylum statute -- the substantive 
asylum statute itself in 8 U.S.C. 1158 provides --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Was that passed as part of 
the same legislation that created the bar section we are 
dealing with?

 MR. KATSAS:  Yes and no.  Let me explain. 

Section 1158, the substantive asylum law, did not have a 
persecutor bar as originally enacted by the Refugee Act 
of 1980.  The persecutor bar in the substantive asylum 
statute was added in 1996 by the IIRIRA statute, which 
in the same statute, in the same section, has a 
provision that asylum can be terminated if the alien 
voluntarily decides to return to his home.

 So you have a contrast in the same section 

of the same statute.  Conduct-based --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But it's -- I don't want to 

split hairs here, but I mean the voluntary return 
behavior is a behavior of the alien in this country with 
respect to, in effect, an election under existing 
federal law; whereas, the voluntary/involuntary

distinction in the DPA was a distinction that referred 
to the alien's conduct overseas at the relevant time.

 MR. KATSAS:  That's a fair point, 

Justice Souter, but to the extent part of the reasoning 
in Fedorenko rests on the -- and the inference from the 
contrast, those same contrasts are present here where --
the point of the example --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  You have convinced me there 
are contrasts, but I am not sure that they are contrasts 
that raise the implication in a clear way as it was 
raised in the DPA.  And I think that's my only 
disagreement with you at this point.

 MR. KATSAS:  Well, you have --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Katsas, can I bring you 

back to Aristotle?

 (Laughter.)
 MR. KATSAS:  Absolutely.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Thank you.  This is not a 

criminal statute.

 MR. KATSAS:  Exactly.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The government is not 

imposing punishment upon this person --

MR. KATSAS:  Exactly.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- for some malfeasance. 
Rather, it's -- it's giving a grant of a great benefit

--

MR. KATSAS:  Exactly.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- to a class of people. 
And your position is that it has narrowed that class, 
perhaps now more than was necessary, but that the 
government thought that, rather than letting in and 
giving asylum to the commandant of Trebenko, it would be 
better to have a provision that simply excludes those 
who, under coercion or not, persecuted others.  Isn't 
that --

MR. KATSAS:  That's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did Aristotle say anything 

about that?  Limiting --

MR. KATSAS:  I'm not sure.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Limiting the nation's 

generosity on the basis of a provision that may or may 
not have anything to do with blame?

 MR. KATSAS:  I don't know what Aristotle had 

to say about it, but --

Aristotle was not construing this Federal statute, don't 
you?

you have a clause that says "otherwise participated," 
right?

 MR. KATSAS:  Right.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that must mean, I 

gather, or could mean that "assisted" does not have as 
broad a meeting as you suggest, because otherwise the 
"otherwise participated" language would be unnecessary 
and redundant.

 MR. KATSAS:  I don't think so, 

Mr. Chief Justice, because the statutory sequence is the 
word "assist" goes all the way back to the Displaced 
Persons Act in the 1977 -- when Congress changes 
"assist" to "assists or otherwise participates in" --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.
 MR. KATSAS:  -- the only consequence of 
that, if any, could be a broadening, not a narrowing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I'm not sure 

that's right, because if "otherwise participated" covers 
-- "assisted" does not include "otherwise participated," 
and I understood your broad reading of "assisted" to 
cover the prison walls, and if it does, then I would say 
"assisted" needs to be interpreted with "ordered" and 
"incited," and if it is, then "otherwise participated" 
should be interpreted along the same lines.

"assist" was construed in Fedorenko not to -- not to 
contain an implicit voluntariness exception.  Congress 
adds to that the word "participate," which this Court in 
Yeskey construed not to have an implicit involuntariness 
--

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think there 
was just a -- it was a belt-and-suspenders redundancy?
 MR. KATSAS:  Either belt-and-suspenders or 

broadening the circle in ways that are difficult to 
describe in the abstract.  But "participate" -- this 
Court has said in Reves, "participate" is a term of 
breadth.  So I don't -- I don't see the argument that by 
adding an additional term of breadth to the scheme 
Congress somehow narrowed what would otherwise apply.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What I may have 

missed, what was your answer to the prison walls?  The 
guy who builds the prison walls?

 MR. KATSAS:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is he or is he not 

participating in the persecution?

 MR. KATSAS:  My answer is that the analysis 
of that question does not turn on whether or not he is 
compelled to build the prison walls; it turns on 
footnote 34 of Fedorenko, which says that courts will 
have to draw difficult lines in distinguishing between

the kind of aid that constitutes assistance within the 
meaning of the statute and the kind of aid that does 
not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's very helpful.
 (Laughter.)
 MR. KATSAS:  But --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- can I get from you 
an answer to the question that I put to Mr. Pincus?  Do 
you -- does the Government deny even the necessity of 
knowledge that what you are doing is assisting in the 
persecution of somebody?  You don't even have to know 
that you are assisting in the persecution?

 MR. KATSAS:  In this case, Justice Scalia, 
our position is that knowledge is a sufficient mens rea 
and is clearly satisfied here where Petitioner, by his 
own testimony, knew about the mistreatment.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  What is your answer to the 

question?

 MR. KATSAS:  We have taken the position, 

Justice Stevens, in other cases, that knowledge is not 
required.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  All right.
 MR. KATSAS:  It's been rejected by a few 

courts of appeals.

that is really an extreme position.

 MR. KATSAS:  It is a broader position, but 
happily for me, it is not the position before the Court 
today, particularly --
(Laughter.)
 MR. KATSAS:  -- particularly in light of 

Fedorenko, Justice Scalia, which puts a gloss on 
voluntariness, but does not address --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Voluntariness is the 

purpose the statute.  What is the difference between 
intent and knowledge, in terms of the purpose of the 
statute?  Why is intent different -- lack of intent any 
different from lack of knowledge?  If you read this 
statute literally?

 MR. KATSAS:  The question -- I'm not sure 

the distinction.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  You say that, do you not, 

that with a case involving lack of knowledge.

 MR. KATSAS:  Or intent.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Pardon?
 MR. KATSAS:  Or intent, Justice Stevens. 

The conduct here intentional.  The question is whether 
there is duress exception to it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  There was an intent to 
persecute or an intent to perform certain acts that

constitute persecution?

 MR. KATSAS:  Intent to perform the acts that 

constitute --

JUSTICE BREYER:  People use that word 

"intent" in the course of the human race to encompass 
the notion of duress.  I mean, that's -- that's 
sometimes done, sometimes not.  They are part and parcel 
of the same thing, which is whether you can blame the 
person for what he did.

 MR. KATSAS:  They were not the same thing, 

even in the criminal --

JUSTICE BREYER:  In criminal law they were 

not, I agree --

MR. KATSAS:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- because that's --

because we've seen the need for specificity.  But the 
question, I think, Justice Stevens had, and certainly I 
have, is why do you read some aspects of what it takes 
to hold a person responsible into the statute, but you 
don't read other aspects of what it takes to hold a 
person responsible morally into the statute?

 MR. KATSAS:  We don't read -- our position 
is it's not fair to -- it's not fair to incorporate the 
full common law background criminal concepts, including 
that of duress.  The question by Justice Breyer whether

assistance in persecution contains an implicit duress 
limitation seems to me very different from the question 
whether it contains an implied knowledge limitation. 
And the latter question is not present here with respect 
to a prison guard who, by his own admission, knew 
exactly what was going on and deliberately implemented 
torture by keeping people in the sun, exposed in the sun 
to the point of death.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your concession --

statement earlier on, that there are going to be 
situations for judicial line-drawing --

MR. KATSAS:  Right.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And it suggests to 

me that BIA's discretion isn't applicable here under 
Chevron step two.  Because what you are saying is this 
is not a situation where the statute never applies.
 In a situation where you can logically 

determine and your answer on the knowledge question is 
pertinent, you can logically draw a line between what a 
person's doing and persecution; and yet you said the c 
courts are going to have to draw lines.  So BIA -- the 
board might get discretion with respect to where that 
line is drawn and when, but they do not get discretion 
on the question of does it ever apply.  And what your 
position is, that this never applies, whenever there is

a but-for logical intention between the action and 
persecution.

 MR. KATSAS:  Mr. Chief Justice, they 

certainly get discretion in conducting the analysis of 
what constitutes assistance.  But Fedorenko said that 
that -- that inquiry is independent of any question of 
duress on -- it said that the inquiry should happen 
case-by-case, that's fine; but it gave -- the footnote 
in Fedorenko gave us two clear data points to help frame 
the analysis.

 One is the conduct of a woman who does 
nothing more than cut the hair of people bound for 
execution.  Court said, as a matter of law, that cannot 
constitute assistance.  The other data point is the case 
of an armed prison guard who, perimeter guard who keeps 
people in a camp; and the Court said, of course, that 
constitutes assistance.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you would say 

the woman who cuts the hair does participate in the 
persecution if there is a guideline that says look, we 
are not going to execute anybody unless -- before their 
hair is cut, right?

 MR. KATSAS:  I would not say that.  I think 

Fedorenko --

as a case that's not covered by the statute, even if the 
person is not going to be executed unless the woman does 
her job?

 MR. KATSAS:  I think Fedorenko -- Fedorenko 
says that the -- the level and degree and character of 
assistance of the woman simply cutting the hair does not 
constitute assistance.  At the other continuum of 
conduct, Fedorenko says that the conduct of an armed 
prison guard does constitute assistance, even if, as in 
Fedorenko, the guard served under duress.

 And Justice Stevens, if I could come back to 
the facts of Fedorenko, the district court in that case 
found that if Fedorenko did not serve at the prison 
guard -- at the prison camp, he would have been 
executed.  That finding was not reversed either by the 
Fifth Circuit or by this Court, which held that duress 
was not relevant to the inquiry of assistance.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Katsas --
MR. KATSAS:  Petitioner --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What -- what about the 

position that the displaced person's act was special to 
the Holocaust?  I mean, we are dealing with people who 
said we were just following orders, and we did not want 
to grant those people asylum.

engaged in an enterprise where other countries in the 
world -- and should we look to see how they are 
interpreting this notion of duress, coercion?  Are they 
considering it irrelevant; would just look to see if the 
person in fact was provided some material assistance to 
persecution?

 MR. KATSAS:  Justice Ginsburg, it's true 

that the Displaced Persons Act was limited to the Nazi 
regime, and later statutes, the Refugee Act generalizes 
in the sense of eliminating the time and place 
restrictions on the definition of refugee.

 On the specific question of the persecutor 
bar, Congress carries forward the same language with an 
affirmative indication of intent to preserve the 
concept.

 With respect to your point about the Nazis 

being singularly horrific in human history, think of how 
that feature plays out under Petitioner's theory.  Under 
Petitioner's theory, the uniquely horrific nature of the 
Nazi regime gives rise to a dramatically expanded class 
of people who can credibly raise a duress defense on 
anyone under -- anyone under Adolf Hitler in the 
organization chart of the Nazi government could credibly 
say, if I didn't kill Jews, I would be killed myself.

they made?  I looked into the person's eyes and they

for some little contradiction in the testimony.  If the

other.  They are going to come from one of the groups of 
one or the other.

 MR. PINCUS:  They may, Your Honor.  But that 
-- that's a problem -- we already have a system where we 
were deciding whether someone is persecuted and all 
these issues arise.  We are already looking very 
specifically at all the facts.  The same facts -- the 
same factual development would be relevant to the 
coercion issue.  As I said, the applicant will bear the 
burden of proof.

 And here, the -- as in other cases, the 

country reports are often relied on and are revealing as 
to whether what the situation is, what the specific 
context is, makes sense.

 If I could turn to the criminal law question 

that Justice Scalia asked.  I think the criminal law 
background is very relevant here as well, because the 
treaty that this statute was enacted to implement our 
obligations with respect to, right -- referred 
specifically to crimes.  The exclusion that was -- that 
is authorized by the treaty says, and I am quoting from 
an excerpt on page 11 of our reply brief:  "has 
committed a crime against people" -- "a war crime or a 
crime against humanity."  That therefore makes very 
relevant this body of law that has been developed in the

criminal --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Why is that an apt analogy? 

If we looked at all the duress cases that have been 
decided since the beginning, are we going to find cases 
where someone said -- someone claims that I was told I 
had to kill 25 people, 100 people; I had to put people 
out in the sun until they died, because if I didn't do 
that, I was going to be shot?

 Aren't the situations entirely different?
 MR. PINCUS:  I think you are combining two 

questions, Your Honor.  One -- one is should this 
language be interpreted to have a coercive -- to require 
uncoerced conduct in order to label someone a 
persecutor.  We think this is very relevant in deciding 
that question, because the underlying treaty that was 
implemented specifically referred to crimes, and crimes

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not actually an 

answer but go ahead.

 (Laughter.)
 MR. PINCUS:  Well, I'm sorry.  May I finish

sentence.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You finish your 

 MR. PINCUS:  -- my thought.  The language at 
issue here, those came later in the re-enactment of that 
language in another context.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel. 

The case is submitted.
