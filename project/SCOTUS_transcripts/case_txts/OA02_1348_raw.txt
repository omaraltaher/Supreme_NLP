          CHIEF JUSTICE  REHNQUIST:   We'll hear  argument

next in No. 02-1348, Olympic Airways v. Rubina Husain.

          Mr.  Harakas.    Am  I  pronouncing  your   name

correctly?

            ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. HARAKAS

                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

          MR. HARAKAS:  Yes, Your Honor. 

          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

          Over 70 years  ago, the  drafters of the  Warsaw

Convention   created  a   treaty   which  set   forth  the

circumstances  under which air carrier liability should be

created in  the event of passenger  injury or death.   The

legal regime they created recognized there's circumstances

where  the passenger  should  be entitled  to  a cause  of

action, but it also expressly recognized the need to limit

that liability and set forth  certain conditions when that

limited liability would apply.   Article 17 of the  Warsaw

Convention creates  a presumption  of  liability but  only

when three conditions precedent are satisfied. 

          One,  there has to  be an accident  in which the

passenger suffers a bodily injury or dies and the accident

took place on board the  aircraft or during the course  of

embarking or disembarking.

          The issue before  the Court here today  -- we're

dealing with the  accident condition precedent.   Was that

satisfied in this case?

          Of  course, the  -- the  Court  in Saks  in 1985

specifically addressed the  issue of what is  an accident,

and  the Court  defined  an  accident  as an  unusual  and

unexpected event that's external to the passenger.

          Of a particular importance to this case is where

the Court declined to extend the accident and encompass an

injury  that  results from  the  passenger's  own internal

condition  and --  and  in  response  to  the  normal  and

expected operations of the aircraft.

          Thus,  until recently, the courts have held that

injuries  arising  out  of  the  passenger's   preexisting

medical conditions  do not satisfy the  accident condition

precedent even if  there were  allegations of air  carrier

negligence.

          QUESTION:  I take it you don't take the position

that -- that, let's say, any death resulting  in part as a

result of  one, but not the only, cause of the preexisting

conditions is thereby  excluded from the  -- the class  of

liability.

          MR. HARAKAS:  I think you have -- Justice --

          QUESTION:   Every --  in other  words, having  a

heart condition does not immunize Olympic Airlines against

liability if  somebody  dies of  a  heart attack  per  se.

You're not taking that position.

          MR. HARAKAS:   Our position is that  if somebody

is on board  an aircraft and they  die of a  heart attack,

that is -- that is not  an -- that's a -- the  passenger's

own internal  reaction and it just  happened to be  -- the

passengers happened to be on board the aircraft.

          QUESTION:  Sure, if -- if they're simply sitting

in the  seat and nothing unusual  happens and they  have a

heart attack  and die, sure, there's no liability.  But if

there  are other  conditions --  and the argument  here is

that there are  other conditions --  and the heart  attack

was merely a contributing cause -- it was a condition upon

which those other conditions acted -- that does not -- the

existence of the heart condition does not immunize Olympic

Airlines  against  liability.   That's  --  I  don't think

that's your argument, is it? 

          MR. HARAKAS:  Well, no.  What the argument is --

and  in this case  here, you have  to look to  what is the

injury-producing   event?    The   injury-producing  event

here --

          QUESTION:    And  -- and  they  say  the injury-

producing event is -- or one of the -- the analyses is the

unexpected refusal of the airline  personnel to allow this

individual to  get moved into a smoke-free zone.  And that

unusual and unexpected event, combined  with the smoke and

the  heart condition, caused  the death.   But it  was the

unexpected refusal to remove from a smoke zone that is the

unexpected event or occurrence that is the accident.  What

is your answer to that?

          MR. HARAKAS:   I respectfully disagree  with the

characterization, which was adopted by the court below, in

that in  this case you  have to --  you -- you  can't just

simply look  to the fact that you had the flight attendant

saying we're  not going to  move you.   He was  assigned a

non-smoking seat.  He --

          QUESTION:   He was assigned  a non-smoking  seat

which happened to be in a zone with smoke.

          MR. HARAKAS:  Well, in -- on board any aircraft,

when smoking is allowed, you  have ambient cigarette smoke

throughout the aircraft, and in this case you have to look

to --  it can't be disputed that this passenger reacted to

the  cigarette  smoke   and  the  injury-producing   event

indirect -- 

          QUESTION:  But less in -- less in row 15 than in

row 48.

          MR. HARAKAS:  That's  -- that's correct, Justice

Ginsburg.   However, when you have  -- when you  -- in any

aircraft when  you -- when they  used to allow  smoking on

the aircraft,  as at this time, you  could be 10 rows away

and you would still be  exposed to that ambient  cigarette

smoke. 

          But the point we have to look to is with respect

to the  Warsaw Convention  is what type  of liability  did

they want to create.  You know, when we get into issues of

straying  away from  the direct cause  -- because  when we

look  to almost  every single  Warsaw  Convention accident

case,  the focus has  always been  on what is  that direct

injury-producing event.   When  we start  inserting common

law concepts of --

          QUESTION:   Well, you say direct, are -- are you

trying to make the -- the act omission distinction?

          MR.  HARAKAS:   Well,  the  act  and  -- in  one

respect, but -- but in the broader sense, you have to look

to is  what  has always  been the  event  the courts  have

looked to, what did the  drafters intend the event --  the

-- the cause to be?  It's not -- I don't think it's proper

to  inject  full-blown  common  law  notions of  proximate

causation. 

          QUESTION:  No --  no one is -- no  one is making

the common  --  I don't  think is  making  the common  law

argument  here.   They're saying  it  was unexpected  as a

matter of fact that somebody  who wanted a -- a  smokeless

seat, who  found there was smoke  in the area of  the seat

and who was  asked to be  moved, would be  refused by  the

airline.  That is the unexpected event.

          MR. HARAKAS:  But -- but that's what courts have

done after the Supreme Court's decision  here by the Court

in Tseng because  at that time, before Tseng,  courts used

to find that it didn't  matter whether you had allegations

of true negligence because we do have to look to --

          QUESTION:  The  -- the point is  the allegations

are  not of  negligence,  which is  a legal  and normative

conclusion. 

          MR. HARAKAS:  Yes. 

          QUESTION:  The allegation is simply, as a matter

of fact,  it is not to be expected that a stewardess would

stand there and  say, no, you can't move him.   Whether it

was negligent or  not negligent, it simply  was unexpected

as a matter of fact, and they're saying that satisfies the

unexpected event.

          MR. HARAKAS:   I -- I  disagree.  I  don't think

that satisfies the unexpected event. 

          QUESTION:  Well,  it could  and it is  different

from ordinary  negligence.  I  mean, it is  conceivable at

least that to have an  airline stewardess say no when  the

policy of the airline and the standard generally is to the

contrary and  to say, no, I  will not consider  moving you

even though  there were seats further away  from the smoke

origin.

          MR. HARAKAS:    I don't  believe in  the --  for

purposes of the article  17 accident analysis, you --  you

-- your -- you should or should be allowed or  it's proper

to  go  beyond looking  to  asking  what  is that  injury-

producing event.

          In this instance  here, we have to  remember too

that,  yes,  there  were  three   requests  to  be  moved.

However, the passenger  himself never  asked to be  moved.

It was always through his wife.  He was a doctor.  He knew

his own condition.  I mean, we can all get into  the whole

reasonableness issue, but what happened --

          QUESTION:    Which  --  which  is  a  matter  of

defense.

          QUESTION:  Yes. 

          MR. HARAKAS:  Yes, it's a matter of defense.

          QUESTION:   But Justice O'Connor's  question and

my question is -- is the question that goes to whether you

get into court to  defend.  And you're -- you're giving us

a -- an argument that, in effect, we weren't negligent.

          MR. HARAKAS:  No. 

          QUESTION:    But  our questions  were  wasn't it

unexpected  in fact that somebody would be in the position

that this passenger was in. 

          MR. HARAKAS:   I don't --  well, I think  that's

where the courts below and where you get -- where  you can

cross the lines and confuse the concepts of negligence and

causation in this case because  here you could say was  it

unusual,  unexpected for a  -- for  a -- when  a passenger

makes a request to be moved.  In a certain sense, yes, you

could say that it was -- it could unusual, unexpected, but

I  think  you have  to come  back  to is  but is  that the

injury-producing event.   And that's what the  courts look

to.

          QUESTION:   Were there other seats  available in

the economy section?

          MR. HARAKAS:  There were other  seats available,

Chief Justice. 

          QUESTION:  In the economy section? 

          MR. HARAKAS:   In the  economy seat section.   I

think  when  you --  it  was very  difficult  to determine

because  the  plane  was --  there  were  approximately 11

seats.    Some  of  those 11  seats  were  in  the smoking

section, but the --

          QUESTION:  And  in addition, there were  the no-

revenue people who could have been asked to leave.

          MR. HARAKAS:  There were the non-revenue people,

but when  you look to  the record, the only  way you could

determine the  non-revenue people  -- in  fact, we  had to

submit post-trial submissions  after the  trial to --  for

somebody to  testify to interpret  the codes that  were on

          QUESTION:  This doesn't have anything to do with

the case, does it?

          MR. HARAKAS:   No, it  doesn't, Your Honor.   It

doesn't have --

          QUESTION:  So what are  we talking about it for?

I mean, it -- it -- the issue before us is not negligence.

          MR. HARAKAS:  It's not --

          QUESTION:  The issue before us is whether it was

an accident.

          MR. HARAKAS:   Exactly.  It is whether it was an

accident.

          QUESTION:   May I ask this question?  I know you

didn't argue about negligence, but  you do seem to draw  a

distinction between  affirmative conduct  on the  one hand

and failure to  act on the other hand.  And my question to

you is, supposing that without  asking the stewardess, the

passenger had gotten into a -- a non-smoking seat seven or

eight rows  ahead of  where he  was sitting  and then  was

ordered to  return to his seat.   Would that have  been an

accident?

          MR.  HARAKAS:   Under the  circumstances, no,  I

don't  think  under   --  for   purposes  of  the   Warsaw

Convention, that would have been an accident.

          QUESTION:  That would have been.

          MR.  HARAKAS:    It  would   not  have  been  an

accident.

          QUESTION:  It would not have been.

          MR. HARAKAS:  Because again, the injury --

          QUESTION:  So then --  then you don't rely on  a

distinction for the action and non-action.

          MR.  HARAKAS:  Well, because --  well, I do rely

on the  distinction between action and  non-action because

you could have an omission  which in and of itself  cannot

be an  accident.  I -- I  really gave a lot  of thought to

this.  I looked at the cases and I could never find a pure

omission being an accident.   A omission can result in  an

accident.

          QUESTION:  Well,  why is  this a pure  omission?

It seems  to me she misrepresented that the plane was full

twice when that wasn't true.   That doesn't sound like  an

omission to me.   She told the  wife to sit down.   She --

well,  how do you  treat that  she was supposed  to report

such incidents to her supervisor and she didn't do that?

          MR.  HARAKAS:   The  -- the  bottom line  of the

allegations here  were that  the --  the flight  attendant

should have  taken action  to move  Mr. --  Dr. Hanson  to

another seat, and failure to do so would be --

          QUESTION:   And part of what -- part of what she

had --

          MR. HARAKAS:  -- in itself an omission. 

          QUESTION:  Part  of the  picture is things  that

she affirmatively did  do, and part are things  she didn't

do.    And  I  don't  understand  that  the  law  makes  a

distinction between doing what one should not have done or

not doing what one should have done.

          MR. HARAKAS:   Generally in --  under negligence

law  -- under negligence law a negligence can be an act or

omission.   But here, when you're looking to the treaty of

an accident  defined as  an unusual,  unexpected event  or

happening, you basically have a non-event, something  that

did not happen.  You -- you see that I think in the --

          QUESTION:  Yes, but you  -- you say you wouldn't

draw the  distinction I suggested.  So assume the case was

the other  way around, that the stewardess told him to get

back to his seat.  Now, why would that not be an accident?

          MR. HARAKAS:  Because at that point, when he got

back to his seat, he would be back  to his normal assigned

non-smoking seat.  While in close proximity to the smoking

section, again,  you have to see  that smoke on  a smoking

aircraft, a known  smoking aircraft,  nobody -- you  know,

there was  no surprise here when  he got on  board on this

aircraft that there  was a -- there was going  to be smoke

on this aircraft -- is not an unusual, unexpected event.

          QUESTION:   But I  want to be  sure I understand

your position.   If the stewardess had gone to the captain

of the plane  and said, we've got  a guy in the  back seat

who said he's going to  die because he can't stand  smoke,

he wants to sit in the front seat, and he's grabbed a seat

up there, should I order him back to the old seat, and the

captain  says,  yes,  send  him back,  would  that  be  an

accident? 

          MR.  HARAKAS:   Under the  Warsaw Convention,  I

don't think it  would be an accident, and here's  why.  It

-- these are extreme examples that -- with respect to that

where -- the passenger in  this case -- don't forget  too,

the flight attendant did give the option to this passenger

to move.   He  could have  taken self-help  to remedy  the

situation,  but he  opted not  to.   But in those  type of

situations, you have instances  where they're very extreme

examples, but --  and the  convention doesn't  necessarily

provide a remedy for all those types of situations.

          QUESTION:  I -- I take it -- I take it you think

-- is it Abramson  in the Third Circuit where  they -- the

-- the passenger can't lie -- lie down.

          MR. HARAKAS:  Exactly, Justice Kennedy. 

          QUESTION:  You  take the  position that case  is

wrong?

          MR. HARAKAS:  No.  That -- that position -- that

case is  -- is 100 percent correct and it's very analogous

to our case because in the Abramson --

          QUESTION:  That's  -- that's --  it seems to  me

there's an accident in that case.

          MR. HARAKAS:   In that case, the -- the court of

appeals found there was not an accident.

          QUESTION:  I understand, but it seems to me that

there is. 

          MR.  HARAKAS:   Well, Abramson  followed the  --

almost the  exact criteria set forth by the Court in Saks.

Was it  an unusual, unexpected event?  And they found that

being seated in  an aircraft  seat --  you're assigned  an

aircraft seat -- is not -- and sustaining an injury due to

your own  internal reaction  was not  an accident  because

they, again, focused on what was the precise factual event

that led to the injury.

          QUESTION:  Of course, there it seems to  me that

the -- the internal cause is -- is much greater than it --

it is here. 

          Let --  let's --  can we  take the  case on  the

assumption  --  I  think  we must  take  the  case  on the

assumption, based  on  the  --  on  the  findings  of  the

district court, that if they  had moved the passenger, the

event would not have occurred.

          MR. HARAKAS:  We have to --

          QUESTION:  Now --

          MR. HARAKAS:  Yes.  We have to take --

          QUESTION:    --  if we  take  the  case on  that

assumption, it's  -- it  seems to  me it's  got  to be  an

accident.

          MR.  HARAKAS:    I  disagree,  Justice  Kennedy,

because again, I -- I just come back to when I was looking

at all the cases and looking at the treaty and the text of

the convention,  you always do have to look to the injury-

producing  event because the  text of  the treaty  says an

accident  which causes the  damage.   And I think  it does

come down to showing what is the direct event.

          I think  when you look at the Krys case, I think

the  Court --  the Eleventh  Circuit in  Krys clearly  set

forth, I  think, a very workable standard.  They say let's

look at the -- we ask let's look at the precise event.  We

look  at what  were  the precise  events that  caused this

injury, not the actions of the air carrier that they could

have taken to avert that injury.

          QUESTION:  But  was it determined here  that the

passenger died from smoke exposure? 

          MR. HARAKAS:  There was at the -- there was a --

a legal  finding that  it was  the smoke  that killed  the

passenger even though --

          QUESTION:   And  do  we take  the  case on  that

understanding? 

          MR. HARAKAS:  You would have to take the case on

the  understanding  because we  didn't  raise  the factual

issue that he would have died from the food poisoning.

          QUESTION:  And  is it the case  that there would

have been seats  possibly available more removed  from the

smoke so that it wouldn't  have been as heavy an  exposure

to smoke?

          MR. HARAKAS:  I don't -- I don't think there was

any  evidence  to  establish  the  concentrations  of  the

cigarette  smoke.    There were  seats  that  were further

removed, but then you come down  to, again, factual issues

or determinations as to, well,  how far do you remove  the

passenger.  Is three further rows further ahead, five rows

further ahead enough? 

          QUESTION:  But  here there  was a total  refusal

to --

          MR. HARAKAS:   There  was a  -- well, there  was

a --

          QUESTION:  -- to provide any help.

          MR. HARAKAS:   There was a  refusal to --  there

was a  refusal to  move him because  the flight  attendant

believed the flight was full,  and it was, other than  the

10 seats.   But the -- the flight attendant  did give this

passenger the option to reseat himself.

          QUESTION:   Well,  you --  you say  you have  to

consider just very precisely what caused the injury.  What

is your view here of what caused the injury?

          MR. HARAKAS:   What  caused the  injury was  his

exposure to  the cigarette smoke  under the facts  of this

case and on  the findings.  And then  we have to determine

was cigarette smoke in that area, ambient cigarette smoke,

unusual, unexpected, and  even the lower court  found that

cigarette  smoke on a smoking  aircraft is not an unusual,

unexpected event.

          QUESTION:   When you say the -- the airline gave

the passenger the option to reseat  himself, wasn't it the

option  to -- to request another passenger to change seats

with him?

          MR. HARAKAS:  To change seats with him.

          QUESTION:  Yes. 

          MR. HARAKAS:  Or he could have -- what the -- or

he  could have moved through the cabin  to see if he could

locate an empty seat. 

          But mind you, the flight attendant never had any

direct  communications  with Dr.  Hanson.   It  was always

through his wife.  There were two requests made to move on

initial boarding.

          QUESTION:  Well, but does that make -- does that

make any difference in -- in this case, the fact  that his

wife was speaking for him? 

          MR. HARAKAS:  No.  I  mean, it would have made a

difference  in  the  lower  court  as   to  the  issue  of

reasonableness and things  like that,  but for purpose  of

the legal  issue before the Court,  no, it doesn't  make a

difference because, again,  when you look  at -- when  you

look at all the various cases, when you come through Krys,

Abramson, and the other pre-Tseng cases -- and I draw that

distinction  before Tseng  -- the  courts universally  had

held that  a  passenger's injury  arising out  of his  own

internal reaction to the conditions on the aircraft is not

an accident.

          And  when  you  look  to   the  history  of  the

convention itself,  here the  lower courts,  in effect  --

while we say they didn't use negligence, they, in  effect,

imported   concepts    of   negligence,    reasonableness,

reasonable alternatives, things like that,  those types of

concepts.

          QUESTION:  How about other  courts?  I mean,  we

do look to see  what our treaty partners do  in this area.

The  two other courts  that were  cited in the  brief that

addressed this question seem to agree with the decision of

the Ninth Circuit in this case. 

          MR. HARAKAS:  Yes.  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.   The

one court was an Australian  court in Povi, a lower  court

case, which  that  case has  been appealed  and argued  on

appeal.  And that case -- that was in the DVT context.   I

think that court suffered from the same fundamental errors

that the courts here below did in viewing what the --

          QUESTION:  What  about the  court of appeals  in

England -- 

          MR. HARAKAS:  -- that --

          QUESTION:  -- that disagreed on the -- on the --

whatever that --

          MR. HARAKAS:  Yes, the DVT litigation. 

          QUESTION:  Disagreed on that,  but did say, went

out of its way  to say, it thought that this  case was the

right way to go about it.

          MR. HARAKAS:  Well, the -- on the DVT litigation

case,  the court  found  that  --  he disagreed  with  the

reasoning of the lower courts,  but he said that he  could

certainly  understand  the  result.   But  he  was, again,

focusing in on the facts because if you applied the --

that he thought that this  case came out right below.   We

wouldn't even -- we wouldn't  even give dispositive effect

to our own  dictum much less to  the dictum of a  court of

appeals in England. 

          MR. HARAKAS:   You're  -- you're  right, Justice

Scalia.   It  was dicta.   And what  happened was  in that

case, I think he had a  misperception of the facts at  the

end of the day,  and if you applied the rationale  that he

used for his opinion in dismissing those cases, the  facts

of this  case would  inevitably lead  to the  dismissal of

this case and a finding of no accident.

          QUESTION:   I don't  think so,  having read  his

decision and the other members of the court of appeals. 

          QUESTION:        What    was    Lord   Phillips'

misperception?

          MR. HARAKAS:  As to the enforced exposure to the

cigarette smoke because -- because  the passenger here was

given the option to relocate, and he could have  relocated

himself.

          QUESTION:  The option being  -- the option being

the one that was mentioned a moment ago.  Your husband can

get up and try to get somebody else to move?

          MR. HARAKAS:  Switch  or find another -- one  of

the available  empty seats.  Because then you also have to

remember, again,  I  -- well,  I don't  want  to get  into

the --

          QUESTION:  She -- she  said positively there are

no empty  seats.  The -- the option  that was given to the

wife was  that  you go  ask  another passenger  to  switch

seats.

          MR. HARAKAS:   Sure, because  -- because at  the

time, you  know, there were only  11 empty seats,  and she

said that the  plane is full.   And that -- and  that's at

the time of boarding as  well, in the middle of  boarding.

It's  a  flight  that  had   been  delayed  for  3  hours.

Everybody is coming on board the plane. 

          QUESTION:  But  by the time the second and third

inquiries were  asked, it  should have  been evident  that

there were empty seats.

          MR. HARAKAS:   Well, the  -- the second  inquiry

was just  before  -- shortly  before takeoff  on  -- on  a

flight delayed  for 3  hours, and  they're trying  to take

off, and she  says, I can't help  you right now.   And one

thing -- and then the third one was shortly after takeoff.

          QUESTION:   Well, but  the --  I wouldn't  think

they allowed smoking before takeoff.

          MR. HARAKAS:   No,  they did  not allow  smoking

before  takeoff.    It  wasn't  until the  third  incident

shortly after takeoff  when smoking was allowed,  and then

she said,  can you please  move my husband  now?   And the

request was denied.

          But I think  with -- with  respect to the  whole

accident inquiry issue here, we also have to look to, when

you  start  bringing  in  the  definition  of what  is  an

accident,  when   you  start   equating  with   issues  of

negligence  and common law,  I think  we go astray  and go

contrary  to what  the drafters  intended  as to  what the

Court here  in Tseng held, that  you don't --  accident is

not a common law concept.  It's a self-contained --

          QUESTION:   If Tseng  had held  nothing on  this

point, in  fact, it -- it  said that the  Second Circuit's

conclusion that that  wasn't an accident was doubtful.  In

Tseng, it  was an academic question.  What barred her from

getting recovery under  the treaty  was she didn't  suffer

from a physical injury or from a psychological injury with

-- with physical  manifestations.  She didn't die  and she

didn't have  the kind of injury that would qualify.  Tseng

--  I  think  you  are quite  wrong  in  saying  that that

decision passed on the concept of accident.

          MR. HARAKAS:   No.   I agree  with you,  Justice

Ginsburg.  I  may have misspoke because  you're absolutely

right.  There was only that one footnote that -- where the

Court did express concern as  to whether the court in  the

Second Circuit flexibly applied the Tseng decision.  But I

was talking  about the  -- what  I meant  was the  broader

context of Tseng with respect to importation or allowing a

parallel state cause of action in light of the exclusivity

of the convention and the  uniformity principles set forth

in the convention.

          And   if  you   start   importing  concepts   of

negligence back into the convention -- because, in effect,

what the courts  are doing below is they're  saying, fine,

we can't go  to State law, but  what we'll do is  we'll --

we'll  define an  accident  to  make  it equivalent  to  a

negligence  cause  of  action.     So  there's  really  no

difference.   What the courts are  doing is nullifying the

exclusivity holding by  equating any act of  negligence as

an accident.

          QUESTION:  But are  -- are you saying here  that

the court of appeals really  wrote an opinion about --  in

negligence and saying that's an accident?

          MR. HARAKAS:  When you  read the -- the language

of the  court of  appeals,  it's --  it's pure  negligence

language. 

          QUESTION:   But -- but  it seems to  me whatever

you think  about what the flight  attendant did, it  -- it

can't be classed as negligence here.  It  was a refusal to

do something. 

          MR. HARAKAS:  It was a refusal.   It was a -- it

was a -- in my view, it was an omission, and I think at --

when you  take omissions and put it in the context of what

is  -- is  that  an  unusual,  unexpected event,  that  an

omission cannot in and of itself be the accident.

          QUESTION:  I don't know if we really have to get

into the act  versus omission  question here because  this

was more than  that.  It was  a refusal to take  action in

the face of an alleged severe medical problem and in -- in

contravention to the rules of the airline at the time.  So

you could  characterize this,  I  think, as  some kind  of

positive action, in effect. 

          MR. HARAKAS:   Well,  I --  when I  think of  an

event,  I think of  some type  of positive action,  and in

this instance,  when --  when I  look at  a refusal  to do

something, I look at it as -- as an omission.

          But  even if you  did look  at it as  a positive

event here, Justice  O'Connor, I think you --  although --

everything leads  us back  to trying  to identify  was the

event  that caused  the injury  here unusual,  unexpected.

And that -- there's only  one injury-producing event.  For

example,  let's say nobody asked the  airline in this case

to move Dr.  Hanson.   There was no  request made, and  he

remained in his non-smoking seat. 

          QUESTION:   No request made?  I thought the wife

made a request. 

          MR. HARAKAS:  I'm sorry. 

          QUESTION:  Excuse me.

          MR. HARAKAS:  A hypothetical.  

          QUESTION:  Oh.

          MR. HARAKAS:   Let's assume no request  had been

made, and  he would have remained in that same non-smoking

seat and he would have died because of the exposure to the

ambient cigarette smoke,  according to plaintiffs' theory.

What  would  be the  injury-producing  event there?   What

caused that death?  His internal reaction to the cigarette

smoke, the normal -- which was normal and expected.

          Now, the fact that they  asked -- somebody asked

for him to  be moved  doesn't change the  injury-producing

event.   The injury-producing event is the same.  It's the

exposure to the cigarette smoke.

          QUESTION:   Well,  but  of course,  the exposure

might have been substantially reduced if the passenger had

been able  to get seated in  an area further  removed from

the active smokers.

          MR. HARAKAS:   There -- he still  would have had

-- there  still would  have been  ambient cigarette  smoke

throughout the cabin, as we all well know.

          QUESTION:  Well, suppose there were five rows of

empty  seats in front and  a -- a  stewardess -- and there

are stewardesses like this sometimes  that we don't people

wandering around the plane.  We're serving food.  You must

sit down in your seat.  A different case?

          MR. HARAKAS:   No, not a different  case because

you are  assigned to your  assigned seat, and  again, it's

one  of those extreme  examples that  if I  believed there

were five empty rows  here, he probably would have  gotten

up and found it  himself.  But in that case,  I don't feel

there  would be a  different case  because, again, I  -- I

focus  in  on this  injury-producing  event here,  and the

injury-producing  event is the exposure to cigarette smoke

which was normal and expected.

          QUESTION:  So your -- your submission is  if the

airline requires  you to sit in the no-smoking seat for no

particularly good reason, there's still no accident.

          MR. HARAKAS:   Oh, I --  I disagree on  that one

because if  they required you to sit in a non-smoking seat

and you had --

          QUESTION:  Well, that was my hypothetical. 

          MR. HARAKAS:   Okay.   If they  -- if you  -- if

they require you to sit in a smoking section?

          QUESTION:   No.   One  -- just  one  -- one  row

ahead.

          MR. HARAKAS:   There would  be no difference  in

the situation from this -- from our scenario.  There still

would not be an accident.   He was assigned a  non-smoking

seat and  you -- again,  you look to was  his own internal

reaction here to the normal  and expected operation of the

aircraft. 

          And  I  think  when  -- when  you  look  at  the

convention, the structure of the convention, and what they

had in mind by the term  accident, you have to -- you  can

only come back to that one basic conclusion, that you look

to what is that injury-producing event.

          I'd like  just to  reserve the  remaining --  my

time for rebuttal if there are no further questions. 

          QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Harakas.

          Mr. Farr, we'll hear from you.

           ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III

               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

          MR. FARR:   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

          There are  basically two  reasons  why we  think

that  article  17  imposes   liability  when  an   airline

knowingly leaves  a passenger in medical  jeopardy without

taking basic measures to alleviate the harm.

          First, because  that  kind  of  action  violates

normal industry safety practices and thus, under Saks --

          QUESTION:  Well, that's the question.   Is it an

accident?   You assume it.  You say that kind of accident.

Well, I think that's the issue.  Is it an accident?

          MR. FARR:  I'm sorry if I said that kind of -- I

meant to say that kind of action under Saks is contrary to

-- to the normal industry safety practices.

          QUESTION:   Let me ask about  Saks.  It's  -- it

seems to  me that the fallacy in the argument that -- that

you --  you run and  that the  Government runs is  that it

accepts the  language of Saks as  the totality of  what is

necessary to be an accident.

          Now, Saks involved a fellow who had some problem

with his ear  which was -- caused him  harm because of the

normal  depressor  --  pressurization  of  the --  of  the

cockpit.   And in  denying relief  under the --  under the

convention, the Court  says, no,  that wasn't an  accident

because the cockpits are pressurized all the  time, and if

it --  it has  --  to be  an accident,  it  has to  be  an

unexpected or unusual event or happening.  Okay.

          Saks was not  saying that  that is a  sufficient

condition to be an accident.  It was just saying that that

is a necessary condition. 

          Now,  let  me  --  let me  give  --  give  you a

hypothetical and you  tell me why -- why  this would be an

accident.    It  seems  to  me  the  hypothetical  closely

parallels what happened here. 

          A man hurls  himself into  the sea intending  to

commit suicide.   There is right nearby to where he hurled

himself into the  sea a dock with  30 people on it  and 30

life  preservers at their  feet, and  not a single  one of

them picks  up the  life preserver  and throws  it to  the

drowning  man.    I  don't know  why.    Maybe  they're 30

libertarians  who  think  people should  be  able  to kill

themselves.  Whatever. 

          (Laughter.) 

          QUESTION:  Certainly  -- certainly an unexpected

and unusual  event.  Who would  imagine that with  30 life

preservers within  reach of  the man,  nobody would  throw

one. 

          Now, would anybody  in his  right mind say  that

this  man died because  of an  accident?  Of  course, not.

Unexpected and unanticipated is a -- a necessary condition

for  --  for  saying  that  something  was  caused  by  an

accident, but it's surely not a sufficient condition.

          And it seems  to me what happened in  this plane

is exactly like that.  It is an event after the person was

endangered.   I --  I don't  think that  this person  died

because of an  accident.  It  just doesn't  make it.   And

that's the language of the convention, not Saks.

          MR. FARR:   Well, Justice Scalia, it seems to me

that --  that the point that  you're making, which  in one

sense I think is a correct one, is that the language of --

of  article 17, if  one looks  at it in  purely colloquial

terms, may not  exactly correspond with the  definition in

Saks.   But the language in  article 17 isn't  used -- the

term accident isn't  used purely in the  colloquial sense.

What we know from the context of the convention as a whole

and the  liability system as a whole and from Saks is that

sometimes it  actually captures  less than  the colloquial

sense of the term accident, sometimes it's more.  

          For example, the  mere fact that somebody  has a

heart attack typically would be,  in the colloquial sense,

thought of  as an accident.   But we've learned  from Saks

that it  is not itself going to be considered the accident

because  of  the context  of  article 17  and  the --  the

language about accidents causing death or bodily injury.

          By  the  same token,  the deliberate  refusal to

help somebody,  as the Chief Justice pointed out in his --

his  earlier  question  I think,  is  --  is normally,  in

colloquial terms, not thought of as an accident.  It's not

inadvertent.  It's deliberate.   But we know under article

17 that  deliberate conduct can, in fact,  be an accident.

If a flight attendant strikes  a passenger in the face  or

throws coffee on  the passenger in a fit  of rage, that is

an accident for purposes of article 17.

          QUESTION:   I'm  willing  to say  that negligent

conduct such  as occurred  here can  be an  accident.   Of

course, it can.  If -- if the flight attendant spills some

hot  liquid on the  passenger causing the  passenger to be

scalded, of course, that -- that's an accident.

          MR. FARR:  Well, Justice Scalia --

          QUESTION:  That  fits the  normal -- the  normal

concept of accident.

          MR. FARR:  Of course, but -- but --

          QUESTION:  What  happened here does not  fit the

normal description of accident.

          MR.  FARR:    But  my example  is  not  a  -- an

accidental spilling.  I'm -- I'm actually talking about it

just to try to  get at the colloquial sense, which I think

is what disturbs you, that -- that if -- if in fact the --

the flight attendant  purposely throws  the coffee on  the

passenger, just become irritated with  the passenger, that

would not normally be thought of as an accident, if you're

asking people around the coffee  shop whether there's been

an accident.

          But in  terms of article  17, it is  an accident

because we  know article  17 covers  instances of  willful

misconduct.  Article 17 is the gateway by which you get to

any liability,  and willful misconduct  includes certainly

the  kinds  of  --  of  things  that  I'm  talking  about,

deliberate conduct.

          QUESTION:  Can this be  said to be that kind  of

conduct where it's contrary to the policy of the airline?

          MR. FARR:   Yes,  it can, Justice  O'Connor.   I

mean, one  of the things that's a little bit curious in --

in tying the two questions  together with Justice Scalia's

question, this  is a -- this is  an incident which in fact

is to some extent intentional. 

          QUESTION:  Yes.

          MR. FARR:  I mean, the -- it was not inadvertent

that  -- that  the passenger  was left  in his seat.   For

example,  just  --  just  to  take a  different,  slightly

changed analogy, if in fact the passenger had -- had asked

to be moved  in -- out of  the vicinity of the  smoke, and

the flight attendant had said, let me wait until everybody

is seated, I'll come back and get you in half an hour, and

she forgot to do that,  that would actually in  colloquial

terms seem more like an accident.  Somehow negligently she

forgot to  come back.   But  in fact,  in this  particular

case, she was asked three  times and knowing in fact  what

she was doing, she said, no, I'm not going to move you.

          QUESTION:   What  if she --  what if  she'd been

asked to move  him, and she  said I'll  be back, and  then

another passenger gets very ill  and she has to take  care

of  him  right away,  and  then the  facts  are the  same.

Accident there?

          MR. FARR:  The question  then I think -- the  --

the proper way to answer that, Justice Kennedy, is to look

at what would happen in the normal flight under the normal

circumstances.  Obviously, under  the circumstances we had

here, it's  unusual and  unexpected that  she didn't  move

him.  If in fact the reason was that there was  some other

enormous  problem  on  the  plane and  all  of  the flight

attendants had to deal with  that particular problem, then

it seems to me the -- the action here would not be unusual

and unexpected.

          QUESTION:  Well, that's --

          QUESTION:  Your  -- you  stated in your  opening

that the airline's  conduct here was contrary  to industry

policy, and I  think Justice O'Connor premised  an earlier

question on saying it was against the policy of -- of this

particular  airline.  Spell  that out a  little, will you?

What was the  policy of -- of the airline and why did this

action violate it?

          MR. FARR:   The  policy of the  airline and  the

policy generally, because I think they're in this case the

same --

          QUESTION:  They're the same. 

          MR. FARR:   -- was  when a passenger  requests a

move  for  medical   reasons,  that   the  policy  is   to

accommodate that request if it's  possible to do so.   And

it was possible here because there were empty seats in the

coach cabin,  so we don't have to get into the complicated

questions of  whether you  have to move  someone to  first

class or to -- to alleviate the problem. 

          QUESTION:  Would -- would it have been any  more

or less  of an accident if that practice had not prevailed

in the industry? 

          MR. FARR:   I think it's possible that it would.

I mean,  I --  our position  is not  that essentially  the

industry   can  give  itself   immunity  by  lowering  its

standards so much that --  that acts that -- that  clearly

are unusual, but  nonetheless within  the -- the  industry

standard are  -- are immune from  liability.  But  I think

the  general idea  is  in trying  to evaluate  things that

aren't  obviously accidents, we have  to have some sort of

benchmark  to  judge whether  what's happened  is unusual.

The natural place is to look  -- is -- is at the  industry

practice.   And if in fact what they've done is consistent

with  industry practice, I  would think in  the usual case

certainly that would suggest there  hasn't been an unusual

event.

          QUESTION:  Well, but it was unusual here.

          MR. FARR:  Absolutely.

          QUESTION:  So  why isn't this an accident in the

same sense  that having an attendant throw hot coffee on a

passenger would be?

          MR. FARR:  It is.

          QUESTION:   Supposing  the airline's  defense to

throwing hot coffee on the passenger said our stewardesses

do that all the time. 

          (Laughter.)

          QUESTION:  There's unexpected about it.

          MR. FARR:   I mean, the -- the fact is as I say,

that  I  don't think  that necessarily  having a  very low

standard in the company itself or in the industry will, in

fact, give  you immunity, although I  have to say  I think

that in fact  that's an unlikely  thing to happen  because

when  we  talk  about  the  Warsaw Convention,  there's  a

natural --

          QUESTION:    Mr.  Farr, can  I  interrupt  for a

second?   It seems to me  that in the question  of whether

you move  a passenger or not,  you could have  a situation

which   for  security   reasons,   as  they   have  around

Washington, every passenger  must remain in his or  her --

her seat for 500 miles or 30 minutes or so, and refusal to

move during that period could not possibly be an accident.

          MR. FARR:   That's correct, Justice Stevens.   I

think --  but -- but  the analysis would  be the same.   I

mean, one  of the  instructions that  Saks gives, I  think

correctly,   is  that  you   have  to  look   at  all  the

circumstances.    What  is  unusual  or  unexpected  under

certain circumstances would not be  unusual or expected --

unexpected under other circumstances like the one --

          QUESTION:  What  -- what  role does fault  play?

It -- it seemed to me, as  I was reading the Ninth Circuit

opinion  in  Saks,  that  negligence  is  probably  not  a

requisite.  I don't know if that makes it necessary for us

to send it  back.  Suppose we think that's true.  Would we

send  it back  to the court  of appeals  and say,  no, no,

negligence is  -- is not the  standard, go ahead  and find

fault on  their -- or whether  or not there's  an accident

under some other standard?

          MR. FARR:   Justice Kennedy, I --  I don't think

that's  necessary.    I  mean,   what  the  Ninth  Circuit

basically said was  this is an unusual or unexpected event

under Saks because it violates industry policies, industry

standards, the company policy, and particularly  given the

nature of the request.   If the Ninth Circuit had  stopped

there, it  seems  to  me  that  their  decision  would  be

absolutely correct.

          QUESTION:   Well, it didn't.  It went on and got

a bunch of negligence language in there. 

          MR.  FARR:   Well,  it's the  following sentence

that  obviously raises  at least  some questions.    And I

should say  I'm not sure that  -- that language  in itself

should  be as  troubling  as it  perhaps  appears to  some

because  the  -- the  situations  that --  that  the court

describes  there  very often  will  be,  it  seems to  me,

unusual or unexpected situations. 

          But nonetheless,  it seems  to me  that --  that

following  the  adage  that  the   Court  sits  to  review

judgments and not opinions, that the Court can simply say,

as we -- we suggest would  be sufficient, that you do have

an unusual  and unexpected event when  you fail to  help a

passenger in violation of the standard industry practice.

          Now, if the standard industry practice would  be

not to help  a passenger  under certain circumstances  and

the claim is  still made that it's  unusual or unexpected,

one would need  another benchmark  for reference, but  the

Court doesn't need to reach that in this case.

          Now, I would like to  -- to also point out  that

in -- in -- when we're talking about the language of -- of

article  17, while  I think it's  -- it's proper  to -- to

focus on the  language itself and discuss it in  -- in the

context of Saks, that it's also I think proper to  look at

the context of the convention  as a whole and whether,  in

fact, competing interpretations of the term accident would

lead to absurd consequences. 

          Here I think  if in fact  the definition or  the

application of the definition that Olympic tries  to -- to

urge on the Court  is accepted, that one is  going to find

that --  that this convention, which is intended to be the

exclusive means of remedy for  passengers who suffer death

or  bodily injury  on an  international flight,  is --  is

going to  have essentially a hole  in it where  it doesn't

cover  situations  even,  as in  this  case,  whether it's

willful misconduct  by the  airline crew  that causes  the

injury.

          And  the  focus that  -- you  know, in  terms of

whether that is a reasonable understanding to attribute to

the parties to the convention  under the circumstances, it

seems to me when you -- when  you say a positive act would

be an accident,  an omission that would  cause an accident

would be  -- you know, would -- would involve an accident,

but there's  liability whatsoever for situations  in which

the -- the conduct itself is the  contributing factor, the

failure to do something is the -- is a strong contributing

factor,  doesn't  really make  any  reasonable sense  as a

construction, and particularly  because one of  the things

that  the --  the  parties must  have  understood is  that

during  the time that  the passenger  is -- is  covered by

article 17, if you will,  from the time of embarkation  to

the time of  disembarkation, the  passenger is largely  in

the control of  the airline.  The airline determines where

the passenger sits.   So the passenger's  opportunities to

engage in self-help are greatly reduced.

          And in that situation, the idea that the -- that

the parties thought that airlines could simply say we have

passengers  on our  plane who  need our  help for  medical

reasons,  and  we're   not  going  to  provide   any  help

whatsoever and that either causes greater injury -- causes

injury in the first place, causes greater injury, or in an

unhappy case like this one, actually causes a death, their

theory would say there's still no liability.  And it would

seem to  me you would need  a very, very  clear indication

from the  text, which  doesn't exist  here, to  reach that

result.

          QUESTION:   Well, what if someone suffered, say,

a heart attack  on the plane and  it was 3 hours  from its

destination and the  doctor there  said, you know,  you've

really got to -- in -- in order to avoid this guy probably

dying, you're  going to have  to land somewhere  en route?

Now, would  an airline be obligated to do that in order to

avoid this sort of accident?

          MR. FARR:  It depends  on the circumstances, but

I think  the general industry practice would  be, in fact,

that an airline would be -- would -- would normally divert

to a  nearer airport  in fact  to --  to save  the --  the

passenger from death or from much more severe injury.

          That in a sense is  the Krys case, the  Eleventh

Circuit case,  that Olympic says  is in conflict  with the

decision  in this  case.   That was  a case  in which  the

Eleventh Circuit said, well, the -- the failure to divert,

which  it --  it was  agreed would  --  would have  made a

significant difference to the passenger's  health, was not

unusual because the plane just  did the normal thing.   It

just  flew to its  regular destination.   But  the problem

with Krys is that if you look at all the circumstances, as

Saks says, it's  not the normal  thing just to  fly on  to

your intended destination when a passenger has had a heart

attack and the medical indication --

          QUESTION:    Well, then  --  then you're  saying

basically it depends on airline practice whether something

is  expected  or unexpected  and  whether it's  the normal

practice.

          MR. FARR:  In this context.   I mean, obviously,

sometimes it's -- it's -- if  -- if the context is the  --

the failure to help a passenger in -- in medical distress,

then it  seems to me that the usual  practice of -- of the

airline  or the industry  in general  is -- is  the proper

benchmark,  at  least initially,  for  determining whether

something is usual or unusual. 

          Now,  obviously,   there  are  other   kinds  of

accidents, crashes and hijackings and  all, where -- where

common knowledge tells  you what happened is  unusual, but

where  common knowledge  doesn't necessarily tell  you the

answer,  then  it  does seem  that  reference  to industry

standards is a useful benchmark.

          QUESTION:  Would you  comment on the distinction

between an event and an accident?

          MR. FARR:   Well,  the event  is under  -- under

Saks --  I mean, the difference is that an accident has to

be an  unusual event, that not every event is an accident.

You have to demonstrate that it's unusual, and -- and much

of  what we've talked about this morning, obviously, is --

is  why this  would be  unusual by  reference to  industry

standards.   But an  event, if  one looks at  a dictionary

definition,  is simply  something  that  happened  on  the

plane.

          QUESTION:  I think it would affect the liability

for loss of baggage and so  forth.  That's triggered by an

event, as I understand it. 

          MR. FARR:  That's correct.   It is now.   It was

at one time triggered by an occurrence, and under the 1999

Montreal Convention it's triggered by an event.  Yes.

          QUESTION:  Do you think the Abramson case in the

Third Circuit was properly decided?

          MR. FARR:   I don't -- I am  not sure the result

was wrong.   I don't  think the approach  was correct.   I

think the court should have asked what  the usual industry

practice would  have been in that  case, and if  the usual

industry practice would have been to make an accommodation

along the lines that -- that the passenger requested, then

I  think that  might have well  have been an  accident.  I

think it's  a -- it's a  difficult question as  to whether

that   would  have  been   true  because  that  particular

passenger needed to be moved into first  class, needed two

first class seats, and in fact part of the solution was he

was perhaps going to introduce  self-induced vomiting as a

cure, which obviously would affect other passengers in the

cabin.  So, you know,  on the facts, one ultimately  might

have said  --  the --  the judgment  that  was made  there

actually  comported   with  --  with  the  usual  industry

standards.  However, we don't know the answer  because the

Third Circuit didn't ask the right question. 

          QUESTION:  But you do think the Eleventh Circuit

Krys case was wrong in both reasoning and result.

          MR. FARR:  Well,  Krys -- we have  an additional

piece of information  because the court went on  to decide

the case.  This was pre Tseng.  So it actually decided the

case as a  common law negligence case, and when it did so,

it found that what the  airline had done by not  diverting

in  that  particular  case  was  a violation  of  industry

standards.   So  in that  case I  think  what should  have

happened in Krys is that  the court should have made  that

inquiry as  part of the Warsaw Convention analysis, and if

it had done so in fact, it would have limited the recovery

in Krys, which was many millions of dollars, to the limits

of the Warsaw Convention, supplemented by the agreements.

          If  the  Court has  no further  questions, thank

you.

          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Farr. 

          Ms. McDowell, we'll hear from you.

           ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL

              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

       AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

          MS. McDOWELL:   Mr.  Chief Justice,  and may  it

please the Court:

          A flight  attendant's refusal  to assist  an ill

passenger can amount  to an accident within the meaning of

the Warsaw Convention.   The  analysis focuses on  whether

such  conduct   is,  objectively   speaking,  unusual   or

unexpected, taking into account the ordinary practices  in

the industry and  other indicia of what would  be expected

in the circumstances. 

          At  a minimum  it's reasonable  to construe  the

convention's term accident, as the United States construes

it, to encompass the aberrant conduct of the  flight crew,

and  this  Court  has ordinarily  accorded  weight  to the

United  States'  reasonable  construction of  treaties  to

which it is a party. 

          Our reading of the  term accident comports  with

the  text structure and  purposes of the  convention.  The

term is a broad and  inclusive one.  It's not  confined to

crashes or explosions or equipment failures.  As the Court

recognized  in Saks,  it  can encompass  a  wide array  of

unusual and  unexpected events  external to  the passenger

potentially --

          QUESTION:  Ms. McDowell --

          MS. McDOWELL:  Yes.

          QUESTION:    --  assuming  that  it  could  have

happened somehow in an airline context, would you say that

Justice Scalia's hypothetical was an accident?

          MS.  McDOWELL:   I  think that  a failure  of an

airline employee to  come to the assistance of a passenger

can, indeed,  be an accident.   One must recall  that even

under the  common law,  common carriers  such as  airlines

have been  understood to have  special obligations  toward

their  passengers,  not expansive  obligations  to act  as

physicians to them,  but to  provide reasonable first  aid

until they reach the destination.  So I think that -- that

this particular context is --  is quite different from the

context when one is dealing with just a bystander.

          And I think  under the common law as well, there

have  been other situations  that might well  be viewed as

accidents that involved omissions when one is under a duty

to act.

          QUESTION:    Okay.    Let's   say  it  wasn't  a

bystander.   Let's say that, you  know, they were  -- they

were relatives.  They're the  parents of -- of the  person

who jumped.   You  still wouldn't  call that  an accident,

would  you?   Does it  have anything  to  do with  -- with

whether there's  a duty or not?   Some States do  impose a

duty  on -- on  bystanders, by  the way, and  let's assume

that happens in a State where there is a duty.

          MS. McDOWELL:  Well, I think the inquiry here --

          QUESTION:     You  still  wouldn't  call  it  an

accident,  I don't think.   I  mean, nobody would  use the

English language that way.

          MS.  McDOWELL:   Well,  I  think here  under the

Warsaw Convention, the  term accident has been  understood

to refer to an unusual, unexpected event. 

          QUESTION:   Okay.   But wouldn't  you --  Warsaw

Convention or not, wouldn't you call it an accident if the

bystanders had put  up an advertisement saying,  swim with

us for $500, and then they stood there?

          MS. McDOWELL:   Yes,  that would  -- that  would

seem to be an accident.

          QUESTION:  That would get a little closer to our

situation, wouldn't it?  And that -- 

          MS. McDOWELL:  Yes, Your Honor. 

          QUESTION:    --  and  that   might  well  be  an

accident.

          MS. McDOWELL:   Other  circumstances --  medical

malpractice cases, for  example, might  be those where  an

omission of  some sort, because the doctor is under a duty

to act,  could be viewed as  an accident.   For example, a

failure  to  diagnose  or to  treat  a  particular medical

condition  until  it's too  late,  if that  was negligent,

could be an accident.

          QUESTION:  Would -- would  you say that we ought

to write  the opinion so that if there is negligence, that

is evidence that  normal airline practices were  not being

followed,  and that's an accident?   So that negligence is

important to the analysis, not necessary, but it -- it can

be helpful.

          MS. McDOWELL:  We would say that --

          QUESTION:  Or -- or should  we write the opinion

without talking about negligence?

          MS. McDOWELL:   We  would say  that the  test is

objective reasonableness  which connotes some of  the same

concepts as negligence does in the common law.

          QUESTION:    Well,  how does  --  how  does that

differ from --  from the common  law at all?   If you  say

objective  reasonableness,  you're  really  just  changing

accident into common law negligence, aren't you?

          MS. McDOWELL:   Well,  not in all  circumstances

because  negligence isn't  a  necessary  condition for  an

accident to occur.  An accident could be an act of God and

an event that did not involve negligence. 

          In  this particular case,  yes, the inquiry into

due care  and the inquiry into  an -- whether  an accident

has occurred are quite similar,  but they're still focused

on  a  different  question.    The accident  inquiry  asks

whether something unusual or unexpected has  happened, and

the due  care inquiry  under article  20 asks  whether the

airline has acted with due care.

          QUESTION:  Well,  negligence is a proxy  for the

fact that normal  airline operating  rules were not  being

followed. 

          MS.  McDOWELL:    Correct.   Now,  there  may be

isolated instances where although ordinary practices  were

being followed,  those practices were  so deficient  that,

nonetheless,  an  accident  might  be  found.    Normally,

however, I think  that -- that airlines'  practices are to

treat passengers  reasonably.  So I think  that asking the

reasonableness question would be the  same as -- as seeing

whether there was  a deviation from standard  policies and

practices.

          In construing the --

          QUESTION:   You know,  I think  there  may be  a

public policy reason for  construing accident contrary  to

its normal meaning to embrace  in this context intentional

acts whether  by the airline employees or by pirates or --

or terrorists or anybody else.  But  I don't -- I -- there

-- there's a problem in  my mind about interpreting it  to

-- to embrace especially negligent omissions.  It seems to

me that's  so far away from the normal meaning of accident

that I don't -- I don't see the justification for doing it

especially   where  it   converts   the  convention   into

essentially what it was not  intended to be, liability for

negligence.  That --

          MS. McDOWELL:  Well, of  course, in this case we

don't have  a mere negligent omission.   We have  what the

district court found  to be willful  misconduct.  We  also

found -- this case also involves a -- a refusal to  act, a

series  of refusals  to  act,  and  --  and  provision  of

misinformation  about  whether the  flight  was completely

full or  not.  So it's  -- it's difficult  to characterize

this particular case --

          QUESTION:   No, the  misinformation didn't  bear

any causality.   I mean,  the --  the --  what caused  the

injury here was -- was not the misrepresentation about the

other seats.  It was simply the failure to move the person

to another seat, and that is totally an -- an omission, it

seems to me. 

          MS.  McDOWELL:   I  don't  think  it's  properly

characterized  as  an  omission   when  there  were  three

increasingly desperate  requests to  reseat the  passenger

and the flight attendant responded on each occasion --

          QUESTION:   I  take  it back.    Three --  three

omissions. 

          MS. McDOWELL:   I think  that this sort  of case

can be contrasted, for example, from a -- a simple failure

to  warn case  where the  question  is whether  an airline

should have  warned about a  particular medical  condition

that  a  passenger  might  have  in response  to  ordinary

flight.   This seems to involve much more.  Certainly Lord

Phillips in the English court of appeals thought that this

case  involved much more  than --  than just a  failure to

act.

          The drafters of the Warsaw Convention  certainly

didn't intend that airlines would be insurers for any harm

that befell a  passenger during flight.  They  did intend,

however, that airlines would be held liable when their own

fault  caused  a  passenger's   death  or  bodily  injury.

Indeed, they eliminated the caps  on damages in cases when

that fault  rose to the level of willful misconduct.  This

would seem doubtful  that the drafters intended  simply by

their  choice  of  the term  accident  to  exempt airlines

entirely from liability in cases  where passengers died or

suffered  bodily injury  because of  the  airline's fault,

including willful misconduct in this case.

          QUESTION:     Well,  is  airline's   fault  even

required?  Supposing that before the plane took off, there

was a big fire in the area and smoke filled the  -- filled

the aircraft while it was  on the runway and then  he died

from that smoke, would that be an accident?

          MS. McDOWELL:   It  could well  be an  accident,

Your  Honor.    It  might not  be  an  accident  for which

liability would -- would be properly --

          QUESTION:  Why wouldn't it be?

          QUESTION:   There's  going  to  be  an  accident

within the  meaning of the  convention is what  I'm asking

you. 

          MS. McDOWELL:  Yes, it probably would.

          QUESTION:  So then the smoke doesn't have -- the

-- the --  whatever the  accidental cause  is, it  doesn't

have to be fault of the airline.

          MS.  McDOWELL:    That's  correct  because   the

airlines  have  the opportunity  under  article 20  of the

convention  to come back  and say  that we cannot  be held

responsible  for  this  accident because  we  did  not act

negligently.

          The understanding  --

          QUESTION:   I thought they had to show more than

that.  I thought they had to show that they did everything

possible to prevent -- to prevent the --

          MS. McDOWELL:   Well, the term in  the treaty is

all necessary measures.

          QUESTION:  Yes.

all  reasonable  measures.     So  it's  essentially  been

understood  as  a  --  a due  care  defense.    And that's

reinforced in the Montreal Convention, the  new convention

that has just come into force, that  -- that uses the term

negligence in its own words.

          The understanding that the accident  requirement

can  be  satisfied  in  cases  like  this  one serves  the

convention's  purpose of  balancing the  interests of  air

carriers and  passengers.  Such cases do not pose a threat

of  particularly expansive liability  to airlines.   Cases

such as this one where  air carriers do something that  is

unusual and  unexpected and  thereby  cause a  passenger's

death  or  bodily   injury  can  be  expected   to  remain

relatively few  under the  convention, as  they are  under

U.S. domestic law.  Imposing liability, meanwhile, enables

passengers and their  families to receive some  measure of

compensation for their  injuries and provides  appropriate

incentives for airline supervision and  -- and training of

their personnel. 

          For all of these reasons,  we'd ask the judgment

of the court of appeals be affirmed.

          QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. McDowell.

                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

          MR. HARAKAS:   Mr. Chief  Justice, I think  when

you -- when you look at the arguments that were  made both

by the respondents and the Solicitor General, it all comes

back  to the  issue of  negligence, wanting  to equate  an

accident with negligence.

          The Warsaw Convention wasn't an all-encompassing

treaty.   There were certain holes  left in the convention

where there  wasn't going to be recovery.  For example, if

there's no bodily  injury, there's  no recovery under  the

Warsaw Convention,  as set forth by the Floyd decision, no

matter, let's say, how egregious the air carrier's conduct

may have  been.   It  set forth  certain  things, and  the

convention wanted to define the  liability based on the --

by  using  that  term  accident  not making  reference  to

various common law notions.

          I think one of the problems that we're seeing is

that confusing  what is the accident  -- and that's  why I

always  come back to  the injury-producing event.   In the

hijacking situation, for example, the accident there isn't

the failure of the airline to conduct proper screening and

allowing the hijackers to come on board the aircraft.  The

accident is  those hijackers get on the -- on the airplane

and they  injure  a passenger.   And  that  -- the  injury

itself is the accident.   Just like in the smoke  example,

if there was a fire someplace and the cabin filled up with

smoke,  the  smoke itself  injuring  the passenger  is the

accident.    Why   the  smoke  got  there   is  completely

irrelevant.

          So  when  you --  when  you start  injecting the

whole concepts of negligence, I think you upset the  whole

balance of the convention, and -- and one of the principal

goals of  the convention was to  have a uniformity  and to

limit the liability of the carrier.  In fact, the Montreal

Convention of 1999, which just -- which  just entered into

force last  week here in  the United States,  retained the

term accident.  The issue of whether the carrier should be

liable for  the state of the  health of the  passenger has

always been a very special and unique issue in the context

of the  convention's history.   Post-ratification  conduct

from 1945 all the way through the -- all the way to the --

the Montreal Convention  of 1999,  the contracting  states

were very careful  and very reluctant to make the carriers

liable  for injuries arising  out of  their -- out  of the

state of health of the passenger.

          And the -- with respect  to the policy arguments

where  they  say --  where  the respondents  and Solicitor

General say that the -- there are certainly policy reasons

should  be  considered   in  weighing  in  favor   of  the

passengers in this instance, I  think when you look to  --

54

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005
