 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERT W. REIN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. REIN:  Mr. -- Mr. -- General Suter 

 Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the Court, 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I get to say 

 (11:04 a.m.) 
 MR. REIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

5

7  University of Texas at Austin.  And you get to say --

10
11  trained me too well. 
12
13  and may it please the Court: 
14
15
16  approving that its use of race as an admissions-plus 
17  factor in the consequent denial of equal treatment, 
18  which is the central mandate of the Equal Protection 
19  Clause, to Abigail Fisher met the two tests of strict 
20
 First --
21
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Rein, before we get 
22
23  to that, because the Court is supposed to raise it on 
24  its own, the question of -- of standing.  The injury --
if the injury is rejection by the University of Texas, 
25

 The central issue here is whether the 
University of Texas at Austin can carry its burden 

scrutiny which are applicable.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you get past 

Texas v. Lesage with that injury --

 MR. REIN:  Lesage --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- which says that mere 

 MR. REIN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, the first 
injury that was before the Court was the use of a system 

1  and the answer is, no matter what, this person would not 
2  have been accepted, then how is the injury caused by the 
3  affirmative action program? 
4
5
6  which denied equal treatment.  It was a Constitutional 
7  injury, and part of the damage claim was premised 
8  directly on the Constitutional issue. 
9
10
11
12
13  use of race is not cognizable injury sufficient for 
14  standing.
15
16  merits, and the question was whether Lesage could carry 
17  his case when -- on summary judgment, when it was 
18  apparent that his complaint, which was that he was 
19  denied access to the graduate program at the University 
20
21
 As I said -- and there are several factors 
22  in this case that are quite different.  First, there is 
23  a Constitutional injury as such, and the Court has 
24  recognized it.
25

 Second, the fact premise, she could not have

and get in automatically, and she didn't, correct? 

 MR. REIN:  No, that's not correct, 

 MR. REIN:  Correct. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  She disclaimed the 

1  been allowed in under any circumstance, was never tested 
2  below, wasn't raised below.  It comes up in a footnote 
3  in --

12  Your Honor.  She -- she was not automatically admitted. 
13  She was considered for the summer program and rejected.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you have to claim an 

injury.  So what's the injury --

she could have attended a different university in the

 MR. REIN:  Well, that issue, of course, is

 MR. REIN:  The -- the denial of her right to 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You still haven't 

answered how Lesage gets away from that --

 MR. REIN:  Well, Lesage --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- but if there's a --

 MR. REIN:  Well --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that you're claiming 

1
2
3  that would sustain a claim of damages? 
4
equal treatment is a Constitutional injury in and of 
5
6  itself, and we had claimed certain damages on that. 
7  We -- we started the case before it was clear whether 
8  she would or wouldn't be admitted. 
9
10
11
12
13  give me another --
 MR. REIN:  Well, I think --
14
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- damages question. 
15
16
 MR. REIN:  On the -- if we then, on remand, 
17  were to assert damages contingent upon the fact that she 
18  should have been admitted to UT and was not admitted, we 
19  would then have to prove that, but for the use of race, 
20
21
22  something you can't tell on this record.  It's merely 
23  asserted.  And I would point out that Texas said below, 
24  there was no way to determine that issue without --
25

she would be admitted.  That's the thrust of Lesage. 

 Whether we can prove it or can't prove it is 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What damages --

gotten the contract otherwise, have we? 

 MR. REIN:  No, sir. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's -- it's been enough 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  We've had cases involving 
1
2  alleged discrimination in state -- state contracting. 
3  And we haven't required the person who was discriminated 
4  against because of race to prove that he would have 
5
6
7
8  that there was a denial of equal protection. 
 MR. REIN:  That is our correct, and that is 
9
our first premise.  And I would say that the same issue 
10
11  was raised in Bakke.  And in Bakke, the contention was 
12  he couldn't have gotten into the medical school; 
13  therefore, he has no case.  The Court said, in footnote 
14  14 to Justice Powell's opinion, that's a matter of 
15
16
17  type of contention was made with respect to the 
18  Louisville class plaintiffs, whose son had been admitted 
19  to the school of his choice, and the Court said damages 
are enough to sustain standing.  There is a live damages 
20
21  claim here, and I don't think there is a question of 
22  standing. 
23
24  necessarily that she would have been -- would have been 
admitted, but that she was denied a fair chance in the 
25

merits; it is not a matter of standing. 

 I think in -- in Parents Involved, the same

2  participation in the contracting lottery, he has

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If you are going to the --
7  to the merits, I want to know whether you want us to --
8  or are asking us to overrule Grutter.  Grutter said it 
9  would be good law for at least 25 years.  And I know 
that time flies, but I think only nine of those years 
10
11 
have passed. 
12
 (Laughter.) 
13
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And so, are you?  And, if 
14  so, why overrule a case into which so much thought and 
effort went and so many people across the country have 
15
16  depended on? 
17
18  carefully, we were not trying to change the Court's 
19  disposition of the issue in Grutter.  Could there be a 
legitimate -- a compelling interest in -- in moving --
20
21  in using race to establish a diverse class. 
22
23  throughout the case is there are varying understandings, 
24  not of the legitimacy of the interest, but how you get 
25

there; is it necessary to use race to achieve that 

 MR. REIN:  Justice Breyer, we had said, very 

 What -- the problem that we've encountered 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So your question is 

 MR. REIN:  We litigated it on that basis,
 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, how do you want to
 

1  interest; what does a critical mass --
2
3  whether -- your point is does your case satisfy Grutter? 
4  Is that what you're arguing?
5
6  yes.
 
7
8  argue it right now in the next ten minutes?  I'm
 
9  interested because I have a very short time to get my
 
question out, and I need to know how you are going to 
10
11 
argue it. 
12
13  argument is we can satisfy Grutter if it's properly 
14  read.  What we've seen --
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21
22  under Grutter, would this plan be acceptable? 
 MR. REIN:  Well, I think that there would be 
23
24  flaws under Grutter, even if you assumed away something 
25

specifically, let's take away the 10 percent solution. 
Suppose the only plan were the one that is before the 
Court now, no 10 percent.  This is the exclusive way 
that the University is attempting to increase minority 
enrollment. 

that can't be assumed away because it is a matter of 

 MR. REIN:  Well, Justice Breyer, our

 Then, if we had no 10 percent solution,

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, then the -- the 

 MR. REIN:  Well, I don't agree with that, 

 In order to satisfy Grutter, you first have 

this program is certainly no more aggressive than the 

1  Texas law, that is, there is a top 10 percent program, 
2  and that --
3
4  question is can you have both?  But it seems to me that 
5
6  one in -- in Grutter; it's more -- in fact, more modest. 
7
8  and let me explain why. 
9
to say that you are not just using race gratuitously, 
10
11  but it is in the interest of producing a critical mass 
12  of otherwise underrepresented students.  And so to -- to 
13  be within Grutter framework, the first question is, 
14  absent the use of race, would we be generating a 
15
16
17  got to examine in context the so-called soft factors 
18  that are in Grutter -- you know, are -- is there an 
19  isolation on campus?  Do members of minority feel that 
20
21
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The one social studies 
22  that this University did said that minority students, 
23  overwhelmingly, even with the numbers they have now, are 
24  feeling isolated.  So what do -- why isn't that even 
25

critical mass? 

 To answer that question, you start -- you've

 MR. REIN:  It was done after 

 MR. REIN:  Well, the survey was -- a random 
survey.  It's not reported in any systematic way.  They 

1
2  evidence is adequate, is necessary, or not.  Why does 
3  their test fail? 
4
5
6  evidently interviewed students.  And it was all about 
7  classroom isolation.  It wasn't about --
8
9  before or after they announced the decision to 
10
11
12  President Faulkner had made the declaration they were 
13  going to do it.  It was done before --
14

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And by the way, do you 
18
19  think that Grutter -- this goes to Justice Breyer's 
20
21  no more affirmative action in higher education after 
22  2028? 
23

 MR. REIN:  No, I don't. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was that the holding of

immediately after our decision in Grutter.

question -- do you think that Grutter held that there is

 And two courts have found, it seems to me, 

Official 

 MR. REIN:  That was -- that was not --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a scary -- that's a 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I agree it might, but I 
want to get to the question, so, what I'm trying to 

1
2
3  scary --
4
5
6  pinpoint, because we have such a limited time, and to 
7  me, the one thing I want to pinpoint, since you're 
8  arguing on that this satisfies Grutter, if properly 
9  understood, as you say that.  In looking up, we have a 
10
11
12  that here, there is a certain thing -- there is no 
13  quota.  It is individualized.  It is time limited.  It 
14  was adopted after the consideration of race-neutral 
15
16  consideration, and race did not become the predominant 
17  factor. 
18
19  to know what precisely it is that Grutter required in 
your opinion that makes this different from Grutter, in 
20
21  that it was not satisfied here?  The ones I listed, two 
22  courts say are the same.  So maybe there's some others. 
 MR. REIN:  I'm not sure we agree with those 
23
24  courts in their method of analysis.
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But we have a rule that if 

means.  Each applicant receives individual 

 So I take those as a given.  And then I want 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  There are facts, and there 

are facts, aren't there? 

 MR. REIN:  Well -- and -- particularly in
 
the case of considering alternatives that have worked 

1  two courts say it, we're very reluctant, on something
 
2  connected with facts, to overturn it, so -- so that's
 
3  why I mention that.
 
4
5
6  about as well, I think that's a legal question this 
7  Court is free to act on. 
8
9
10
11
 MR. REIN:  So if I might try to answer your 
12  question, there was no effort in this case to establish 
13  a -- even a working target for critical mass.  They 
14  simply ignored it.  They just used words, and they said, 
15
16  predicate question, which Grutter asks:  Absent the use 
17  of race, can we generate a critical mass? 
18
19  think is in Grutter.  We think it's necessary for this 
Court to restate that principle.  Now, whether that --
20
21
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That -- that's a normal 
22  fact that we accede to two-court holdings on, whether 
23  there is -- is or is not a critical mass? 
24
25

 MR. REIN:  No.  I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a weird kind of a 

we've got to do more.  So they never answered the 

 So -- I mean, that's -- that's a flaw we

 MR. REIN:  Well, Justice Scalia, that is 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No -- putting aside -- I 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So could you tell me 

 MR. REIN:  And I'm -- I'm not saying --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's an estimation, isn't 

1  fact. 
2
3
4  it?  A judgment?
5
6  correct.  And in addition, the courts didn't find 
7  whether a critical mass --
8
9  what a critical mass was?  I'm looking at the number of 
blacks in the University of Texas system.  Pre-Grutter, 
10
11 
when the state was indisputably still segregating, it 
was 4 percent.  Today, under the post-Grutter system, 
12 
13 
it's 6 percent.  The 2 percent increase is enough for 
you, even though the state population is at 12 percent? 
14 
Somehow, they've reached a critical mass with just the 
15
16 
2 percent increase? 
17
 MR. REIN:  Well, we don't believe that 
18  demographics are the key to underrepresentation of 
19  critical mass.
20
21  don't -- I'm not going to quarrel with you that, if 
22  demographics alone were being used, I would be somewhat 
23  concerned.  But you can't seriously suggest that 
24  demographics aren't a factor to be looked at in 
25

combination with how isolated or not isolated your 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

or at least ought to be. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why don't you 

Official 

 MR. REIN:  Well, I think, if you start to 

1  student body is actually reporting itself to feel? 
2
3  split out subgroups of minorities, you mistake, I 
4  think -- what I think is the proper thrust of Grutter, 
5
6
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It might be insulting --
7  it might be insulting to some to be thrown into a pot. 
8
9  seriously suggest that?  Why don't you seriously suggest 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  position because it seems, to me, right. 
18
19  balancing is not a permissible interest.  And we have 
20
21  permissible interest.  And that is something we 
22  certainly agree with. 
 Trying to respond to Justice Sotomayor 
23
24  and -- and in the framework of Grutter, what you're 
25

that demographic -- that the demographic makeup of the 
state has nothing to do with whether somebody feels 
isolated, that if you're in a state that is only 
1 percent black that doesn't mean that you're not 
isolated, so long as there's 1 percent in the class?
 MR. REIN:  Certainly -- racial balance --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I wish you would take that 

looking at is, do you -- does this person, member of a 

 MR. REIN:  Well, Justice Scalia, racial 

constantly -- this Court has constantly held not a 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 And I think we've always said, if you have a 

very large number, as Texas did in 2004, when they 

1  so-called underrepresented minority -- it's a concept we 
2  don't necessarily accept, but it's Texas' concept -- are 
3  they isolated?  Are they unable to speak out? 
4
5
6  ostensibly made the decision to reinstitute race, they 
7  had a 21 percent admission percentage of what they 
8  called the underrepresented minorities. 
 They also had about an 18 percent admission 
9
ratio of Asian Americans.  So on campus, you're talking 
10
11  about -- about 40 percent of the class being minorities. 
12
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, but the test is -- the 
13  test is, in your opinion -- I have to write this in the 
14  opinion, let's say -- the proper test of critical mass 
15
16  That's the test.  And that wasn't in Grutter or was in 
17  Grutter?  And in your opinion, it was in Grutter? 
 MR. REIN:  Yes.  It said expressly in 
18
19  Grutter --
20
21 
 MR. REIN:  In Grutter, the Court assumed 
22
23  that the very small number of admissions -- minority 
24  admissions, looked at as the whole -- and it was looked 
at as a whole, only as a whole in Grutter -- would have 
25

is, is the minority isolated, unable to speak out. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Isolated.  And the reason 

it was satisfied there and not here is?

 MR. REIN:  We -- it's not our burden to 

1  yielded about 3 or 4 percent minority admission in a 
2  class of 350, which means about 12 to 15 students --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what are you telling 
3
4  us is the standard of critical mass?  At what point does 
a district court or a university know that it doesn't 
5
6  have to do any more to equalize the desegregation that 
7  has happened in that particular state over decades, that 
8  it's now going to be stuck at a fixed number and it has 
9  to change its rules.  What's that fixed number?
10
11  establish the number.  It was the burden of the 
12  University of Texas to determine whether --
13
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, they told -- they 
14  told the district court.  They took a study of students. 
They analyzed the composition of their classes, and they 
15
16  determined in their educational judgment that greater 
17  diversity, just as we said in Grutter, is a goal of 
18  their educational program and one that includes 
19  diversifying classes.
 So what more proof do you require? 
20
21
 MR. REIN:  Well, if you are allowed to state 
22  all the grounds that need to be proved, you will always 
23  prove them, in all fairness, Justice Sotomayor. 
24
25

 The question is, they have --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but given it was

saying? 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's enough now. 
 MR. REIN:  And --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what you're 

1  in the evidence, what more do you think they needed?  I 
2  think I hear all you saying in your brief is the 
3  number's fixed now, they got enough, no more is 
4  necessary.
 MR. REIN:  What we're saying in the brief 
5
6  was they were generating, in fact, a very substantial 
7  number of minority presence on campus. 
8
9
10
11 
12
 MR. REIN:  No.  And that immediately thrust 
13  upon them the responsibility, if they wanted to -- you 
14  know, essentially move away from equal treatment, they 
had to establish, we have a purpose, we are trying to 
15
16  generate a critical mass of minorities that otherwise 
17  could not be achieved. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Tell me -- all right. 
18
19  Tell me what about their use of race did not fit the 
narrow tailoring -- not the necessity prong as you've

23  violated the terms of Grutter?

2
 MR. REIN:  Well, put -- put aside whether 
3  this was necessary and whether it was an appropriate 
4  last resort in -- in a quest for diversity and critical 
mass because Grutter's not without limits.  But I'll put 
5
6  that aside, and let me come directly to your question. 
7
8  tailoring, you can't tailor to the unknown.  If you have 
9  no range of evaluation, if you have no understanding of 
10
11
12  quota for critical mass? 
13
 MR. REIN:  No.  There's -- there's a huge 
14  difference, and it's an important one that is not well 
put out by the University of Texas.  Having a range, a 
15
16  view as to what would be an appropriate level of 
17  comfort, critical mass, as defined in Grutter, allows 
18  you to evaluate where you are --
19
20
21  shouldn't have. 
 MR. REIN:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, I think 
22
23  it's very important to distinguish between the operative 
24  use of that range.  In other words, that's where we are, 
25

quota, we'll call it a goal, something Grutter said you 

and we're going to use race until we get there, every

doing, that you shouldn't be setting goals, that you 

 Tell me how this system doesn't do that. 
 MR. REIN:  This system doesn't -- I mean, 

1  year, in consideration of each application, which was a 
2  problem --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Boy, it sounds awfully 
3
4  like a quota to me, that Grutter said you should not be 
5
6  shouldn't be setting quotas.  You should be setting an 
7  individualized assessment of the applicants. 
8

it's not narrowly tailored because it doesn't fit. 
10
11  There are certain forms of Grutter that it follows. 
12  It --
13
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Rein, do you understand 
14  what the University of Texas thinks is the definition of 
15
16
17  the language of Grutter.  They have no definition.  They 
18  can't fit --
19
20
21  relying entirely on the 10 percent is enough.  They 
22  don't -- they got minorities through the 10 percent, so 
23  they don't need any more.  And I tried to get you 
24  rigidly to focus on -- forget the 10 percent plan.  This 
25

to me that, in your talking about critical mass, you are

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because of the 

 MR. REIN:  Well, let me tell you that, if 
1
2  you look outside the top 10, at the so-called AI/PAI 
3  admits only -- forget the top 10 for a minute, they were 
4  generating approximately 15 percent minority admissions 
outside the top 10, which is in -- above what the target 
5
6  was in Grutter.  So this is not Grutter on its facts. 
7  It's vastly different.  This is a --
8
9  10 percent.
 MR. REIN:  No, it was -- I'm talking about 
10
11  only the non-top 10 percent admissions.  15 percent of 
12  those were so-called underrepresented minorities.  This 
13  is without the top 10.  Now, the top 10 is also a major 
14  generator of admissions for underrepresented minorities.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And this was -- and this 
15
16  was before the adoption of the plan.

20
21  the one that was arrived at with the 10 percent plan. 
22
 MR. REIN:  No.  With the 10 percent plan, 
23  it's much higher.  In 2004, it was 21 percent for just 
24  Hispanics and African Americans, and these are the 
25

categories they used.  If you add in Asians, it was over 

 MR. REIN:  That is correct.  Those are the 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I'm sorry. 

Now, I'm confused.  I thought the 15 percent figure was 

21

very close to that over time. 

 But I'm isolating -- in response to Justice

to use race directly, which came up in Hopwood. 

1  38 percent. 
2
3  Ginsburg, I'm isolating to the non-top 10 admissions. 
4  Those are over 15 percent in that year, and they average 
5
6
 So the -- the total generation of minority 
7  presence is a combination of the two in fact, but the 
8  AI/PAI system -- which was adopted in response to 
9  Hopwood, it was -- as Texas says, it was the first thing 
10
11 
12
 So that was their first response, to look at 
13  a more balanced admission program between Academic Index 
14  and Personal Achievement Index.  So it is not a system 
15
16
17  this -- and then I hope we can get back to 
18  Justice Alito's question. 
19
20
21  achieve a diverse student body because it admits so few 
22  people -- so few minorities.  And I had trouble with 
23  that, reading the brief.  I said, well, if it's so few, 
24  then what's the problem?
25

 You argue that the University's 

race-conscious admission plan is not necessary to 

which just excludes minorities. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you comment on 

 MR. REIN:  Well, it's a question --

22
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. REIN:  Well --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I see an inconsistency 

 MR. REIN:  Well --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it -- are you saying 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then -- let's assume --
1
 MR. REIN:  Excuse me, Justice. 
2
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- that it resulted in the 
3
4  admission of many minorities.  Then you'd come back and 
say, oh, well, this is -- this shows that we -- we were 
5
6  probably wrongly excluded.  I --
7
8
9  here.
10
11
12  that you shouldn't impose this hurt or this injury, 
13  generally, for so little benefit; is -- is that the 
14  point?
15
16  The second is the question of reasonably available 
17  alternatives.  If we take Texas at its word, and it says 
18  they are satisfied, they are happy going on with the way 
19  they apply race today, we tried to measure, well, what 
20
21  thing with a reasonably available race-neutral 
22  alternative? 
 That's a question that was asked in Grutter. 
23
24  They were supposed to analyze that.  They didn't look at 
25

it.  But it --

23
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. REIN:  Well, yes, that's part of it. 

difference is it making?  And could you achieve the same 

10 percent plan was to increase minority enrollment. 

 MR. REIN:  Well, we say --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And it -- and that -- the 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But is the -- the
 
1
2  race-neutral alternative is the 10 percent plan?
 
 MR. REIN:  The race-neutral alternative
 
3
4  includes an extension of the 10 percent plan because
 
it's a major generator of minority admissions.  And 
5
6  right now, that ranges at 30. 
7
8  okay because it's -- it's race-neutral.  But is it 
9  really?  The -- the only reason that they instituted the 
10
11
12
13  only way it works is if you have heavily separated 
14  schools.  And worse than that, I mean, if you -- if you 
15

17  you don't take challenging courses, because that's how 
18  you'll get into the 10 percent.

23  is nothing in the record to support it.  We don't know.

 MR. REIN:  Yes.  And even the Fifth Circuit 
13  said you can't disregard its consequences because it's a 
14  matter of law.  I'm simply saying they could choose to 
extend it beyond where it is because it's capped today 
15
16  at 75 percent. 
17
 But that's not the only option.  That's not 
18  the only alternative.  And -- and certainly, one simple 
19  alternative is they could look at the yield, that is, 
20
21  actually encouraging and -- and enrolling. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Or they could -- this is 
22

24  directly to answer it.  I did look up the figures.  And

2  5 percent per year, really, pretty steadily. 
 Then after Hopwood and 10 percent, it went 
3
4  down a little bit, not a lot, but it went down to about 
3 and a half percent -- 4 percent, maybe.  And then they 
5
6  introduced Grutter, and it's back up to 5 percent.

Federal judges dictating the policy of admission of all 
these universities?  You see why I'm looking for some

it.  It's minimal change with the use of race.  And 
that's why we say there is an alternative, which would 
serve it about as well in increasing yield or, indeed, 
in reweighting the -- the PAI, which is a critical 
element here, so that you put more emphasis on the 
socioeconomic factors and less emphasis on the essays, 
which are an academic measure within the PAI.

 And I think, Justice Kennedy, just to answer 

alternatives.  And if you look at Parents Involved, 
that -- that was the critical question.  The out -- the 
outcomes were so small, that there were readily 
available alternatives. 

1  again, how race and their use of race overwhelms those 
2  other factors in their system as it's created? 
3
 MR. REIN:  I -- the question is not whether 
4  it overwhelms them.  They're --
but they -- they say --
they admit, it is effective.  There are admissions that 
5
6  would not have taken place, but for; somebody else would

17  both levels, A, because the objective is inappropriate

19  defective.  Which or both of those are you arguing?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And in what respect does

4  certainly, it -- race should have been a last resort. 
5
6  prong of it.  And in order -- and they failed in every 
7  respect. 
 If you go to narrow tailoring, what we are 
8
9  saying is they didn't consider alternatives, and their 
treatment of, as we have pointed out, Asian Americans 
10
11 
and Hispanics makes a -- an incomprehensible 
distinction.  They say, we don't worry about Asians,

there are a lot of Asians, it's a demographic measure, 
which is a forbidden measure.

16  Texas population.  But if you are trying to find 
17  individual comfort levels, if you are breaking it down 
18  between African Americans and -- and Hispanics, the --
19
who, in your brief, has assumed that they are valuing 
20
21  different races differently.  But Asian numbers have 
22  gone up, under however they have structured this PAI. 
23  And as I understand their position, race is balanced 
24  against other issues like socioeconomics, the strength 
of the classes people took.  It's never a standalone. 
25

 They are in excess of their share of the

I say that this -- the white student president of the 
class in an ethnically different school is a measure of 
leadership. 

 So even a white student, I presume, who goes 
1
2  to an -- an entirely black or an entirely Latino school, 
3  who becomes class president, would get some points 
4  because he has or she has proven that they foster or can 
deal in a diverse environment.  That's how I understood 
5
6  their plan, that it's not just giving you a plus because 
7  of race.  It's combining that with other factors. 
 MR. REIN:  There is a plus because of race.

 For two overriding reasons, the -- the

MR. GARRE:  That's right.  And so that's the 

1  narrow tailoring category, that it is narrowly tailored 
2  the way Grutter did -- said, not the necessity prong and 
3  not the need prong -- not the necessity prong.  I think 
4  most of his argument has been centered on that, so --
5
6  second point I was going to make, which is that the 
7  holistic admissions process at issue here is a necessary 
8  counterpart to the state's top 10 percent Law and works 
9  to systematic -- to offset the systematic drawbacks of 
that law in achieving an interest that is indisputably 
10
11 
compelling, the university's interest in assembling a 
broadly diverse student body. 
12 
13
 In the interest --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, before -- I 
14
need to figure out exactly what these numbers mean. 
15
16  Should someone who is one-quarter Hispanic check the 
17  Hispanic box or some different box? 
18
19  multiracial box.  Students check boxes based on their 
own determination.  Now, this is true under the Common 
20
21  Application --
22
23  person who is one-quarter percent Hispanic, his own 
24  determination, would be, I'm one-quarter percent 
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I suppose a 

 MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, there is a 

Hispanic.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They would check 

 MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, that was -- they --

 MR. GARRE:  I don't think -- I don't think

honor code for someone who is one-eighth Hispanic and 

 MR. GARRE:  Then they would check that box, 

1
2  Your Honor, as is true of any --
3
4  that box.  What about one-eighth?
5
6  they would make that self-determination, Your Honor. 
7  If -- if anyone, in any part of the application, 
8  violated some honor code then that could come out --
9
10
11  says, I identify as Hispanic, to check the Hispanic box? 
12
13  it would, Your Honor.  I don't think that that issue 
14  would be any different than the plan upheld in Grutter 
15
16
17  any way, the racial identification?

that determination is made in any other situation, I'm 

or the Harvard plan or in Bakke --

Leagues, that I'm aware of.

13  the school at large, but class by class?  How do they

What -- are they -- somebody walks in the room and looks 
15
16  them over to see who looks -- who looks Asian, who looks 
17  black, who looks Hispanic?  Is that -- is that how it's 
18  done? 
 MR. GARRE:  No, Your Honor, and let me try 
19
to be clear on this.  The university has never asserted 
20
21  a compelling interest in any specific diversity in every 
22  single classroom.  It has simply looked to classroom 
23  diversity as one dimension of student body diversity. 
24  And after --

 This Court in Grutter recognized the obvious 

1  talking about.  I mean, it is either a factor that is 
2  validly in this case or it isn't.  Now, do they look to 
3  individual classroom diversity or not?  And if so, how 
4  do they decide when classes are diverse?
 MR. GARRE:  This Court in Grutter, Your 
5
6  Honor -- and maybe the most important thing that was 
7  said during the first 30 minutes is, when given an 
8  opportunity to challenge Grutter, I understood my friend 
9  not to ask this Court to overrule it.
10
11  fact that the classroom is one of the most important 
12  environments where the educational benefits of diversity 
13  are realized.  And so the University of Texas, in 
14  determining whether or not it had reached a critical 
15
16
17  did they look to the classroom? 
18
19
require everybody to check a box or they have somebody 
20
21  figure out, oh, this person looks 1/32nd Hispanic, and 
22  that's enough? 
23
24  that took into account the same considerations that they

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, on the classroom 

qualified as small, and the total number of African 
Americans and Hispanics who were admitted under the part 
of the plan that is challenged was just a little over 
200. 

1  available to the university, Your Honor, the race of 
2  students, if they've checked it on the application.  But 
3  I do want to be clear on this classroom diversity study. 
4  This was only one of many information points that the 
5
6
7  diversity, how does the non-top 10 percent part of the 
8  plan further classroom diversity?  My understanding is 
9  that the university had over 5,000 classes that 
10

12 
13 
14
15
16  increase classroom diversity? 
17
 MR. GARRE:  Well, Your Honor, first, I think 
18  that 200 number is erroneous.  There have been many more 
19  minority candidates in --

that possibly do more than a tiny, tiny amount to

 JUSTICE ALITO:  How many -- how many non-top 

 MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, we didn't look

time, there were no holistic admits taking race into 
account. 

1  shocking isolation against --
2
3  10 percent members of the two minorities at issue here 
4  are admitted in each class?
5
6  specifically at that determination.  What we did -- in 
7  other words, to try to find whether there were holistic 
8  admits or percentage admits, we did conclude in 2004 --
9  and, again, this was before -- we did the classroom 
10

13
14  if you looked at African Americans, for example, in 
15
16  participatory size --
17
 JUSTICE ALITO:  I really don't understand 
18  your answer.  You know the total number of, let's say, 
19  African Americans in an entering class, right?  Yes or 
20

22

 MR. GARRE:  We do, Your Honor.  But, again, 
25

 MR. GARRE:  Yes, Your Honor.

no? 

at the time --

 And what we concluded was that we simply --

90 percent of the classes of the most common

per class? 

 MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, I don't know the 

 MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, at the time --

process at issue here was adopted in 2003-2004. 

1

3

6
7  answer to that question, and let me try to explain why 
8  the university didn't look specifically at -- to that. 
9  Because at the time that the classroom diversity study 
10
11 
12
13  as important as just finding out are African Americans 
14  or Hispanics, underrepresented minorities, present at 
the university in such numbers that we are not 
15
16  experiencing racial -- racial isolation in the 
17  classroom. 
18
19  What is the critical mass of African Americans and 
20

22  And -- and this Court in Grutter --
23
24  supposed to tell whether this plan is narrowly tailored

 MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, we don't have one.

 MR. GARRE:  To look to the same criteria of 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Does critical mass vary from 

 MR. GARRE:  It certainly is contextual.  I 

first say that my friends have -- throughout this 
litigation, not in this Court, asserted 20 percent as a 
critical mass, and that's lumping together different 
minority groups. 

1
2  this Court in Grutter.  This Court in Grutter

1  and what Grutter said it meant, in terms of --
2
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Garre, could you 
3  explain -- I think you were trying to before -- what 
4  seems to me the critical question in this case:  Why 
didn't the 10 percent solution suffice?  There were a 
5
6  substantial number of minority members admitted as a 
7  result of the 10 percent solution.  Why wasn't that 
8  enough to achieve diversity? 
 MR. GARRE:  Well, let me make a couple of 
9
points, Your Honor.  First, if you just looked at the 
10
11  numbers -- we don't think it's the numbers, but if you 
12  looked at the numbers, after 7 years, racial diversity 
13  among these groups at the University of Texas had 
14  remained stagnant or worse.  2002, African American 
15
16  one part of it. 
17
 The other part of it is, if you look at the 
18  admissions under the top 10 percent plan, taking the --
19  the top 10 percent of a racially identifiable high 
20
21  but it doesn't guarantee you diversity that produces 
22  educational benefits on campus.  And that's one of the 
23  considerations that the university took into account as 
24  well.
25

school may get you diversity that looks okay on paper, 

enrollment had actually dropped to 3 percent.  That's 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand that. 

41
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. GARRE:  Because, Your Honor, as is true 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What kind of viewpoints?  I 

would want representatives and different viewpoints from 

1  Why?  Why -- why doesn't it? 
2
3  for any group -- and the Harvard plan that this Court 
4  approved in Bakke specifically recognized this, you 
5
6  individuals within the same -- the same racial group, 
7  just as you would from individuals outside of that. 
8
9  mean, are they political viewpoints?
 MR. GARRE:  Well, anyone's experiences, 
10
11  where they grew up, the situations that they -- that 
12  they experience in their lives are going to affect their 
13  viewpoints. 
14
15
16  about something else. 
17
18  impacts the educational benefits of diversity in this 
19  sense, that the minority candidate who has shown that --
20
21  environment, has shown leadership, community service, 
22  the other factors that we looked at in holistic review, 
23  is precisely the kind of candidate that's going to 
24  come -- come on campus, help to break down racial 
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  This -- this has nothing to 
do with, with racial diversity.  I mean, you're talking 

 MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, I think it directly 

that he or she has succeeded in an integrated 

barriers, work across racial lines, dispel --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Also, the kind that is 

 MR. GARRE:  1998, Your Honor. 
 But, but with respect to your -- your 

1  stereotypes --

3  likely to be included within the 10 percent rule.  And, 
4  incidentally, when -- when was the 10 percent rule 
5
6
7
8  factual point, that's absolutely wrong, Your Honor.  If 
9  you look at the admissions data that we cite on page 34 
of our brief, it shows the breakdown of applicants under 
10
11 
the holistic plan and the percentage plan. 
12
 And I don't think it's been seriously 
13  disputed in this -- this case to this point that, 
14  although the percentage plan certainly helps with 
15
16  who are admitted tend to come from segregated, 
17  racially-identifiable schools. 
18
19  whole purpose of affirmative action was to help students 
who come from underprivileged backgrounds, but you make 
20
21  a very different argument that I don't think I've ever 
22  seen before. 
23
24  African Americans -- lots of Hispanics and a fair number 
25

minority admissions, by and large, the -- the minorities 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I thought that the 

adopted? 

 The top 10 percent plan admits lots of 

of African Americans.  But you say, well, it's -- it's

the top 
1 percent of earners in the country, and they have --
parents both have graduate degrees. 

1  faulty because it doesn't admit enough African Americans 
2  and Hispanics who come from privileged backgrounds.  And 
3  you specifically have the example of the child of 
4  successful professionals in Dallas.
 Now, that's your -- that's your argument? 
5
6  If you have -- you have an applicant whose parents are 
7  -- let's say they're -- one of them is a partner in your 
8  law firm in Texas, another one is a part -- is another

14  Asian or a white applicant whose parents are absolutely 
15

 MR. GARRE:  No, Your Honor.  And let me --
17  let me answer the question.  First of all, the example 
18  comes almost word for word from the Harvard plan that 
19  this Court approved in Grutter and that Justice Powell

23  or being a Hispanic is a plus factor.

held out in Bakke. 

 MR. GARRE:  Because, Your Honor, our point 

is, is that we want minorities from different

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So what you're saying is 

 MR. GARRE:  No, Your Honor, what counts is 

1  backgrounds.  We go out of our way to recruit minorities 
2  from disadvantaged backgrounds. 
3
4  that what counts is race above all?
5
6  different experiences --
7
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's the 
8  necessary -- that's the necessary response to 
9  Justice Alito's question.
 MR. GARRE:  Well, Your Honor, what we want 
10
11  is different experiences that are going to -- that are 
12  going to come on campus --
13
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You want underprivileged 
14  of a certain race and privileged of a certain race.  So 
15
16
17  not race.  It's just the opposite.  I mean, in the LUAC 
18  decision, for example, this Court said that failing to 
19  take into account differences among members of the same 
20
21
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the -- but the reason 
22  you're reaching for the privileged is so that members of 
23  that race who are privileged can be representative, and 
24  that's race.  I just --
25

MR. GARRE:  It's -- it's members of the same 

that's race.

background or perspective, you would want people from
 

interests that -- that the Harvard plan specifically 
adopts and lays out --

1  racial group, Your Honor, bringing different 
2  experiences.  And to say that -- if you took any racial 
3  group, if you -- if you had an admissions process that

14  is narrowly tailored to a compelling interest.  The

 What -- what we look to, and we think that 
12  courts can review this determination, one, we look to 
13  feedback directly from students about racial isolation

for their race.

 MR. GARRE:  That's one of the things we 

looked at. 

 MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, that's one of the 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  What are the

 MR. GARRE:  Another is that we did look to 

the University of Texas dropped to 3 percent in 2002

3 percent is not a critical mass.  It's -- it's well

3  took into account the racial climate on campus.

6  African American population is around 2 percent?

8  would.  I mean, our concept to critical mass isn't tied 
9  to demographic.  It's undisputed in this case that we 
are not pursuing any demographic goal.  That's on page 
10

138 of the Joint Appendix.

14  modest factor.  It's undisputed that we're taking race

16  totality.  This is a --
17
18  the issue that my colleagues are asking is, at what 
19  point and when do we stop deferring to the University's 
judgment that race is still necessary?  That's the 
20
21  bottom line of this case.  And you're saying, and I 
22  think rightly because of our cases, that you can't set a

 MR. GARRE:  Yes, Your Honor.  And I think --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You address that in 

1  pages 415 and 416 of the Joint Appendix, where it makes 
2  clear that Ms. Fisher would not have been admitted to 
3  the fall 2008 class at University of Texas no matter 
4  what her race, because her --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just to be clear, 
5
6  are you arguing that she doesn't have standing in an 
7  Article III sense? 
8

11  obligation to consider it in every case, and what you 
12  gave us is one footnote in which you said it's hard to 
13  see how she could establish cognizable jurisdiction. 
 MR. GARRE:  And there is another part of 
14
15
16  Honor, which goes to the relief that she has requested. 
17  The declaratory and injunctive release -- relief that 
18  this case began with, that request has fallen out, and 
19  that's undisputed.  So the only thing that is live in 
20
21  request is on page 79 of the Joint Appendix, and it's 
22  focused exclusively on a request for the return of 
23  admissions fees.  And the reason why that is not enough 
24  to confer standing is that she would have paid the 
admissions fee no matter what policy the university

19  it is bifurcated in the sense that we could go and prove 
damages, but the complaint makes no doubt that the only 
20
21  request for monetary damages is a request for admissions 
22  fees.  That -- it says that explicitly.  And this Court 
23  has said that relief that does not remedy the injury

 The core of our interest is in ensuring that

demonstrated track record of --

 So my understanding of what the university 
1
2  here is looking to do, and what universities generally 
3  are looking to do in this circumstance, is not to grant 
4  a preference for privilege, but to make individualized 
5

17  race, don't worry about it. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I don't think it's a

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It doesn't function

1  indisputably a meaningful factor that can make a

4  have a clear case; they're using race in a way that

 Now, with respect to the implementation 

although the Petitioner says she's challenging 
implementation, that this plan meets every requirement 
of Grutter and addresses the concern of Justice Kennedy 
that you raised in dissent in Grutter.  Whether Texas 
had to or not, it did address that concern.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  I'm hearing a

1  I agree with my friend that critical mass is not a 
2  number.  I think it would be very ill-advised to suggest 
3  that it is numerical.  So --
4
5
6  because our responsibility is to decide whether this use 
7  of race is narrowly tailored to achieving, under this 
8  University's view, critical mass.

deference to the University's judgment that it hasn't

16  yet achieved the level of diversity that it needs to 
17  accomplish its educational mission. 
18
19  make its own independent judgment.  I think the way the 
Court would go about making that independent judgment is 
20
21  to look at the kind of information that the university 
22  considered.  That could be information about the 
23  composition of the class.  It could be information about 
24  classroom diversity.  It could be information about 
25

retention and graduation rates.  It can be information 

 I think that the Court ought to -- has to

identified as a compelling interest. 

 And I will say, I do think, as the number of

2  history.  Is it a university that has had a history of 
3  racial incidents and trouble or not?  A series of

9  further advance the educational goals that Grutter has

11
12  minority enrollees gets higher, the burden on the 
13  university to do that is going to get harder to meet. 
14  But I don't think -- I don't think there is a number, 
and I don't think it would be prudent for this Court to 
15
16  suggest that there is a number, because it would raise 
17  exactly the kind of problem that I -- that I think 
18  Justice Kennedy identified in the Grutter dissent of 
19  creating hydraulic pressure towards that number.

 I think it is important, Your Honors, not

14  universities have the flexibility to shape their 
environments and their educational experience to make a 
15
16  reality of the principle that Justice Kennedy identified 
17  in Parents Involved, that our strength comes from people 
18  of different races, different creeds, different 
19  cultures, uniting in a commitment to freedom, and to

 MR. REIN:  Well, that's what we're seeking 
8
9  in this case, Mr. Chief Justice, a level playing field 
10
11
12  on.  First, there's been a lot of back and forth on 
13  standing, but, as we have pointed out, that really 
14  relates to merits.  And I just want to make clear that 
we do not accept the premise of that footnote, that she 
15
16  would not have entered under any circumstances; that 
17  they've asserted that, but, in fact, she was considered 
18  for the summer program, which is --
19
20
21  As written, is that what it's limited to? 
22
23  other damages," at the point when we were writing it, 
24  which was --
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is your complaint 

limited to injunctive relief and the return of the $100? 

 MR. REIN:  No, because it said, "any and all 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In Arizonans and Alvarez

Did you ask only for injunctive relief and the $100,

 MR. REIN:  The only specific number in the

never had the opportunity to develop the full damages --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In --
 MR. REIN:  -- because of --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In Arizonans and Alvarez 

1  we said any all -- any and other -- all damages is too 
2  speculative.  Is what you actually see what I said: 
3  Injunctive relief and the return of the $100.

9  we said you can't manufacture standing after the fact.

13  complaint, because of the point in time when it was 
14  filed was the application fee, which we believe --
15
16 
17 
 MR. REIN:  You would have paid the fee in 
18
19  return for a fair processing of the application, which 
she did not receive, and we think that is a claim that 
20
21  will be sustained.  It is not tested at this point. 
 And the second thing is, because of the way 
22
23  the case was bifurcated, with the agreement of all and 
24  the district court as well, we did not develop the 
additional damages here.  We reserved the right to 
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And you would have paid 
that no matter what; under any system of admission you 
would have paid the same $100.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  For what, nominal 

 MR. REIN:  Because as -- as in the BIO, what 

 MR. REIN:  No --

2

4

6  around Arizonans? 
7
8  UT pointed out was there are other kinds of financial 
9  injuries which were not ascertainable at the time the 
complaint was filed because we were trying to put her 
10
11 
into the university. 
12
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  She was going to get a 
13  better job because she went to a different university? 
14
suggested.  There are differences in cost between the --
15
16  what she paid at LSU and what she would have paid at UT. 
17  I'm just saying, these are all reserved questions and 
18  they don't go to standing.  The Court made that clear in 
19  Bakke.
20
21  think I never completed my answer to Justice Breyer. 
22  Where we stand on what you should do about Grutter is as 
23  follows. 
24
25

 We recognize, as in the words of -- that the 

Solicitor General just issued -- that there is an 

 MR. REIN:  That's one of the things they 

 Let me go to another issue that, you know, I 

75
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And as long as you don't cross two lines, 

determinative points and fixed quotas -- "quotas" 

1  interest which is cognizable in diversity.  That is --
2  that was the root question in Grutter, could you 
3  recognize it at all.  But what we are concerned about, 
4  as you are seeing here, is universities like UT and many 
others have read it to be green light, use race, no end 
5
6  point, no discernible target, no critical mass written, 
7  you know, in circumstances reduced to something that can 
8  be reviewed. 
9
10
11  meaning we will fill this quota exclusively with who we 
12  deem to be under-represented -- you are okay.  We don't 
13  think that's the way Grutter was intended.  Grutter was 
14  intended to say this is an area of great caution; using 
race itself raises all kinds of red flags, so before you 
15
16  use race make a determination whether really, your 
17  interest in critical mass -- that is, in the dialogue 
18  and interchange, the educational interest, is that --
19
20
21  university got into only the physical education program; 
22  and in this particular university that -- that physical 
23  education program includes all the star athletes; so 
24  every star athlete in the school happens to be black or 
Hispanic or Asian or something else, but they have now 
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You are not suggesting 

that if every minority student that got into a 

76
 

Alderson Reporting Company

nature of the hypothetical. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, it's just that every 

diversity in its other departments? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In the holistic way that 

 MR. REIN:  Well, if you are saying there's a 

1  reached the critical mass of 10, 15, 20 percent -- that 
2  the university in that situation couldn't use race? 
3
 MR. REIN:  Well, I think you are talking 
4  about --
5
6  Grutter permits? 
7
8  -- a differentiated department of physical education, 
9  which is like a separate college, you have changed the 
10
11
12  one of their students who happens to be a minority is 
13  going to end up in that program.  You don't think the 
14  university could consider that it needs a different 
15
16
 MR. REIN:  Well, if that were the case, 
17  remember the factor that is causing it, and you are 
18  assuming, is choice.  You have a critical mass of 
19  students.  They choose to major in different things, and 
20
21  diversity concept.  They never asked the question why, 
22  if 40 percent of our students are minorities, are they 
23  not in the small classrooms?  Why does that happen? 
24  Statistically you would say that's an aberration.  You 
might ask the question what's causing it?  Because in 
25

that's one of the base problems with the classroom 

77
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. REIN:  No.  Because they don't take into 

is a -- that minority student who is a nuclear 

major -- major in physics.  And when it comes time in 
the UT system to allocate access to different majors, 
they do that in a way that is basically premised on 
academic index. 

1  order to fit --
2
3  same thing when they say, when we are looking at the 
4  holistic measure, we are looking for that student who 
5
6  scientist? 
7
8  account your interests, they don't ask you, are you 
9  going to join ROTC, they don't ask you are you going to 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
 So they have a two-tiered admission system. 
They are only here focused -- their preference goes to 
15
16  admission as such, it doesn't go to sorting people out 
17  by majors. 
 And if I might then say to Justice Breyer, I 
18
19  think our answer is, when we see what UT is doing, what 
we that -- Grutter's -- you know, it has been perceived 
20
21  as a green light; go ahead and use race, race which is 
22  otherwise really a highly questionable, an abominable 
23  kind of sorting out.  That unchecked use of race, which 
24  we think is -- has been spawned by misreading of 
25

Official 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Aren't they saying the 

Grutter, needs to be corralled.  So what we --

78
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

mission.  This is not what is going on at UT. 

 This is not an individualized, I will look 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it any more unchecked 
1
2  than the Harvard plan which -- that started all this off 
3  in 1978, decided by Justice Powell?  Is it any different 
4  from how race is used in our military academies?
 MR. REIN:  Well, I mean, they are two 
5
6  different questions.  The Harvard plan is a very 
7  different world.  It's a plan of wholly individualized 
8  admission comparing individuals one on one, to establish 
9  the platonic ideal of the class as the educational 
10
11
12  at you.  I will score you.  I will score you 
13  individually.  But as they keep saying, at the point of 
14  admission, I am not admitting people; I am admitting 
15
16  question. 
17
18  was entirely fair, because in the way they do their 
19  system, in the PAI scoring, you can figure out that two 
people would have had the same PAI score but for race. 
20
21  It's an add-on.  It allows them to boost the PAS 
22  component of the PAI score.  So -- it is not infrequent. 
23  There are many, many candidates who will score the same 
24  PAI, may even have the same AI, and then you boost some 
25

categories, boxes; and that relates to Justice Alito's 

 I thought your hypothetical, Justice Alito, 

of them. 

79
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

we think will improve, in our view, dialogue.  That is 

 But it's purely race, and it comes to the 
ultimate question then, which, Chief Justice, you were 

 Now, what UT says is, well, we don't boost 
1
2  all the minorities.  And that -- as they've stood here 
3  today, and they said in their briefs, we want to boost 
4  the ones we like.  We want those affluent minorities who 
5
6  contrary indeed to the fact that they give points in the 
7  same system for socioeconomic disadvantage.  It's at 
8  odds with itself. 
9
10
11  asking:  Where is the end point?  If you have nothing to 
12  gauge the success of the program, if you can't even say 
13  at the beginning we don't have critical mass because we 
14  don't know what it is and we refuse to say what it is, 
there is no judicial supervision, there is no strict 
15
16  scrutiny and there is no end point to what they are 
17  doing. 
18
19  back to Justice Breyer, how would you write it, you can 
20
21  requires you to do A, B, C, and -- and we've said in our 
22  brief that would be satisfactory.  But to the extent 
23  that you then have it surviving side by side, there 
24  could be enormous confusion.
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So what you want me to do 

80
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 So what we have said, and it comes right 

clarify it, you can say Grutter properly applies, 

Official 

1  is go read back what we wrote in Grutter, go look what 
2  the underlying determinations of critical mass were 
3  there, go look exactly how it is being done in Texas --
4  which I have charts that help me see that -- and I will 
then find enough of a difference that I can write some 
5
6  words that can be administered by 2,000 or 3,000 -- a 
7  thousand Federal judges as they try to deal with 
8  programs like this, in -- that's the point, is that 
9  right?
 MR. REIN:  Well, I'm saying if you clarify 
10
11  the needs and the necessity point, if you then look at 
12  some of the other deficiencies and clarify the -- the 
13  consideration of reasonably available alternatives as a 
14  necessity, if you then attribute that -- you attribute 
the weaknesses of the Texas program to the absence of 
15
16  those factors, I think you can fashion a result in this 
17  case which may or may not have to, quote, "overrule" 
18  Grutter. 
19
20
21  of this odious classification?  That's what we are 
22  talking about, it's a narrow window; and it should be 
23  stated as a narrow window. 
24
25

 It's really a matter, what do you -- do you 
want to clearly restate what it is that allows the use 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you don't want to 

overrule Grutter, you just want to gut it. 

81

 MR. REIN:  Justice Sotomayor, I don't want 

to gut it.  And the only way one could reach that 

 MR. REIN:  Well --

3  You don't want to overrule it, but you just want to gut 
4  it.
5
6
7  universities that once you reach a certain number, then 
8  you can't use race anymore. 
9
10
11  conclusion is to assume that Grutter is an unlimited 
12  mandate without end point to just use race to your own 
13  satisfaction and to be deferred to in your use of race.
