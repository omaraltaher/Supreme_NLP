 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, and Case

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will continue

14  As Congress found and the Federal Government concedes, 
the community-rating and guaranteed-issue provisions of 
15
16  the Act cannot stand without the individual mandate. 
17  Congress found that the individual mandate was essential 
18  to their operation. 
19

20
21  that Congress intended, they would actually counteract 
22  Congress's basic goal of providing patient protection

mandate to force people into the market, then community

1  rating and guaranteed issue will cause the cost of
 
2  premiums to skyrocket.  We can debate the order of
 
3  magnitude of that, but we can't debate that the
 
4  direction will be upward.  We also can't debate --
5
6  be true.  The economists are going back and forth on 
7  that issue, and the figures vary from up 10 percent to 
8  up 30.  We're not in the habit of doing the legislative 
9  findings.
 What we do know is that for those States 
10
11  that found prices increasing, that they found various 
12  solutions to that.  In one instance -- and we might or 
13  may not say that it's unconstitutional -- Massachusetts 
14  passed the mandatory coverage provision.  But others 
15
16
17  fact the economists prove -- some of the economists 
18  prove right that prices will spiral?  What's wrong with 
19  leaving it to -- in the hands of the people who should 
20
21
 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, a couple of questions --
22  a couple of responses, Justice Sotomayor.  First of all, 
23  I think that it's very relevant here that Congress had 
24  before it as examples some of the States that had tried 
to impose guaranteed issue and community rating, and did

 Why shouldn't we let Congress do that, if in

appendix.  Congress specifically found that having the 
individual mandate is essential to the operation of 
guaranteed issue and community rating. 

1  not impose an individual mandate.  And Congress rejected 
2  that model.  So, your question is quite right in saying 
3  that it's not impossible to have guaranteed issue and 
4  community rating without an individual mandate.  But 
it's a model that Congress looked at and specifically 
5
6  rejected. 
7
 And then, of course, there's Congress's own 
8  finding, and their finding, of course -- this is finding 
9  (i), which is 43a of the Government's brief, in the 
10
11 
12 
13
14  was essential to.  I mean, I'm looking at it.  The 
15
16  gathering facilities that tell insurers what the various 
17  policies actually mean.  And that has proven to be a 
18  cost saver in many of the States who have tried it.  So, 
19  why should we be striking down a cost saver --
MR. CLEMENT:  Well --
20
21
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- when, if what your 
22  argument is -- was that Congress was concerned about 
23  costs rising?

exchanges.  The State exchanges are information-

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's all it said it 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why should we assume 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. CLEMENT:  I think a couple of things. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think on the bottom 

line, is why don't we let Congress fix it? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, let me answer the bottom 

1  they wouldn't have passed an information --
2
3  One, you get -- I mean, I would think you'd sort of have 
4  to take the bitter with the sweet.  And if Congress --
if we're going to look at Congress's goal of providing 
5
6  patient protection but also affordable care, we can't --
7  I don't think it works to just take the things that save 
8  money and cut out the things that are going to make 
9  premiums more expensive.  But at a minimum --
10
11 
12
13  line question, which is, no matter what you do in this 
14  case, at some point there's going to be -- if you strike 
15
16  Congress to do.  The question is really what task do you 
17  want to give Congress?  Do you want to give Congress the 
18  task of fixing the statute after something has been 
19  taken out, especially a provision at the heart, or do 
20
21  care?  And I think it would be better in this 
22  situation --
23
24  we strike down one provision, we're not taking that 
power away from Congress.  Congress could look at it 
25

down the mandate, there's going to be something for 

you want to give Congress the task of fixing health 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We're not taking -- if 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. CLEMENT:  And, of course, that's right, 

ever wanted to do so we are going to strike down the 
rest of the statute immediately and then try to fix the 
problem.  So, whatever you do, Congress is going to have 
options.  The question is --

1  without the mandatory coverage provision and say this 
2  model doesn't work; let's start from the beginning.  Or 
3  it could choose to fix what it has.  We're not declaring 
4  -- one portion doesn't force Congress into any path.
5
6  Justice Sotomayor, and no matter what you do here, 
7  Congress will have the options available.  So, if you --
8  if you strike down only the individual mandate, Congress 
9  could say the next day, well, that's the last thing we 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, that's exactly --
16
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean --
17
 MR. CLEMENT:  -- what I was going to say, 
18
19  Justice Scalia, which is I think the question for this 
20
21  inertia.  And then the question is what's the best 
22  result in light of that reality? 
23
24  that we should take on more power to the Court?
25

Court is -- we all recognize there's legislative 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  There's such a thing as 

legislative inertia, isn't there? 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You are not suggesting 

 MR. CLEMENT:  No, I --

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because Congress would 

 MR. CLEMENT:  And I agree.  We're simply 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, I wanted to ask you 
about that.  Why do we look to the -- are you sure we 

1
2  choose to take one path rather than another.  That's 
3  sort of taking onto the Court more power than one, I 
4  think, would want.
5
6  asking this Court to take on, straight on, the idea of 
7  the basic remedial inquiry into severability which looks 
8  to the intent of the Congress --
9
10
11  look to the intent of the Congress?  I thought that, you 
12  know, sometimes Congress says that these provisions will 
13  -- all the provisions of this Act will be severable, and 
14  we ignore that when the Act really won't work, when the 
remaining provisions just won't work.  Now, how can you 
15
16  square that reality with the proposition that what we're 
17  looking for here is what would this Congress have 
18  wanted? 
19
Justice Scalia:  We can look at this Court's cases on 
20
21  severability, and they all formulate the test a little 
22  bit differently. 
23
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, they sure do. 
 MR. CLEMENT:  But every one of them talks 
about congressional intent.  But here's the -- there's 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, two responses, 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's true, but is it 

 MR. CLEMENT:  It is right.  And here's how I 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.  The consequence 

1  the other answer --
2
3  right? 
4
would answer your question, which is, when Congress 
5
6  includes a severability clause, it's addressing the 
7  issue in the abstract.  It doesn't say, no matter which 
8  provisions you strike down, we absolutely, positively 
9  want what's left.
10
11  of your proposition, would Congress have enacted it 
12  without this provision, okay, that's the consequence. 
13  That would mean that if we struck down nothing in this 
14  legislation but the -- what is it called -- the "Corn 
15
16  constitutional proscription of venality, okay? 
17
18
19  it's clear that Congress would not have passed it 
20
21  last necessary vote in the Senate.  And you're telling 
22  us that the whole statute would fall because the 
23  Cornhusker kickback is bad.  That can't be right. 
24
25

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Scalia, I think 
it can be, which is to say that the basic proposition, 

 (Laughter.) 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  When we strike that down, 

Husker kickback," okay, we find that to violate the 

without that.  It was -- it was the means of getting the 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

saying that the guarantee-issue and the community-rating 
provisions are tied to the mandate.  And you -- you 
pointed to where that was in the findings. 

1  that it's congressional intent that governs.  Now, 
2  everybody on this Court has a slightly different way of 
3  divining legislative intent.  And I would suggest the 
4  one common ground among every member of this Court, as I 
5
6  can agree with that. 
7
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, Mr. Clement, let's start 
8  with the text.  And you suggest, and I think that there 
9  is -- this is right, that there is a textual basis for 
10
11 
12 
13
14  Because I've been unable to find one.  It seems to me 
15
16  between guarantee issue, community ratings, on the one 
17  hand; everything else, on the other. 
 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kagan, I'd be 
18
19  delighted to take you through my view of the text and 
20
21
22  Finding (J), which is on the same page, 43a.  And as I 
23  read that, that's a finding that the individual mandate 
24  is essential to the operation of the exchanges.
25

that if you look at the text, the sharp dividing line is 

why there are other things that have to fall. 

 The first place I'd ask you to look is 

 Is there a textual basis for anything else? 

Official 

understand it, is you start with the text.  Everybody 

 But there are other links between guaranteed 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

And the question is always, does Congress want half a 
loaf?  Is half a loaf better than no loaf?  And on 
something like the exchanges, it seems to me a perfect 
example where half a loaf is better than no loaf.  The 
exchanges will do something.  They won't do everything 
that Congress envisioned. 

1  issue and community rating and the exchanges.  And 
2  there, I think, it's just the way that the exchanges are 
3  supposed to work, and the text makes this clear, is 
4  they're supposed to provide a market where people can 
compare community-rated insurance.  That's what makes 
5
6  the exchanges function. 
7
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Although the exchanges 
8  function perfectly well in Utah, where there is no 
9  mandate.  They function differently, but they function. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  there are situations where half a loaf is actually 
18  worse, and I want to address that.  But before I -- more 
19  broadly -- but before I do that, if I can stick with 
20
21
 I do think the question that this Court is 
22  supposed to ask is not just whether they can limp along 
23  and they can operate independently, but whether they 
24  operate in the manner that Congress intended.  And 
25

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kagan, I think 

just the exchanges. 

that's where I think the exchanges really fall down, 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

provisions. 

1  because the vision of the exchanges was that if you got 
2  out of this current situation where health insurance is 
3  basically individualized priced based on individualized 
4  underwriting and you provide community rating, then it's 
going to be very easy for people to see, okay, well, 
5
6  this is a silver policy, and this is a bronze policy, 
7  and this is a gold policy.  And we can -- you know, I 
8  can just pick which insurer provides what I think is 
9  going to be the best service based on those comparable 
10
11
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Clement, you just said 
12  something which you say a lot in your brief.  You say 
13  the question is the manner in which it would have 
14  operated.  And I think that that's not consistent with 
our cases.  And I guess the best example would be 
15
16  Booker, where we decided not to sever provisions, 
17  notwithstanding that the sentencing guidelines clearly 
18  operate in a different manner now than they did when 
19  Congress passed them.  They operate as advisory rather 
20
21
22  actually think Booker supports our point as well, 
23  because there are two aspects of the remedial holding of 
24  Booker.  And the first part of it, which I think 
25

actually very much supports our point is where the 

than mandatory. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  But, Justice Kagan, I mean, I 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 But, nonetheless, this Court said, boy, if 

you do that, then all of the sentencing is basically 

operate. 

1  majority rejects the approach of the dissent, which 
2  actually would have required nothing in the statute to 
3  have been struck, not a single word. 
4
5
6  going to be done by a combination of the juries and the 
7  prosecutors, and the judges are going to be cut out. 
8  And the Court said the one thing we know is that's not 
9  the manner in which Congress thought that this should 
10
11
 Now, later they make a different judgment 
12  about the -- which particular provisions to cut out. 
13  But I do think Booker is consistent with this way of 
14  looking at it.  It's certainly consistent with Brock, 
the opinion that we rely on, because there the Court 
15
16  only reached that part of the opinion after they had 
17  already found that the must-hire provision operated 
18  functionally independent from the legislative veto. 
19  So --
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Clement, there are so 
many things in this Act that are unquestionably okay.  I 
think you would concede that reauthorizing -- what is it 
-- the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, changes to 
the Black Lung benefits.  Why make Congress redo those? 
I mean, it's a question of whether we say everything you 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

whether it wants them in or out. 

1  did is no good, now start from scratch, or to say, yes, 
2  there are many things in here that have nothing to do, 
3  frankly, with the affordable health care, and there are 
4  some that we think it's better to let Congress to decide 
5
6
 So, why should we say it's a choice between 
7  a wrecking operation, which is what you are requesting, 
8  or a salvage job?  And the more conservative approach 
9  would be salvage rather than throwing out everything.
 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, two 
10
11  kinds of responses to that:  One, I do think there are 
12  some provisions that I would identify as being at the 
13  periphery of this statute, and I'll admit that the case 
14  for severing those is perhaps the strongest.
15
16  because if we were in here arguing that some provision 
17  on the periphery of the statute, like the Biosimilars 
18  Act or some of the provisions that you've mentioned, was 
19  unconstitutional, I think you'd strike it down and you 
20
21
22  provisions that have constitutional difficulties or are 
23  tied at the hip to those provisions that have the 
24  constitutional difficulty are the very heart of this 
Act.  And then if you look at how they are textually 
25

 But I do think it's fundamentally different, 

wouldn't even think hard about severability. 

 What makes this different is that the 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

heart of the Act. 

Medicaid, if you follow that through what you end up 

1  interconnected with the exchanges, which are then 
2  connected to the tax credits, which are also connected 
3  to the employer mandates, which is also connected to 
4  some of the revenue offsets, which is also connected to 
5
6  with at the end of that process is just sort of a hollow 
7  shell.  And at that point, I think there is a strong 
8  argument for not -- I mean, we can't possibly think that 
9  Congress would have passed that hollow shell without the 
10
11
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it would 
12  have -- it would have passed parts of the hollow shell. 
13  I mean, a lot of this is reauthorization of 
14  appropriations that have been reauthorized for the 
15
16  for Congress to throw it in, in the middle of the 
17  2700 pages than to do it separately.  I mean, can you 
18  really suggest -- I mean, they cite the Black Lung 
19  Benefits Act, and those have nothing to do with any of 
20
21
22  know, they tried to make them germane.  But I'm not here 
23  to tell you that, you know -- some of their -- surely, 
24  there are provisions that are just looking for the next 
legislative vehicle that's going to make it across the 
25

previous 5 or 10 years, and it was just more convenient 

the things we're talking about. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, you 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

go, if you follow me that far, then the question is 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but it's not --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I'm still not sure, 

1  finish line, and somebody's going to attach it to 
2  anything that's moving.  I mean, I'll admit that. 
 But the question is -- when everything else 
3
4  from the center of the Act is interconnected and has to 
5
6  would you keep this hollowed-out shell? 
7
8
9  what is the test -- and this was a colloquy you had with 
Justice Scalia with the Cornhusker hypothetical.  I need 
10
11 
to know what standard you're asking me to apply.  Is it 
whether as a rational matter the separate parts could 
12 
13 
still function, or does it focus on the intent of the 
Congress?
14 
 If you -- suppose you had party A wants 
15
16  proposal number 1; party B wants proposal number 2. 
17  Completely unrelated.  One is airline rates; the other 
18  is milk regulation.  And we -- and they decide them 
19  together.  The procedural rules are these have to be 
voted on as one.  They are both passed.  Then one is 
20
21  declared unconstitutional.  The other can operate 
22  completely independently.  Now, we know that Congress 
23  would not have intended to pass one without the other. 
24  Is that the end of it, or is there some different test? 
25

Because we don't want to go into legislative history, 

17
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Sure.  Justice Kennedy, the 

1  that's intrusive, so we ask whether or not an objective 
2  -- as an objective rational matter, one could function 
3  without -- I still don't know what the test is that 
4  we're supposed to apply.  And this is the same question 
as Justice Scalia asked.  Could you give me some help on 
5
6  that? 
7
8  reality is I think this Court's opinions have at various 
9  times applied both strains of the analysis.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And which one -- and what 
10
11  test do you suggest that we follow if we want to clarify 
12  our jurisprudence? 
13
14  objective tests, Justice Kennedy.  I'd be perfectly 
15
16  approach.  I think there are certain Justices that are 
17  more inclined to take more of a peek at legislative 
18  history, and I think if you look at the legislative 
19  history of this, it would only fortify the conclusion 
that you would reach from a very objective textual 
20
21  inquiry.  But I am happy to focus the Court on the 
22  objective textual inquiry --
23
24  understand --
25

happy with you to apply a more textually based objective 

 MR. CLEMENT:  I'm -- I'm a big believer in 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that objective test is

 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Sotomayor, every one 

of your cases, if you have a formulation for 

 MR. CLEMENT:  It is whether the statute can 

1  what? 
2
3  operate in the manner that Congress -- that Congress 
4  intended.  And --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No statute can do that, 
5
6  because once we chop off a piece of it, by definition, 
7  it's not the statute Congress passed.  So, it has to be 
8  something more than that. 
9
10
11  severability, if you interpret it woodenly, it becomes 
12  tautological.  And Justice Blackmun addressed this in 
13  footnote 7 of the Brock opinion that we rely on, where 
14  he says:  Of course, it's not just -- you know, it 
doesn't operate exactly in the manner because it doesn't 
15
16  have all the pieces, but you still make an inquiry as to 
17  whether -- I mean, when Congress links two provisions 
18  together and one really won't work without the other --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, what is wrong with 
19
the presumption that our law says, which is we presume 
20
21  that Congress would want to sever?  Wouldn't that be the 
22  simplest, most objective test?  Going past what 
23  Justice Scalia says we have done, okay, get rid of 
24  legislative intent altogether, which some of our 
25

colleagues in other contexts have promoted, and just

2  severable, we shouldn't sever.  We should let them fix 
3  their problems. 
4
 You still haven't asked -- answered me why 
in a democracy structured like ours, where each branch 
5
6  does different things, why we should involve the Court 
7  in making the legislative judgment? 
 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Sotomayor, let me try 
8
9  to answer the specific question and then answer the big 
picture question.  The specific question is -- I mean, 
10
11 
you could do that.  You could adopt a new rule now that 
12 
basically says, look, we've sever --
13
14  presume.  We've rebutted the presumption in some 
15
16
17
18  that judicial action. 
19
20
21  get to, you'd have to ratchet up that presumption a 
22  couple of ticks on the scale, but -- and because the one 
23  thing --

25

 MR. CLEMENT:  Right.  But --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- but some would call

that we refused to sever for this reason. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, one thing that's wrong 
1
2  with that, which is still at a smaller level, is that's 
3  inconsistent with virtually every statement in every one 
4  of your severability opinions, which all talk about

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it's not inconsistent 
7  with our practice, right, Mr. Clement?  I mean, you have 
8  to go back decades and decades and decades, and I'm not 
9  sure even then you could find a piece of legislation 
10
11
 MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think that's right, 
12  Justice Kagan.  I mean, I think there are more recent 
13  examples.  A great example I think, which sort of proves 
14  and maybe is a segue to get to my broader point, is a 
15
16  statute, but I don't think anything turns on that, is 
17  Randall v. Sorrell, where this Court struck down various 
18  provisions of the Vermont campaign finance law.  But 
19  there were other contribution provisions that were not 
20
21  the contribution limits.  But this Court at the end of 
22  the opinion said, you know, there's no way to think that 
23  the Vermont legislator would have wanted these handful 
24  of provisions there on the contribution side.  So, we'll

touched by the theory that the Court used to strike down 

case that involves a State statute, not a Federal 

Official 

congressional intent. 

strike down the whole thing. 

21
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And if I could make the broader point, I 

And a great example, if I dare say so, is Buckley.  In 

 This Court struck down the ban on 

1
2  mean, I think the reason it makes sense in a democracy 
3  with separation of powers to in some cases sever the 
4  whole thing is because sometimes a half a loaf is worse. 
5
6  Buckley this Court looked at a statute that tried to, in 
7  a coherent way, strike down limits on contributions and 
8  closely related expenditures. 
9
expenditures, left the contribution ban in place, and 
10
11  for four decades Congress has tried to fix what's left 
12  of the statute, largely unsuccessfully; whereas it would 
13  have I think worked much better from a democratic and 
14  separation of powers standpoint if the Court would have 
15
16  expenditures under the Constitution.  The contribution 
17  provision is joined at the hip.  Give Congress a chance 
18  to actually fix the problem, not just --

which is a practical question?  I take as a given your 
answer to Justice Kennedy.  You're saying let's look at 
it objectively and say would Congress have intended 
this, okay?  This is the mandate in the community --
this is Titles I and II, the mandate, the community,

 What do you suggest we do?  I mean, should 

we appoint a special master with an instruction?  Should

2  you know, and when I look through the rest of it, I have 
3  all kinds of stuff in there.  And I haven't read every 
4  word of that, I promise.  All right. 
5
6  there's breast feeding, there's promoting nurses and 
7  doctors to serve underserved areas, there's the CLASS 
8  Act, et cetera. 
9
10
11  we go back to the district court?  You haven't argued 
12  most of these.  As I hear you now, you're pretty close 
13  to the SG.  I mean, you'd like it all struck down, but 
14  if we are supposed to apply the objective test, I don't

 So, that's -- you know what you have there? 

1  areas, the biosimilar thing and drug regulation, the 
2  CLASS Act -- those have nothing to do with the stuff 
3  that we've been talking about yesterday and the day 
4  before, okay?
 So, if you tell me at that level, I'd say, 
5
6  sure, they have nothing to do with it; they could stand 
7  on their own.  The Indian thing, about helping the 
8  underserved Native Americans -- all that stuff has 
9  nothing to do with it.  Black lung disease, nothing to 
10

13  asking you what should I do? 
14
15
16  the mandatory, individual mandate is tied, as the 
17  Government suggests, to guaranteed issue and community 
18  rating, but the individual mandate, guaranteed issue, 
19  and community rating together are the heart of this Act. 
20
21
22  tax credits, because the amount of the tax credit is key 
23  to the amount of the policy price on the exchange.  The 
24  exchanges are also key to the employer mandate, because 
the employer mandate becomes imposed on an employer if 
25

say the following, which is follow me this far, which is 

They -- they're what make the exchanges work. 

 The exchanges in turn are critical to the

4  hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of the 
needy.  This isn't in Title I.  It's in the other part 
5
6  that you had in your other hand.  But it doesn't work 
7  without the mandate, community rating, and guaranteed 
8  issue.

12
13  fallback position be if we don't accept the proposition 
14  that if the mandate is declared unconstitutional, the 
rest of the Act, every single provision, has to fall? 
15
16  Other proposed -- other dispositions have been proposed. 
17  There's the Solicitor General's disposition, the 
18  recommended disposition to strike down the 
19  guaranteed-issue and community-rating provisions.  One 
of the -- one amicus says strike down all of Title I;

7  passed quickly --

11  passage -- I mean, this was a piece of legislation 
12  which, there was -- had to be a concerted effort to 
13  gather enough votes so that it could be passed.  And I 
14  suspect with a lot of these miscellaneous provisions 
that Justice Breyer was talking about, that was the 
15
16  price of a vote:  Put in the Indian health care 
17  provision and I will vote for the other 2700 pages.  Put 
18  in the black lung provision, and I'll go along with it. 
 That's why all -- many of these provisions,

16  taxpayer, but the taxpayer doesn't have standing.  That 
17  -- that just continues.  Even though it is -- it should 
18  -- it is so closely allied to what's been struck down 
19  that it ought to go as well.  But, nonetheless, that has 
to continue because there's nobody in the world that can

21  challenge it. 
22
23
24  point, Justice Scalia.  This Court has repeatedly said 
25

 Can that possibly be the law?

that just because there's -- no one may have standing to 

Federal money, it doesn't hurt anybody except the

1  challenge -- and particularly like tax credits or taxes 
2  which are challenged only after going through the 
3  Anti-Injunction Act, just because no one has standing 
4  doesn't mean someone must.
 But beyond that --
5
6
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But those are provisions
 
7  that have been legitimately enacted.  The whole issue
 
8  here is whether these related provisions have been
 
9  legitimately enacted or whether they are so closely
 
allied to one that has been held to be unconstitutional 
10
that they also have not been legitimately enacted.

12
 You can't compare that to -- to cases 
13  dealing with a statute that nobody denies is -- is 
14  constitutional.

16  parallel to the Printz case, in our view.  In that case, 
17  the Court struck down several provisions of the Brady

staying in place.  And what we're really talking about, 
as Justice Sotomayor started this discussion, is who is 
the proper party to take out what isn't infected by the

may be no standing, one institution clearly does have 
standing, and that's Congress.

MR. KNEEDLER:  No, we believe that in that 
case, the tax -- the tax provision should not be struck 
down.  In the first place, the Anti-Injunction Act would 
bar a direct suit to challenge it.  And it would be very 
strange to allow a tax to be struck down on the basis of 
a severability analysis.  Severability arises in a case 
only where it's necessary to consider what relief a 
party before the Court should get.  The only party --

18  By reason of this Court, we would have a new regime that 
19  Congress did not provide for, did not consider.  That, 
it seems to me, can be argued at least to be a more 
20
21  extreme exercise of judicial power than to strike --

7  question that several Justices have asked, we think that 
8  severability is a matter of statutory interpretation. 
9  It should be resolved by looking at the structure and 
10
11  legislative history to figure out what the text and 
12  structure mean with respect to severability.  We

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought the simple 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, that is -- that is 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- what we have to look 

interpretation.  The Court's task, we submit, is not to 
look at the legislative process to see whether the bill 
would have been -- would have passed or not based on the 
political situation at the time, which would basically 
convert the Court into a function such as a whip count. 
That is not the Court's function. 

1
2  answer was you don't have to because --
3

17  interpretation.  That means you have to go through every 
18  line of the statute.  I haven't heard your answer to 
19  Justice Scalia's question yet.
 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I think in this case 
20
21  there is an easy answer, and that is -- Justice Kagan 
22  pointed out that that the Act itself creates a sharp 
23  dividing line between the minimum coverage provision --

 Now, if the 350 billion -- maybe you'll 

of roughly $700 billion on the insurance industry and 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  May I ask you about the 

1
2
3  argument that's made in the economists' amicus brief? 
4  They say that the insurance reforms impose 10-year costs 
5
6  that these costs are supposed to be offset by about 350 
7  billion in new revenue from the individual mandate and 
8  350 billion from the Medicaid expansion. 
9
disagree with the numbers, that they're fundamentally 
10
11  wrong.  But assuming that they're in the ballpark, if 
12  the 350 million from the individual mandate were to be 
13  lost, what would happen to the insurance industry, which 
14  would now be in the -- in the hole for $350 billion over 
15
16
17  all, for the Court to go beyond text and legislative 
18  history to try to figure out how the finances of a bill 
19  operated, it's like being the budget committee.  But --
20
21  wrong.  If there's Medicaid expansion, the insurance --
22  and the insurance companies are involved in that, 
23  they're going to be reimbursed for the --

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But what if there 

isn't Medicaid expansion?  We've talked about the 

10 years? 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  I don't -- I mean, first of 

but we think the economists had added up the figures 

42
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, it -- the 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  We don't -- we don't think 

that that would have any effect.  And that could be 

Government's position is that if Medicaid expansion is 

1  individual mandate, but does the Government have a 
2  position on what should happen if the Medicaid expansion 
3  is struck down? 
4

6  addressed in the next argument.  But we don't think that 
7  would have any effect on the -- on the rest of the -- on 
8  the rest of the Act. 
9

11  struck down, the rest of the Act can operate --
12
 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes. 
13
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- without it. 
14
 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  It's -- in the past, 
Congress has expanded Medicaid coverage without there 
15
16  being -- it's done it many times without there being a 
17  minimum coverage provision. 
18
19  understand where you are with the answer to 
20
21
22  probability that the 350 billion plus 350 billion equals 
23  7 is going to be cut in half if the individual mandate 
24  is stricken.  Assume there is a significant possibility

of that.  Is it within the proper exercise of this

3  that kind of risk?

ever -- most of our severability cases, you know, 

1  can you give us a prior case in -- that resembles this 
2  one in which we are asked to strike down what the other 
3  side says is the heart of the Act, and yet leave in --
4  as you request, leave in effect the rest of it?  Have we 
5
6  involve one little aspect of the Act, and the question 
7  is whether the rest.  When have we ever really struck 
8  down what was the main purpose of the Act and left the 
9  rest in effect?  Do you have a case for that?
 MR. KNEEDLER:  I think Booker is the best 
10
11  example of that.  In Booker, the mandatory sentencing 
12  provisions were central to the Act, but the -- but the 
13  Court said Congress would have preferred a statute 
14  without the mandatory provision in the Act, and the 
15
16  guidelines remained. 
17
18  reason the majority said that was that they didn't think 
19  that what was essential to the Act was what had been 
stricken down, and that is the -- the ability of the 
20
21  judge to say on his own what -- what the punishment 
22  would be.  I don't think that's a case where we 
23  struck -- where we excised the heart of the statute.

13
 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I would like to go to 
14  "the heart of the Act" point in a moment.  But what I 
would like to say is this is a huge act with many 
15
16  provisions that are completely unrelated to market 
17  reforms and operate in different ways.  And we think it 
18  would be extraordinary in this extraordinary act to 
19  strike all of that down because there are many 
provisions and it would be too hard to do it. 
20
21
22  uncommon that Congress passes an act, and then there are 
23  many different titles, and some of the titles have 
24  nothing to do with the other titles.  That's a common 
25

thing.  And you're saying you've never found an instance 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I think it's not

 My question is -- because I hear Mr. Clement 

1  where they're all struck out when they have nothing to 
2  do with each other. 
3
4  saying something not too different from what you say. 
He talks about things at the periphery.  We can't reject 
5
6  or accept an argument on severability because it's a lot 
7  of work for us.  That's beside the point.  But do you 
8  think that it's possible for you and Mr. Clement -- I'm 
9  exploring this -- to get together and agree on --
(Laughter) 
10
11
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- I mean, on a list of 
12  things that are, in both your opinions, peripheral? 
13  Then you would focus on those areas where one of you 
14  thinks it's peripheral and one of you thinks it's not 
peripheral.  And at that point, it might turn out to be 
15
16  far fewer than we're currently imagining, at which point 
17  we could hold an argument or figure out some way or 
18  somebody would hold an argument and try to -- try to get 
19  those done.
20
21
22  that's realistic.  The Court would be doing it without

12  two analogies that --

14  like to discuss it again in terms of the text and 
15
16  indications from the structure of this Act that the 
17  whole thing is not supposed to fall. 
18
19  Congress would have intended the whole Act to fall if 
20
21  refuted by the fact that there are many, many provisions 
22  of this Act already in effect without a minimum coverage 
23  provision.  Two point -- 2 and a half million people 
24  under 26 have gotten insurance by one of the insurance 
25

structure of the Act.  We have very important 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  And -- and I would

3  companies, if not the States, unless this minimum 
4  coverage provision comes into effect.

Medicare reimbursement rates -- Medicare has covered 32 
million insurance -- preventive care visits by patients

constitutional.  And if -- that certainly doesn't stop

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  us from reaching our own determination on that. 
2
 MR. KNEEDLER:  No, but what I'm saying is 
3  it's a question of legislative intent, and we have a 
4  very fundamental indication of legislative intent that 
it -- that Congress did not mean the whole Act to fall 
5
6  if -- without the minimum coverage provision, because we 
7  have many provisions that are operating now without 
8  that. 
 But there's a further indication about why 
9
the line should be drawn where I've suggested, which is 
10
11  the package of these particular provisions.  All of the 
12  other provisions of the Act would continue to advance 
13  Congress's goal, as the test that was articulated in 
14  Booker, but it's been said in Regan and other cases. 
15
16  advance the purposes of the Act. 
17
 Here they unquestionably can.  The public 
18  health -- the broad public health purposes of the Act 
19  that are unrelated to the minimum coverage provision but 
also the other provisions designed to enhance affordable 
20
21  -- access to affordable care:  The employer 
22  responsibility provision, the credit for small 
23  businesses, which is already in effect, by the way, and 
24  affecting many small businesses.  That --

You look to whether the other provisions can continue to

 MR. KNEEDLER:  The question for the Court 

1  not -- many of the people in Congress might not have 
2  voted for those provisions if the central part of this 
3  statute was not adopted. 
4
 MR. KNEEDLER:  But that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, you know, you're --
5
6  to say that we're effectuating the intent of Congress is 
7  just unrealistic.  Once you've cut the guts out of it, 
8  who knows, who knows which of them were really desired 
9  by Congress on their own and which ones weren't?
10
11  is, Congress having passed the law by whatever majority 
12  there might be in one house or the other, Congress 
13  having passed the law, what at that point is -- is the 
14  legislative intent embodied in the law Congress has 
15
16
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's right. 
17  But the problem is, straight from the title, we have two 
18  complementary purposes, patient protection and 
19  affordable care.  And you can't look at something and 
20
21  consistent with Congress's intent.  Because Congress had 
22  a balanced intent.  You can't look at another provision 
23  and say this promotes patient protection without asking 
24  if it's affordable.

Congress's goal.  And most of all, Medicaid, which is --
which is unrelated to -- to the private insurance market

1  to promote Congress's purpose, that's just an inquiry 
2  that you can't carry out.

4  disagree, because I think it's evident that Congress's 
5
6  it in discrete ways.  It did it by the penalty on 
7  employers that don't -- that don't offer suitable care. 
8  It did it by offering tax credits to small employers. 
9  It did it by offering tax credits to purchasers.  All of 
10
11 
12

14
governing employers and whatnot, Congress built on its 
15
16  prior experience of using the tax code, which it has --

18  provision of health care --

market, which is where the minimum coverage provision is

7  background of the Act, the experience in the States, the

11  was addressing.  There was a -- there was -- a shifting 
12  of present actuarial risks in that market that Congress 
13  wanted to correct.  And if you took the minimum coverage 
14  provision out and left the other two provisions in, 
there would be laid on top of the existing shifting of 
15
16  present actuarial risks an additional one because the 
17  uninsured would know that they would have guaranteed 
18  access to insurance whenever they became sick.  It would 
19  make the -- it would make the adverse selection in that

 All of the other provisions would actually 

long subsidized insurance through employers, has used 
that to impose a tax penalty on -- on employers, to give 
tax credits.  This is traditional stuff that Congress 
has done. 

1  coverage, that won't work.  That was Congress's 
2  assumption, again, shown by the text and legislative 
3  history of this provision.  And that's why we think 
4  those things rise or fall in a package, because they cut 
5
6
7  increase access to affordable care and would have 
8  advantageous effects on price.  Again, Congress was 
9  invoking its traditional use of the tax code, which has

13 
14
15
16  guaranteed issue and community rating.  Effectively, 
17  within the large employer plans, they can't discriminate 
18  among people.  They can't charge different rates.  What 
19  Congress was doing, was doing that in the other market. 
If it can't, that's all that should be struck from the

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III,

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 AS THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE 

 MR. FARR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 At the outset, I would just like to say I 
think that the Government's position in this case that 

1
2
3  please the Court: 
4
5
6  the community-rating and guaranteed-issue provisions 
7  ought to be struck down is an example of the best 
8  driving out the good, because, even without the minimum 
9  coverage provision, those two provisions, guaranteed 
issue and community rating, will still open insurance 
10
11  markets to millions of people that were excluded under 
12  the prior system and for millions of people will lower 
13  prices, which were raised high under the old system 
14  because of their poor health.
 So, even though the system is not going to 
15
16  work precisely as Congress wanted, it would certainly 
17  serve central goals that Congress had of expanding 
18  coverage for people who were unable to get coverage or 
19  unable to get it at affordable prices.
 So, when the government --
20
21
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  One of the points that 
22  Mr. Kneedler made is that the price won't be affordable 
23  because the -- he spoke of the adverse selection 
24  problem, that there would be so fewer people in there, 
the insurance companies are going to have to raise the 
25

57
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 First of all, when we talk about premiums 

 So, it's nice that Congress made it possible 

something that applies accurately to everybody. 
 For people who were not able to get 

1  premiums. 
2
3  for more people to be covered, but the reality is they 
4  won't because they won't be able to afford the premium.
 MR. FARR:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me 
5
6  say two things about that. 
7
8  becoming less affordable, it's very important to keep in 
9  mind different groups of people, because it is not 
10
11
12  insurance before, obviously, their insurance beforehand 
13  was -- the price was essentially infinite.  They were 
14  not able to get it at any price.  They will now be able 
15
16
 For people who are unhealthy and were able 
17  to get insurance, but perhaps not for the things that 
18  they were most concerned about, or only at very high 
19  rates, their rates will be lower under the system, even 
20
21
22  under the Act --
23
24  say -- I didn't follow that.  Why?
 MR. FARR:  Because --
25

to get it at a price that they can afford. 

without the minimum coverage provision. 

 Also, you have a large number of people who, 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  Why do you 

58
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why would their rates be 

 MR. FARR:  Their rates are going to be lower 

going into a pool of people, rather than -- some of whom 

1
2  lower? 
3
4  than they were under the prior system because they are 
5
6  are healthy, rather than having their rates set 
7  according to their individual health characteristics. 
8  That's why their rates were so high. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the problem, Mr. Farr, 
9
isn't it, that they're going to a pool of people that 
10
11  will gradually get older and unhealthier.  That's the 
12  way the thing works.  Once you say that the insurance 
13  companies have to cover all of the sick people and all 
14  of the old people, the -- the rates climb.  More and 
more young people and healthy people say why should we 
15
16  participate; we can just get it later when we get sick. 
17  So, they leave the market.  The rates go up further. 
18  More people leave the market.  And the whole system 
19  crashes and burns, becomes unsustainable.
20
21
22
23
24  do I know?  It's just what -- what's reflected in 
Congress's findings, that it's -- it looks at some

6
 MR. FARR:  Well, in a moment, I'd like to
 
7  talk about the finding, but if I could just postpone
 
8  that for a second and talk about adverse selection
 
9  itself.

10
11  Justice Kagan, is that Congress, having seen the 
12  experience of the States in the '90s with community 
13  rating and guaranteed issue, simply imposed the minimum 
14  coverage provision as a possible way of dealing with 
15
16  provision, then, essentially, adverse selection runs 
17  rampant.  But that's not what happened. 
18
19  other provisions to deal with adverse selection caused 
20
21
22  authorizes annual enrollment periods so people can't 
23  just show up at the hospital.  If they don't show up and 
24  sign up at the right time, they at least have to wait to 
the -- to the time next year.  That's authorized by the 
25

that, and if you don't have the minimum coverage 

 Congress included at least half a dozen 

 There are -- to begin with, the Act

 There -- with respect to the subsidies,
 

generous.  For people below 200 percent of the Federal 

 The structure of the subsidies, because 

1  Act.
 
2
3  there are three different things that make this
 
4  important.  First of all, the subsidies are very
 
5
6  poverty line, the subsidy will cover 80 percent, on 
7  average, of the premium, which makes it attractive to 
8  them to join. 
9
their income -- they create a floor for -- based on the 
10
11  income of the person getting the insurance, and then the 
12  government covers everything over that.  And this is 
13  important in adverse selection because if you do have a 
14  change in the mix of people and average premiums start 
to rise, the government picks up the increase in the 
15
16  premium.  The amount that the person who is getting 
17  insured contributes remains constant at a percentage of 
18  his or her income. 
19
20
21 
22 
23
24
25

Federal support that is unsustainable, right?  That is 
infinite. 

 And the third thing --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There is nothing about 

 (Laughter.) 
 MR. FARR:  Well, I mean, that's a fair 

point, Justice Scalia, although one of the things that 

61
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 But I'd just like to go back for one more 

1  happens, if you take the mandate out, while it is true 
2  that the subsidies that the government provides to any 
3  individual will increase, and they will be less 
4  efficient -- I'm not disputing that point -- actually, 
the overall amount of the subsidies that the government 
5
6  will provide will decline, as the Government notes 
7  itself in its brief, because there will be fewer people 
8  getting them.  Some people will opt out of the system 
9  even though they're getting subsidies.
10
11  second to the point about how the subsidies are part of 
12  what Congress was using, because the other thing is that 
13  for people below 250 percent of the Federal poverty 
14  line, Congress also picks up and subsidizes the 
15
16
 So, you have all of that, and then you have 
17  Congress also, unlike the States, establishing -- or I 
18  should be precisely accurate -- unlike almost all the 
19  States, establishing an age differential of up to three 
to one.  So, an insurance company, for example, that is 
20
21  selling a 25-year-old a policy for $4,000 can charge a 
22  60-year-old $12,000 for exactly the same coverage. 
23
24  were instituting these programs, they either had pure 
community rating, where everybody is charged the same 
25

out-of-pocket costs, raising the actuarial value. 

 The States typically in the '90s, when they 

62
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Congress did a lot of different things to 

try to combat the adverse selection. 

 So, when Congress is enacting this Act, it's 

 Now, if I could turn to the finding, because 

1  premium -- everybody regardless of their age is charged 
2  the same premium.  Some States had a variance of 1.5 
3  to 1.  Massachusetts, for example, which did have good 
4  subsidies, but their age band was two to one.
5
6  not simply looking at the States and thinking:  Well, 
7  that didn't go very well.  Why don't we put in a minimum 
8  coverage provision?  That will solve the problem. 
9
10
11
12  I think this is the crux of the Government's position, 
13  and then the plaintiffs pick up on that and then move --
14  move from that to the rest of the Act.  And it seems to 
me, quite honestly, it's an important part because that 
15
16  is textual.  You know, in this whole sort of quest for 
17  what we're trying to figure out, the finding seems to 
18  stand out as something that the Court can rely on and 
19  say here's something Congress has actually told us.
 But I think the real problem with the 
20
21  finding is the -- the context in which Congress made it. 
22  It's quite clear.  If the Court wants to look, the 
23  finding is on page 42 -- 43a, excuse me, of the 
24  Solicitor General's severability brief, in the appendix.
 But the finding is made specifically in the

to the Court the basis on which it believed it had the 

says this requirement "is essential to creating 
effective health insurance markets" in which guaranteed 
issue and pre-existing illnesses can be covered. 

1  context of interstate commerce.  That is why the 
2  findings are in the Act at all.  Congress wanted to 
3  indicate to the Court, knowing that the minimum coverage 
4  provision was going to be challenged, wanted to indicate 
5
6  power under the Commerce Clause to enact this law. 
7
 Why does that make a difference with respect 
8  to Finding (I), which is the one that the Government is 
9  relying on, and in particular the last sentence, which 
10
11 
12 
13
14  "essential" in the Commerce Clause context doesn't have 
the colloquial meaning.  In the Commerce Clause context, 
15
16  "essential" effectively means useful.  So that when one 
17  says -- in Lopez, when the Court says section 922(q) is 
18  not an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme of 
19  economic activity, it goes on to say:  In which the 
20
21  this provision. 
 Well, if that's all Congress means, I agree 
22
23  with that.  The system will be undercut somewhat if you 
24  don't have the minimum coverage provision.  It's like 
25

 And the reason is because the word 

regulatory scheme would be undercut if we didn't have 

the word "necessary" in the Necessary and Proper Clause

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there any dictionary
 

 (Laughter.) 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just give me one 

 MR. FARR:  I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.
 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that definition of
 

1  Clause.  It doesn't mean, as the Court has said on 
2  numerous occasions, absolutely necessary.  It means 
3  conducive to, useful, advancing the objectives, 
4  advancing the aims.  And it's easy to see, I think, that

 MR. FARR:  Well --
19
(Laughter.) 
20
21
 MR. FARR:  I think that there are several 
22  reasons that I would suggest that we would know that 
23  from.  The first is, as I say, the findings themselves. 
24  Congress says at the very beginning -- the head of it is 
25

 MR. FARR:  Well -- but I think my point, 

Justice Scalia, is that they're not using it in the true 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  How do we know that?  When 

Official 

"essential"?  It's very imaginative. 

Congress makes the following findings.  And they're 

65
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

Court's Commerce Clause statement. 

 But if one looks at the very preceding 

1  talking about the interstate -- you know, (B) is headed 
2  "Effects on the national economy and interstate 
3  commerce."  So, we know the context that Congress is 
4  talking about.  It is more or less quoting from the 
5
6
7  finding, which is Finding (H), which is on 42 over onto 
8  43, Congress at that point also uses the word 
9  "essential."  In the second sentence, it says this 
requirement -- and again, we're talking about the 
10
11 
minimum coverage provision -- "is an essential part of 
this larger regulation of economic activity," which is, 
12 
13 
by the way, an exact quote from Lopez, in which "the 
absence of the requirement would undercut Federal 
14 
regulation," also an exact quote from Lopez. 
15
16
17  an essential part of ERISA, the National Health Service 
18  Act, and the Affordable Care Act.  It can't possibly be, 
19  even the plaintiffs haven't argued, that those acts 
would all fall in their entirety if you took out the 
20
21  minimum coverage provision. 
22
23  Congress, the statute that was before the Court in 
24  Raich, section 801 of Title 21, the Court said that the 
25

regulation of intrastate drug activity, drug traffic, 

 And as a second example of the same usage by 

 But what it's referring to is essential --

66
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 So, I think once you look at the finding for 

what I believe it says, which is we believe this is a 

1  was essential to the regulation of interstate drug 
2  activity.  Again, it is simply not conceivable that 
3  Congress was saying one is so indispensable to the 
4  other, the way the United States uses the term here, so 
indispensable that if we can't regulate the intrastate 
5
6  traffic, we don't want to regulate the interstate 
7  traffic, either.  The whole law criminalizing drug 
8  traffic would fall. 
9
10
11  useful part of our regulatory scheme, which the Congress 
12  would think in its own approach would be sufficient --
13
14
15
16  that you're ignoring the congressional findings and all 
17  of the evidence Congress had before it that community 
18  ratings and guaranteed issuance would be a death 
19  spiral -- I think that was the word that was used --
20
21  materials that are part of the legislative record here. 
22
 So, even if it might not be because of the 
23  structure of the Act, that's post hoc evidence.  Why 
24  should we be looking at that as opposed to what Congress 
had before it and use "essential" in its plain meaning:

4
question.  But the idea that -- that all the information 
5
6  before Congress only led to the idea that if -- that you 
7  would have death spirals seems to me to be contradicted 
8  a little bit at least by the CBO report in November of 
9  2009, which is about 4 months before the Act passed, 
10
11
 Now, I want to be clear.  This is at a time 
12  when the minimum coverage provision was in the statute. 
13  So, I'm not suggesting that this is a discussion without 
14  that in it.  But, nonetheless, the CBO goes through and 
talks about adverse selection and -- and points out the 
15
16  different provisions in the Act, the ones I have 
17  mentioned plus one other, actually, where in the first 3

8  to say, either, that there is a death spiral.  Do you 
9  want -- you don't want us to make either of those two 
10
11
 MR. FARR:  That's correct.  Now, I -- I 
12  agree that there's a risk and the significance of it 
13  people can debate.  But what I think is -- is lost in 
14  that question -- and I didn't mean to be whimsical about 
it.  I think what is lost in it a little bit is what's 
15
16  on the other side, which is the fact that if you follow 
17  the Government's suggestion, if the Court follows the 
18  Government's suggestion, what is going to be lost is 
19  something we know is a central part of the Act.  I mean, 
indeed, if one sort of looks at the legislative history 
20
21  more broadly, I think much of it is directed toward the 
22  idea that guaranteed issue and community rating were the 
23  crown jewel of the Act. 
24

 The minimum coverage provision wasn't 

something that everybody was bragging about.  It was

8  States have tended to change that because they found 
9  that having too narrow a band worked against the 
10
11 
12
13  question directly, Mr. Chief Justice, the position I'm 
14  advocating would simply have those -- those pleas go to

16
17  more generally, if that's helpful, I think that if there 
18  were situations where the Court deferred -- let's say 
19  for discretionary reasons, they just said -- the Court 
20
21  severability and therefore not resolve it in these other 
22  situations, it certainly seems to me that in enforcement 
23  actions, for example, if the time comes in 2014 and 
24  somebody applies to an insurance company for a 
25

policy and the insurance company says, well, we're not 

Congress, not in court. 

 Now, if one -- just to discuss the issue

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Farr, let's consider 

how -- how your approach, severing as little as 

1  going to issue a policy, we don't think your risks are 
2  ones that we're willing to cover -- it seems to me that 
3  they could sue the insurance company and the insurance 
4  company could raise as a defense that this provision, 
the guaranteed-issue provision of the statute, is not 
5
6  enforceable because it was inseverable from the decision 
7  -- from the provision that the Court held 
8  unconstitutional in 2012. 
9
10
11  possible, thereby increases the deference that we're 
12  showing to Congress.  It seems to me it puts Congress in 
13  this position:  This Act is still in full effect.  There 
14  is going to be this deficit that used to be made up by 
15
16  come from somewhere.  You can't repeal the rest of the 
17  Act because you're not going to get 60 votes in the 
18  Senate to repeal the rest.  It's not a matter of 
19  enacting a new Act.  You got to get 60 votes to repeal 
it.  So, the rest of the Act is going to be the law. 
20
21
 So, you're just put to the choice of, I 
22  guess, bankrupting insurance companies and the whole 
23  system comes tumbling down, or else enacting a Federal 
24  subsidy program to the insurance companies, which is 
25

the mandatory coverage provision.  All that money has to 

what the insurance companies would like, I'm sure.

legislation after a Court ruling would be.  I'm not 
aware of any severability decision that has ever looked 
anything like that. 

1
2  showing deference to Congress and respecting the
 
3  democratic process?
 
4
5
6
 MR. FARR:  Well, Your Honor, the difficulty 
7  is that it seems to me the other possibility is for the 
8  Court to make choices particularly based on what it 
9  expects the difficulties of Congress altering the 
10
11 
12 
13
14  my approach.  My approach would say, if you take the 
heart out of the statute, the statute's gone.  That 
15
16  enables Congress to do what it wants in the usual 
17  fashion.  And it doesn't inject us into the process of 
18  saying:  This is good, this is bad, this is good, this 
19  is bad.
 MR. FARR:  Well --
20
21
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me it reduces 
22  our options the most and increases Congress's the most. 
 MR. FARR:  And I guess to some extent I have 
23
24  to quarrel with the premise, Justice Scalia, because at 
25

least the position that I'm advocating today, under 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I -- that wouldn't be 

74
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

thinks it is. 

 Now, I do think once you take out guaranteed 
issue and community rating, you're getting closer to the 

1  which the Court would only take out the minimum coverage 
2  provision, I don't think would fit the description that 
3  you have given of taking out the heart of the statute. 
4
5
6  heart of the statute.  And one of the -- one of the 
7  difficulties I think with the Government's position is 
8  that I think it's harder to cabin that, to draw that 
9  bright line around it.  It's harder than the Government 
10
11
 I mean, to begin with, even the Government 
12  seems to acknowledge, I think, that the exchanges are 
13  going to be relatively pale relatives of the exchanges 
14  as they're intended to be, where you're going to have 
15
16  comparisons based on products that look more or less the 
17  same. 
 But the other thing that's going to happen 
18
19  is with the subsidy program.  The way that the subsidy 
program is set up, the subsidy is calculated according 
20
21  to essentially a benchmark plan.  And this -- if one --
22  if the Court wants to look at the provisions, they're --
23  they begin at page 64a of the private plaintiffs' brief. 
24  Again, in the appendix.  The particular provision I'm 
25

standardized products, everybody can come and make 

talking about's at 68a.  But there's a -- there's a 

75
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 First question, obviously, is:  Is there
 

1  question -- you -- you're looking essentially to
 
2  calculate the premium by looking at a -- at a
 
3  standardized silver plan.
 
4
going to be any such plan if you don't have guaranteed 
5
6  issue and community rating, if the plans can basically 
7  be individualized?  But the second problem is that, in 
8  the provision on 68a, the -- the provision that's used 
9  for calculating the subsidy, what -- what is anticipated 
in the provision under the Act, as it is now, is that 
10
11  you do have the floor of the income.  You would -- you 
12  would take this benchmark plan, and the government would 
13  pay the difference. 
14
15
16  provision says it can be adjusted only for age.  So, if 
17  in fact you even have such a thing as a benchmark plan 
18  anymore, if the rates of people in poor health go up 
19  because of individual insurance underwriting, the 
government subsidy is not going to pay for that. 
20
21
22  the answer that you gave to Justice Scalia was 
23  essentially that the minimum coverage provision was not 
24  the heart of the Act.  Instead, the minimum coverage 
25

provision was a tool to make the nondiscrimination 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Farr, I understood that 

 And as we talked about earlier, the 

benchmark plan can change for age, and -- and the 

76
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 So, if you assume that, that all the minimum 

 Even without the minimum coverage provision, 

 MR. FARR:  No, I don't think so, because 

 And if one -- and the case that comes to 

1  provisions -- community rating, guaranteed issue --
2  work. 
3
4  coverage is, is a tool to make those provisions work, 
then I guess I would refocus Justice Scalia's question 
5
6  and say, if we know that something is just a tool to 
7  make other provisions work, shouldn't that be the case 
8  in which those other provisions are severed along with 
9  the tool?
10
11  there are -- there are many other tools to make the same 
12  things work.  That's I think the point. 
13
14  mind is New York v. The United States, where the Court 
struck down the "take title" provision but left other --
15
16  two other incentives essentially in place. 
17
18  there will be a lot of other incentives still to bring 
19  younger people into the market and to keep them in the 
20
21  correct -- and that's all that Congress is saying, that 
22  this would be useful -- it doesn't mean that it's 
23  impossible to have --
24
25

like to hear before you leave your argument, if you want 

market.  And if -- if my reading of the finding is 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But would you -- I'd just 

77
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Now, some of them cost money, and some of 

1  to, against what Justice Scalia just said.  Let's 
2  assume, contrary to what you want, that the Government's 
3  position is accepted by the majority of this Court.  And 
4  so, we now are rid, quote, of the true "heart" of the 
bill.  Now, still there are a lot of other provisions 
5
6  here like the Indian Act, the black lung disease, the 
7  wellness program, that restaurants have to have a 
8  calorie count of major menus, et cetera. 
9
them don't.  And there are loads of them.  Now, what is 
10
11  your argument that just because the heart of the bill is 
12  gone, that has nothing to do with the validity of these 
13  other provisions, both those that cost money or at least 
14  those that cost no money?  Do you want to make an 
argument in that respect, that destroying the heart of 
15
16  the bill does not blow up the entire bill; it blows up 
17  the heart of a bill?  And I'd just like to hear what you 
18  have to say about that. 
19
20
21  think is the proper severability standard and say, would 
22  Congress rather have not -- no bill as opposed to the 
23  bill with whatever is severed from it, it seems to me 
24  when you're talking about provisions that don't have 
anything to do with the minimum coverage provision, 
25

what I would say is, if one goes back to the -- what I

 MR. FARR:  Well --
13
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You know -- you only have 
14  two choices, Congress.  You can have the whole bill or 
15
16  bill at all.  Why that false choice? 
17
 MR. FARR:  I think the reason is because 
18  severability is by necessity a blunt tool.  The Court 
19  doesn't have -- even if it had the inclination, doesn't 
essentially have the authority to retool the statute --
20
21
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Oh, I know.  So, you 
22  -- I would say stay out of politics.  That's for 
23  Congress, not us. 
24
25

you can have -- you can have parts of the bill or no 

 MR. FARR:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But the -- the question 

79
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

think there probably are cases in the '20s and '30s that 
would be more like that. 

1  here is -- you've read all these cases or dozens -- have 
2  you ever found a severability case where the Court ever 
3  said:  Well, the heart of the thing is gone, and, 
4  therefore, we strike down these other provisions that 
have nothing to do with it, which could stand on their 
5
6  feet independently and can be funded separately or don't 
7  require money at all.

 If I could just take one second to address 
13  the economists' brief because Justice Alito raised it 
14  earlier.  I just want to make one simple point.  Leaving 
15
16  economists' brief, I think it's very important to note 
17  that when they're talking about one side of the balance 
18  -- may I finish? 
19
20
21  balance, they're not just talking about the minimum 
22  coverage provision.  They very carefully word it to say 
23  the minimum coverage provision and the subsidy programs.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Clement, could you 
9
respond to amici's point?  He says that Congress didn't 
10
11  go into this Act to impose minimum coverage.  They went 
12  into the Act to have a different purpose, i.e., to get 
13  people coverage when they needed it, to increase 
14  coverage for people, that this is only a tool.  But 
15
16  there are other tools besides minimum coverage that 
17  Congress can achieve the same goals.  So, if we strike 
18  just a tool, why should we strike the whole Act --
19
20
21 
22
23  four points in rebuttal, but I'll start with Justice 
24  Sotomayor's question, which is to simply say this isn't 
25

 MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- when Congress has 

other tools available? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, I'll make 

other States -- going back to my original point, that

just a tool; it's the principal tool.  Congress 

81
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Now, that brings me to my first point in 

1  identified it as an essential tool.  It's not just a 
2  tool to make it work.  It's a tool to pay for it, to 
3  make it affordable.  And, again, that's not my 
4  characterization; that's Congress's characterization in 
Sub-finding (I) on page 43a of the Government's brief. 
5
6
7  rebuttal, which is Mr. Kneedler says, quite correctly --
8  tells this Court don't look at the budgetary 
9  implications.  Well, the problem with that, though, is 
once it's common ground that the individual mandate is 
10
11 
in the statute at least in part to make community rating 
and guaranteed issue affordable, that really is all you 
12 
13 
have to identify.  That establishes the essential link 
that it's there to pay for it.
14 
 You don't have to figure out exactly how 
15
16  much that is and which box -- I mean, it clearly is a 
17  substantial part of it, because what they were trying to 
18  do was take healthy individuals and put them into the 
19  risk pool -- and this is quoting their finding -- which 
20
21  will lower premiums.  So, that's what their intent was.

24  that's reason alone to sever it.

guaranteed-issue and a community-rating provision 

 To figure out what they're talking about you 

1  says there's an easy dividing line between what they
 
2  want to keep and what they want to dish out.  The
 
3  problem with that is that, you know, you read their
 
4  brief and you might think, oh, there's a
 
5
6  subtitle in the bill.  There's not. 
7
8  have to go to page 6 of their brief, of their opening 
9  severability brief, where they tell you what's in and 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
 Now, in getting back to the -- an inquiry 
18
19  that I think this Court actually can approach is, to 
20
21  further than the title of this statute: Patient 
22  Protection and Affordable Care.  I agree with Mr. Farr 
23  that community rating and guaranteed issue were the 
24  crown jewels of this Act.  They were what was trying to 
25

what's out.  And the easy dividing line they suggest is 
actually between 300g(a)(1) and 300g(a)(2), because on 
community rating, they don't -- they say that (a)(1) 
goes, but then they say (a)(2) has to stay because 
that's the way that you'll have some sort of -- kind of 
Potemkin community rating for the exchanges.  But if you 
actually look at those provisions, (a)(2) makes all 
these references to (a)(1).  It just doesn't work. 

look at what Congress was trying to do, you need look no 

provide patient protection.  And what made it 

83
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Why make them do that in health care?  The 

1  affordable?  The individual mandate.  If you strike down 
2  guaranteed issue, community rating, and the individual 
3  mandate, there is nothing left to the heart of the Act. 
 And that takes me to my last point, which is 
4
simply this Court in Buckley created a halfway house, 
5
6  and it took Congress 40 years to try to deal with the 
7  situation, when contrary to any time of their intent, 
8  they had to try to figure out what are we going to do 
9  when we're stuck with this ban on contributions, but we 
can't get at expenditures because the Court told us we 
10
11  couldn't.  And for 40 years, they worked in that halfway 
12  house. 
13
14  choice is to give Congress the task of fixing this 
15
16  is struck down, or giving them the task of simply fixing 
17  the problem on a clean slate.  I don't think that's a 
18  close choice.  If the individual mandate is 
19  unconstitutional, the rest of the Act should fall.
