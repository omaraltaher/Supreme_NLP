 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

1
2
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 
3
4  next in Case 11-460, Los Angeles Flood Control District 
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
 In this case, the Ninth Circuit held that a 
12  discharge from a point source under the Clean Water Act 
13  occurred in the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers, 
14  based upon the fact that water moved from channelized 
portions of the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers into 
15
16  what it termed, quote, "naturally occurring portions of 
17  those rivers." 
18
19  discharge occurred because it moved through the concrete 
20
21  at the cert appendix at 44, it was, "again discharged to 
22  the rivers," and the "again" meaning that it was 
23  prior -- at prior time, it was in the rivers. 
24
25

 This is completely contrary to the Court's 
decision in Miccosukee Tribe, where the Court held that 

portions.  And in the words of the court itself, found 

 The court emphasized, in fact, that the 

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why don't we just 

the correct rule.  Virtually all the amici agree that is 

1  there cannot be a discharge for purposes of the NPDES 
2  permit program and the Clean Water Act, based upon the 
3  mere transfer of water within a single body of water. 
 All the parties to this case agree that is 
4
5
6  the correct rule.  And it's our view that that is 
7  dispositive of this case.  It is the only live issue 
8  before this Court from the Ninth Circuit, and it 
9  dictates --
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
18  reversal is -- is warranted, without a doubt, but I 
19  think given the record in this case is abundantly clear 
about what the claims were before the Ninth Circuit and 
20
21  what's going on with these monitoring stations. 
22
23  clearly within the rivers themselves.  There is just no 
24  dispute about that.  Even the Ninth Circuit's opinion, 
25

remand and let it sort it out under the right 
understanding of the legal rule?  Which is basically 
what the government is saying, with an added twist 
because it thinks there is another legal question that I 
think the Ninth Circuit has answered, but we could go 
back and forth on it. 

 MR. COATES:  Correct.  At minimum, a 

 I mean, these monitoring stations are 

like I said, the language of the opinion 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company

when they found it in the middle of rivers; and, that 
being resolved against the Respondents, there is no 
other live issue. 

1  suggests that --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Everybody agrees. 
2
 MR. COATES:  Correct.  And the reason why I 
3
4  don't think there is an open remand is because there is 
nothing further in the record, really, to argue about. 
5
6
 At minimum, of course, we would prefer 
7  reversal, and it would take an open remand.  But I 
8  think, given the record in this case, the only live 
9  claim before the Ninth Circuit was this discharge theory 
10
11 
12 
13
14  that they present a very direct syllogism.  You have a 
permit that sets these monitoring stations where they 
15
16  are.  The monitoring stations show exceedances, you have 
17  violated your permit.  What -- what's wrong with that? 
18
19  monitoring here -- for example, when you look at the 
permitting question, it doesn't say the monitoring of 
20
21  any permittee.  If you look at the permit where it talks 
22  about the mass emissions monitoring stations, it talks 
23  about measuring discharges and compliance from the MS4, 
24  not any individual permittee's MS4. 
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it seems to me 

 MR. COATES:  Well, because the nature of the

for which you're responsible? 

 MR. COATES:  But itâ€™s the -- Well, I think, 

again, the -- the rules say that you look at the permit's 

 The government suggests that there could be 

1  understand the argument to be that that's the problem 
2  that your permit imposes on you; in other words, that 
3  this is where the monitoring station is supposed to be. 
4  What is it monitoring, if not discharges from the MS4, 
5
6
7  different rules about whether you have to show the 
8  allocation or if that's your responsibility. 
9
10
11  terms to interpret it. 
12
 And the Ninth Circuit did look at the 
13  permit's terms.  I mean, it -- it dealt with this 
14  argument, and it noted that there are several factors in 
the permit that suggest that it didn't relieve the 
15
16  Respondents of the obligation of having to show an 
17  actual discharge of water --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you don't --
18
19  you don't question that there was an actual discharge. 
The storm sewer system in Los Angeles hasn't been shut 
20
21  down, right? 
22
23
24  discharges, right? 
25

 MR. COATES:  Correct.  But, again --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So there are 

MR. COATES:  But not discharges of

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't dispute 

sources, do you? 

 MR. COATES:  Well, we don't know that.  But 

suggest -- you have asked in your permit for a limit on 
how much of a --

1  pollutants, and that's what's reported. 
2
3  that there was at least some small amount of pollutant, 
4  even below the -- the permit level, from your point 
5
6
7  the -- but the point I want to make --
8
9  whether -- I mean, isn't it -- doesn't common sense 
10
11 
12
13
14  pollutant you can discharge. 
15
16
17  that, unless you expected to discharge some. 
You might do it 
18
19  sometimes, you might do it others, you might do it in 
concentrations that would cause or contribute to the 
20
21  exceedances; but you still have to have a discharge that 
22  causes or contributes to the exceedances. 
23
24  put the monitoring sources where they are, if that

MR. COATES:  But, again --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You wouldn't do

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. COATES:  Because you're required, in 

the regulatory agency.  And it's a question of 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the government 
says that that question -- you're saying, I understand, 
there are other discharges -- well, you're by far the 
dominant discharger, but I understand there are others, 
and they may contribute as well to what the monitoring 
station says. 

1  the permit? 
2
3  a -- in a system-wide permit like this, to suggest -- to 
4  propose monitoring which is subject to the approval of 
5
6  monitoring of what?  Not monitoring of any individual 
7  permittee's discharge.  In fact, it's not designed for 
8  that.  We even presented evidence in the district court 
9  to that effect. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 But the government's position is that, well, 
17  that's how you wrote the permit without any allocation; 
18  and that whatever allocation issues you have may be 
19  between you and the other dischargers, but that doesn't 
20
21
 MR. COATES:  Well, except for the fact that 
22  the permit terms themselves say that each permittee is 
23  only responsible for its own discharge.  If you read the 
24  permit in the general fashion that the Respondents wish, 
25

then -- then you're not responsible only for your own

 It's essentially you're in immediately and

concentration of pollutants. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose that the district 

has 85 percent of the water by volume that's put into 
this river, and then you have this high pollution index. 
Does that make it an easier case for the challengers? 
Or is that just irrelevant? 

MR. COATES:  It's just irrelevant, unless 

 You could have a major discharger that

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I have one different 

question.  This is hypothetical.  It's not in the case. 

 Suppose you have the river, and part of it 

And when the -- in the dry season, they fix 
the concrete bank, but they use bad concrete.  And a lot 
of pollutants are coming out of the concrete, but it is 
in the river.  Is that a discharge under this statute? 
 MR. COATES:  I don't believe so.  Although, 

1  you're adding more pollutants, necessarily, or how those 
2  pollutants contribute to exceedances measured at the 
3  mass emissions monitoring stations.

MR. COATES:  Well, the reason why -- the

permittees. 

1  for the pollution; is that right? 
2
3  right, but you look for the --
4
5
6  reason why that that's there is to measure, essentially, 
7  the health of these rivers so that you can fine-tune the 
8  MS4 permit -- the systemwide permit, and so that you can 
9  gauge general water quality standards, and if necessary, 
10
11 
12
 And we note that there is a renewed permit. 
13  It still has the monitoring stations in it, so under the 
14  Ninth Circuit's decision, we would still be discharging 
at those monitoring stations.  But it does provide for 
15
16  outfall monitoring at representative outfalls for 
17  individual permittees to do precisely that kind of 
18  correlation that we are talking about. 
19
20
21
 MR. COATES:  There is a renewed permit.  The 
22  permits are renewed every 5 years.  This is -- we are on 
23  the third permit now; this is the fourth; it's gone 10 
24  years.  The renewed permit continues the mass emission 
station.  So, as I mentioned, we are still discharging

 What I'm saying is that there is no

player in that portion of the system.  I'm not going to 
downplay that. 

1  percentage of discharges come from you, as opposed to 
2  the other members of the MS4 --
3
4  infrastructure.  I don't know the specific percentage, 
5

16  traceable to our discharge that contributes to those 
17  exceedances. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what goes 
18
19  into these discharges, besides the rainwater runoff? 
MR. COATES:  Here, it's just stormwater.

There is just no automatic correlation to 
that.  And I think, as the district court said -- you 
know, it's not so much to ask to at least sample at one 
outfall to try and show that kind of correlation, so you 
can show exceedances at the margin. 

1  that, for some reason, their rainwater would have a 
2  different amount of pollutants than your rainwater?

5
6  industrial sites that discharge water into the L.A.

9  in terms of doing pollution control as well.

17
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Circuit's error -- was the 
18  Ninth Circuit's error here a factual one, because it was 
19  based on the location of the stations?  Or was it a legal 
20
21
22  don't believe it's a factual mistake, for a couple of 
23  reasons.  One, the language that -- that I cited, that's 
24  in the cert appendix at 44, where it talks about the 
water, again, discharged to the river, suggests that 
25

one because it misinterpreted our Miccosukee case?

 And finally, the record is just abundantly 

MS4 is an intrastate manmade construction, as opposed to

two remedies, that the NRDC, if they think you are

 renewed.  We are waiting for the final version to go 
 online and to see it.  I think what we cite to the Court 
 is the last one that was before the regional board.  It 
 lines -- it lines out. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you are not doing 

 it now? 

 MR. COATES:  We are not doing it now.  I 

 mean, there's -- the new permit is technically 
 effective.  It could be stayed if someone challenges it. 
I think it's open until it's challenged until December 
 11th.  But under the renewed permit, there is outfall 
 monitoring -- specific outfall monitoring.  Now, the 
 mass emission station is still there, and under the 
 Ninth Circuit's opinion, we are still discharging there 
and responsible for the exceedances.

 So -- but that's the type of monitoring that 
 plaintiffs want, and that's in the new permit.  If they 
 want it in the last permit, they could have disputed it; 
 they could have contested the last permit.  But they 
didn't do so.  This is a fine-tuning program.  I mean, 
 municipal stormwater is a complex issue.  Congress 
 didn't treat it the same way it did industrial 
 stormwater. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it your position that 

the rivers -- the two rivers in question are outside the 
 MS4?  I thought there was a suggestion in the 
 government's brief that you could have both the river 
 and the MS4 that could cover the same area. 

 MR. COATES:  We have -- in the lower courts, 
the district personnel refer to the channelized portion 
 as part of our MS4 because it's all flood control to us. 
 However, we have never said it's all the same for 
 purposes of a discharge.  We've been very careful about 
 that, that, for a discharge from a point source, an 
outfall, not the monitoring stations -- in fact, in the 
 district court, plaintiff somewhat argued that theory, 
 the monitoring stations, when you're MS4, they're 
 exceedances; ergo, exceedances in your MS4. 

 And we pointed out, under Miccosukee, there 
is no discharge of water.  There's no discharge because

 it's merely transferring water as water moves past the 
 monitoring stations.  And then --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was the purpose of 
 having the monitoring station if nothing can be done? 
And are -- the monitoring shows, yes, there is a lot of 
 pollutants in there, and we know that at least some of 
 them have to be ascribed to the district.  But you say, 
 unless you -- you show the outflow, that it comes from 
 there, no liability. 

Why shouldn't it be that, given there is 

 going to be a contribution that the district is making, 
 that the district should have the burden of showing, no, 
 there are all these other ones out there, so our 
 percentage is X, not the whole thing? 

MR. COATES:  Well, again, the -- the Water 
 Act makes you responsible for a discharge in violation 
 of permit terms, so you have to have a discharge by the 
 permittee. 

 The permit terms itself are not written in 
that fashion.  Again, it says we are only responsible 
 for our own discharge.  Could you write a permit that 
 way?  Perhaps.  But this permit was not written that 
 way. 

 And, in fact, the Ninth Circuit agreed with 
us on that.  The permit language is not tricky on that.

 You could have permittee monitoring.  You could.  And 
 that's what the renewed permit does.  But that is not 
 this permit. 

 The regional board -- as I said, it's part 
of a process.  There have been three permits over the 
 last -- since 1990.  And we have a fourth permit, and it 
 has some new provisions to fine tune it for precisely 
 this reason. 

 I note that -- the biggest dispute we seem 
to have on this monitoring issue -- and -- and it's one 
 that I think the discussion we are having bears out, is 
 that it is not a straightforward issue; that when you 
 look at the statute itself, the Statute 1342(p)(3) 
 distinguishes between industrial stormwater dischargers 
and municipal stormwater discharges. 

 Now, I think it is worth looking at that 
 provision because, if you look at (a), and that talks 
 about industrial dischargers, it says they have to meet 
 every requirement of this provision.  And if you go to 
1342(a), it includes everything, including the 
 monitoring requirements of 33 U.S.C. 1318. 

 But if you look at 1342(p)(3), subdivision 
 (B), which talks about municipal stormwater, you do not 
 see that language.  You do not see that "must comply" 
with every other provision of this section.  It doesn't

 say that. 

Official 

 It only has, essentially, three 

 requirements, which is these permits can be granted on a 
 system-wide or jurisdiction-wide basis, you have to only 
allow stormwater, and that the -- must provide to try 
 and manage pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. 
 And that's the sum total of it. 

 So I don't think you can assume that these 

 are identical monitoring requirements.  It's, at the 
very least, a complex question.  I think it's one that 
 would have behooved the Court to be able to obtain more 
 amicus assistance on.  And part of it is the way that 
 this was raised to this Court, that this was a proper 
 issue for a cross-petition. 

And the only justification I've seen for 

 this is I saw a letter come to the Court advising it of 
 two cases, I think, LeTulle v. Scofield -- I don't know 
 if it's LeTulle or LeTulle -- and Ryerson v. United 
 States.  And neither of one of those suggest that this 
is an appropriate issue for the Court. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is -- is your description 
 of the statute meant to conclude, or does it -- does it 
 conclude, that these outsource monitoring stations which 
 exist under the new permit are not really required? 

MR. COATES:  Well, not necessarily

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH, 
 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE 
 MR. SHAH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

 The answer to the question presented in this 
 case is both straightforward and undisputed.  Under this 
 Court's decision in Miccosukee, no addition, and thus, 
 no discharge of pollutant occurs, when water flows from 
a channelized portion of a river to a downstream portion

 of that same river. 

Official 

 Because the monitoring stations at issue are 
 actually located within the rivers themselves, the court 
 of appeals erred in concluding that a discharge of 
pollutants occurred when, quote, "the still-polluted 
 stormwater flowed out of the concrete channels where the 
 monitoring stations are located, through an outfall and 
 into the navigable waterways." 

 And because the court of appeals rested its 
liability determination on that erroneous premise, the 
 judgment should be vacated and the case remanded to the 
 court of appeals. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Shah, what about the 

 problem that one of the amici brought up concerning 
dredged material?  Said that if we just say Miccosukee 
 applies, then when there's a dredging operation and the 
 material is redeposited back into the same water, then 
 that would also -- there would be no responsibility 
 based on that. 

MR. SHAH:  Right.  Your Honor, I think -- I 
 think the one amicus that does raise that issue raises 
 it limited to -- the biggest counterexample they raise 
 is the one that you raise about Section 404 permits for 
 dredged and fill material.  Those permits are just very 
different in kind.

 Section 404 applies to dredged and fill 

 material, which almost, by definition, is going to be 
 coming from the source itself.  And so we think that the 
 Miccosukee line of decision just doesn't apply to that 
permitting regime, which -- which is a very different 
 sort of permitting regime than we have at issue here. 
 And in any event, I think it's far beyond 

 the question presented in this case, the Miccosukee 
 rule. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, tell me why 
 remand?  I thought -- and correct me at whatever step 
 I'm wrong, okay -- that the district court rejected 
 Respondents' argument that the mere monitoring excesses 
 created liability.  What it said is you have to follow 
the terms of the permit and make the permittee 
 responsible only for their excess discharges, and you 
 haven't shown us any evidence that does that. 

 The Ninth Circuit agreed that the permittee 

 is only liable for its own discharges.  It held the 
permittee liable because it believed that the discharges 
 were within their source -- within their outflow.  So 
 what are we remanding for?  The legal question of 
 whether the -- the -- the monitoring stations 
 automatically create liability has been answered in the 
negative by both courts.

 MR. SHAH:  Justice Sotomayor, I agree with 

 your reading of -- of both opinions below. 

 I think what we're asking for is the Court 

 to do what it normally does when it vacates an erroneous 
part of a judgment and sends it back, that is, leave it 
 open to the court of appeals, to address any issues 
 consistent with this Court's opinion. 

 We think it's conceivable that the Ninth 
 Circuit might approach the permit construction issue 
differently, once it's corrected of the 
 misimpressions --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How would it --
 MR. SHAH:  -- that it had before it. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- what could it do 

differently? 

 MR. SHAH:  I think, in particular, the Ninth 
 Circuit construed this permit on the understanding that 
 there was a discharge of polluted water after it flowed 
 past the monitoring station and said that the district 
could be liable, based simply on the exceedance measured 
 by the mass emission station alone. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How does that change the 
 answer to the legal question that the permittee -- both 
 courts have said the permittee is only liable for their 
own discharges.  And unless this proves that they

 discharged -- they, themselves, discharged, which it 
 can't because it's in the river and not within the 
 source --

 MR. SHAH:  Well, it --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- how can that, alone, 

 establish liability? 

 MR. SHAH:  Well, again, I think the Ninth 

 Circuit predicated its permit interpretation on the 
 understanding that there would be at least some way to 
hold a permittee -- in this case, the district -- liable 
 based on the mass emission exceedance alone, and that's 
 because it misapprehended that there would be a 
 discharge of flow of the polluted water. 

 It could be, and it may not be.  We don't 

know until it gets back to the Ninth Circuit.  It may be 
 that the Ninth Circuit would reject the view that you 
 could have a permit that sets up a permitting regime 
 that does not allow a plaintiff to sue any particular 
 permittee, unless it has evidence beyond that provided 
by the monitoring regime. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So -- so -- so what follows 

 from that; that the district is liable because it's a 
 lousy permit? 

 MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, if --

 court -- how the -- how the court of appeals is going to 
 be able to do anything different, other than say there's 
 no liability here, unless, of course, it adopts another 
 fanciful interpretation of the statute, which is 
something I worry about. 

 MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, we think that 
 this permit -- again, the terms of this permit are both 
 complex and ambiguous.  We do not think that permits 
 should be written this way.  We think permits that 
provide for water quality -- for MS4s to adhere to water 
 quality standards based on ambient monitoring should be 
 coupled with either individual --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I agree with that, but 

 how can this permit possibly be interpreted in such a 
way as to hold a district liable? 

 MR. SHAH:  Well, I think the most 

 persuasive -- and, again, we don't take a firm position 
 on this, but I think the most persuasive argument on the 
 other side would be that, when permit writers issue a 
permit, they -- they assume that the permitting regime 
 provided in the permit would provide a basis to seek 
 enforcement of that permit.  If that were true --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They would assume that; 

 but, if it doesn't, it doesn't. 

MR. SHAH:  Well --

 MR. SHAH:  Well, one could imagine a regime 

 where the permittees, that is, the municipalities who 
apply for a joint permit, would agree to a shared 
 presumption of liability.  For example, there are --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They have -- they have not 

 agreed. 

 MR. SHAH:  Well, again, we don't --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you're going to impose a 
 shared thing?  I see no way for the court of appeals to 
 do this in -- in a fashion that will not bring the case 
 right back here, and you'll be asking us to send it back 
 to the same panel. 

MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor, I don't think 
 it's a cert-worthy issue, how to interpret the terms of 
 this specific -- this is a fairly --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But, anyway, you say that 

 the court held the same thing in two other cases 
involving two other rivers, and they didn't cross-appeal 
 from that, and so that issue isn't really in front of 
 us.

 MR. SHAH:  Right.  You Honor, I think in 
 terms of the cross-petition issue, that is a closed 
 question.  I don't think the Court needs to get near it 
because I think there are several other good reasons why 
 this Court should not decide the permit construction 
 issue itself. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  But if we decide 

 that they needed file a cross-petition and they didn't, 
then what's the basis for our remanding, rather than 
 reversing? 

 MR. SHAH:  Well, Your Honor --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  It's that issue that what 

 we have to decide. 

MR. SHAH:  Your Honor, it's established that 

 this Court -- even if a cross-petition were required, 
 it's established that this Court has the authority to 
 remand for disposition of any further issues once a case 
 comes before this Court.  So the cross-petition --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why should we, in light 

 of the clarity of the permit?  That's the question 
 Justice Scalia is asking. 

 MR. SHAH:  Sure.  I think the Court should 

 just follow its ordinary practice.  We're not asking for

 vacating the judgment and remanding for further

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And if there -- if 

 there is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that is not our 

 ordinary practice, when -- when nothing can happen on 
 remand, except -- except to give judgment for the 
 Petitioners here. 

 MR. SHAH:  Well, I think it would be unusual 
for the Court to reverse and then instruct that judgment 
 be entered in favor of Petitioner.  Of course, the Court 
 is free to do that, and it may decide to do that.  We 
 just think that there is a possibility that the Ninth 
 Circuit would -- would take a different approach. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Sometimes, the Court says 

 the bottom line in that italicized thing, which I've 
 never fully understood when and when we don't do it, but 
 it just says, "Reversed." 

 MR. SHAH:  Right. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  And then, sometimes, it 
 says, "It is so ordered."  And exactly when you write 
 the word "Reversed" -- but I usually just ask the Clerk, 
 all right.

 question is when do we do the one or the other, and I 
 think, here, what they're saying is, just write the word 
 "Reversed," we'll deal with the rest of it.  All right. 
 So that's --

MR. SHAH:  Right.  And, again, the Court is 

 well within its -- its discretion to do that.  We 
 think --

 say that in the judgment of the Court? 

MR. SHAH:  Doesn't it always say what, Your

 so ordered," in the judgment that we release? 

 MR. SHAH:  Yes, yes.  And I think the 

typical -- I think the typical phrasing would be vacate 
 and -- and remand for further proceedings. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Shah, am I right 
 about that this other theory, if it were open to the 
 Ninth Circuit, would apply equally to the other rivers 
that Justice Breyer mentioned, and those were out of the 
 case because, when it got to the Ninth Circuit, we were 
 talking about only the Los Angeles and the San Gabriel? 

 MR. SHAH:  That's right, Your Honor.

would apply to all four.

still has the case on remand, if it were to revisit its 
 permit construction.

 would be that the rationale that they used for those two 
 rivers, it would be in tension with it, and if they 
 agree that the rationale which led them to deny -- to 
deny liability on those two rivers, that may lead them 
 to adhere to its current permit interpretation.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON COLANGELO 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
MR. COLANGELO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

 it please the Court: 

 We do not defend the judgment on the Ninth 
 Circuit's stated rationale, but on alternative grounds 
 that are properly before this Court.  The compliance 
monitoring included in the permit determines 
 Petitioner's liability for permit violations as a matter 
 of law, as the Clean Water Act, EPA regulations, and the 
 permit's own terms all require. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, where is the 

permit's own terms?  Your friend cited JA 93, which says 
 each permittee is responsible only for a discharge for 
 which it is the operator.  So where does the permit 
 clearly show the opposite? 

 MR. COLANGELO:  Your Honor, let me point you 
to three provisions in the permit that, taken together, 
 compel this result.  The first is page 195 of the Joint 
 Appendix, the paragraph numbered D(1).  And this refers 
 to the individual permittees, and it says, "Each 
 permittee must comply with all of the terms, 
requirements, and conditions of this order.  Any

 violation of this order constitutes a violation of the 
 Clean Water Act, its regulations, and the California 
 Water Code, and is grounds for enforcement action." 

 And that's the first of the three 

provisions, and it is undisputed here that there are 
 permit violations.  The monitoring included in the 
 permit that Petitioner and its co-permittees chose has 
 demonstrated, since 2003, undisputed permit violations. 

 The second provision is page 98 --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.  But -- but before 

 you go further, it says each permittee must comply.  It 
 doesn't say that each permittee shall be responsible or 
 shall be liable.  And it's the other provision that says 
 that each permittee is responsible only for a discharge 
for which it is the operator. 

 MR. COLANGELO: 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
 MR. COLANGELO: 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
MR. COLANGELO: 

Correct. 
So you got more --
Yes, You Honor. 
-- more besides 195. 
Well, and what 195 adds is 

 it says any violation is grounds for enforcement action. 

 Now, JA 98 talks about exactly this 

 circumstance, when violations are detected at the 
 monitoring stations.  And about halfway down JA 98, it 
says, if exceedances of water quality objectives or

 water quality standards persist -- and that's only 
 measured in one place; that's at the compliance 
 monitoring in the rivers -- notwithstanding 
 implementation of control measures and other 
requirements of this permit, quote, "the permittee," 
 individually, "the permittee shall assure compliance 
 with discharge prohibitions and receiving water 
 limitations by complying with the following procedure." 

 It then sets out four steps that each 

permittee must comply with to bring the MS4 within the 
 permit limits.  Now, that is --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, the very first 

 step is A, "Upon a determination by either the permittee 
 or the regional board that discharges are causing or 
contributing to an exceedance of an applicable water 
 quality standard, the permittee shall promptly notify," 
 et cetera.  They cannot make such a determination 
 because of the nature of the monitoring -- monitoring 
 here. 

MR. COLANGELO:  That's -- that's incorrect, 

 Your Honor.  The permit compels this result because 
 there is only one place in the permit that that 
 monitoring is required, and that is the in-stream mass 
 emission stations that the permittees chose.  And the 
permit says, explicitly, the monitoring results at those

 locations are used to assess compliance and determine 
 whether the MS4 is contributing to violations. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But as I read it, and he 

 explained it, I thought that, look, what they're 
thinking is this:  Stormwater is really a big problem, 
 and it's really complicated how you work it out, and we 
 want the agencies to work it out.  So the purpose of 
 this monitoring thing is we first determine that there 
 is an exceedance. 

Now, once we determine that there is an 

 exceedance, which is the point of this pertinent 
 particular requirement, then we're going to go on to 
 decide who.  And what we're going to do is leave you 
 with two possible choices.  One is you can try to figure 
out who, which means you've got to get an expert and 
 monitor it; or let us now have a new permit which 
 will -- will -- you know, which will -- which will put 
 some responsibility on the individuals, because we'll 
 monitor higher up the river. 

Now, that's a rational way for an agency to 

 proceed and it leaves you with pretty good remedies. 
 And so why -- why are we running all around, trying to 
 work this thing out?  Why don't you just sort of try to 
 deal with it as they described it and say, okay, we're 
going to either prove you did it before or at least we

 can prove it now? 

Official 

 MR. COLANGELO:  There are two answers to 

 that, Your Honor.  The first is this is all sorted out 
 during the permitting process.  This permit was adopted 
by the State agency and upheld by State courts upon the 
 Petitioner's challenge after 5 years of litigation.  The 
 permit was based on an 80,000 page administrative record 
 and the testimony of 29 witnesses.  And the point of 
 this process is that permit terms are fixed once the 
permit is finalized and approved by the courts. 

 Now, the reason we didn't challenge the 

 permit at the time is that we were defending the permit 
 alongside the State agency as an intervenor against 
 Petitioner's challenge.  Petitioner in State court for 
years made exactly the opposite argument that it makes 
 here.  It said that it was entitled to a safe harbor 
 provision in the permit, to excuse it from liability, 
 because it would be held responsible based on this 
 in-stream monitoring. 

Now, there may be, as a -- as a technical or 

 scientific matter, better monitoring programs, to 
 determine who's putting in what and where exactly it is 
 coming from, but that cannot be reopened upon an 
 enforcement proceeding.

 district is a big contributor, but there are other 
 contributors.  So, on your theory, how do we determine 
 what is the share that the district would be liable for? 

 MR. COLANGELO:  Your Honor, the permit 

includes a blueprint that sorts that out, and it 
 parallels the traditional notion of several liability. 
 Where there are multiple contributors to a single harm, 
 each is responsible for its share --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you still have to show 

that there is a contributor.  And I've been through 
 these sections, and it seems to me that a reasonable 
 interpretation of this section is that there is a 
 violation if a particular permittee violates. 

 And what I'm taking away from your argument 
is that, once there is a violation, all the permittees 
 are liable, and that just can't be. 

 MR. COLANGELO:  It can be, Your Honor, and 
 that's the -- that's the solution that the permit works 
 out and that the permittees negotiated for in advance. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's the third section, 
 Mr. Colangelo?  I'm waiting breathlessly for your third 
 section.  You said there were three. 

 (Laughter.) 
 MR. COLANGELO:  The third, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I've got 195.  I've got 98.

 Where is the third one? 

Official 

 MR. COLANGELO:  The third, Your Honor, is JA 

 109. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  109. 
MR. COLANGELO:  And this parallels a 

 provision in EPA's regulations. 

 At the very bottom of JA 109, subsection D, 
 it says, "The permittee shall carry out all inspection, 
 surveillance, and monitoring procedures necessary to 
determine compliance and noncompliance with permit 
 conditions." 

 So the problem with Petitioner's theory is 
 that they are violating this provision of the permit, 
 which is taken virtually verbatim from EPA regulations, 
which says that the discharger has the responsibility to 
 measure and report its own violations. 

 And stepping back to talk about the Clean 
 Water Act program, generally, and the discharge permit 
 program, generally, no one is entitled to discharge 
without a permit; a permit fixes terms that must be 
 complied with; and at the heart of the permitting 
 program is self-monitoring and self-reporting of 
 violations. 

Looking at 
109, it strikes me as a little bit circular to say â€“ to 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well --

41
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 say they have the responsibility to carry out inspection 
 and surveillance and monitoring to ensure compliance with 
 the permit, and their point is, well, we're not -- we're 
 not not in compliance with the permit because you 
haven't -- there hasn't been an allocation of the 
 discharges to them. 

 MR. COLANGELO:  Well -- and the problem with 
 that, Your Honor, is that it leads to no liability ever 
 for the discharger, even though it concedes --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I think that 
 might be -- I think that might be right, but that gets 
 back to the question of whether the permit is -- is 
 poorly drafted. 

 MR. COLANGELO:  Right. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And -- and I guess 

 the idea is they're changing the permit so to -- to cure 
 that problem. 

 MR. COLANGELO:  The permit has changed.  It 

 is not yet effective, Your Honor, but there is a new 
permit that will be in effect shortly.  But on the 
 question of whether --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why -- why do you 

 need that if -- if the present permit covers it as 
 clearly as you say?  I mean self -- self-monitoring.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  My goodness, you're going 
 to go through all of this how many -- how long did it 
 take you to challenge this and blah, blah, blah, blah? 
 Why go through all that if, indeed, the present permit, 
as you say, is perfectly adequate? 

 MR. COLANGELO:  The present permit is 

 adequate.  The State agency renewed the permit.  That's 
 a matter of course.  It changed the monitoring program. 
 The point is that whatever monitoring the State agency 
sets and that the State courts uphold is the monitoring 
 that determines compliance. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, would you still 

 I'm not clear if you gave me an answer to how the 
 district share would be determined.  It is not the 
only polluter.  Are you saying each permittee is 
 responsible for the whole? 

 MR. COLANGELO:  No, Your Honor.  That's 
 joint and several liability.  And here, JA 93, which 
 Petitioner cites, says that each permittee is 
responsible only for its discharges.  That's just --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So how do we find out 

 what is its part -- what is its share? 

 MR. COLANGELO:  The permit sets that out. 

 The permit says, once a violation is detected, each 
permittee has to go back upstream, conduct enhanced

 monitoring to identify the particular sources of 
 pollution within its jurisdiction, control those 
 sources, but only those within its jurisdiction, and 
 continue that process until the problem is resolved. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that the 109 language 

 you cite? 

 MR. COLANGELO:  No, Your Honor.  That's at 

 both 98, which I cited second, and page 213. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So the upshot would 
be, however, as I understand it, and correct me if I'm 
 wrong, that since they're doing that now anyway under 
 the new permit -- and you can question my hypothetical 
 assumption there -- but if they are doing it under the 
 new permit, then the only result of your winning this 
would be to transfer the running of the district from 
 the agency to the court.  And I suspect the Ninth 
 Circuit knows less about it than you participating in 
 a -- some kind of negotiation with the agency. 

 MR. COLANGELO:  No, not at all, Your Honor. 
The -- the Petitioner retains the authority and, indeed, 
 the responsibility to identify the particular sources 
 within its jurisdiction that are causing the problem and 
 abating only those.  So it is limited, in response to 
 Justice Ginsburg's earlier question, only to its own 
share.

 There is no question that there are other 

 contributors, but the permit doesn't impose a violation 
 only upon the entity who is the sole cause.  There 
 are -- there are many polluters that discharge into 
these rivers.  The permit specifically says it is 
 unlawful to cause or contribute to a violation of water 
 quality standards.  So prohibiting a contribution 
 assumes that there will be other contributors and that 
 the Petitioner will not be the sole cause. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, this is all 
 fine and good.  Your -- your friend, though, says you 
 should have cross-petitioned because the relief you seek 
 expands the judgment below, and there are all these 
 cases saying you can't do that. 

MR. COLANGELO:  Your Honor, the relief we 

 seek would not expand the judgment below because the two 
 rivers on which we lost are out of the case. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I understand 

 that, but -- it seems reasonable, but they do cite a lot 
of cases that say you can't do that.  You can't just 
 sort of say, oh, I give up on the others because the 
 judgment, I guess, is one whole, and you would be 
 changing the judgment. 

 MR. COLANGELO:  Accepting this argument, 
Your Honor, would not change the judgment.  The cases 

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 that Petitioner cites are all examples -- except for 
 one, which I'll get to in a second -- where the 
 Respondent was seeking to change the judgment, either in 
 its favor or to get lesser relief, or where the result 
would necessarily have changed the judgment. 

 Here, accepting this argument would not 

 change the judgment. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why wouldnâ€™t it 

 necessarily --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Thatâ€™s because youâ€™re giving 
 up -- you're giving up on the two rivers, even though your 
 theory would work the same way with respect to them? 

 MR. COLANGELO:  That's correct, Your Honor. 
 And that's consistent with the cross-petition rule.  A 
respondent who is satisfied with the result below and 
 does not seek to change the judgment does not need to 
 cross-petition.  A cross-petition is only necessary --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But do you think that the 
 trial court was wrong, the district court was wrong, and 
the Ninth Circuit, both times, when they said, well, you 
 didn't prove -- there was no -- there was no proof that 
 the district was responsible for a given part.  So, on 
 your theory, both the district court and the Ninth 
 Circuit were wrong on that?

 Honor, yes.  But this Court can affirm on any basis 
 preserved below, and this was also preserved in our 
 brief in opposition at the jurisdictional stage, as long 
 as it would not change the judgment. 

And here's why it would not.  Let me 

 distinguish the Northwest Airlines v. County of Kent 
 case, which Petitioner cites.  That case presents, in 
 fact, the opposite situation of what we have here.  In 
 that case, Respondent's argument, had it been accepted, 
would have required the district court to grant further 
 relief in continuing proceedings on a claim that no 
 longer existed because the Respondent's argument was 
 that there was no private right of action at all. 

 Our case is the opposite because, if the 
Court accepts our position, we simply don't get any 
 further relief with respect to claims that are waived to 
 which we would have been entitled.  And the two cases 
 that we've cited by letter last week both represent 
 exactly that situation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Colangelo, did you 

 raise this argument in your brief in opposition? 

 MR. COLANGELO:  Yes, Your Honor, we did.

 MR. COLANGELO:  We do -- let me just quote 
 what may be the most explicit thing, Your Honor, which 
is at the very bottom of page 4 in our supplemental 
 brief at the cert stage.  "The Court of Appeals' ruling 
 was both correct and equitable.  Every Clean Water Act 
 permit must include monitoring provisions ensuring that 
 permit conditions are satisfied."

 MR. COLANGELO:  At the very bottom of page 

 4, the last two lines, and the top of page 5. 

 Final -- now, most of our supplemental brief 

 and our brief in opposition were addressing why we did 
not think Petitioner's question merited this Court's 
 review.  This is the argument that we made in defense of 
 the judgment below, "The Court of Appeals ruling was 
 both correct and equitable.  Every permit must include 
 sufficient monitoring to determine compliance." 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well -- but -- but that --

 that's just to say you can rely on -- on the extant 
 monitors. 

 MR. COLANGELO:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  And 

 Petitioner's saying we're not --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you say -- you know, 
 they were correct.  You have to find some basis for 
 liability, and they use the monitors, and that's it.  It 
 didn't -- it didn't say, in detail, that these people 
 had to go and -- and set up their own monitoring 
under -- under the permit. 

 MR. COLANGELO:  Your Honor, that was the --
 that was our argument in the Ninth Circuit and at the 
 cert stage, and that -- we do lay out exactly how the 
 permit works.  The point is that the permit imposes 
liability on the multiple dischargers --

49
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you told this to the 

 Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit said no? 

 MR. COLANGELO:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

 That's correct.  But we can -- we can defend the 
judgment on a basis, even one that the Ninth Circuit 
 rejected. 

 To go back --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Colangelo, suppose we did 

 what the Solicitor General says to do and vacated 
this.  Can you think of any reason why the Ninth Circuit 
 would change its mind?  I mean, is there any connection 
 between these two issues that you can point to, such 
 that our making clear to the Ninth Circuit that they 
 made a mistake on one actually would affect their 
analysis on the other? 

 MR. COLANGELO:  There is one reason, Your 
 Honor, and that is that a permit is interpreted like a 
 contract, and it is a cardinal rule of contract 
 interpretation that a contract should be read where --
where possible to be both lawful and enforceable. 

 So the Ninth Circuit may go back down and 

 say, okay, with this corrected understanding of the 
 universe of law and facts that apply, we see that 
 Petitioner's reading of the permit would render it 
unenforceable because none of the permittees can be held

 liable and, therefore, unlawful because the Clean Water 
 Act requires all permits to include within it 
 self-monitoring and self-reporting to demonstrate a 
 violation. 

So the Ninth Circuit -- now, it may just --

 it may just say, we say what we said before.  But it 
 could reconsider on that basis, and that would be a 
 legitimate basis for it to do so. 

 To go back to the earlier question about 
where there is a discharge, there is no question that 
 Petitioner discharges these pollutants to these rivers, 
 so the only question for this enforcement proceeding is 
 where to measure Petitioner's discharges for purposes of 
 liability. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why is there no -- where 

 do I look to find out that the district is making a 
 discharge of polluted water, other than under the Ninth 
 Circuit's theory that it's in the river itself? 

 MR. COLANGELO:  Two places, Your Honor. 

First is that it's a premise for the permit itself.  So 
 if you look at page JA 55, it says the Petitioner 
 discharges stormwater into these rivers.  And then the 
 very next paragraph shows that the Petitioner has done 
 an assessment of the pollutants that are typically in 
its discharges, and it lists the ones that are now in

 violation here. 

Official 

 So the permit, it didn't -- it came out of 
 this administrative process, and one of the elements --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So is your theory that, if 

the district is permitted to -- on a scale of 1 to 10, 
 to discharge up to 2, but that if the monitoring station 
 in the river shows an 8, then it is automatically liable 
 for the increase, even though other dischargees might 
 have made this? 

MR. COLANGELO:  Yes, yes, because --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't get that from what 

 you have read.  I've looked at --

 MR. COLANGELO:  Your Honor, because --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the text you've read and 

it looks to me like it's permittee by permittee. 

 MR. COLANGELO:  It says that the MS4 is in 

 violation, that's correct.  But then it says each 
 permittee must, when an exceedance is detected, take 
 these steps.  So here, what they have failed to do is 
take the necessary steps to apportion responsibility 
 among the multiple contributors.  The second place, just 
 to finish on the -- on the proof that they discharge --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Finish that.  So what's the 

 consequence of that?

 Each one is liable for what they put in and bears the 
burden to demonstrate and limit what it puts in.  That's 
 explicit in the permit. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they haven't done so. 

 So what? 

 MR. COLANGELO:  So that's a permit 

violation, and result is that this pollution continues 
 year after year after year, when the point of the permit 
 and the point of the Clean Water Act was to eliminate 
 what everybody agrees is the biggest source of water 
 pollution in Southern California.  And this --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So if each permittee is 
 allowed to put in a 2, but one permittee puts in an 8; 
 then both permittees are liable? 

 MR. COLANGELO:  Correct, Your Honor, 

 unless -- because those facts are not known at the time 
the violation is detected. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no, we now know the 

 facts because it's the hypothetical. 

 MR. COLANGELO:  Okay.  So if the permittee 

 has done its own monitoring, in addition to what the 
permit requires, and can demonstrate that it did not put 

53

 anything in, then it is not liable.  If not, then yes. 
 Two dischargers into the same river who agree in advance 
 to be measured by a single monitoring station in the 
 river are liable for what's measured there, and then 
they sort it out. 

 And what -- Congress set up a regime that 

 would allow for system-wide and jurisdiction-wide 
 permits precisely because this problem was so 
 complicated. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are the 

 provisions -- excuse me, the provisions we've been 
 talking about, the three that you cited and the one that 
 youâ€™re -- are they boilerplate?  Do they show up in every 
 typical stormwater permit? 

MR. COLANGELO:  Well, 109 -- the fact that 

 the permittees must conduct all monitoring to 
 demonstrate compliance, if "boilerplate" means that they 
 are in all permits, then, yes, because that's a 
 requirement of EPA regulations. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.  What about the 

 one that says each permittee is responsible only for a 
 discharge for which it is the operator? 

 MR. COLANGELO:  That's from a EPA 

 regulation, too, yes.  That's in the definition of 
"co-permittee" at 122.2; so, yes, that's also standard

 in system-wide permits. 

Official 

 To go back to the earlier question about 
 where there is a discharge, the district court found, 
 and this is undisputed, at Petition Appendix 117, the 
permit admits -- the permittee, Petitioner, admits that 
 it is discharging these pollutants, the ones measured in 
 violation, to these rivers.  So what we have is no 
 question, no dispute that they discharged these 
 pollutants, a monitoring system included in the permit 
that the State court upheld against Petitioner's 
 challenge, showing that those limits have been exceeded. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Your basic argument is 

 this permit requires you, L.A. County, to do monitoring, 
 to decide if you're violating it.  You chose this 
system, then common sense suggests you're doing it.  You 
 struck out twice with that argument --

 MR. COLANGELO:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- in the other two rivers, 

 and now, you're going to go back if we permit it, and 
we want to make the argument and tell the Ninth 
 Circuit, three times and you're out; in this case, hold 
 the opposite. 

 MR. COLANGELO:  Well -- yes.  I'm not sure I 

 would say we struck out, Your Honor; the --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Thatâ€™s what you want us â€“-

 I understand it. 

Official 

 (Laughter.) 
 MR. COLANGELO:  But correct, the lower court 

 did not -- neither lower court accepted this argument 
fully.  The Ninth Circuit did agree that all permits 
 must include compliance monitoring, but it said you need 
 a little more here.  And we think that was improper 
 because you can't add terms to the permit once it's been 
 settled. 

And there was an earlier question, Justice 

 Breyer, about could we sample from an individual 
 outfall, could we show more?  The problem with that is 
 that it would prove nothing.  The Petitioner has said, 
 just sample from one outfall, one of our outfalls.  We 
alleged 140 violations for a dozen different pollutants 
 over a 5-year period.  So sampling from a single outfall 
 as an evidentiary matter would be utterly meaningless. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Couldn't you get some 

 expert who understands --

MR. COLANGELO:  Well, we did, Your Honor, in 

 district court as an alternative theory have an expert 
 who said all of this came from them.  The district court 
 did not address that and we didn't appeal.  The appeal 
 was limited just to this legal issue. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand why you

 didn't cross-appeal on -- on this theory that -- that 
 the lower court rejected. 

 MR. COLANGELO:  Because, Your Honor, we were 

 satisfied with the judgment; and that's the rule.  A 
respondent who is satisfied does not need to 
 cross-appeal, unless it is --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I didn't say you need to. 
 I didn't say you needed to.  But I -- I would normally 
 have done it, just to be sure I had that arrow in my 
quiver and that it would not be argued, as it will be 
 here, that this would be expanding the judgment below. 
 MR. COLANGELO:  And the reason it would not 

 be expanding the judgment below is that we are on the 
 opposite side of what happened in Kent.  To rule in our 
favor on this argument would just leave untouched two 
 claims on which we didn't prevail. 

 We'd get no further relief on those.  It's 
 like two co-plaintiffs in district court who both lose 
 identical claims.  One appeals, and the other doesn't. 
The one who appeals wins a reversal.  That creates an 
 inconsistency, two similarly situated plaintiffs, one 
 has a valid claim, one no longer does.  But that's the 
 consequence of our failing to cross-petition. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do we have -- I just 

don't remember now.  Do we have a circuit split on thi

 issue of whether a permit in a situation like this would 
 impose liability on all permittees? 

 MR. COLANGELO:  No.  No.  There is no â€“ I 

 don't know of any other circuit court who has 
addressed -- that has addressed this question. 

 And let me speak to -- to the issue of 

 additional monitoring, putting the burden on plaintiffs 
 to conduct additional monitoring.  The problem is it 
 creates a complicated factual dispute for district 
courts resolve -- to resolve, when that was exactly what 
 Congress wanted to eliminate. 

 When Congress adopted this permit program in 

 the Clean Water Act and then amended it to bring 
 municipal stormwater discharges under the program, 
Congress said, we do not want district courts to be the 
 forum for sorting out all of these complicated factual 
 issues. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I see.  What do you think 
 of the government's point?  They are telling us, just 
write what you usually write, and then you can go make 
 all your arguments, see what they do.  Does that satisfy 
 you? 

 MR. COLANGELO:  Your Honor, we would be most 

 satisfied with an affirmance on the grounds we have 
presented.  If the Court vacates, we would be satisfied

 with that, too, and then we would go back to the

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if this panel found â€“ 

 found for you on the ground that they used, they will 
surely find for you on this other ground, which --

 (Laughter.) 
 MR. COLANGELO:  Yes.  We expect they would.

 inkling of plausibility.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. COATES:  Thank you, Your Honor. 
 To the cross-appeal issue, the cases that we 

 cite talk about the Court's prudential limitation on 
 deciding questions that are not preserved by 
cross-petition.  And I depart from my learned opponent, 
 Mr. Colangelo, on that point as to what the Court's 
 cases say.  We cite the Northwest Airlines v. County of 
 Kent case, and that is a case where, in fact, the 
 respondent was not seeking to change the judgment below. 
They did not cross-petition.  They were just trying to

 keep what they had. 

Official 

 And the Court said we are not going to reach 
 that issue because, if we buy the fact that there is in 
 fact no private right of action, the effect of that is 
to essentially change the underlying judgment --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Let me ask a quick 

 question. 

 MR. COATES:  Sure. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Does it satisfy you if we 

just write in the judgment what you -- we usually write, 
 and then you all can argue what it means below?  What 
 about that?  Does that satisfy?  Or do you want us to 
 write something special? 
 (Laughter.) 
MR. COATES:  It -- it's -- it's acceptable 
 because a reversal is always better than an affirmance. 
 But talking about what the Court decides and what's left 
 in the case, I think it is a case where the Court 
 reviews what the Ninth Circuit actually decided, what is 
actually before it, and what is properly remaining in 
 the case because we don't believe the cross-appeal issue 
 is here. 

 And that leads, I think, to reversing the 

 Ninth Circuit because the district is entitled to 
summary judgment on these two river claims.  And I think

 that is all that's left in the case. 

 And I call the Court's attention to another 

 case we cited on the cross-appeal issue.  It's one of 
 the NLRB cases, the -- the Express Publication case. 
And it makes it very clear there, that the respondent 
 was just trying to hang on so much of what was good 
 about the order as he could keep and was not seeking to 
 change anything.  And, again, the Court said no. 

 It basically undermines the entire basis for 

the --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did we use our usual 

 language, and did it go back, and the -- and the court 
 of appeals considered --

 MR. COATES:  I think, in one of the cases, 

the Court --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- considered the issue we 

 had refused to consider? 

 MR. COATES:  In one of the cases, the Court 

 simply affirmed, and so it didn't go anywhere. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay. 
 MR. COATES:  But --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't we have two -- I 

 don't know that we do this all the time.  When we expect 
 them to keep the case and do something different, don't 
we usually vacate and remand, rather than reverse?

 MR. COATES:  Well, I do know that, in the 

 context of a lot of the Court's opinions, the Court will 
 specify that judgment be granted in terms of a party. 
 I know the qualified immunity cases, you 
find someone's entitled to qualified immunity, and it 
 comes up on a summary judgment, the reversal is -- to 
 the Ninth Circuit.  And I've seen both languages used, 
 but it's plain, from the text of the opinion, the 
 judgment is to be entered in favor of that party. 

And, again, I think that's appropriate here. 
 My opponent suggests and the government suggests, again, 
 that, let's go back to the Ninth Circuit and let them 
 consider this monitoring argument.  They considered it. 
 In fact, they even considered the use of contract terms 
that -- that they urged them to consider again. 

 It's already rejected that claim with 

 respect to these two rivers that are in front of the 
 Court.  It's rejected it with respect to Malibu Creek 
 and Santa Clara River, which is not in front of the 
Court.  They even accepted it with respect to an entire 
 different party with County of Los Angeles --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they might change their 

 mind now.  They might change their mind. 

 MR. COATES:  It would be a very odd judgment 
because you'd have two claims that are -- continue to be

 dismissed that are not properly before any court.  Those 
 close -- those are closed.  And you have another party 
 out of the case on the very ground that the Ninth 
 Circuit rejected in the initial opinion. 

A sort of remand for some consideration of 
 an issue that's already spoken on just doesn't seem to 
 make sense and invites the very sort of kind of 
 jurisdictional confusion that, I think, leads the Court, 
 for prudential reasons, not to consider these things 
unless there's a cross-petition. 

 I think that's why this is kind of a great 

 example of why prudential reasons say you should not 
 consider it. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I understand, 

and you do cite a lot of cases for that, but I can't 
 figure out what sense it makes.  I mean, if you're 
 willing to give up Santa Clara and Malibu, you're --
 you're safe there, and that's the only thing you've won. 
 Why does it -- how does that make sense? 

MR. COATES:  Well, the Court does it for two 

 reasons.  It does it as a prudential matter because it 
 does look odd to affirm on -- to make a decision in this 
 Court on a ground that essentially repudiates the lower 
 court decision.  It does it for prudential reasons. 

And, in fact, the case they cite, LeTulle,

 which basically says the Court has the jurisdiction to 
 do that -- when someone abandons the piecemeal claim --
 is cited only once in this context after that, and 
 that's in the United States v. ITT Continental Baking 
case, 420 U.S. 223, footnote 2. 

 And the court gives it a "but-see" for the 

 proposition that you have the jurisdiction to do it. 
 But then describes this exact situation and says, for 
 prudential reasons, we don't do it because it undermines 
our cert jurisdiction, particularly if resolution of 
 that issue is highly fact-specific -- the one they are 
 trying to bring up -- and it would really foreclose 
 having to even decide this cert issue because you 
 wouldn't get to it.
