 CHIEF JUSTICE  REHNQUIST:  We'll hear  argument 

4  next in No. 02-1603, Jeffrey A. Beard v. George E. Banks.

 Mr. Eisenberg. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD EISENBERG 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MR. EISENBERG:  Mr. Chief  Justice, and may  it 

9  please the Court: 

10

 At  his  trial in  1983,  George Banks'  team of 

11  three defense  lawyers presented 23  mitigation witnesses, 

12  including  three  forensic  psychiatrists,  his  mother, 

13  brother,  and co-workers,  a priest,  and  two nuns.  The 

14  trial court instructed the jury  that it must consider any 

15  mitigating evidence  unless it was unanimous  in rejecting 

16  it. 

17

 Now  Banks  claims  that  Mills v.  Maryland,  a 

18  ruling  of this  Court made  after the  completion  of his 

19  direct appeal, entitles him to  re-open his death sentence 

20  for  the killing of 13  people.  In  fact, Mills creates a 

21  new distinct rule  regulating the  manner of conducting  a 

22  death penalty hearing that is not applicable retroactively 

23  and that in any case  was reasonably applied by the  State 

24  courts attempting to interpret it. 

25

 The  primary  issue  in  this  case, though,  is 

3


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  whether  the  Mills  rule  which  prohibits  unanimity 

2  requirements at the  mitigation stage  was merely a  minor 

3  application of existing law dictated by prior precedent or 

4  whether  it's  instead  Teague-barred. 

Mills does  cite 

5  Lockett  v.  Ohio for  the  general proposition  that it's 

6  beyond  dispute that the sentencer, quote/unquote, may not 

7  be precluded from considering mitigation. 

8

 But before Mills, the sentencer,  quote/unquote, 

9  always  referred  to the  judge  or  the  jury,  never  to 

10  individual  jurors.  That  was a  leap made for  the first 

11  time  in Mills. 

That was  new.  Even with  a unanimity 

12  charge, although there wasn't  one in this case,  as we'll 

13  address,  a  jury  still considered  the  evidence  in the 

14  manner that juries historically have considered  evidence, 

15  that is  collaboratively.  Until Mills,  the Constitution 

16  had never  been read to  forbid unanimity as  to verdicts, 

17  whether general verdicts  or special  verdicts.  And  even 

18  since  Mills,  as this  Court  recently said  in  Jones v. 

19  United States, we have long been of the view that the very 

20  object of  the jury  system is  to secure  unanimity by  a 

21  comparison  of  views and  by  arguments among  the jurors 

22  themselves. 

23

 So the  question of jury unanimity,  we believe, 

24  remained open  not only after Lockett but  even within the 

25  understanding  of members  of this  Court at  the time  of 

4


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Mills  and  thereafter. 

In  fact,  in  McKoy  v.  North 

2  Carolina, decided 2  years after  Mills, four Justices  of 

3  the  Court  rejected  Lockett  as  supporting,  let  alone 

4  compelling, a rule against jury unanimity. 

5

 Now, whether the dissenters in McKoy can be said 

6  to  be  right  or  wrong about  the  meaning  of  Mills is 

7  irrelevant in this  Teague context.  The  question is that 

8  they believed that Mills, not to mention Lockett,  did not 

9  resolve the unanimity question presented here. 

10

 QUESTION: 

Mr.  Eisenberg,  tell 

--  

tell  us 

11  exactly what you mean by jury unanimity because, you know, 

12  most States  require jury unanimity in the -- in the final 

13  verdict. 

14

 MR. EISENBERG:  Excuse me, Your Honor,  yes.  I 

15  mean  only  at  the stage  of  finding  whether particular 

16  mitigating circumstances are present.  That is the -- the 

17  jury unanimity question that was decided in the  Mills and 

18  McKoy  cases,  as I've  said,  subject to  dispute, strong 

19  dispute, among the Court that continued even after Mills. 

20

 Because this is a Teague  case, the question, as 

21  I've  said, is not  whether Mills  was right or  McKoy was 

22  right  or  which side  can  be  better  defended now,  but 

23  whether  State court  judges reasonably  could have  known 

24  what the  outcome would  be.  And since  even within  the 

25  Court there was such continuing controversy on the matter, 

5


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  it cannot be said that State judges  reasonably could have 

2  known, and therefore the case is Teague-barred. 

3

 But that uncertainty continued even beyond McKoy 

4  because  in the next similar case before the Court, Walton 

5  v. Arizona,  the issue  was presented  on essentially  the 

6  same basis as  the Mills case had been.  The single hold­

7  out  juror scenario,  that  a single  juror  because of  a 

8  unanimity requirement in  Mills or  because, in Walton,  a 

9  preponderance  of  the  evidence  standard,  could  block 

10  consideration of mitigating evidence and thereby mandate a 

11  death penalty case. 

12

 QUESTION:  On -- on the  instructions in the red 

13  brief  at  page 8  and  then  at  page  9, there  are  two 

14  different  instructions  set  out. 

This  is  in  the 

15  respondent's brief.  And then  the jury form which has  to 

16  be checked is set out on pages 9 and 10.  In your view  is 

17  that  all  we  should  consider  when we  interpret  these 

18  instructions, or do you have some  additional instructions 

19  that you wish us to refer to? 

20

 MR. EISENBERG:  Your  Honor, I  think that  the 

21  instruction here was basically  the same throughout,  that 

22  the message as  to unanimity  regarding mitigation or  not 

23  was basically the same throughout  the instructions.  It's 

24  in the joint  appendix at page 21.  It's  repeated at page 

25  26, and we think embodied in the jury form -- I'm sorry -­

6


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  also at pages 66 and 67. 

2

 And  in  each  of  those  cases,  the  jury  was 

3  instructed  first  that  it  must  be  unanimous  to  find 

4  aggravation  or  no  mitigation  and  then  that  it  must 

5  unanimously  find  whether  any 

--  

find  aggravating 

6  circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances. 

7

 But,  of  course,  the  threshold  question  is 

8  whether the State courts could even have known  that there 

9  was such a thing as  a rule against unanimity, whether  or 

10  not unanimity was actually required  on the facts of  this 

11  case.  And the Walton case, as I've mentioned, is relevant 

12  to that question because  in Walton the same  argument was 

13  at issue,  and  the  argument  was  that  because  of  the 

14  preponderance of the evidence  standard, a hold-out  juror 

15  or even really 12 hold-out  jurors, so to speak, could  be 

16  somewhat persuaded by mitigating  evidence, could think it 

17  significant, but not quite past the tipping point required 

18  by the preponderance  standard and  yet be precluded  from 

19  considering that evidence  at all  in the weighing  stage. 

20  And yet, the defendant lost that argument in Walton. 

21

 And again,  the relevance for Teague purposes is 

22  to  leave the State  courts in  the position of  trying to 

23  determine before  Walton, before  McKoy, before  Mills, in 

24  this case in  1983 that the  Eighth Amendment through  the 

25  Lockett  case  somehow  precluded  the  establishment  of 

7


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  unanimity. 

2

 QUESTION:  Well, with  Lockett -- with Lockett 

3  they -- what Lockett says is that the sentencer cannot be 

4  precluded from  considering  as a  mitigating  factor  any 

5  aspect  of  the  defendant's character  or  record  or any 

6  circumstance. 

7

 Now,  one  thing that  could  have meant  -- one 

8  thing  -- is that  you cannot  execute a person  unless 12 

9  people  think  that  not  only  that  crime  is  unusually 

10  terrible 

--  

that's  aggravating 

--  

but  also  that  it 

11  outweighs in this person's  life any good things he  wants 

12  to bring in.  That's his character.  And 12 people have to 

13  come  to that ultimate  judgment.  Now, if that's  so, 12 

14  people have to  come to that ultimate  judgment, 12 people 

15  have not  come to that ultimate  judgment when in  fact 11 

16  would let him  off, but one  blocks it  by saying I  don't 

17  agree that  this is the  mitigating circumstance.  So  if 

18  that's  what Lockett means, it  would be obvious that that 

19  wouldn't satisfy it. 

20

21

 MR. EISENBERG:  Well -­

 QUESTION:  Well, what else could Lockett mean is 

22  my question. 

23

24

 MR. EISENBERG:  Lockett -- Lockett -­

 QUESTION: 

What else  could Lockett  mean that 

25  would make sense in the context of the death penalty?  And 

8


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  you'll have a lot of answers, but I want to know what they 

2  are. 

3

4

5

 MR. EISENBERG:  Excuse me, Justice Breyer. 

 QUESTION:  Yes. 

 MR. EISENBERG:  It -- what it also  could have 

6  made sense is  that the jury as a  whole in the historical 

7  manner of juries had to consider the evidence, and there's 

8  no doubt that it could have meant the  interpretation that 

9  you suggest.  And we know that because Mills held that and 

10  McKoy held that.  So, of course, it could have meant that. 

11  But  the  fact  that  it could  have  meant  that  and was 

12  eventually held to  mean that  over continuing dissent  by 

13  the Court is not -- does not resolve the Teague question. 

14

 QUESTION:  No, it  doesn't, but  I want  you to 

15  tell me precisely  in a reasonable way -- and I'm going to 

16  wonder if that's  -- if it is  reasonable or not.  That's 

17  going to be the  issue -- what  other thing it might  have 

18  meant.  And I  -- I'll  draw here  on the concurrence  in 

19  Penry where the statement is made it's  obvious it's meant 

20  what I just said it meant because anything else would have 

21  been  arbitrary  in  the  context  of  our  arbitrariness 

22  jurisprudence. 

23

24

 MR. EISENBERG:  Well -­

 QUESTION:  So -- so you tell me -- I understand 

25  the words,  well, historical, et cetera, but I want to pin 

9

1  you down more than that. 

2

 MR. EISENBERG:  Yes,  Your Honor.  Let me  speak 

3  first to Penry. 

4

 Penry  did  not  involve  this  question  of 

5  unanimity, and the  reason I believe that  the opinion was 

6  taken that  it was obviously an application  of Lockett is 

7  because it involved very much the same kind of categorical 

8  question  that was  presented  in Lockett.  In  the Penry 

9  case, there were  three questions  before the jury,  three 

10  mitigating categories given  to the  jury.  The  defendant 

11  said,  I  have some  evidence  that doesn't  strictly fall 

12  within one of those  three categories.  In  Lockett, there 

13  were  three  categories  of  mitigation  given  to  the 

14  sentencer, and the defendant said,  I have some categories 

15  of  mitigation  that  don't  fall  within  those  three 

16  categories that my  sentencer was limited to.  That's why 

17  Penry is a straightforward Lockett case. 

18

 QUESTION: 

But  I'm  thinking  of  Penry's 

19  commentary  about Mills or  whatever.  I may  -- I may get 

20  these  cases mixed  up,  but  I  thought  that  Mills  was 

21  characterized as a case that follows obviously -­

22

23

24

 MR. EISENBERG:  Your Honor, I --

 QUESTION:  -- from Lockett -­

 MR.  EISENBERG:  I  could be  wrong, but I  -- I 

25  remember no  such statement  from any  of the  opinions in 

10


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Penry or  really in any other  case except for  the -- the 

2  Mills and  McKoy cases where  the subject was  in dispute. 

3  So that to  the extent it  was obvious to some  members of 

4  the Court, it was far from obvious to other members of the 

5  Court, and therefore certainly couldn't have been  obvious 

6  to the State court judges who were expected to know before 

7  either of those cases were decided. 

8

 QUESTION:  Mr. Eisenberg, the court  of appeals 

9  has changed its mind in this area, has it not? 

10

 MR. EISENBERG:  That is certainly our view, Your 

11  Honor, and  that is very  relevant to the  second question 

12  presented here, which  is whether, even assuming  that the 

13  Mills  rule could be applied retroactively, there was a -­

14  an  unreasonable  application of  that  rule by  the State 

15  court. 

16

 Now,  originally this  question came  before the 

17  Third Circuit Court of Appeals in 1991 in  the Zettlemoyer 

18  case. 

It  was  the  same  type  of  instruction  that's 

19  presented  here  that  tracked  the  structure  of  the 

20  Pennsylvania  sentencing  statute. 

And  the  court  of 

21  appeals, the  Third Circuit  Court of  Appeals, said  that 

22  that instruction was  not inconsistent with Mills,  and it 

23  said  it  was  not  inconsistent  with  Mills  because  an 

24  instruction that requires unanimity as  to aggravation but 

25  doesn't  mention  unanimity  as to  mitigation  is  not an 

11


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  instruction that requires unanimity as to both.  It's the 

2  same theory  that we have been presenting in this case all 

3  along. 

4

 In the next  case that came up before  the Third 

5  Circuit in  1997 in Frey, the Third Circuit held, no, that 

6  kind of instruction, with all the words and proximities at 

7  issue there, did violate Mills. 

8

 QUESTION:  Did it -- did it treat the Frey case 

9  as overruling its earlier case? 

10

 MR.  EISENBERG: 

It's 

--  

it  treated  it  as 

11  distinguishing, Your Honor, but that -- Mr. Chief Justice, 

12  but  we  think  that that's  irrelevant  for  our purposes 

13  because  the  Frey case  was  a pre-AEDPA  case, certainly 

14  wasn't applying a  deference standard.  And  the Frey case 

15  not only wasn't applying the  deference standard, but went 

16  so far as to characterize the State court's interpretation 

17  of its instruction in these capital cases as plausible. 

18

 Now,  whether 

or 

not  plausible 

means 

19  reasonable -­

20

21

22

 QUESTION:  Could I interrupt? 

 MR. EISENBERG:  Excuse me. 

 QUESTION: 

May  I  interrupt  with  just  one 

23  question?  Because I'm -- I'm a little rusty on just what 

24  the sequence of opinions  was.  And I -- I  think you have 

25  one  impression  of  the  case  if  you  just  read  the 

12


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  instructions  because  I think  you've  got a  very strong 

2  argument on the instructions. 

3

 I get a different impression of  the case when I 

4  look at the jury form,  the verdict form, which in  effect 

5  requires a check to show the jury acting unanimously.  And 

6  my  question is at  the first  go-round, did the  court of 

7  appeals actually focus on  the -- the jury form as well as 

8  the instructions? 

9

 MR.  EISENBERG:  The  court  of appeals  in the 

10  Zettlemoyer case, the first one in 1991,  focused on both, 

11  Your Honor. 

12

13

 QUESTION:  It did. 

 MR. EISENBERG:  And the court of appeals  -- it 

14  was faced  with the 

--  

the -- I believe  that the  page 

15  exactly is  923 F.2d at 308.  It's cited  in our -- in our 

16  brief.  The court of  appeals specifically quoted both the 

17  charge and  the verdict form,  and we  would suggest  that 

18  both  were legally  parallel to  the charge  and  the form 

19  involved in this case.  And the court  made its comment in 

20  regard to both of those provisions. 

21

 QUESTION:  Because  the jury  form does seem  to 

22  imply a concept  of unanimity because they got  to require 

23  -- you know, the form definitely refers to unanimity. 

24

 MR.  EISENBERG: 

Well,  the  form  refers  to 

25  unanimity in  exactly the same way that the charge does, I 

13


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  would submit, Justice  Stevens, because  it says, we,  the 

2  jury,  unanimously sentence  the  defendant  in the  above 

3  matter, and then you have two options, just as the statute 

4  in Pennsylvania and  just as the judge's charge  laid out. 

5  We unanimously sentence the defendant in the above matter, 

6  and it says to at least -- we -- we, the jury, unanimously 

7  sentence the  defendant in  the above  matter to  death or 

8  life  imprisonment. 

We,  the  jury 

--  

have you  found 

9  unanimously,  and  then the  two  options.  At  least one 

10  aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance or 

11  -- and there's  a big or in the middle of the verdict form 

12  -- or one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh 

13  any mitigating circumstances.  So -­

14

 QUESTION:  Yes, but -- but the key point is that 

15  in the mitigating  circumstances are, there are  one, two, 

16  three options.  They just checked one. 

17

 MR.  EISENBERG:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  There are 

18  blanks next to the mitigating circumstances,  but frankly, 

19  we  still  have  those  blanks  next  to  mitigating 

20  circumstances now after Mills, after it's been changed, in 

21  order to make it perfectly explicit that any one juror can 

22  vote for mitigation. 

23

 QUESTION:  And see, it  isn't explicit here, and 

24  the check seems to me to indicate that they were unanimous 

25  on mitigating circumstance number 1,  but they were not on 

14


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  the others. 

2

3

 MR. EISENBERG:  Well -­

 QUESTION:  And so it seems very likely that some 

4  of the jurors may have  considered -- felt they could  not 

5  consider mitigating circumstance 2 or 3. 

6

 MR. EISENBERG:  Your Honor, two things.  First 

7  of all, the reason that there are checks there is that the 

8  jury,  under the  Pennsylvania  structure, is  essentially 

9  required to  give  a  second look  at  mitigation  in  the 

10  weighing charge,  even if some of those jurors may have -­

11  even if  the jurors  may have  been in  dispute about  the 

12  existence of those mitigating circumstances.  So in order 

13  to apply the first phase of the instructions, they have to 

14  decide whether all of them find no mitigation.  If  all of 

15  them don't find the absence of mitigation, then they go to 

16  the second stage, and at that point, they are all required 

17  to  look at  mitigation,  even if  they  might have  voted 

18  against  it the first time.  So the statute appropriately 

19  tracks  the  kind  of  mitigation  that  all of  them  are 

20  required to consider in the weighing process. 

21

 The second point  I want to make,  however, Your 

22  Honor, is that, of course, this is not the first time that 

23  a verdict form like this and an instruction like this have 

24  been looked at.  And I  must emphasize this is a deference 

25  case under section 2254. 

15

1

 As I explained, the Third Circuit in 1991 looked 

2  at a verdict  form like this and  said, no, this is  not a 

3  violation  of  Mills.  Other  circuits around  the United 

4  States  have  consistently  held  that  this  kind  of 

5  instruction and verdict form are not a violation of Mills. 

6  Where  the 

--  

where  the  instruction and  verdict  form 

7  explicitly require unanimity as  to aggravation but  don't 

8  explicitly  require  unanimity  as  to  mitigation,  then 

9  there's no violation of Mills.  And that's -­

10

 QUESTION:  And so -- so  if in fact we  have 12 

11  jurors and all 12 believe that this person was awarded the 

12  Congressional Medal of  Honor and  11 of  them think  that 

13  means he  shouldn't get death, but  one of them  thinks it 

14  isn't that much  of an offsetting factor,  on your reading 

15  of  this, the  -- they could  conclude after  Lockett that 

16  it's death because we don't have unanimity on whether that 

17  Congressional Medal offsets the horrible crime. 

18

 MR. EISENBERG:  Justice Breyer, for  purposes of 

19  the  second question  here,  the deference  question,  our 

20  argument  is that that is not the case, that the jury here 

21  was  not permitted to  vote for  death or not  required to 

22  vote for death automatically merely  because they were not 

23  unanimous  in  failing  to  find  a  particular  piece  of 

24  mitigation. 

25

 QUESTION:  So if they  had been -- because let's

--  

I -- I was reading  the jury form  differently, and I 

2  might be wrong.  I'll go back to that. 

3

 But take my hypothetical  and I want to  go back 

4  to  the  retroactivity  question. 

And on  that,  you're 

5  thinking, well,  before Mills  a State  that came  to that 

6  conclusion would not be violating the Constitution. 

7

 MR. EISENBERG:  What I would say, Your Honor, is 

8  that before  Mills a State  that came  to that  conclusion 

9  would  not  have acted  unreasonably  for purposes  of the 

10  Teague standard. 

11

12

 QUESTION:  Yes, all right. 

 Now, suppose  in Mills -- suppose you're right. 

13  And now  in Mills you would  say, well, that's  not right, 

14  and the reason that's not right is because the role of the 

15  juror is not simply to find  the facts, but also to  weigh 

16  the significance of the mitigating fact against the horror 

17  of the crime.  That's what Mills then  on that view would 

18  have said. 

19

 Well, why isn't that terribly important?  I.e., 

20  that is a radical shift in the role of the juror from what 

21  was previously viewed  as simply finding  facts, now to  a 

22  person who is going to make the ultimate weighing question 

23  in  his own  mind in  respect to  life  and death  and the 

24  person's career. 

25

 MR. EISENBERG:  Well, Your Honor, we think it is

 MR. EISENBERG:  Well, that's -­

 QUESTION:  I'm -- I'm saying -­

 MR. EISENBERG:  -- to the same exception. 

 QUESTION:

a  watershed rule. 

Is  it  a 

8  watershed rule? 

9

 MR. EISENBERG:  Yes, yes.  Yes, Your Honor, and 

10  the answer to that is -­

11

 QUESTION:  If it is  a watershed rule,  then of 

12  course it's retroactive. 

13

 MR. EISENBERG:  Then  answer to  that is,  Your 

14  Honor, that  the fact  that  a rule  is new  enough to  be 

15  Teague-barred is hardly enough to make it -- render it -­

16

17

 QUESTION:  In other words, it's not that -­

 MR. EISENBERG:  -- a  second Teague  exception. 

18  In fact, Your  Honor, this Court has on numerous occasions 

19  held that  rules, including Lockett-based  rules, are  not 

20  new, and yet not a single one of them has  been held to be 

21  a second  exception.  The Court  has made clear  that that 

22  category is exceedingly narrow,  that such exceptions will 

23  be very rare, and surely in every other case where a -- an 

24  important Lockett-based rule  has been announced that  has 

25  been found  new for Teague purposes, the Court has gone on 

18


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  to  reject second exception  status here.  In  fact, even 

2  Banks in  his brief here  does not argue  second exception 

3  status for the Mills rule. 

4

 In further comment on the Mills rule, however, I 

5  would -- I would like to -- on the Teague bar, Your Honor, 

6  I  would like to  point out,  as I've mentioned,  that the 

7  Court has  previously considered Lockett-based  claims for 

8  Teague  purposes.  In  Simmons, for  example, and  in the 

9  Caldwell  case,  the  Court established  rules  that  were 

10  explicitly based on  Lockett concerning -- concerning  the 

11  jury's consideration  of evidence at  the -- at  a capital 

12  sentencing hearing.  And yet, in both of those cases, even 

13  though I would suggest they were really smaller leaps from 

14  Lockett than Mills was, the Court has held that those were 

15  new rules that were not entitled either to old rule status 

16  or  to  second exception  status.  And  as  in the  cases 

17  holding  that  Simmons  and Caldwell  were  new  rules, we 

18  believe the Court should hold that Teague is a new rule. 

19

 Now,  to  return  to  the  question 

--  

to  the 

20  deference question, which -­

21

22

 QUESTION:  You mean that Teague is a new rule. 

 MR. EISENBERG:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  That's 

23  Mills is a new rule. 

24

25

 QUESTION:  Mills is. 

 MR. EISENBERG:  Thank you.

1

 To return to the  deference question, the second 

2  question presented,  as I  was saying,  the Third  Circuit 

3  held that the  State court's interpretation, the  one that 

4  was  victorious  here  in  State  court,  the  same 

5  interpretation based  on the same  State court precedents, 

6  was  plausible. 

And  whether  or  not  plausible  means 

7  reasonable, it surely does not mean unreasonable. 

8

 And yet, in the  first post-AEDPA case involving 

9  Mills that  came along in the Third Circuit, this one, the 

10  Third  Circuit  held  without  discussion  of  either  its 

11  original 1991  ruling that had  upheld this charge  or any 

12  discussion  of  its 1997  ruling that  had noted  that the 

13  contrary  construction  was  not unreasonable,  the  Third 

14  Circuit held in  this case that no  court could reasonably 

15  have applied Mills in the way that the State court did. 

16

 And  the 

--  

the  reason  that  all  the  other 

17  circuits have disagreed with the Third Circuit on that and 

18  that  the Third  Circuit itself  has come  to  a different 

19  position on that gets back  to Mills itself because  Mills 

20  was not the kind of charge that was involved in this case. 

21  In Mills, the  charge explicitly required  the jury to  be 

22  unanimous in order to find the presence of mitigation. 

23

 QUESTION: 

Just  to  get  back a  minute,  Mr. 

24  Eisenberg, this case was decided before Mills was decided. 

25  Right? 

20

1

 MR.  EISENBERG: 

The  direct  appeal  in  this 

2  case -­

3

4

 QUESTION:  Yes, the direct appeal. 

 MR.  EISENBERG: 

-- was  completed,  including 

5  denial  of  certiorari  by this  Court,  before  Mills was 

6  decided.  Yes, Your Honor. 

7

 And in the Mills case,  the Court was faced with 

8  a verdict form which explicitly required unanimity to find 

9  -- to mark yes for mitigation and explicitly required that 

10  only those mitigating circumstances marked yes -- that is, 

11  unanimously  marked  yes  -- could  be  considered  at the 

12  weighing stage. 

13

 Now,  contrast that  in both respects  with what 

14  happened here.  There was  no instruction on unanimity for 

15  yeses.  There was no instruction that only unanimous yeses 

16  could be  weighed.  Instead,  we have only  an instruction 

17  requiring unanimity for no votes on mitigation. 

18

 And I  think  that there's  a further  important 

19  point about the Mills case. 

20

 QUESTION:  But, Mr. Eisenberg, you would concede 

21  that  those 

--  

those  questions  are 

--  

are  certainly 

22  ambiguous.  The -- Pennsylvania made the  change just to 

23  clarify that  it was the individual  juror and not  the -­

24  the group.  You can look at those and  conclude that just 

25  like you  had to find  the aggravated unanimously,  so you 

21


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  had to  find  each mitigating  unanimously.  The form  is 

2  certainly susceptible to that reading. 

3

 MR.  EISENBERG: 

Well,  Your  Honor,  I  would 

4  suggest  that if it  is susceptible  to such a  reading at 

5  all, it  is far from the  primary meaning, and  the reason 

6  for that is really just the rules of English grammar.  The 

7  two  stages  of  the  process that  are  laid  out  in the 

8  instruction  in  question  are  not  parallel.  They  are 

9  dramatically different.  So the first stage says, you must 

10  be unanimous in  finding aggravating  circumstances or  no 

11  mitigating circumstances.  And there's no question,  as a 

12  matter  of  grammar, that  there's only  one verb  in that 

13  sentence with  two objects, aggravating  circumstances and 

14  no mitigating circumstances.  The verb, unanimously finds, 

15  must apply to both nouns. 

16

 In  the second  sentence,  we  have a  different 

17  structure.  Unanimously find -­

18

 QUESTION:  Mr.  Eisenberg, if you -- if you were 

19  -- if you were a -- a defense lawyer and you knew that the 

20  -- the law was  that each juror could individually  decide 

21  the mitigators and  you were confronted  with a form  like 

22  this, would you object? 

23

 MR. EISENBERG:  Well, Your  Honor, had the Mills 

24  rule already  been decided,  I think  somebody might  have 

25  raised an objection.  It may or may not have succeeded but 

22


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  certainly  had  an  objection  been  able  to  be  made 

2  contemporaneously, we wouldn't have  to have worried about 

3  error being built into the trial and the matter could have 

4  been handled expeditiously. 

5

 That's why we have changed our verdict form, not 

6  because Pennsylvania has changed its understanding of what 

7  has always been  the structure of its  sentencing process, 

8  but because  once Mills was  decided, once the  matter was 

9  constitutionalized, it became certainly wise for the court 

10  to attempt to avoid further litigation on  the question by 

11  making it explicit. 

12

 QUESTION:  Before  it was just  the law and  not 

13  constitutional, it was all right to be -- to be ambiguous, 

14  but once  it was constitutional, it had  to be clear?  I'm 

15  not following. 

16

 MR. EISENBERG:  Well, our  -- our argument, Your 

17  Honor, is  that the  fact that  they changed  the form  in 

18  response  to  a  new  rule  is  not  evidence  that  they 

19  previously read  their  statute in  a different  way.  In 

20  fact, the  State supreme court has always said that it has 

21  always read the  statute to require  unanimity only as  to 

22  the absence, to the rejection of mitigation and not to the 

23  finding of any particular mitigation. 

24

 But  in  reference to  your  question concerning 

25  arguments of  counsel, in fact,  there was no  argument of 

23


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  counsel from  either side  here that  the jury  had to  be 

2  unanimous about  mitigation.  In the same manner that Your 

3  Honor  has  suggested, presumably  the prosecutor,  had he 

4  believed  that  the  jury  had  to  be  unanimous  about 

5  mitigation, it  would have been to his advantage to say so 

6  and to argue to the jury, all 12 of you have to find these 

7  before you can consider them.  He didn't say anything like 

8  that. 

9

 And in fact, here's what the defense lawyer said 

10  in volume  6 of  the trial  transcript at  pages 2300  and 

11  2301.  He wasn't,  I believe,  specifically referring  to 

12  mitigation, but he said, quote, think individually, decide 

13  this individually.  All it takes is one person to save his 

14  life. 

15

 Now, in light  of the manner  in which the  case 

16  was argued to the jury and in light of the manner in which 

17  the judge  presented the charge  and laid out  the verdict 

18  form, we believe that the jury would not have -- cannot be 

19  assumed  to have come  to the  wrong conclusion  here, and 

20  surely that  the State court and, as I've mentioned, every 

21  Federal circuit  court looking at similar instructions and 

22  verdict  forms,  could  not  be  said  to  have  acted 

23  unreasonably in finding the absence of a Mills violation. 

24

 Thank you.  If there are no  further questions, 

25  now I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.

6  Court: 

 QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Eisenberg. 

 Mr. Flora, we'll hear from you. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALBERT J. FLORA, JR. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 MR. FLORA:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the 

7

 Lockett and  Eddings  established a  fundamental 

8  principle  which basically  provides  that  a State  which 

9  creates  any  barrier  which precludes  a  sentencer  from 

10  giving full consideration  and full  effect to  mitigating 

11  evidence relating to a person's character, background, and 

12  circumstances  of  the  offense  is  constitutionally 

13  impermissible. 

14

 When we look at Mills  and take into account the 

15  decision in McKoy, the unanimity  instruction in Mills, in 

16  a weighing State  such as Pennsylvania, essentially  was a 

17  different type of  barrier which precluded jurors  to give 

18  effect to mitigating  evidence.  In a  non-weighing State, 

19  the unanimity  requirement would probably  be appropriate, 

20  but in  a weighing State, what  happens is a  single juror 

21  can say  to other  11 jurors,  I don't  believe that  this 

22  particular  piece  of  evidence  satisfies  a  mitigating 

23  circumstance,  and that  single juror  can preclude  those 

24  other 11 jurors from giving effect. 

25

 QUESTION: 

That might  have  been, Mr.  -- Mr. 

25


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  Flora, the logical extension of  Lockett, but to say  that 

2  Lockett  itself compelled  or  directed  that extension  I 

3  think is quite a stretch. 

4

 MR. FLORA:  Justice Ginsburg, I think  when you 

5  look back  at the legal landscape  over a period  of time, 

6  going back from Hitchcock, to Skipper, to Eddings, in  all 

7  of those  cases, the Court  dealt with different  types of 

8  barriers. 

The  Court  dealt  with different  pieces  of 

9  factual evidence relating to  character and background and 

10  circumstances of the offense. 

11

 When the Lockett rule was initially announced by 

12  a plurality  of the Court, the Court could not perceive in 

13  the future every  different type of barrier that  may come 

14  about, and  so what happened over  a period of  time, when 

15  you took the  Lockett rule, you were  essentially applying 

16  it to a variety of  factual different situations, and each 

17  time  the Court would look at  a particular barrier, which 

18  it had not perceived  in the past, and  if it precluded  a 

19  juror or a jury from giving effect to mitigating evidence, 

20  it  struck down  that  barrier.  And  that's where  we're 

21  coming from here. 

22

 So when  we say that it is a stretch of Lockett, 

23  I don't believe so.  I think it is a  logical consequence 

24  of Lockett.  I think  it is  dictated by Lockett  and the 

25  cases that followed after that.

1

 QUESTION:  Does it -- does it  mean nothing that 

2  this Court was so sharply divided and that you really have 

3  just an opinion?  The  lead opinion is labeled opinion  of 

4  the  Court, but Justice  White disassociated  himself from 

5  the reading.  He -- he had a  much narrower view  of the 

6  case. 

7

 MR.  FLORA:  If we look at  Mills and if we look 

8  at  the  dissent,  in  looking  at  the  dissent,  my 

9  interpretation  was  that  the  issue  was  over  how  a 

10  reasonable  juror would  have  interpreted the  particular 

11  instructions in  that  case.  I did  not  glean from  the 

12  dissent that  they thought a  unanimity requirement  would 

13  not constitute a barrier to a jury or jurors giving effect 

14  to mitigating evidence. 

15

 If you look  at McKoy -- and  I think this  is a 

16  question that  Justice Breyer had posed about a case -- in 

17  McKoy at 494  U.S. at 438, the Court  says in the majority 

18  opinion,  we  reason  that allowing  a  hold-out  juror to 

19  prevent  the  other  jurors  from  considering  mitigating 

20  evidence  violated the principle established in Lockett v. 

21  Ohio, that a  sentencer may not  be precluded from  giving 

22  effect to all mitigating evidence. 

23

 QUESTION:  Yes, but Lockett  didn't put it quite 

24  that  way, did it?  I  mean, frequently a  later decision 

25  will kind  of characterize  an earlier  decision in  a way 

27


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  that tends to support the later decision. 

2

 MR. FLORA:  That is correct.  I -- I would agree 

3  to a point.  If we look  at Lockett, Lockett did  not say 

4  that  an  evidentiary  ruling  which  precluded  the 

5  consideration or giving effect to mitigating evidence  was 

6  constitutionally prohibited. 

7

 QUESTION:  It said that the -- it said the court 

8  had to  admit any  evidence dealing  with the  defendant's 

9  character. 

10

 MR. FLORA:  That is correct, but what I'm saying 

11  is when you look back at Lockett, at the  time Lockett was 

12  decided, I don't think  the Court could -- could envision 

13  the  various types of  barriers that a  State could create 

14  which would  preclude a  sentencer from  giving effect  to 

15  mitigating evidence.  So  each  time a  barrier came  up, 

16  whether it was in Eddings or Skipper or Hitchcock -­

17

 QUESTION: 

But what  happened  in  Lockett was 

18  quite  different  than what  was  involved in  Mills.  In 

19  Lockett,  evidence  was offered  to  be considered  by the 

20  jury.  The  court said, no, that's not what we think of as 

21  mitigating evidence.  And  our Court  said, any  evidence 

22  bearing  on the  defendant's character  is admissible  for 

23  consideration by the jury.  Now, that's a long step  from 

24  the way you describe Mills. 

25

 MR.  FLORA: 

The  way  I  describe  Mills  is 

28


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  essentially  again  that  in  order  to  give  effect  to 

2  mitigating evidence, you simply  cannot have a requirement 

3  which  allows  one juror  to  preclude the  other  11 from 

4  giving that effect.  And it's my position that that is -­

5  that concept is dictated by the Lockett rule. 

6

 QUESTION:  If there's doubt  about that, I mean, 

7  one might  say you  would prevail  on that  argument in  a 

8  debate, but Teague requires more, doesn't it? 

9

 MR.  FLORA:  There is  language as to whether if 

10  there is  a  reasonable debate  amongst the  minds of  the 

11  jurors.  The problem with  that concept, when you look  at 

12  the  history  of  capital  jurisprudence  since  Furman on 

13  forward, I can only think  of probably two cases in  which 

14  this  Court has  been unanimous  in its  decision, one  of 

15  which was Hitchcock  v. Dugger.  If  we say that  the rule 

16  upon which a defendant seeks to rely is a new rule,  if so 

17  much as one Justice disagrees, I don't think we could ever 

18  have then a rule that would be based on precedent.  That's 

19  the problem I have. 

20

 QUESTION:  Does  it make any difference  if it's 

21  four Justices, as it was in McKoy, do you think? 

22

 MR.  FLORA: 

I don't  think  you  can honestly 

23  quantitate it  -- put a quantitative amount to it.  I just 

24  think that -­

25

 QUESTION:  Does it make  any difference that the

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  dissenters say  Lockett didn't  remotely support  the rule 

2  that a mitigator found by only one juror controls? 

3

4

 MR. FLORA:  I think -- that's a tough question. 

 QUESTION:  But that is what -- what was said in 

5  McKoy by the dissenters. 

6

 MR. FLORA:  That is what  was said in  McKoy by 

7  the dissenters, but  the majority in McKoy  disagreed with 

8  that. 

9

 QUESTION: 

Would it  be  all right,  let's say 

10  today after Mills, for a  trial judge to instruct a  jury, 

11  ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is a case of utmost 

12  gravity from the standpoint  of both the defendant  and -­

13  and the families of the victims?  And your verdict will be 

14  most valuable  if you are  unanimous as to  mitigating and 

15  aggravating  factors. 

You  should  not  surrender  your 

16  individual views.  If you  cannot come to that conclusion, 

17  then I'll  give you further  instructions.  Could  a judge 

18  say that?  Would that serve a purpose? 

19

 MR. FLORA:  A judge could not say that in light 

20  of Mills.  I think, however -­

21

22

 QUESTION:  It's too dangerous? 

 MR. FLORA:  -- especially  in a weighing  State 

23  because you're talking about unanimously find  aggravating 

24  circumstances.  Then you also  used the phrase unanimously 

25  find mitigating circumstances, and that's the problem that

2

 I think clearly a  court can give guidance to  a 

3  jury in the  consideration and  weighing of evidence,  and 

4  quite frankly, that happens all the time. 

5

 QUESTION:  Because it seems to me that what I've 

6  said is  right, that if they are unanimous on all factors, 

7  that that's  -- that's the  jury functioning at  its best. 

8  And you would give further instructions in the  event that 

9  the jurors cannot surrender -- should not surrender their 

10  individual views on mitigation, and  if that's the way  it 

11  has to  come out, fine.  But I want you to try to do this. 

12  You think that would be error? 

13

 MR. FLORA: 

If you  tell the  jury  to try  to 

14  unanimously  find  all  of  the  mitigating  factors,  the 

15  problem I see with that is what happens if they don't.  In 

16  Pennsylvania there  is no remedy if there is a deadlock on 

17  the finding of a mitigating factor. 

18

 QUESTION:  Well, of course, my  hypothetical was 

19  half -- half completed, and then we'd have to fill in what 

20  would happen and I -- I didn't bother to do  that.  But it 

21  does seem  to me  that the  instruction I  suggest in  the 

22  first instance  is -- is valuable and  also reflects  the 

23  understanding at least pre-Mills that  -- that many people 

24  in the legal system had as to the way the jury functions. 

25

 MR. FLORA:  It was an understanding  of the way

1  the jury functions pre-Mills.  I would agree there, but in 

2  the  penalty  phase,  in  taking a  look  at  the  way the 

3  unanimity requirement would  operate in that phase,  it is 

4  very different -­

5

 QUESTION:  Well, I -- I think for your case you 

6  -- you have to amend your statement.  If you say this was 

7  the general understanding as to the way the jury functions 

8  pre-Mills, I  think you should  say pre-Lockett  or -- or 

9  you're in danger of losing your Teague argument. 

10

 MR.  FLORA:  Well,  when I think  of a unanimity 

11  requirement in a  non-capital setting, if one  juror holds 

12  out, that  juror  cannot force  a guilty  verdict.  In  a 

13  capital case,  if one  juror holds out  and precludes  the 

14  other 11 from  giving effect to mitigating  evidence, that 

15  one juror essentially can effect a sentence of death. 

16

 QUESTION:  That's true, but  now what are you -­

17  what do you say to  a different reading of Lockett,  which 

18  would be the  following?  A  State official reads  Lockett 

19  and says,  this is  how it's  supposed to  work, that  the 

20  defendant can introduce evidence on  anything he wants and 

21  the jurors can  consider any of this  mitigating evidence, 

22  and they do consider it.  But when it comes time  to vote, 

23  the only  things that  the jurors  can use  to offset  the 

24  aggravating  factors  are  mitigating  aspects  of  the 

25  defendant's life, that they unanimously agree are, one, in 

32


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  existence and, two, are mitigating.  They  look at Lockett 

2  and say, of course, the jurors considered everything.  Now 

3  -- now it comes time to vote,  and at this point these are 

4  the rules in our State. 

5

 Now, what  I think  is the  hardest for  you is, 

6  while that might not be the best reading of Lockett and it 

7  certainly doesn't prove  to have been the  true reading of 

8  Lockett  after  Mills,  can we  say  it's  an unreasonable 

9  reading of Lockett? 

10

11

12

 MR. FLORA:  I think we can. 

 QUESTION:  Because? 

 MR. FLORA:  I think we can because merely giving 

13  consideration  to mitigating evidence would, I think, also 

14  necessitate the ability  to give effect to  that evidence, 

15  and I think that's what's  essential.  If we're left  with 

16  the fact -­

17

 QUESTION:  But you -- you don't seem  to mention 

18  our holding  in Saffle v. Parks  which was a  much harder, 

19  closer case  in my view about  whether it was  dictated by 

20  Lockett than your  case.  And the  Court said no.  And in 

21  light of Saffle, I -- I don't see what you have left going 

22  for you on that argument. 

23

 MR. FLORA:  In Saffle,  you were dealing with an 

24  anti-sympathy instruction.  Sympathy in and of itself is a 

25  concept, but  it's not  evidence of  character.  It's not 

33


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  evidence  of  background. 

It's  not  evidence  of  the 

2  circumstances of a crime. 

3

4

5

6

7

 QUESTION:  Sympathy is a -- a conflict? 

 MR. FLORA:  Is a concept. 

 QUESTION:  Concept. 

 QUESTION:  Oh, concept.  Excuse me. 

 MR. FLORA:  When you  introduce sympathy, as the 

8  attempt was  to  be done  in Saffle,  that  by doing  that 

9  you're bringing into the picture something that is totally 

10  irrelevant and from which a jury would not be able to make 

11  a  reasoned  moral  inquiry into  the  culpability  of the 

12  defendant to determine whether a sentence of death or life 

13  should be imposed.  So when I look at Saffle and I look at 

14  what  Saffle was  attempting to  do, I  think that's  very 

15  different  than having  a barrier  which precludes  giving 

16  effect to  character evidence and background  evidence and 

17  evidence specifically relating to the  circumstances of an 

18  offense.  I  see it  as being  very  different under  the 

19  circumstances. 

20

 QUESTION:  Is -- is -- the point I was thinking 

21  before and  I'd -- it was  Justice Kennedy  actually.  I 

22  think when he -- he wrote in concurrence.  It is apparent 

23  the  result  in  Mills  fits  within  our  line  of  cases 

24  forbidding  the  imposition of  capital punishment  on the 

25  basis of caprice in an arbitrary and unpredictable fashion 

34


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  or through arbitrary  or freakish means.  That's Franklin 

2  and California v. Brown and Furman  and so forth. 

3

 All right.  Think back  to what my -- my  effort 

4  to  characterize  a  reasonable  State  interpretation  of 

5  Lockett different from yours.  Well, can you say why would 

6  that be in  your opinion, the  State saying they  consider 

7  everything?  You remember what it was.  Right?  All right. 

8  Why would that be freakish or arbitrary? 

9

 MR. FLORA:  It would  be freakish or  arbitrary 

10  again I think because mere consideration of  evidence by a 

11  jury  is not  enough.  I  think  you  have to  give  that 

12  evidence effect.  Without giving that evidence  effect, I 

13  think you can end up  with an arbitrary imposition of  the 

14  death penalty. 

15

 QUESTION:  No, but the question is how you  give 

16  it effect.  Eddings and Lockett said  you cannot preclude 

17  the  jury,  all  12 people,  categorically  from  giving a 

18  certain  kind  of mitigating  evidence  any consideration. 

19  The question  in Mills was can you preclude one juror from 

20  giving dispositive effect to an item of evidence in such a 

21  way as  to  determine the  verdict.  Those  are two  very 

22  different  questions. 

They  can  be  placed  under  the 

23  umbrella of  what effect must jurors be allowed to give to 

24  mitigating evidence, but they are very different questions 

25  within that umbrella.  And it seems to me that because the 

35


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  questions are different, there is not something irrational 

2  or capricious in someone  having a question -- in  someone 

3  being uncertain of the answer to  the second question even 

4  though  the first question  has been answered  in favor of 

5  admissibility.  What do you say to that? 

6

 MR. FLORA:  I think that it still comes back to 

7  how the unanimity requirement operates.  And the mechanism 

8  that's  being  utilized  in  employing  that  unanimity 

9  requirement  is the  actual juror,  and if  that  juror is 

10  again I  think a lone, hold-out  vote, then I  think under 

11  the circumstances that is a clear violation of the Lockett 

12  rule. 

13

 QUESTION:  Is  -- a different question.  Is the 

14  jury form  in the record  -- do  we have it?  I'm  -- I'm 

15  looking at pages 66, 67, and  68 of the appendix where 

--

16  of the joint  appendix where you have  the form.  And  I'm 

17  trying to  work out whether this  is or is  not ambiguous. 

18  And it seems  to me it might depend on the way in which it 

19  appeared on the page because you see  the word unanimously 

20  appears over  here in question 2 on page 66, and depending 

21  on how  this is  indented, it  might be  whether the  jury 

22  would reasonably think that that  word unanimously does or 

23  does not apply to the questions that are on page 68. 

24

 MR. FLORA:  It's improperly  indented.  When you 

25  go back  and I think you could actually  look at the -- at 

36


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  the jury -­

2

 QUESTION: 

But  the  form  itself is 

--  

it's 

3  indented.  If it  were indented,  it would seem  that the 

4  unanimously  would govern what  follows thereafter, but if 

5  it's not indented, it seems to me a judge might reasonably 

6  think that  that word  unanimously didn't  govern what 

--

7  what follows thereafter. 

8

 MR. FLORA:  When you  have we,  the jury,  have 

9  found unanimously, my recollection of the form was that it 

10  is actually not indented like that. 

11

 QUESTION:  If it's  not indented,  then -- and 

12  this is the other  part of the case.  See, if -- if it's 

13  not indented,  then you look at the instruction and in the 

14  instruction itself,  nowhere does  the judge say  anything 

15  about  having  to  find  the 

--  

the  mitigating  factors 

16  unanimously.  He doesn't  say that.  And then you  look at 

17  the jury form and again,  if it's not indented, it  really 

18  doesn't  seem  to  say  that  they  have  to  find  this 

19  unanimously because  the word unanimously  seems to  apply 

20  here on the page to the first three things that are blank. 

21  And then we  get a  new section.  In the  new section  it 

22  doesn't say anything about unanimous. 

23

 So -- so that was what  I want you  to reply to 

24  because the  question is  whether  a judge  in that  State 

25  court  could  reasonably  have  taken  this form  and  the 

37


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  instructions  and said, well,  it -- it doesn't  say they 

2  have  to be  unanimous.  They wouldn't have  thought they 

3  did. 

4

 MR. FLORA:  My understanding of the verdict form 

5  when it  was developed was that  we, the jury,  have found 

6  unanimously  basically  applies to  all  of the  check-off 

7  items. 

8

9

10

 QUESTION:  All of those things. 

 MR. FLORA:  I beg your pardon? 

 QUESTION:  And  -- and if a judge -- if a judge 

11  in the State says, well, I think it didn't, what would you 

12  point to in reply? 

13

 MR. FLORA:  The only thing that I could point to 

14  is  the actual verdict  form itself.  That's all  I could 

15  point to. 

16

 I'd like  to  go back  a minute  on  the -- the 

17  question on the jury question -- or the jury instructions. 

18

 Jury instructions in capital cases to begin with 

19  are  very  difficult  to  get  across  to  jurors. 

Just 

20  traditionally  we've had a tough time.  When you look at a 

21  case  like this and  you have  the jury going  through the 

22  guilt  phase of the case, that jury is already conditioned 

23  to a  unanimity requirement  in finding  guilt.  When you 

24  then carry them  over to a penalty phase and  you take the 

25  instruction  that  we  have  here  and  you  give  that 

38


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  instruction to them, given the  fact it's the way  they've 

2  already been conditioned and listening to that instruction 

3  and hearing the  word unanimously  repeated and  repeated, 

4  there  is  a substantial  likelihood  that the  jury would 

5  interpret that instruction as requiring unanimity both  as 

6  to  the  aggravating and  mitigating  circumstances.  And 

7  that's the problem with the instruction. 

8

 And then when you take the verdict slip  and put 

9  that on top of it, I think that compounds everything under 

10  the circumstances.  And that's the problem here. 

11

 When we  -- staying  with this,  when the  State 

12  supreme  court  looked  at the  Mills  issue  -- and  they 

13  decided Mills on  the merits in 1995.  It  was not decided 

14  during the direct review process.  Pennsylvania has a very 

15  unique procedure  dealing with finality in  capital cases. 

16  In 1995  when the State supreme court applied Mills on the 

17  merits,  what they simply did was  they said, we interpret 

18  our statute as  not requiring unanimity.  They looked  at 

19  only a portion of the instruction, I believe approximately 

20  three sentences, and they say,  the instruction tracks the 

21  language  of  our  statute  and  therefore  there  is  no 

22  violation  of  Mills.  I  suggest that's  an unreasonable 

23  application  because  what  they didn't  do  is  apply the 

24  correct standard in -­

25

 QUESTION:  But  that was something in  1995, and 

39


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  you're talking  now about a case  that was over  on direct 

2  appeal before Mills was decided. 

3

 MR. FLORA:  That  is correct, but in  1995, when 

4  the case was  decided, the Pennsylvania supreme  court had 

5  the benefit of  Mills.  And that's  what's different about 

6  this case. 

7

 Pennsylvania  has a  very  different and  unique 

8  procedure which essentially leaves  open the direct review 

9  process  because  in capital  proceedings  in Pennsylvania 

10  prior to 1996, the State court on  collateral review would 

11  apply  any existing constitutional  precedents to a claim, 

12  even though it was  not considered first on  direct review 

13  and  even though the  decision came  up or was  decided by 

14  this Court after the direct  review process.  It's a  very 

15  different concept there.  So there's a question here as to 

16  when finality I think occurred. 

17

 QUESTION: 

But  wouldn't  that  undercut  this 

18  Court's remand the first  time around?  I mean, if it were 

19  -- if it was still  on direct review, then there  wouldn't 

20  be any question about applying  Teague and yet we sent  it 

21  back. 

22

 MR.  FLORA:  And I understand that, and when you 

23  sent it back,  one of the questions we had in our own mind 

24  is  whether  in  fact  this  Court  was  fully  aware  of 

25  Pennsylvania's  unique process  dealing  with finality  in 

40


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  capital cases. 

2

 In  looking  at Teague,  one  of the  very first 

3  things you  have to do is  determine when the  judgment is 

4  final. 

Teague itself  speaks  in terms  of conventional 

5  notions of finality,  but that doesn't mean  a State can't 

6  develop its  own concept of finality to  which the Federal 

7  courts should  give respect.  After all, States  have the 

8  primary responsibility for establishing rules of  criminal 

9  procedure and protecting the rights of an accused. 

10

 With that in  mind, concepts  of federalism  and 

11  comity which underline  the basic  precepts of Teague  are 

12  not  offended if a  State court  decides to keep  open its 

13  direct review process and on  collateral review say, look, 

14  here's a  decision that came  down from the  United States 

15  Supreme Court.  We  are going to apply it to  the facts of 

16  this case  because we want  to be absolutely  certain that 

17  execution  of  an  individual  is  beyond  constitutional 

18  reproach. 

19

 QUESTION:  Yes,  but that's  the State making  a 

20  policy  that its  State  court judges  will  do that,  and 

21  that's different from a Federal intrusion. 

22

 MR. FLORA:  I think  the States have a right  to 

23  do that. 

24

25

 May I finish the question? 

 QUESTION: 

I  think  you've  answered it,  Mr.

 Mr. Eisenberg, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD EISENBERG 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. EISENBERG:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 As to the  last point concerning  finality, Your 

7  Honor,  and  the  argument that  the 

--  

Pennsylvania has 

8  created  a  unique  form of  collateral  review,  which is 

9  really just direct review, that would be news to the State 

10  supreme court which declared this very case to have become 

11  final at the conclusion of direct appeal in 1987. 

12

 Moreover, the Pennsylvania Supreme  Court has on 

13  numerous  occasions  applied  the  Teague  rule  in  cases 

14  arising on  collateral review  to hold  that the  claim at 

15  issue was a new rule.  Obviously they couldn't have  done 

16  that if they didn't think that their own collateral review 

17  occurred after the point of finality. 

18

 And -- and furthermore, in -- in response to the 

19  argument that  this Court may not have been fully aware of 

20  the supposedly unique nature of Pennsylvania's  procedure, 

21  Mr.  Flora  made exactly  that  argument in  the  brief in 

22  opposition  to  certiorari  that  preceded  this  Court's 

23  previous summary disposition in this case. 

24

 Concerning the general argument  that Lockett is 

25  not a  new  rule because  it forbids  any  barrier to  the 

42


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  consideration of mitigation, of  course the whole question 

2  of what's a barrier that  qualifies for Lockett protection 

3  or not -- and that question has by no means been clear, as 

4  I mentioned.  That  was the  exact argument  that was  at 

5  issue in Walton, and the  majority of the Court held  that 

6  to the  extent the  preponderance standard  is a  barrier, 

7  it's an acceptable barrier.  But, of course, even in those 

8  cases where  the Court has  held that Lockett  applies, to 

9  create  a rule against a  barrier to consideration such as 

10  Simmons and such as Caldwell,  the Court has, nonetheless, 

11  held that that rule is new. 

12

 Saffle is certainly additional  support for that 

13  proposition,  although  in Saffle  the  Court declined  to 

14  create  a rule.  In Simmons  and Caldwell, the  Court did 

15  find  that the rule  was required  by Lockett, and  yet in 

16  later cases found that the rule was new. 

17

 Now,  one  of  the  reasons  I  think  that  the 

18  alternative  view or  the -- the failure  to  see Lockett 

19  immediately as a case that  precluded unanimity is because 

20  we  must  consider  what the  nature  of  consideration of 

21  mitigating circumstances is, Your Honor.  It's not merely 

22  a fact finding.  It is really a mixed question of  law, in 

23  fact.  The jury is not required to find fact A, fact B, or 

24  fact C.  It is required to find a mitigating circumstance. 

25

 And given that that is  the nature of mitigating 

43


1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005


Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.


1  circumstances,  it  was all  the  more reasonable  for the 

2  States not  to understand Lockett as  precluding unanimity 

3  for the purposes of making  that mixed fact -- mixed  fact 

4  and law determination at the mitigating stage.  But in any 

5  case, as  I've said, given the dispute even on this Court, 

6  it  was  certainly reasonable  for  the -- for  the State 

7  courts not to know. 

8

 And  given the  dispute among  the other  courts 

9  about the  -- the nature of  the application of  the Mills 

10  rule to verdict forms and  instructions like this one,  it 

11  was certainly reasonable for the State courts to -­

12

 QUESTION:  See,  this mixed question of  fact of 

13  law that  I think makes it  more difficult for you  in the 

14  sense that  if it's a  mixed question, it's  really asking 

15  the  jurors  to decide  should  this person  die,  does he 

16  deserve  to die.  And then  the pre-Mills statute  in the 

17  State becomes a situation where he will die even though 11 

18  jurors think he shouldn't. 

19

20

21

 MR. EISENBERG:  But, Your Honor, those -­

 QUESTION:  And that -- that -­

 MR.  EISENBERG: 

--  

those  difficult  mixed 

22  questions  are  exactly  the kinds  of  questions  that we 

23  always ask juries  to decide and in  every context outside 

24  of this one, to decide unanimously, even for example,  not 

25  just in the case of the commonwealth meeting its burden of 

44

1  proof, but the defendant meeting his burden of proof where


2  that burden of proof is on him in the situation of a -- of


3  an affirmative defense. 


4

 Of course, my argument is not that Lockett can't


5  possibly be read to require the result that you suggest.
