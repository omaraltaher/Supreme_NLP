CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

Johnson. 

            

Mr. Shanmugam. 

 

          

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, 

  

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The Bankruptcy Code sets up a process for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

evaluating claims that are subject to potential 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations defenses.  Under that process, a creditor 

   

  

 

 

 

seeking to collect on a debt files a proof of claim. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

For certain types of consumer debt, the creditor also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

includes information to enable the trustee and other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties in interest to assess the claim's timeliness and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where appropriate to object.  A creditor is not required 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

to go further and to certify that there is no valid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations defense to its own claim.  If that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly what Respondent and the government are asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court to do, under the guise of interpreting the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  There is nothing --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Under the Fair Debt

brought in court to collect on a debt that is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

time-barred.  Would that violate the Fair Credit law if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you sued in court on a debt that was time-barred? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Justice Ginsburg, our view, 

  

 

 

 

 

perhaps not surprisingly, is no.  Our view is that there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be nothing misleading or unfair about the suit in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that instance. 

 

            

But this Court need not address that issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in order to resolve the question presented here, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indeed, the courts of appeals that have accepted our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view have largely assumed that the filing of a suit in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state court presents different considerations from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filing of a proof of claim in bankruptcy.  And that is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the simple reason that there are distinctive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

characteristics about the operation of the bankruptcy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system. 

            

First, and perhaps most importantly, the 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy system defines the term "claim" quite broadly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to include any circumstance in which there is a right to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment.  And as this Court held in Butner, whether or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not there is a right to payment is defined under state 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law, and Alabama law is clear that the running of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations period does not extinguish the right; the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right remains.  And so, for instance, if the debtor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

takes some action to make repayment, the right springs

back into life, indeed, the right never disappears in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first place, but the right, once again, becomes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicially enforceable. 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are there -- are there any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances, just as a practical matter, where the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

trustee decides that the trustee is going to pay the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time-barred debt, it's obviously prejudicial to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other creditors.  Are there any -- I was -- I was just 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to think of that.  I -- I can't think of any 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance in which a trustee would want to do that.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was thinking suppose the debtor wanted to continue a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business relation with the -- with -- with the creditor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whose debt is time-barred, and -- and as for -- but I --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I just can't think of any instance.  But perhaps --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  No, and -- and -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Kennedy, I can't think of any instance either, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I think that that's precisely because the trustee 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

has the statutory duty to object, to preserve the assets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the estate, and to do so for the creditors.  And, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again, that is a critical feature of the bankruptcy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

system. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I'm having a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

great deal of difficulty with this business model. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Completely.  You buy old, old debts that you know for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainty are not within any statute of limitations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

You buy them and you call up creditors and you say to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

them, you don't have to pay me.  But out of the goodness 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of your heart, you should?  Or do you just call them up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and say, you owe me money, and you hope that they'll pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you. 

            

And is it the same thing in bankruptcy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court?  You filed a claim and you hope the trustee 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't see that it's out of time?  And apparently, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collect on millions of dollars of these debts.  So is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that what you do? 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So, Justice Sotomayor, I do 

   

  

 

 

 

not think that that is a valid understanding of our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business model, and let me explain why. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First, this debt was not time-barred at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time it was purchased.  And indeed, Midland, my client, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes every effort not to purchase time-barred debt. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now, of course, they're not always correct in their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assessments, and debt that is not time-barred at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time of purchase can come --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Did you have a 

  

 

 

 

 

good-faith basis in this case to believe that the debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was not time-barred --

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- when you filed this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

claim?  Forget about some of the others.

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Just to be clear, there is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

actually no allegation in this case that we knew that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was a valid limitations defense.  If you take a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at the complaint in this case, and if you take a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at page 25 of the Joint Appendix in particular, all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the complaint alleges is that we were aware of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very facts that we disclosed in the proof of claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Facts that, to be sure, indicated the existence of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potential limitations defense.  Because, after all --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Did you have a 

  

 

 

 

 

good-faith basis to believe the statute of limitations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was not applicable? 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Midland at the time would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

file proofs of claim without conducting some sort of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustive inquiry, and that's for the simple reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Midland did not believe that that was legally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required.  And so, again, there is no record on this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do you do with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the committee notes that say that everyone who files a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proof of claim has an obligation to do a good-faith 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry as to whether it's an enforceable obligation or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not? 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  I don't think that that is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

an accurate characterization of what the advisory

committee did.  And let me first --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no.  Not what they 

  

  

 

 

 

 

8 

did; what they said. 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  I don't think that that's an 

    

 

 

 

 

 

accurate characterization of what they said, either. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And let me explain why that's true. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First of all, let me set out what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisory committee actually did, because that's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical part of our argument.  In Rule 3001(c)(3), 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which was adopted in 2012, the advisory committee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required certain disclosures, the whole point of which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was to put trustees and other parties in interest on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice of the potential availability of a limitations 

   

 

 

 

 

 

defense. 

            

And the advisory committee thought about 

 

 

 

 

 

going further.  It thought about doing, again, exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Respondent and the government are asking this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do under the FDCPA; namely, to require a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification that having investigated the existence of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a limitations defense, the creditor had made a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination that there was no valid such defense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, the advisory committee decided not to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do that, Justice Sotomayor, and it decided not to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that for two critical reasons.  The first was that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisory committee recognized that the question of

whether or not there is a valid limitations defense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as -- as opposed to the question of whether or not the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim appears to be time-barred, could be complicated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

And it could be complicated even in the context of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consumer debts like these ones, because of the potential 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for revival and tolling, choice-of-law issues, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like. 

            

            

The second reason --

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I agree with you.  But 

    

  

 

 

 

if -- if that is true that you investigated and you had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a good-faith basis for believing that it wasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time-barred, you wouldn't be liable either under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy rules or under these debtor rules.  So -- but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the point is if you were unaware and didn't properly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigate, have you fulfilled your obligations as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer to the bankruptcy court? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  And our view, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor, just to be clear, is that you have done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly what the code itself contemplates. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And this goes to the second reason why the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisory committee did not go further.  The advisory 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

committee expressed a concern that if it had gone 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

further, it could be violating the Bankruptcy Rules 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Enabling Act because it would be acting inconsistently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the burden-shifting framework that the code itself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

devised. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I don't 

    

  

 

 

10 

remember reading that in these.  Could you give me a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record cite for that? 

 

 

 

            

            

reply. 

            

brief --

 

            

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  I --

    

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or you can do it in your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  No.  It's -- it's in our 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or --

  

 

 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  It's in our brief at page --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I believe it's at page 86 of the Agenda Book where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advisory committee working group discusses the proposal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to require creditors to, quote, "State whether the claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is timely under the relevant statute of limitations." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But let me explain that point in a little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

more detail, because I do think that this is really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important to understanding our argument here.  The way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Bankruptcy Code operates is first, that a party 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is entitled -- a creditor is entitled to file a proof of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim where they have a right to payment.  And at that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point, the burden shifts.  The claim is presumptively 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

valid.  And if there is an issue concerning the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceability of the claim, that is an issue that has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be raised by the trustee or by another party in

interest or else the claim will be allowed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, what I think Respondent and the 

   

 

 

 

 

government are trying to do here is to really align two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate concepts:  The question of validity on the one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

hand and the question of enforceability on the other. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And I think Respondent, in particular, is attempting to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

somehow build the concept of enforceability into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of a claim. 

   

 

            

But how we know that that is not true is by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

virtue of the fact that in Section 502(b), the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute -- the code specifically provides that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceability is a basis for objecting and for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

disallowing a claim.  It doesn't go to the question of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether or not you have a valid claim in the first 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place. 

            

So, once again, all of this really depends 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critically --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm -- I'm -- I'm a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

little bit confused.  The fact that the code anticipates 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that some people will file unenforceable claims even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though they shouldn't, that that somehow proves that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

code invites unenforceable claims? 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Quite to the contrary, 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor.  The code specifically wants this to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen because the code defines claims expansively.  And

that is because in 1978, when Congress adopted the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bankruptcy Code, it adopted this broad definition of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

claim to bring claims into the bankruptcy estate.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Contingent, unmatured, 

  

 

 

these are all words that suggest an entitlement to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment.  Where in the definition any use of word -- of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words talk about a claim that's unenforceable?  A 

   

  

 

 

 

 

contingent claim may not be enforceable today, but it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might be in the future. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  I agree with the first half 

    

 

 

 

 

 

of your question, but not the second, Justice Sotomayor, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because you're right:  The code talks about an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitlement to payment.  But that is precisely what we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have here.  And to the extent that the code includes as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples of types of rights to payment, contingent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims or unmatured claims, that illustrates that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of claim includes rights to payment that may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not be presently enforceable. 

 

 

 

            

Again, the question of enforceability is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question that arises with regard to objections.  It does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not relate to the question of an entitlement to file a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  And this is critical to understanding how the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bankruptcy Code works. 

 

 

            

Now, how the Bankruptcy Code works in turn

informs the application of the actual language of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FDCPA, which is, after all, the question before this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

Court. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Before you get to that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

language, Mr. Shanmugam.  Could you just -- you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just from a commonsense basis, it seems hard to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand why Congress would want all these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unenforceable proofs of claim to flow in, because only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two things can happen.  One is that the trustee will 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

properly filter out those claims; and the other is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the trustee will be swamped and won't have the time or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the energy or the inclination or he'll make mistakes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and some of those claims will be deemed enforceable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when, in fact, they're not. 

 

 

 

 

            

So why would anybody want these proofs of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim to flood into the bankruptcy system? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  So, Justice Kagan, two 

  

 

 

 

 

responses to that.  The first is that, again, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we don't know that these claims are unenforceable.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think what we know is that there is an apparent time bar 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to these claims.  The very facts that are disclosed in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the proof of claim illustrate that.  And there is some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further work to be done before an ultimate legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination can be made about whether there is a valid 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations defense.

And Congress very consciously put that 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

burden on the trustee and other parties in interest in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Bankruptcy Code.  The trustee or the debtor or any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other party in interest can come in and object and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue can be litigated. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I -- but I -- the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

understanding here is that this case involves not claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which maybe they're barred by the statute of limitations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and maybe they're not, but the issue, as presented to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

us, is as to claims where everybody knows, including the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person who's filing the proof of claim, that they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

barred by the statute of limitations. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And what sense could it make for Congress to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, oh, that's a great idea for some -- for people 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just to file those claims and -- and, you know, the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the -- on -- the best thing that can happen is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those claims will be filtered out, and the worst thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that can happen is that they won't be.  People will make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistakes and people will pay on things that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't be paying on. 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yeah.  And Justice Kagan, 

  

  

 

 

 

just to be clear, I'm disputing the assumption that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somehow acted with knowledge here.  But I'm happy for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court to consider this case, as we said in footnote 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 of our brief, on the assumption that if there had been

an objection, the claim would have been disallowed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think that the answer, though, is still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same.  And I think that Congress, in adopting this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

system in the Code, must have known that some number of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims would be allowed that should otherwise be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disallowed if there is an objection.  Because after all, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is the unelectable consequence of imposing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden on responsive parties in deeming claims to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valid, absent and objection. 

 

 

 

            

But the reason -- the affirmative reason why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress would have wanted to do that is precisely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because of the fresh start principle that underlies the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entire bankruptcy system. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is part of that -- help 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

me, it's on basic bankruptcy law.  Suppose I'm a debtor. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I know that the claim is time barred.  Do I list that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim with the trustee just to be sure that it can be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of the discharge that the claim is -- that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the claim is extinguished and I can't later be sued? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  I think it should be listed 

    

 

 

 

 

 

for the simple reason that there is a valid claim and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is, therefore, a valid right to payment. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  As a routine matter, 

   

  

 

 

does -- does the discharge extinguish that claim? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes, that is correct.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

the virtue --

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why would need -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a claim is time barred, you don't need a fresh start to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get rid of that claim.  You say it's time barred, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore, no claim.  You don't need a discharge in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy to accomplish that. 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Justice Ginsburg, I disagree 

   

  

 

 

with that solely because of the virtue of a discharge. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the virtue of a discharge is that in the language of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Code and the language in particular of Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

523(a)(3), the discharge prevents the creditor from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking any act to collect.  And that includes efforts to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encourage the debtor, notwithstanding the absence of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicial remedy, to make any sort of payment, which I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think Respondent acknowledges that a debtor retains --

   

 

 

 

 

 

we have some ability to do even after --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It would also foreclose 

  

 

 

 

 

the possibility of the creditor arguing that there had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been a waiver. 

   

            

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes.  I guess --

    

  

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In other words, if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

debt is discharged, then the debtor doesn't have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worry about some claim that he had waived the statute of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations. 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes.  Well, that is correct

in the sense that, again, the creditor can take no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

action to collect even a sort of voluntary request for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment.  And that has very real value.  And in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

addition, as we explained in our brief, discharge has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other collateral consequences in prohibiting certain 

 

 

 

 

 

types of discrimination based on the existence of debts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And those are the very principles that again underlie, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not just the Code more generally, but the very broad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of claim in particular.  And that really was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an innovation of the 1978 Bankruptcy Code, namely, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

replacing the old provability system with a very broad 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of claim that was meant to bring claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within the bankruptcy process. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We are talking about the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

effect of the FDCPA.  And isn't it so that there would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be no point in making a claim for a debt that's clearly 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time barred.  No point in doing that except for the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chance that it will be overlooked, that it will be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

skipped.  And that you will get paid on the assumption 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it's a good claim when, in fact, it isn't. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, again, I think that 

   

  

 

 

 

that question, Justice Ginsburg, presupposes a state of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

mind, which is simply not alleged and on which there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply no record in this case or in other cases.  But I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't want to fight that factual premise too hard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

because I think that even if such a state of mind 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

exists, the operation of the Code is the same.  Again, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

the state of mind of the creditor is neither here nor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there for purposes of the operation of the Code.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sole question for purposes of the operation of the Code 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is whether or not there is a right to payment.  And so 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when these proofs of claim were filed, the -- there --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is not an extensive further investigation at that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point, or at least I'm certainly not aware of one on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part of in my client or on the part of debt collectors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more generally. 

 

            

What the debt collector is obligated to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the Code and under the rules is to disclose the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information that essentially provides the world notice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a prima facie limitation. 

   

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. -- I'm sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, I was going to bring 

   

  

 

 

 

 

this back to the language of the Code because I did want 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to address that, but Justice Kagan. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Let's suppose that you are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right, that the Code allows this.  I mean, it's hard for 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me to believe that the Code actively invites it, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's suppose, as it's written, allows that.  So then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you wouldn't violate the Code by filing these proofs of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  That's -- that's for sure.  But why would that

also absolve you from liability under other statutes? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

The codes does not obligate this.  You don't have to do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this under the Code.  It's a choice.  And then another 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute can come along and say, you know what, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain actors, for certain creditors, for these debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collectors, there's an independent rule and the Code 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says nothing about that. 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yeah.  So let me address, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

first, the specific language of the FDCPA.  And I want 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to put down a marker because I want to address the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate issue of how the FDCPA and the Bankruptcy Code 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relate. 

            

We think that the operation of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bankruptcy Code informs the analysis under the two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant provisions of the FDCPA.  First, on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question of whether or not we made false or misleading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representations and second, the question of whether or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not this is an unfair or unconscionable practice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On the question of 1692e, our submission is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite straightforward that there is nothing false or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misleading about the submission of a proof of claim that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not only entirely accurate, but that affirmatively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

puts the world on notice as to the existence of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potential limitations defense. 

 

 

            

And to go to the second prong of this, the

question of whether or not such a proof of claim is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misleading, our submission is that the filing of a proof 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

of claim implies only a good-faith basis that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor has a claim.  It doesn't imply anything about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the enforceability of the claim more generally or about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the availability of a limitations defense more 

   

 

 

 

 

specifically other than providing affirmative notice 

 

 

 

 

 

that such a potential defense exists. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  What do you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

do with the language of Pennsylvania Public Welfare v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Davenport where we explicitly said that a claim is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to payment and enforceable obligation?  What do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you do with that language? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, I don't think that --

   

  

 

 

 

 

that that even rises to the level of, in the parlance of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the last argument, a drive-by holding.  And that's for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the simple reason that neither Davenport nor the later 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases citing Davenport in any way purported to somehow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclude unenforceable rights from the definition of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  In Davenport, everyone agreed that the right in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question was enforceable in some respect.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question was whether the fact that the enforcement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mechanism was limited somehow affected whether or not it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

came within the definition of claim, and the Court said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no.

21 

            

But, again, if you thought that that rose to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the level of even a passing holding, I would return to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the language of the Bankruptcy Code and, in particular, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the definition of a claim which says nothing about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceability.  To the contrary, Section 502 builds 

  

 

 

 

 

 

enforceability into the objections that have to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised. 

            

Now, I do want to say a bit about the other 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision of the FDCPA, the provision that prohibits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unfair or unconscionable practices.  And I think that on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that provision, we would rely centrally on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protections provided by the bankruptcy system.  It bears 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

remembering that a proof of claim, unlike a civil 

   

   

 

 

 

 

lawsuit, is not filed against the debtor.  It is filed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against the estate.  And as we've been discussing, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trustee bears a statutory obligation to monitor proofs 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of claim. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it's a breach of the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

trustee's duties if he or she lets the claim go through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without objecting? 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  If some purpose would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

served.  And, Justice Sotomayor, to the extent that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have concern --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that was Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Kennedy's initial question.  What would be the purpose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

of a trustee permitting a stale claim to go forward? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  The trustee should object 

  

 

 

 

 

22 

where, in the language of the statute, some purpose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be served.  And I think there are actually 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

contexts in which an objection might be futile because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it would have no effect on any of the other creditors or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly on the amount that the debtor pays.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise, the trustee should object.  And I would say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that to the extent that you have concern about --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where -- where would 

  

 

 

 

 

that situation arise?  The amount the creditor pays 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

might be -- the debtor pays might be true, but every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other creditor loses if an unenforceable debt is paid. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  There -- there could be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case in which the unsecured creditors get nothing.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at that point, it doesn't make any difference because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

none of the unsecured creditors are going to get paid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and there are other similar circumstances. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So those situations 

  

 

 

 

don't account for the $800 million you've collected on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these old claims. 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, I don't -- I don't 

   

   

  

 

 

think that there is a record on how much we've collected 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with regard to this particular type of claim more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generally.

But leaving that aside, I want to make one 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

very important point about the interplay between the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

Bankruptcy Code and the FDCPA here.  I think that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's briefs sort of has this genus-like quality. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because Respondents fight this to some extent on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operation of the Bankruptcy Code.  But I think, really, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the principal beef that Respondent has here is that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy system just isn't works as it should. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If you take a look at pages 29 to 30 of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's brief, Respondent really makes the broader 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point that trustees and other parties in interest aren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

simply objecting as often as they should in bankruptcy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that frustrates --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I just ask you a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

practical question?  Would there be anything -- suppose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a trustee or the attorney for a debtor said, I am going 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- let's say this case is in Alabama.  The statute of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations for the collection of debt in Alabama is six 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years.  I am going to object to every -- any claim for a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt that was incurred more than six years ago. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Would -- would that be inconsistent with the duties of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the trustee or the attorney? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  I mean, no, not necessarily, 

    

 

 

 

 

because at that point essentially what -- what would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happening is that the trustee would say there's a prima

facie limitations defense here, we're going to raise an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

objection, and at that point the issue would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigated.  And if the creditor in that circumstance 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't come back and request a hearing or otherwise 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigate the issue, it -- I think it's quite possible, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depending on the nature of the objection, that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection would be sustained and that the claim would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disallowed. 

            

Again --

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'll -- I'll ask 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Geyser the same question, but it -- I can't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand why a trustee or an attorney wouldn't take 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- wouldn't take that approach --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- automatically object to 

  

 

 

 

 

anything that is over the -- the statute of limitations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well -- and I think that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

this illustrates the artificiality of taking the FDCPA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and injecting it into the bankruptcy regime. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

To be sure, the FDCPA applies to debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collectors specifically, but I think in this context, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

what would either happen is that there will be an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objection and the claim will be disallowed -- that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what took place in this case, albeit on somewhat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different grounds.  And, of course, in that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

circumstance, there is no harm to the actual debtor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the claim has, in fact, been disallowed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If, in fact, the claim has been allowed, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

seems quite odd to say that you could still bring an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FDCPA action, because what you would effectively be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing is collaterally challenging the bankruptcy court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision to allow the claim in the first place.  And as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we explained in our brief -- and we make this point not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only specifically with regard to the standing of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff, but really with regard to this whole category 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of cases -- one of the reasons why this practice is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unfair or unconscionable is that it is very hard to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

posit a circumstance in which it will actually lead to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an injury to the debtor.  And it's really for that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  You're 

  

  

 

 

taking up trustee time, which gets paid by the debtor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately and at administrative cost.  You are taking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

up the time of other creditors, because there has to be, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when an objection is raised, notice to all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditors, a hearing date set, all of these procedural 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

steps that are unnecessary because you have no basis to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe that this debt is enforceable. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. SHANMUGAM:  Speaking of time, I'd like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to reserve the balance of mine, but let me answer your

question, Justice Sotomayor. 

 

 

26 

            

It is simply not true that the amount that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the trustee gets paid is somehow dependent on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objections that the trustee raises, and I would revert 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the fundamental principle underlying our argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This is exactly how Congress thought the system should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work.  And if the system as an administrative matter is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not working as Congress intended, the solution is to fix 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the bankruptcy system and not to extend the FDCPA into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the domain of bankruptcy. 

 

 

 

            

you. 

            

I'll reserve the balance of my time.  Thank

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL L. GEYSER 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Midland is, in fact, using a business model 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that intentionally floods bankruptcy courts with 

 

 

 

 

 

time-barred debts.  And after the first half of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument, I think two propositions remain undisputed. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

The first is that under the Bankruptcy Code, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these debts are unenforceable and will lose a hundred 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent of the time if anyone objects.  The second is

27 

there is literally no scenario where Midland collects 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless the system breaks down and fails.  What --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are there other 

  

 

 

 

 

defenses to a debt that you would say are covered by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your theory other than the statute of limitations?  For 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, that the -- the debt was incurred to a contract 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of adhesion or, you know, the -- the normal list of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons that a debt might be unenforceable.  Does your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

theory apply to all of those? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  Our theory, I think, is exactly 

   

  

 

 

 

 

what Justice Sotomayor said earlier in the argument.  A 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt collector has to have a good faith belief that they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a right to payment under the code and have a valid 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and enforceable debt.  If they have any reasonable basis 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to think that -- that an affirmative defense might not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply, then they don't violate the FDCPA. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, then what that means 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is that not just in this case, not just with statute of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations, that -- that there are a whole set of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims that can be brought in bankruptcy where you would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say they don't.  They don't have a reasonable good faith 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

belief.  And, of course, what they say is we do.  We do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a good faith belief.  Okay? 

   

  

 

 

            

And now who's going to decide that?  A 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy judge?  No.  An ordinary judge in a case 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

28 

brought in an ordinary court where, in fact, if one side 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wins, they get a thousand dollars per instance plus 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney's fees, plus costs.  Now, I thought the point 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of the Bankruptcy Code was to have bankruptcy matters 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided in a bankruptcy court and not in an ordinary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article III court.  So how do you reconcile what you are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arguing with the basic point of bankruptcy? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  Your Honor, I think the point 

   

  

 

 

 

 

of the Bankruptcy Code is to have legitimate genuine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disputes resolved in the Bankruptcy Code. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Really?  Really.  How 

  

  

  

 

interesting.  Then what do they argue about?  In --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- I mean, are there cases in bankruptcy court where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one side says, I have a legitimate dispute and the other 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

side says, no, you don't?  Is that unheard of in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy court? 

 

            

            

purpose? 

            

MR. GEYSER:  Not -- not at all --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that outside its 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. GEYSER:  Not at all.  And to be very 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear, our theory doesn't cover that situation.  If a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor can articulate --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh.  Only when the creditor 

  

  

 

 

 

 

comes in and says, I admit I had no good-faith reason 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for bringing this.  That's the only thing your theory

covers? 

            

MR. GEYSER:  No.  This is the situation it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

covers, and this is all it covers.  If the affirmative 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

defense, a complete defense, is obvious on the face of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the claim, and if there is not an articulable reason to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that that complete defense may not apply, this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly the same standard that applies, and all five 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts of appeals have looked at this.  This is not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shifting the burden, this is not imposing an affirmative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification requirement of all creditors to 

 

 

 

 

 

investigate claims that have no defect on the face of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the claim. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well -- well, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

how do you know that's the case in the statute of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations with respect to a statute of limitations 

   

 

 

 

 

 

defense?  There are exceptions to the statutes of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations that -- that -- totally -- you know, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole list of -- so it's hard to say.  I mean, but 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the argument on the other side is look, we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spelled out -- we -- we have to have spelled out the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of basis.  If you think there's a statute of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations defense, here are the dates of these things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If it's obvious on the face, which was the standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've proposed, then it ought to be obvious to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other side as well.

MR. GEYSER:  Yeah --

  

 

 

30 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How do we know?  Do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

we -- is there some way we know that there wasn't a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolling argument that could be raised in this case? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  Your Honor, we -- first, we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have alleged that Midland did, in fact, know there was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no defense of limitations objection.  So that -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- that's how this case comes to the Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There was a little 

   

  

 

 

 

disputed footnote battle about that --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GEYSER:  Yes --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- in terms of what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the record provided or not. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  So -- there was, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

We -- we think that the original complaint should have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been clear in this.  It's since been amended to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expressly allege that Midland acted with knowledge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Let's take 

  

  

 

 

 

the case where the dates, since you asked, it's six 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years that was incurred, however many years beyond that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and you say they -- they should just not raise it, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you say that they should inquire somehow to make sure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there wasn't a basis for tolling the -- the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute?  What -- what do they have to do?

satisfy and discharge the obligation they have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfy and discharge under Rule 9011.  It's a basic --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

that is. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, tell me what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GEYSER:  It's -- it is a reasonable 

   

  

 

 

 

 

belief, after a reasonable inquiry, that they have a --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

a ground for the complaint, that the evidentiary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allegations have some factual support, and that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim isn't filed for --

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it's -- it's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough for them to say there might be, it's -- you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there -- a tolling issue here.  I mean, their argument 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

is that that's exactly how bankruptcy works.  Here we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a claim, and if there is an objection to it, it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shifts to the other side.  It seems to me that you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

putting a burden on them to research the claim before 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asserting it in bankruptcy. 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  Only when the affirmative 

  

 

 

 

 

defense is blindingly obvious on the face of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint.  And this, by the way, is the exact same rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that applies in Alabama State court. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let -- let me -- let 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me ask this.  In -- in State courts generally, my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding is that there is a debt; it is just not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceable.

Forget bankruptcy.  A civil practitioner 

    

 

 

32 

represents the creditors.  They know the debt is time 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

barred.  Is it unethical to sue because -- on -- on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory that the defense may not be waived? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

raised? 

            

            

MR. GEYSER:  Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  They may -- may not be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GEYSER:  What -- what --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If the defense isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

raised as an affirmative defense, as a matter of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

pleading I assume in some jurisdictions, and it goes to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial and you say, oh, judge, this is time barred, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge will say, too late, you didn't raise the defense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  An affirmative defense can't 

  

 

 

 

 

be -- can be waived, but I think what's important is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that all five courts of appeals that have looked at this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have said that if you bring the complaint knowing that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's subject to a complete defense, you're imposing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

unnecessary costs on a defendant to object. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It may not be.  I mean it 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

depends on the circumstance.  But that isn't what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

bothering me and I -- and I put it in a sort of -- you 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a very good argument.  I'm not saying you don't. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm telling you what's worrying me.

cases, which now you've -- you've narrowed it to that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set which is sanctionable under Rule 9011, which is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy rule with sanctions.  And you're saying in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

addition to the sanctions, the person who -- the debtor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can go and bring a different case now under the word 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"unfair" in the debt collection act. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I'm saying what's worrying me, and I'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like to hear what you say specifically, is that here we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have two sets of courts; one with the power to sanction; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other the ordinary Article III court, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumably will automatically give $1,000 per violation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, plus attorneys' fees, plus costs.  And that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems what the bankruptcy court was trying to avoid.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want bankruptcy matters decided in bankruptcy court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, I don't think I have a convincing 

   

   

   

 

argument against you.  I have a point.  And I'd like to 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

hear what you have to say in response. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  We appreciate that.  I think 

    

  

 

 

 

the -- the ultimate response is what Congress intended 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically designed for remedies for professional debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collectors, realizing that ordinary remedies like Rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9011 sanctions that are calibrated for general creditors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aren't always enough.  Professional debt collectors are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

inventive, they impose heightened risks, and you often

need a heightened remedy to check their conduct, which I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think is exactly what we see here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if -- if the States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were so worried about that, why don't all States do what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apparently two States do?  They say if the statute of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitation runs, the debt is barred forever.  But, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

apparently, many States don't say that.  They say you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can still sue. 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  They -- they do, Your Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but I think that States have the option --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's the trouble I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

having in this case. 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  Well -- well, to be perfectly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear, even States that don't eliminate the debt, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's still not a right to payment, it's not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceable in any way that's not purely voluntary.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Alabama -- and this is, I think, critical here -- it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually gives rise not just to a sanctionable act, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to a tort.  It's malicious prosecution to file a lawsuit 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

in Alabama subject to the complete defense of a statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of limitations. 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is -- is it just the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute of limitations you're talking about, or is it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all affirmative defenses? 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  It's clearly at least the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

statute of limitations.  I think it's any complete 

    

 

 

 

 

 

defense to the suit. 

 

 

 

35 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Sorry.  And is it just the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute of limitations you're talking about, or is it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all affirmative defenses? 

 

 

            

            

MR. GEYSER:  Any affirmative defense --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Any 

  

  

  

 

 

affirmative defense.  Some of these, you know, are quite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicated. 

            

            

MR. GEYSER:  And -- and --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And, therefore, we're now 

  

 

 

 

 

going to have the Article III judge -- maybe not in some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, but in many cases -- deciding pretty complicated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things as matters of bankruptcy law growing out of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy case. 

 

            

            

Now, if that's wrong, why is it wrong? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GEYSER:  I think it's wrong for -- for 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

two reasons. 

   

 

The first is that what the -- the matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they'll be citing in the Fair Debt Collection 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Practices cases will not be inherent in bankruptcy laws, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asking, did you allege a time-barred claim?  And it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

very easy to --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  You missed my 

  

  

 

 

 

 

whole point.  You said it applies to all affirmative 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defenses.

affirmative defense might not apply, we don't have an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FDCPA claim. 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So what are the other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

affirmative defenses that your argument might apply to? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  I think one example could be a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

release.  Let's say that you sign a release to a claim, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

and then the debt collector the next day in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy files a proof of claim on exactly the same 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debt they just released.  In that case, they're imposing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an unnecessary cost on everyone in the process.  They're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to collect a debt that they will only collect in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two circumstances.  They either actually trick everyone 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in the system who doesn't realize there's a complete 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense, or people do realize there's a complete defense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and they acquiesce.  And --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Are there any affirmative 

  

 

 

 

 

37 

defenses that your argument might apply to that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy-related particularly?  Or are these all kind 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of the sort of defenses that are involved in any suit? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  I think logically, it's any 

    

 

 

 

 

complete defense to the proof of claim.  We've been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focusing on the complete defenses under applicable law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  I was asking, are 

    

  

 

 

 

any of those defenses only bankruptcy related?  Do some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of them only arise in a bankruptcy proceeding? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  I can't think of one off the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

top of my head, Justice Kagan.  What we're looking at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are defenses that, again, you file the proof of claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without a good-faith reason to believe it's actually 

   

 

 

 

 

 

valid and enforceable.  That it's -- it effectively is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule that says creditors can't act in bad faith. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And -- and where --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where does the -- where do you litigate the issue of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good faith? 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  In good faith, you would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

litigate it in the FDCPA lawsuit. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So what you're saying is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

set of cases that would warrant a sanction under Rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9011, if I said to the bankruptcy judge, who happens to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know something about it because he's heard the case, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

I were to ask him -- but who's going to bother to ask 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

him?  Because I get my attorneys' fees and a thousand 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

dollars and et cetera.  If I go into this other court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before a judge who doesn't know about it and just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue -- have a litigate on an easy issue, an easy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue, the state of mind of the individual creditor, ah, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes.  It's just state of mind.  I grant you the easy 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing about state of mind is it's only three words, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the difficult thing is, of course, proving what it was. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Now -- now do you see what is worrying me? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GEYSER:  I do, I do, Justice Breyer.  I 

    

   

  

 

 

 

think that in the bankruptcy setting, first of all, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given the speed of the proof of claim process, the odds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are the objection will be adjudicated before the FDCPA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit is -- is far underway or underway at all, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually what happened in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I also think that in most circumstances, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state of mind can be satisfied by the creditor by simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

articulating any reason they filed the -- the suit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They simply have to explain, why did you -- why did you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think you were entitled to collect?  Because every claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the bankruptcy process is automatically deemed prima 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facie valid and enforceable.  And when a debt collector 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

says by filing a proof of claim, I believe I have a 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

right to payment on an enforceable obligation, and they

know that's not true, then they are misstating the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

character and the legal status of the debt. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  May I ask you the question 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that I -- I asked your -- your adversary.  Why -- why do 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these time-barred claims slip through?  I mean, that's a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

big part of your argument.  Why don't trustees and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorneys for the debtor automatically object to any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim that is beyond the number of years set out in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute of limitations? 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  I think there are two reasons 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that they don't.  The first is that the cost of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objecting is sometimes more than the benefit of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excluding the claim.  These are nuisance-value claims. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

They often will acquiesce in a legitimate payout simply 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to avoid the nuisance value of the objection, which I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think is unfair. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Why is there a big cost 

   

  

 

 

 

 

in -- in filing an objection? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  According to -- to the National 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Association of Bankruptcy Attorneys, it often takes two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to three hours to do all the paperwork, serve the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties.  It might not seem like very much, but that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that does impose a cost on the system. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

The other reason that the trustees --

even have -- you could have a computer program that does 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

this automatically.  I can't understand why it would be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

very difficult. 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  Your Honor, even if it took 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

only an hour, you're talking about hundreds of thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of claims filed each year, which, in the aggregate, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amounts to an awful lot of time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

The other reason that the trustees --

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But how many of these would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there be in the typical Chapter 13? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  What -- what we've seen in at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least the cases that have had a chance to go past the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pleading stage is that the trustee, for example, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Middle District of Alabama processes between 6 and 7,000 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims a month.  So to review the claims, they have to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review a claim every two minutes for 365 days a year --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But what kind of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

claims are you talking about?  These -- these kinds of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims? 

            

MR. GEYSER:  Well, claims filed in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy.  But the -- the point is Congress wanted to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit the bankruptcy process to legitimate claims. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So then it's 

  

 

 

 

 

logistically, it's every claim that they -- they look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at?

MR. GEYSER:  That -- those are the claims 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they have to sort through.  And I don't -- I --

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

41 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That doesn't tell us 

  

 

 

 

 

 

very much about how many of these claims there are. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  Well, sometimes we don't know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

how many claims of these nature there are because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes they slip through and no one notices them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the other reason that the trustees don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always object, Justice Alito, and they've told us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- the -- the Chapter 13 trustees at page 15 of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their brief, there -- there's an information asymmetry. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Trustees assume that creditors act in good faith.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they assume if there's a facially time-barred claim, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

it's possible the creditor is aware of some basis for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolling.  And the trustee doesn't know what the creditor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is thinking, and so they might not object, which is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way that these claims are, in fact, misleading, even to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sophisticated trustees. 

 

            

So the real point is that Midland wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file these claims if the system actually functioned the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way that Congress intended.  If -- if it did function 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and everyone objected the way they were supposed to, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these claims would always lose. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I find this is a very 

    

   

 

 

 

difficult case because if -- if your description of

Midland's business model is correct, it doesn't seem to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me that it has much, if any, social utility. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On the other hand, I have real a problem 

   

   

 

 

 

 

with your -- with fitting your argument into the concept 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of an affirmative defense.  I thought an affirmative 

    

 

 

 

 

 

defense was a rule of law that may allow the defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to prevail if the defendant asserts the defense.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you want to switch -- you're switching that over to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side of the plaintiff or the person filing the claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It seems inconsistent with the whole idea of an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmative defense. 

 

            

The idea of an affirmative defense -- let's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take statute of limitations.  The idea is that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant may escape liability based on the statute of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations, but only if a defendant asserts the defense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and, if necessary, proves it.  And if a defendant 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't do that, then the law is perfectly content with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having a recovery on a claim that would have otherwise 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

been time barred. 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  Well, I -- I think that, again, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

we're -- we're not talking about affirmative defenses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that aren't obvious on the face of the -- of the claim. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Under Rule 9011 -- and -- and just thinking about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way a creditor would normally approach this, if they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

look and they realize there's a facially obvious time 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

bar -- this case is a great example.  The debt's over a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

decade old.  They missed the limitations period by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost five years on a six-year limitation period.  They 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

almost doubled the -- the length of time they had to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  In this case, is it -- is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there something in the record?  I mean, it's rather 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

surprising to me that there is a company and their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business model, you say, is to go around buying up debts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that can't be enforced and are worthless, and then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

filing cases hoping that no one will notice.  Is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shown in the record?  I mean, is somebody -- they admit 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's their business model?  Where does this come from? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  Your Honor, I think it comes 

   

  

 

 

 

 

from -- first, this was dismissed on the pleadings, so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we can develop it in the case.  But it comes from the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FTC report that analyzed the data of debt collectors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and --

 

            

they did. 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  The FTC says that's what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GEYSER:  It says they buy debts for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pennies on the dollar.  The amount of the debt --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why didn't the FTC then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

bring an action against them if that's what they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing?

could do such a thing.  We have the sanctions in the

MR. GEYSER:  Congress wanted this, too.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

entire purpose of the FDCPA is to use the private 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney general function to police professional debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collector misconduct.

right? 

            

            

MR. GEYSER:  That's correct.

MR. GEYSER:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And if they withdraw the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

claim at that point, there's no sanctions, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Unless --

inherent powers.  But that's a rare action where a judge

resorts to inherent powers. 

 

 

 

45 

            

            

MR. GEYSER:  That's exactly --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This model -- this model 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is beautiful.  You file a claim you know is old.  If you 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get paid, wonderful.  If somebody objects, you withdraw 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  There's no sanction that's possible. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

going. 

            

MR. GEYSER:  That's correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And it just keeps on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GEYSER:  It -- it does.  And that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

exactly why you need the FDCPA as a backstop and why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress designed it as an overlay to existing remedies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calibrated for general creditors.  And we know that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Midland in fact does do exactly what you've described. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They file a time-barred claim.  They're caught.  Someone 

   

  

  

 

 

 

moves for sanctions.  They withdraw the claim.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

it -- it's a great system, but it's not exactly what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress intended in the Code. 

 

 

 

 

            

And just to respond, there is no benefit to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

including these time-barred claims in the Code, as Chief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Judge Wood explained in her Seventh Circuit dissent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The time bar is virtually exactly the same as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discharge injunction in the broadest majority of cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Debtors often don't list time-barred debts on their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

schedules because they don't care about them.  No one

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's a little hard for --

   

  

 

 

 

 

to imagine how to write a opinion to say that the law is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a trap for the unwary.  But that's -- that's in effect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you want us to say. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  Oh, not at all, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Our law is actually -- our rule is exactly the opposite. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The uncounseled person 

  

 

 

 

gets a notice of -- of demand for payment.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

uncounseled person doesn't know about a statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

limitations.  So it's a trap for the unwary.  But the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

law makes that trap.  That's my problem. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GEYSER:  Well, the FDCPA exists to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

protect the uncounseled person to avoid -- I'm sorry. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

sentence. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can finish your

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In our view, no creditor is entitled to file 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

a proof of claim in bankruptcy on a claim that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creditor knows is time barred.  When the bankruptcy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

system works --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that also true in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil action generally, forget bankruptcy? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.  In our view, in all 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

five court of appeals that considered the issue have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held --

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So if a -- if a creditor 

   

   

  

 

 

 

files suit on a debt that's time barred, the defendant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't raise it.  The judge said, I hereby grant an 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

award of $10,000 for the debt and I sanction you for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 11 -- under Rule 11. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, that's not -- there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are lots of situations where a prevailing party can be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanctioned for litigation conduct.  Under Rule 11, a --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

a district court judge has great discretion about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether to award sanctions, and there might be reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not to do so. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that a plausible 

   

  

 

 

scenario?  In other words, the -- the law allows 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recovery, but you sanction the attorney for getting it?

that most district courts would not -- would choose not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to exercise their discretion by awarding sanctions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you think that that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- that that is a plausible exercise of Rule 11 power? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, let me -- let me put 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it this way.  You can imagine --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  To sanction someone 

  

 

 

 

because they prevailed in a case. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  I think it's --

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's without any 

  

 

 

 

misleading.  All they've done is file a suit. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  I think it is plausible, 

    

 

 

 

 

but unlikely to happen.  But if -- but if you can think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about it more broadly.  If you can imagine a system 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where a plaintiff was permitted and entitled, in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's words, to come in and throw up any possible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal argument no matter how frivolous, and the burden 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was on the defendant to shoot all of those arguments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down, that is not the system that we have adopted.  Rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11, every court of appeals to consider the issue has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested -- has held that Rule 11 requires a party to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certify that it has done a reasonable investigation and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

has a good faith-basis for believing that its claims are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warranted by law.  Every court of appeals that has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered it has said that that includes forebearing

from filing a lawsuit when it is obvious that it is --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there's a landscape of defense. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's bankruptcy and that's 

  

 

 

 

 

what worries me.  Of course there will be a set of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims where the person is behaving pretty badly.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a remedy right in the Code.  It's called a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanction.  Moreover, if they really go around doing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this, I don't know why the FTC wouldn't bring a claim 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying this is an unfair business practice.  So if in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact you say they also have a remedy under this other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act, it's quite possible, given the remedies that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have under the other act, that lawyers won't move for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanctions.  They won't bother with it. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Exactly. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  They will go right into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

court and then we'll have two sets of courts and other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people trying to decide the same question.  The same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem that was bothering me 15 minutes ago and I'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like to -- I'd like to know what you think of that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  I'd love to tell you.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

exact same thing is true in the general civil litigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context, that there is the possibility of Rule 11 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanctions just like there's a possibility of Rule 9011 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanctions.  In the very statutory findings in the FDCPA, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress said in our view, existing legal remedies are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

not sufficient to deter this kind of conduct from debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 

collectors. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, bankruptcy is 

  

 

 

 

 

very different.  The whole idea is let's get everything 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here in one place and -- and deal with it, you know, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different priorities and all of that.  I think it's much 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more significant if you have things spinning out of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy estate being adjudicated elsewhere than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact that you might have it as a general matter in -- in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district courts. 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

it's a bedrock principle of bankruptcy that a creditor's 

   

   

 

 

 

 

rights with respect to a debt are defined by State law. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When a debt is time barred, State law has determined 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that debt is not judicially enforceable.  Nothing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the bankruptcy gives a creditor an extra right to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicially enforce the debt.  That's --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you place any weight 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on this Fair Debt Collection Act being limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular kinds of creditors; that is, this is not for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your everyday creditor.  It is only for these debt 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collectors. 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  That's right, Justice 

  

 

 

 

Ginsburg.  I want to just emphasize, though, that in the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's view, this case is as much about abuse of

bankruptcy as it is about a violation of the FDCPA.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51 

way we think --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  If that's so, then why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not -- what about this.  It's a little complicated as a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solution and so I'm pretty nervous.  I don't know that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'd really do this.  But you'd say okay.  The word in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the debt collection act is unfair and where it's in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy, there's a whole system to decide if it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unfair by people who know about it.  So where a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy court does in fact say that it's unfair and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanctions a party for this unfair behavior.  In that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

case, it's unfair within the meaning of the debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collection act and in that case, you can go and bring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your extra remedy. 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  So there are two reasons, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, why that would not work.  The first is, as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor pointed out, there's a safe haven in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rule 9011, just like there is in Rule 11 since 1993 that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allows a creditor to withdraw in offending a proof of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

claim when it's objected to.  Now, I just want to point 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out, if a -- if a creditor really has a basis for -- a 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good-faith basis for believing that its claim is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforceable, it will presumably assert that in response 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to an objection.  That's not what happened here. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But the second is that there is even more

reason to be cautious about this in bankruptcy than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

there is in general civil litigation.  Because by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

operation of Rule 3001 of the bankruptcy rules and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 502 of the Code, a proof of claim, when it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failed, makes the underlying claim presumptively valid. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think this good faith 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense is objective or subjective? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  We think it's objective --

  

 

 

 

 

 

or it's the same -- it's basically the same. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  It's objective? 

  

 

 

MS. HARRINGTON:  It's objective.  All we are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

doing is saying the same standard that would be applied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under Rule 9011 or Rule 11 should be applied here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And you said -- take the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case of -- this was the third debt collection act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You're just talking about debt collectors.  So -- but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's under bankruptcy, you have a single creditor, a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

person who owns a sandwich shop has a claim.  It's -- it 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

turns out that it's clearly barred by the statute of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations, files that claim.  That's sanctionable 

  

 

 

 

 

conduct? 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  As a practical matter, it 

   

  

 

 

 

probably wouldn't be because they would withdraw. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  As legal matter, it would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under your interpretation.

period didn't apply in that case because of tolling or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some other equitable principle --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Subjective.  They were

MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, Rule 9011 requires a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer or another party to certify they have done a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable investigation and have a good-faith basis for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

believing that their claims are warranted by existing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  And so if they haven't done that reasonable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation or if they have ignored the results of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that investigation, which must have been happened here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then they violated Rule 9011 and engaged in unfair and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misleading practices. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What other 

  

 

 

 

affirmative defenses does your theory apply to? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, think about freedom 

  

 

 

 

 

from the defense of res judicata.  If a creditor had 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sued in state claim on a timely -- a timely debt, and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the state court had said:  This is not a valid claim. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We wouldn't want a system where that creditor could then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

file a proof of claim in bankruptcy, hoping that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim would just slip through the cracks and get paid

even though the creditor knew for sure --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  A lot of these 

    

 

 

 

 

affirmative defenses though in -- aren't presented as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abstractly as that.  They may involve nuances. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

54 

            

We have cases about the scope of res 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judicata and when it applies.  What other -- I assume 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your argument applies to every affirmative defense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Only if it's obvious, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if the creditor doesn't -- is able to access all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information without discovery.  That's the rule that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

been applied in the Rule 11 context --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The Rule applies to every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

affirmative defense. 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Every obvious affirmative 

  

 

 

 

defense where the creditor or the plaintiff --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are there any nonobvious 

  

 

 

 

 

affirmative defenses to which it wouldn't apply? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  I mean, I think something 

    

   

 

 

like contributory negligence may be kind of a classic 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmative defense that would be -- it would be hard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to say that the plaintiff in the civil litigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had an --

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How about a lack -- lack 

   

  

 

 

 

 

of personal jurisdiction? 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Lack -- I mean, I guess it

depends on the circumstances.  If there's -- if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

creditor --

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You know -- you know there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is no personal jurisdiction, but you filed a -- filed a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit anyway, and the Rule says that -- that it has --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to make an objection. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  I don't think that would 

    

 

 

 

 

arise in a bankruptcy context, but in a civil litigation 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

context --

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm talking about just --

  

 

 

 

 

 

as ordinary civil litigation. 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  I think if -- what I would 

    

   

 

 

 

 

say is if the Court could sanction that under Rule 11, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then we think --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In the ordinary civil 

  

 

 

 

 

litigation, the defendant can always consent to personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  So it's -- it's --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And he can always consent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to the waiving of the statute of limitations by not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raising it. 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  But -- but not in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy because it's -- if it -- the debtor cannot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent to the -- to the payment of a time-barred claim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because that takes money away from other creditors --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why can't they consent?

Suppose it's Chapter 11?  Suppose they're trying to get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a plan?  Suppose the plan is a company that does 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

business in countries -- I know you don't believe there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are such countries, but there are, there are countries 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where it's a matter of honor to pay a debt.  And people 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually do pay debts. 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

            

MR. HARRINGTON:  I believe that. 

    

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So you could --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's easy to think of cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Justice Breyer, I --

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah. 

  

 

MS. HARRINGTON:  -- I -- I think the one 

   

   

  

 

 

 

thing everyone agrees on in this case is that if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy system works as Congress intended, 

 

 

 

 

 

100 percent of time-barred claims will be disallowed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That is what Congress intended, but --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, in Chapter 11 I'm not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure they did --

 

 

 

            

            

dispute. 

            

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Because it --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But regardless of that 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. HARRINGTON:  Okay.  This --

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is -- is -- is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

automatic stay applied to these actions or not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.  In our view these are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

claims within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- so they can't proceed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the -- the -- under the ^ cap? debt act until the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy is over. 

 

 

            

            

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  That's true, yes. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

MS. HARRINGTON:  And -- and also, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in terms of the discharge, the FDCPA gives the debtor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the right to ask not to be contacted any more by a debt 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collector, which is basically the functional equivalent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a discharge, and the anti-discrimination provisions 

   

 

 

 

 

apply to any dischargeable debt, not just debt that has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been discharged, and so that would apply to these -- to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these types of debts. 

 

 

 

            

And so I just think it -- there is nothing 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the code that gives a creditor the right to try to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sneak one through when the creditor knows that if it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objected to, it should be disallowed --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is your argument --

  

 

 

 

 

MS. HARRINGTON:  -- 100 percent of the time. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- dependent on a view of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the code that precludes these kinds of claims? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes.  Yes.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So if -- if one looked at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the code and said, well, it seems as though these kinds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of claims, although unenforceable, can be filed, if that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58 

was your view of the code, what do you think follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from that? 

 

            

MS. HARRINGTON:  So then I think it would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

not be unfair and it would not misleading, and if I'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like -- if I could, I'd like to tell you why.  It's --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reason it's unfair here is because the creditor does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not have a right to get paid in bankruptcy on this type 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of claim and so it's unfair to try to do that and to put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other participants to the burden of making sure that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it doesn't happen. 

 

 

            

It's misleading because when you file a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proof of claim under Rule 9011 you're making an implicit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representation -- may I finish my sentence?  That you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

have done a reasonable investigation and have a good 

   

   

 

 

 

 

faith basis for believing that the claim is warranted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If it is warranted under the Bankruptcy Code then that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not misleading.

Mr. Chief Justice. 

 

 

59 

            

Just two points on rebuttal.  First, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think, with all due respect, the Court should be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned about the breadth of Respondent's position, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and let me lay out circumstances that I think would be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covered by Respondent's rule. 

 

 

 

              

A circumstance in which a claim has been 

   

 

 

 

 

discharged in a previous bankruptcy, a circumstance, in 

   

   

 

 

 

which a claim has in fact actually been paid off.  A 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance in which the claim is subject to a setoff, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or a circumstance in which the creditor simply gets the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong amount or the wrong person.  These circumstances, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm reliably informed, recur with some frequency in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy proceedings, and yet, in all of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances, after an objection is raised and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim is disallowed. 

 

 

   

There could be a claim that the 

   

 

 

 

 

claim itself was false or misleading under the FDCPA, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and a holding in Respondent's favor would really be a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recipe for clogging the courts with these sorts of FDCPA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims. 

            

And I would note, parenthetically, that to 

   

 

 

 

 

the extent the Respondent and the government's argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presupposes some absence of a good faith basis for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

believing that some of these objections are invalid. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's very hard to reconcile with the language of the

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

FDCPA because if there is one established principle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60 

about the operation of the FDCPA, it is that there is no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmative state of mind requirement.  And so what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent and the government would be asking you to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is to say, sure, there could be a prima facie claim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the FDCPA, but the only way in which a creditor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could escape liability would be to invoke the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmative defense in Section 1692k paragraph c, where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the violation is not intentional and results from a bona 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fide error which requires the maintenance of procedures 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonably calculated to avoid that error. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so, again, this is going to be a recipe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for bringing these FDCPA actions into play, and many, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many bankruptcies. 

 

            

And that leads me to my second point, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that this Court has never applied the FDCPA within 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the four corners of a bankruptcy proceeding, and I think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

that the problem with doing so here is that it really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't address the principle concern that Respondent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the government raises, and let me give you an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example as to why that's true. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Suppose you have a bank that holds credit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

card debt, and that bank actually doesn't sell that debt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on to a debt collector.  Well, that bank could do the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very same thing.  It could file a proof of claim, it

would be required to disclose that there is a prima 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61 

facie limitations defense, and yet, if that bank does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not qualify as a debt collector under the definition of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the FDCPA.  FDCPA liability would not be available, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that simply illustrates the fact that this is really a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem, if it is, in fact, a problem, with the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operation of bankruptcy, and it's a problem that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Congress or the advisory committee are -- are best 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situated to remedy, and so, for instance, if there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern about the limitations defense, one solution is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to eliminate the fact that that's a defense, and for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress to shift the burden back on to the creditor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But, again, that's a remedy in the particular context of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bankruptcy. 

            

And just to address, finally, the 

 

 

 

 

 

government's broader argument about the sanctionability 

 

 

 

 

 

of conduct outside bankruptcy.  This Court has never 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

held that it would be a violation of Rule 11 for a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff to file a complaint in the face of an obvious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense, whether it's a limitations defense or some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

other type of defense.  And notwithstanding the rather 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cursory analysis in the court of appeals' cases that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent and the government cites, I would 

   

 

 

 

 

respectfully submit that that would be an astonishing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposition for civil litigants if this Court were to
