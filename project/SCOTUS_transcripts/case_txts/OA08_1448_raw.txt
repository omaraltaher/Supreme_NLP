 (10:04 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 08-1448, 

Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Association.

 Mr. Morazzini.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ZACKERY P. MORAZZINI

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The California law at issue today before 

this Court differs from the New York law at issue in 

Ginsberg in only one respect:  Where New York was 

concerned with minors' access to harmful sexual material 

outside the guidance of a parent, California is no less 

concerned with a minor's access to the deviant level of 

violence that is presented in a certain category of 

video games that can be no less harmful to the 

development of minors.

 When this Court in Ginsberg crafted a rule 

of law that permits States to regulate a minor's access 

to such material outside the presence of a parent, it 

did so for two fundamental reasons that are equally 

applicable this morning in this case.

 First, this rule permits parents' claim to

authority in their own household to direct the 

upbringing and the development of their children; and, 

secondly, this rule promotes the States' independent 

interest in helping parents protect the well-being of 

children in those instances when parents cannot be 

present.

 So this morning, California asks this Court 

to adopt a rule of law that permits States to restrict 

minors' ability to purchase deviant, violent video games 

that the legislature has determined can be harmful to 

the development and the upbringing -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's a deviant -- a 

deviant, violent video game?  As opposed to what?  A 

normal violent video game?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Yes, Your Honor.  Deviant 

would be departing from established norms.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  There are established norms 

of violence?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Well, I think if we look 

back -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, some of the Grimms' 

fairy tales are quite grim, to tell you the truth.

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Not at all, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What's the difference? 

I 

mean, if you -- if you are supposing a category of 

violent materials dangerous to children, then how do you 

cut it off at video games?  What about films?  What 

about comic books?  Grimms' fairy tales?

 Why are video games special?  Or does your 

principle extend to all deviant, violent materials in 

whatever form?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  No, Your Honor.  That's why 

I believe California incorporated the three prongs of 

the Miller standard.  So it's not just deviant violence. 

It's not just patently offensive violence.  It's 

violence that meets all three of the terms set forth 

in -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think that misses 

Justice Ginsburg's question, which was:  Why just video 

games?  Why not movies, for example, as well?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Sure, Your Honor.  The 

California Legislature was presented with substantial 

evidence that demonstrates that the interactive nature 

of violent -- of violent video games where the minor or 

the young adult is the aggressor, is the -- is the

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, do you actually have 

studies that show that video games are more harmful to 

minors than movies are?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Well, in the record, Your 

Honor, I believe it's the Gentile and Gentile study 

regarding violent video games as exemplary teachers. 

The authors there note that video games are not only 

exemplary teachers of pro-social activities, but also 

exemplary teachers of aggression, which was the 

fundamental concern of the California Legislature in 

enacting this statute.

 So, while the science is continually 

developing -- indeed, it appears that studies are being 

released every month regarding -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What was the -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And suppose -- suppose a new 

study suggested that movies were just as violent.  Then, 

presumably, California could regulate movies just as it 

could regulate video games.

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Well, Your Honor, there is 

scientific literature out there regarding the impact of 

violent media on -- on children.  In fact, for decades,

the President, Congress, the FTC, parenting groups have 

been uniquely concerned with the level of violent media 

available to minors that they have ready access to. 

So -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know -- is that 

answering Justice Kagan's question?  One of the studies, 

the Anderson study, says that the effect of violence is 

the same for a Bugs Bunny episode as it is for a violent 

video.  So can the legislature now, because it has that 

study, say we can outlaw Bugs Bunny?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  No -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And there are people who 

would say that the cartoon has very little social value; 

it's entertainment but not much else.  This is 

entertainment.

 I'm not suggesting that I like this video, 

the one at issue that you provided the five-minute clip 

about.  To me, it's not entertainment, but that's not 

the point.  To some, it may well be.

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Justice Sotomayor, cartoons 

do not depart from the established norms to -- of a 

level of violence to which children have been 

historically exposed to.  We believe the level of 

violence in these video games -­

have been made when movies first came out.  They could 

have said, oh, we've had violence in Grimms' fairy 

tales, but we've never had it, you know, live on the 

screen.  I mean, every time there's a new technology, 

you can make that argument.

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Well, Your Honor, I think 

that's the beauty of incorporating the three prongs of 

the Miller standard into California's law.  This 

standard is very prophylactic and ensures that only a 

narrow category of material will be covered, certainly 

not Grimms' fairy tales.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How is this any 

different than what we said we don't do in the First 

Amendment field in Stevens, where we said we don't look 

at a category of speech and decide that some of it has 

low value.  We decide whether a category of speech has a 

historical tradition of being regulated.  Now, other 

than some State statutes that you point to, some of 

which are very clearly the same as those that we struck 

down in Wynn, where's the tradition of regulating 

violence?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Your Honor, California 

submits that when the rights of minors are at issue and 

not the rights of adults, the standard should be more 

flexible.  The Constitution should recognize that when

that it's directly harmful to the development of minors 

in the way that we know that violent video games can be. 

We know that violent material, like sexual material, 

appeals to a base instinct in -- in especially minors.

A 17-year-old?  A 10-year-old?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Your Honor, I would submit 

that, just like in the obscenity context for minors, a 

law similar to the New York law at issue in Ginsberg, 

though California's law hasn't been construed or 

applied, I would submit that the jury would be 

instructed to consider minors as a whole.  In California 

that's under 18 years old.  So I believe they would just 

be instructed minors as a class, not -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  How can they -- how can they 

do that?  Isn't the average person likely to think that 

what's appropriate for a 17-year-old may not be 

appropriate for a 10-year-old or an 8-year-old?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Your Honor, I think juries 

and judges do this every day in the 

variable obscenity -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But California doesn't do 

that.  California has in big letters "18."  So it's not 

-- is it okay for a 7-year-old?  Is it okay for a 

12-year-old?  Part of this statute requires labeling 

these video games in big numbers "18."  So it's 18, and 

California doesn't make any distinctions between 

17-year-olds and 4-year-olds.

consider -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because the average minor 

is halfway between 0 and 18, is that 9 years old?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Fair point, Justice Scalia. 

I think a jury could be instructed as to the typical age 

group of minors that are -- that are playing these 

games.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why wouldn't you, if 

necessary, simply say that -- that a -- a video game 

that appeals to the prurient, shameful, or morbid 

interests of those 18 or under, but let's take 18, and 

it's not suitable in the community for those 18, and it 

has no redeeming importance of any kind, no serious 

literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for 

those 18, that at least as to those, you can't sell it 

without -- the parent can buy it, but the child can't 

buy it.  So you can't sell to a 12-year-old something 

that would be horrible for an 18-year-old.  Is that -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Morazzini, could I take 

you back to Justice Scalia's original question, which 

was what counts as deviant violence or morbid violence? 

Because I read your briefs all the way through, and the 

only thing that I found was -- you said was clearly 

covered by this statute was Postal 2.  But presumably 

the statute applies to more than one video game.  So 

what else does it apply to?  How many video games?  What 

kind of video games?

 I mean, how would you describe in plain 

English what -- what morbid violence is, what you have 

to see in a video game for it to be covered?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Okay, Justice Kagan, I would 

go back to the language of the statute, and the statute 

covers video games where the range of options available 

to the player includes maiming, killing, dismembering, 

torturing, sexually assaulting, and those types of 

violence.  So I would look to games where -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So anything that has those 

kinds of violence counts?

as violent that are not covered?

jury could be instructed with expert testimony, with 

video clips of game play, and to judge for 

themselves whether -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not concerned about the 

jury judging.  I'm concerned about the producer of the 

games who has to know what he has to do in order to 

comply with the law.  And you're telling me, well, a 

jury can -- of course, a jury can make up its mind, I'm 

sure.  But a law that has criminal penalties has to be 

clear.  And how is the manufacturer to know whether a 

particular violent game is covered or not?

look -­

jury and -- and try it before -- you know -­

material to judge whether or not it's a -- it's in -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let me just make one 

comment on that point.  It seems to me all or at least 

the great majority of the questions today are designed 

to probe whether or not this statute is vague.  And you 

say the beauty of the statute is that it utilizes the 

categories that have been used in the obscenity area and 

that -- that there's an obvious parallel there.

 The problem is, is that for generations 

there has been a societal consensus about sexual 

material.  Sex and violence have both been around a long 

time, but there's a societal consensus about what's 

offensive for sexual material, and there are judicial 

discussions on it.  Now, those judicial discussions are

not precise.  You could have had the same questions 

today with reference to an obscenity statute, and we 

have -- we have said that with reference to obscenity, 

there are certain -- that there are certain materials 

that are not protected.  Those rules are not precise at 

the margins, and some would say not precise in a more 

significant degree as well.

 But you're asking us to go into an entirely 

new area where there are no consensus, no judicial 

opinions.  And this is -- and this indicates to me the 

statute might be vague, and I just thought you'd like to 

know that -- that reaction.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Justice Kennedy, as with 

sexual -- the regulation of sexual material and 

obscenity, we had to start somewhere.  California is 

choosing to start now.  We can build a consensus as to 

what level of violence is in fact patently offensive for 

minors, is deviant for minors, just as the case law has 

developed over time with sexual depictions.  Your Honor, 

I believe the key is the -- the similarities violence 

has with sex.  This is material -­

glorification of drinking, movies that have too much

Official 

 I -- I am not just concerned with the 

vagueness.  I am concerned with the vagueness, but I'm 

concerned with the First Amendment, which says Congress 

shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.  And 

it was always understood that the freedom of speech did 

not include obscenity.  It has never been understood 

that the freedom of speech did not include portrayals of 

violence.

 You're -- you're asking us to create a -- a 

whole new prohibition which the American people never -­

never ratified when they ratified the First Amendment. 

They knew there were -- you know, obscenity was -- was 

bad, but what's next after violence?  Drinking? 

Smoking?  Movies that show smoking can't be shown to 

children?  Does -- will that affect them?  Of course, I 

suppose it will.

 But is -- is that -- are -- are we to sit 

day by day to decide what else will be made an exception 

from the First Amendment?  Why -- why is this particular 

exception okay, but the other ones that I just suggested 

are not okay?

courts -- that the country, legislatures, can regulate 

are fighting words?  And we regulate fighting words, 

don't we?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Absolutely.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Because they provoke 

violence.  And the American Psychological Association 

and the American Pediatric Association have said that 

certain kinds of video games here create violence when 

children are exposed.  There are 80 people who think to 

the contrary.  There are two huge things of meta­

studies that think that -- not to the contrary.  All 

right.  So what are we supposed to do?

find it hard to believe, and I know of no historical 

evidence that suggests, that our Founding Fathers, in 

enacting the First Amendment, intended to guarantee 

video game retailers' First Amendment right -­

what Justice Breyer was asking?  Because this Court,

your face" and provoke an immediate action -- the Court 

has been very careful to cordon that off so it doesn't 

have this spillover potential.  So you -- you didn't 

latch on to fighting words.  Your analogy is to 

obscenity for teenagers, as I understand it.

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  With 

regard to fighting words, the -- the societal interest 

in preventing acts of violence is -- is different than 

the concern at issue here today.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So could I just make -- make 

sure I understand that, Mr. Morazzini, because, as I 

understand, the State has given up its argument that the 

interest protected by this law is an interest in 

preventing minors who see these games from going out and 

committing violent acts themselves; that the State is 

not saying that that's the interest in the law; is that 

correct?  That instead the State is saying that the 

interest in the law is in protecting children's moral 

development generally?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Justice Kagan, we welcome 

that as -- as an effect of California's regulation, but 

the primary interest was the internal intrinsic harm to 

minors.  That's what the State of California is deeply 

concerned with in this case.

for selling to a minor, and the other is a requirement 

that you label in a certain way each video.  The 

district court said both were -- I think the circuit

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And your brief has not 

addressed the labeling requirements at all.

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Well, we didn't, Your Honor, 

because one holding of the Ninth Circuit hinged upon the 

other.  In striking down the body of California's law, 

the restriction on the sale, the court found that since 

it's not illegal to sell these games to 18-year-olds, 

that the governmental purpose served behind the label 

itself was -- was in fact misleading.  So under the 

Zauderer case law -- I don't have the case cite before

labeling, so long as it's necessary to prevent 

misleading the consumer.

 The Ninth Circuit found that because they 

struck down the body of our law, that the "18" label 

would be misleading.  So that -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's an interesting 

concession on your part, that the labeling doesn't have 

a need separate from the restriction on sale.  I would 

have thought that if you wanted a lesser restriction, 

that you would have promoted labeling as a reasonable 

strict scrutiny restriction to permit the control of 

sale of these materials to minors, but you seem to have 

given up that argument altogether.

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Justice Sotomayor, I 

certainly did not attempt or intend to concede that the 

Ninth Circuit's opinion was correct in any sense in this 

case.

it by not appealing it, but okay.  We're not -- your

they're entitled to direct the development and the 

upbringing of their children in the manner they see fit.

of California that the parent -- that we ensure that the 

parent can involve themselves in this important 

decision.

all this is, is a -- a law to help parents; is that 

right?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  It's one of the two 

fundamental interests that are served by this law, yes, 

ensuring that parents can involve themselves in the 

front end.  California sought to erect a barrier in 

between a retail sales clerk and a minor with regard to 

violent material, just as we allow for minors' access to

sexual material, because California sees that the 

developmental harm that could be caused to minors is no 

less significant than that recognized by this Court in 

-- in Ginsberg with regard to minors' exposure to sexual 

material.  Now, again, the material at issue in Ginsberg 

was not obscene.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think there's any 

barrier in California to minors' access to sexual 

material?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  I -- I believe California 

has a law, Penal Code Section 313.1.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  California has a 

Ginsberg-type law.

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Does your office spend a lot 

of time enforcing that?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  I'm not aware, 

Justice Alito.  But there is a proscription on the sale 

of sexual material to minors.  It's defined as harmful 

to minors, similar to California's Act.  In fact, 

California's Act, in incorporating the three prongs of 

Miller, goes even further than the Ginsberg law at issue 

in Ginsberg v. New York.

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Justice Scalia, California's 

not doing that here.  The standard is quite similar to 

that in the sexual material realm.  California is not 

acting as a censor.  It is telling manufacturers and 

distributors to look at your material and to judge for 

yourselves whether or not the level of violent content 

meets the prongs of this definition.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I can see your white 

light's on.  But even if we get past what I think are 

difficult questions about vagueness and how to interpret 

this law, isn't there a less restrictive alternative 

with the -- a V-chip?

Internet search for bypassing parental controls brings

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. SMITH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The California law at issue restricts the 

distribution of expressive works based on their content. 

California, as we've heard today, does not seriously 

contend that it can satisfy the usual First Amendment 

standards that apply to such a law.  Instead, it's 

asking this Court to grant it a new free pass, a 

brand-new Ginsberg-like exception to the First Amendment 

that would deny constitutional protection to some 

ill-defined subset of expressive works and, I submit, 

not just video games, but necessarily movies, books, and 

any other expressive work that describes or portrays 

violence in a way that some court somewhere, some day, 

would decide is deviant and offensive.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about -- the 

distinction between books and movies may be that, in 

these video games, the child is not sitting there

passively watching something; the child is doing the 

killing.  The child is doing the maiming.  And I suppose 

that might be understood to have a different impact on 

the child's moral development.

 MR. SMITH:  Well, Your Honor, it might.  The 

-- the State of California has not marshaled a shred of 

evidence to suggest it's true.  And if you look at the 

social science -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What was -- what was 

the state of the record that was present before the 

Court in Ginsberg?

 MR. SMITH:  The state of the record was that 

they were aware of science on both sides, but made a 

judgment that as a matter of common sense, they could 

decide that obscenity, even somewhat at-large 

obscenity -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the Court acted 

on the basis of common sense?

 MR. SMITH:  Yes.  It said as long as there's 

science on both sides, but in that particular area, 

which is an exception based -- that goes back to the 

founding, they felt that it was -- it was proper for 

them to adjust the outer boundaries of the exception.

obscene.  They were girlie magazines.  I imagine to

that is important to recognize, they didn't pass on the 

particular material before the Court.  They simply said, 

is this somewhat larger a definition of variable 

obscenity going to be acceptable to -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Talking about common sense, 

why isn't it common sense to say that if a parent wants 

his 13-year-old child to have a game where the child is 

going to sit there and imagine he's a torturer and 

impose gratuitous, painful, excruciating, torturing 

violence upon small children and women, and do this for 

an hour or so, and there is no social or redeeming 

value, it's not artistic, it's not literary, et 

cetera -- why isn't it common sense to say a State has 

the right to say, parent, if you want that for your 

13-year-old, you go buy it yourself.  Which I think is 

what they're saying.

to have some reason to think that parents -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  It does, it does.  What it 

has is -- and I've looked at the studies, perhaps not as 

thoroughly as you, but it seemed to me that Dr. Ferguson 

and Dr. Anderson are in a disagreement.  They aren't in 

that much of a disagreement actually, but they've looked 

in depth at a whole lot of video games, not movies 

they're talking about or other things; they're talking 

about video games.

 And both groups come to the conclusion that 

there is some tendency to increase violence.  And the 

American Psychiatric -- Psychological Association and 

the American Pediatric Association sign on to a long 

list on -- I think it's the Anderson side that this does 

hurt children.

 I have to admit that if I'm supposed to be a 

sociological expert, I can't choose between them.  But 

if I can say could a legislature have enough evidence to 

think there's harm, the answer is yes.

 MR. SMITH:  There is two aspects of harm. 

The one I was about to address was the question of 

whether parents need additional help in exercising the 

role that they have played throughout the history -­

help because many parents are not home when their

children come home from school.  Many parents have jobs, 

I -- we hope.  And -- and when -- when their children 

are there, they do what they want.  And all this says 

is, if you want that gratuitous torture of, let's say 

babies, to make it as bad as possible, what you do, 

parent, is you go buy it; don't let him buy it on his 

own, and he's 13 years old.  Now, what's the common 

sense or what's the science of that?

 MR. SMITH:  Well, two aspects.  With respect 

to parental controls, Your Honor, there's a whole 

variety -- a whole series of things that parents have 

available to them and are using today to deal with any 

concerns that they have about what's appropriate for 

their children.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't want to 

interrupt your answer, but any 13-year-old can bypass 

parental controls in about 5 minutes.

 MR. SMITH:  That is one element of about 

five different elements, Your Honor.  And if I could 

talk about them -- there is the ratings.  Parents are 

doing the purchasing 90 percent of the time.  Even if 

the child does the purchasing, they bring the game home, 

the parent can review it.

 The game is being played in the home on the 

family television or computer most of the time.  Any

harm that's supposed to be inflicted on them is supposed 

to take place over a period of years, not minutes, so 

the parent has ample opportunity to exercise parental 

supervision over what games are being played in the 

house.  Plus there is the parental controls, which are 

very similar to the ones that the Court has found to be 

significant in the Playboy case, in the COPA case, in a 

whole variety of cases.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  How much do these videos 

cost?

 MR. SMITH:  They cost in the range of $50 to 

$60 when new, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not too many 13-year-olds 

walk in with a $50 bill, do they?

 MR. SMITH:  It seems very likely that the 

people, if there are any out there, buying games without 

parental permission -- which the State, by the way, has 

not even tried to show -- they are very likely in the 

16-year-old category.  The -­

buy a naked woman, but you can go and buy that, you say 

to the 13-year-old.  Now -- now, what sense is there to 

that?

 MR. SMITH:  Well, there's -- there's various 

aspects of this that I think it's important to 

understand.  First of all, violence has been a feature 

of works that we create for children and encouraged them 

to watch throughout the history of this country.  We

There is a difference.  We do not have a tradition in 

this country of telling children they should watch 

people actively hitting schoolgirls over the head with a 

shovel so they'll beg with mercy, being merciless and 

decapitating them, shooting people in the leg so they 

fall down -- I'm reading from the district court 

description -- pour gasoline over them, set them on 

fire, and urinate on them.  We do not have a tradition 

in this country.  We protect children from that.  We 

don't actively expose them to that.

 MR. SMITH:  And -- and parents have been 

doing that for -- since time immemorial.  The question 

before this Court is whether you're going to create an 

entirely new exception under the First Amendment, 

whether parents need to have such a new exception 

created, and whether or not, if you're going to do it, 

you could possibly figure out what the scope of that 

exception is.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is it your position

it your position that the First Amendment could not 

prohibit the sale to minors of the video game that I

the ESRB, the private voluntary system that exists, into

down in Interstate Circuit.  When you -- when the 

government does that and you have to go to them for 

permission to allow kids into the movies or to play this 

game, it is a prior restraint.  You have way too much 

discretion.  It's a licensing authority that the First 

Amendment doesn't allow.

judgments that they make about their children at 

different ages and with different content and different 

family values, and that's what -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Smith, is there 

any showing that the State could make that would satisfy 

you, that would say, yes, that's a sufficient showing 

for this law to go forward?

 You know, I understand that you think that 

the current studies don't suggest much of anything about 

harm.

 MR. SMITH:  No, they don't.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But -- but are there studies 

that would be enough?

 MR. SMITH:  Well, I guess I can imagine a 

world in which expression could transform 75 percent of 

the people who experience it into murderers.  That's 

clearly not the way the human mind works.  And here the 

reality is quite the opposite.  Dr. Anderson testified 

in the Illinois trial, which is in the record, that the 

vast majority of people playing the games will grow up 

and be just fine.  And, in fact, he -- he acknowledged 

that the effects of these games are not one whit 

different from watching cartoons on television or 

reading violent passages in the Bible or looking at a

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you really don't want 

to argue the case on that ground.  I -- I gather you 

don't believe that the First Amendment reads:  Congress 

shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech except 

those that make sense.  Is that -­

MR. SMITH:  Your Honor, my main ground today 

is exactly that, that this Court said last year in 

United States v. Stevens it doesn't have a freewheeling 

authority to create new exceptions to the First 

Amendment after 200 years based on a cost-benefit 

analysis, and this is -- this is a test of that.  This 

is exactly what the State of California is asking you to 

do.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But we have here a new -- a 

new medium that cannot possibly have been envisioned at 

the time when the First Amendment was ratified.  It is 

totally different from -- it's one thing to read a 

description of -- as one of these -- one of these video 

games is promoted as saying, "What's black and white and 

red all over?  Perhaps the answer could include 

disposing of your enemies in a meat grinder."  Now, 

reading that is one thing.  Seeing it as graphically

 JUSTICE ALITO:  -- and doing it is still a 

third thing.

 So this presents a question that could not 

have been specifically contemplated at the time when the 

First Amendment was adopted.  And to say, well, because 

nobody was -- because descriptions in a book of violence 

were not considered a category of speech that was 

appropriate for limitation at the time when the First 

Amendment was violated is entirely artificial.

 MR. SMITH:  We do have a new medium here, 

Your Honor, but we have a history in this country of new 

mediums coming along and people vastly overreacting to 

them, thinking the sky is falling, our children are all 

going to be turned into criminals.

 It started with the crime novels of the late 

19th century, which produced this raft of legislation 

which was never enforced.  It started with comic books 

and movies in the 1950s.  There were hearings across the 

street in the 1950s where social scientists came in and 

intoned to the Senate that half the juvenile delinquency 

in this country was being caused by reading comic books, 

and there was enormous pressure on the industry.  They 

censored -- they self-censored.  We have television.  We 

have rock lyrics.  We have the Internet.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Smith, do you think all 

video games are speech in the first instance?  Because 

you could look at these games and say they're the 

modern-day equivalent of Monopoly sets.  They're games. 

They're things that people use to compete.  You know, 

when you think about some of them -- the first video 

game was Pong.  It was playing tennis on your TV.  How 

is that speech at all?

 MR. SMITH:  The games that we are talking 

about have narrative, events that are occurring, 

characters, plot.  And that's exactly what the State has 

set out to regulate here.  It says if these events occur 

here -- there is violence, one person is hurting another 

person -- it has to be a human being who's the victim -­

and it's doing it in a -- in a way that they find 

offensive in some way, we're going to regulate it.  So, 

obviously, what -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So are we going to separate 

video games into narrative video games and non-narrative 

video games?

 MR. SMITH:  You don't have to, as long as 

the law is limited to regulating narrative.  That's what 

this law is limited to.  Now, if the law said you 

shouldn't buy -- play games that have red images that 

appear in them, or something else that was somehow

non-content based, that might be a closer case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, what -- what about a 

law that says you can't sell to minors a video game -­

it doesn't care what the plot is, but no video game in 

which the minor commits violent acts of maiming, 

killing, setting people on fire?  What about that? 

Would that -- would that be regulating speech?

 MR. SMITH:  Well, of course, Your Honor. 

That's exactly what -- what -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not speech.  You're 

saying you just can't let the kid maim -- maim, kill -­

MR. SMITH:  I'm sorry.  Were you -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- or set on fire.  What 

the law would be directed at is not the plot, not the 

video game itself, but the child's act of -- of 

committing murder, maiming, and so forth.

 MR. SMITH:  Well, the events in a video game 

are -- what happens in the plot is a combination of what 

the game gives you and what the player adds to it. 

There's a -- there's a creative aspect coming at it from 

the other side.  It's often referred to as a dialogue 

between the player and the game.  I would submit that 

both are completely protected by the First Amendment.

 MR. SMITH:  No.  The child is helping to 

make the plot, determine what happens in the events that 

appear on the screen, just as an actor helps to portray 

what happens in a play.  You're acting out certain 

elements of the play, and you're contributing to the 

events that occur and adding a creative element of your 

own.  That's what makes them different and in many ways 

wonderful.

specifically didn't decide whether it could be applied

 MR. SMITH:  Well, that's -- that's correct, 

Your Honor, but I think it's -- there's no argument 

here, I don't think, that if you can find one game out 

there to which this can constitutionally be applied, 

even though it would also be unconstitutionally applied 

under the vast run of other cases -­

think, is that there may be games and may be minors -­

maybe a less violent game sold to a 17-year-old, perhaps 

that violates the First Amendment, but something like 

Postal 2 sold to a 10-year-old might -- might well not 

violate the First Amendment to apply this law to that.

 MR. SMITH:  Well, that may be -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And the way we 

approached the issue in Stevens, where we had hunting 

videos and crush videos, would say that it's too broad 

to apply the law to everything, so we strike it down, 

it's overbroad, but leave open the possibility that a 

more narrowly drawn statute might pass muster.

 Why -- why isn't that a good approach here?

law, because this law is clearly much broader than any 

one game.  I would submit to you, though, that there's 

no way, in fact, anybody is going to be able to come 

back and draw a statute that gets to what they claim, 

because the English language is not susceptible of that 

level of precision.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So it's not 

susceptible.  Throughout you've been arguing your point, 

which is fair.  You have some experts who -- who favor 

you, and you make that point very strongly, and your 

point's a pretty good one and a serious one, that it's 

very hard to draw this line under traditional First 

Amendment standards.

 But I'd like you to deal with their point 

for a moment.  And I take it their point is:  There is 

no new First Amendment thing here.  There is a 

category -- call them X -- which really are involving 

things like torturing children, et cetera.  Maybe you 

don't like to sell them to anybody.  You have them X'd 

or some special thing.  But they exist, and they fit 

within a Miller-type definition.  They are much worse 

than the simple girlie magazine that was involved there. 

And they will use traditional First Amendment tests; 

that is to say, there is speech at issue, that speech is 

being limited, it is being done for a good reason,

compelling interest -- namely, this problem with the X 

videos and the torture and living it through -- and 

there is no less restrictive alternative that isn't also 

significantly less effective.

 See, I want you to deal with that directly, 

because what you have been doing for the most part is 

saying we have to be in some new, total new area, et 

cetera.  But their argument is you don't have to be in 

some totally new area, et cetera.  Apply traditional 

First Amendment standards, and we win.  That's their 

argument, and I'd like to hear what you have to say 

about that, specifically.

 MR. SMITH:  Your Honor, they do not suggest 

that there's any existing exception to the First 

Amendment that would apply to violence.

It is the traditional strict scrutiny First Amendment 

test.

come close to the kind of showing that would be required 

under -- under the First Amendment.

 First of all, they have not shown any 

problem, let alone a compelling problem, requiring 

regulation here in a world where parents are fully 

empowered already to make these calls, where crime, 

including violent crime, since the introduction of these 

games, has been plummeting in this country, down 50 

percent since the day Doom first went on the market 

15 years ago; in a world where parents are fully aware 

of what's going on in their homes and aware of the 

ratings system and can use all the other tools that we

don't have the same history of it.  There's no 

historical pedigree of that kind of an exception.  And, 

as I was suggesting earlier, there's a fundamental 

difference factually, which is Ginsberg works tolerably 

well because we take everything that's sexually explicit 

and appeals to a prurient interest, and we say over 

here, it's not appropriate for minors.

 Violence would require you to draw a much 

different line between acceptable protected violence and 

unacceptable unprotected violence for minors, and that

given the nature of what you're trying to do -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the courts -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The courts struggled for 

many, many years and are to some extent still struggling 

with obscenity.  They came up with basically what we 

might call the Miller standards.  And -- and the State 

has said this gives us a category that we can work with, 

with reference to violence.

 MR. SMITH:  And if you take the Miller 

standards and you take two things out of it -- you take 

out of it explicit sex and nudity, and you take out an 

appeal to prurient interest -- what do you have left?

apparent meaning.  There is no way to know how a court 

would apply a standard like deviant violence, morbid 

violence, offensive violence, let alone decide which 

video games have a redeeming social, political, artistic 

value.

 The value of a video game is completely in 

the eye of the beholder.  Some would say they're 

beautiful works of artistic creation; others would

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You could make all those 

arguments with reference to obscenity.

 MR. SMITH:  Except that you know -- we know, 

we all know, at least with respect to Ginsberg -- adult 

obscenity, I would acknowledge, is a very difficult 

line.  Adult -- Ginsberg works reasonably well, because 

if it has sex in it and naked people having sex in it 

and it's designed to be appealing to people's prurient 

interests, you don't give it to minors.  And you don't 

have a lot of cases out there about that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, and you started 

Ginsberg with something that is proscribable even with 

regard to adults.

 MR. SMITH:  Correct, Your Honor.

-- even as to adults; whereas in this case, I don't know 

that there's such a thing as morbid violence which could 

be eliminated from ordinary movies.

 MR. SMITH:  Let me -- I think a little 

history is helpful here.  This Court has twice dealt 

with laws attempting to regulate violent works in the 

past.  One was in Winters v. New York, where law applied 

to magazines and books, and one was in the 1960s.  On 

the very day Ginsberg came down, in the Interstate 

Circuit case, the City of Dallas had an ordinance where 

there was going to be a commission that was going to 

review each movie and decide if it was appropriate for 

children.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me be clear about 

exactly what your argument is.  Your argument is that 

there is nothing that a State can do to limit minors' 

access to the most violent, sadistic, graphic video game 

that can be developed.  That's your argument?

evidence at all in this record that actual children, not 

testers, are in fact disobeying their parents and 

secretly buying these games, bringing them into the

children.  Some of us may conclude that it does.

the studies at face value, it's not one whit more 

harmful than watching television cartoons.  That's what 

the record shows.

the hours when most children are awake, just the way 

pornography is.  I don't remember what -- what are the

several years trying to come up with a definition that 

would allow anybody to figure out which violent TV shows 

have to be put into this adult category and which don't,

 This is a very difficult task, trying to use 

language to differentiate levels of violence or types of 

violence in a manner that would in some way tell people 

what the rules of the game are.  I think, even if you 

think that there's some problem out there that needs to 

be solved, you ought to think very carefully about 

whether or not you're going to authorize the creation of 

some new rule authorizing regulation in this area, when 

no one will have any idea what the scope of it is.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And you say there's no 

problem because 16-year-olds in California never have 

$50 available to go buy a video game and because they 

never have TVs in their room, and their parents are 

always home watching what they -- they do with their 

video games, and the parents -- and the video games have

features that allow parents to block access, to block 

the playing of violent video games, which can't be 

overcome by a computer-savvy California 16-year-old; 

that's why there's no problem, right?

 MR. SMITH:  I guess, if what we're really 

going to do is judge the constitutionality of this law 

based on what 16- and 17-year-olds are getting and 

whether that would be harmful to them, I think the 

problem there is the line between 16 and 17 and 18 is so 

fine, that you're not going to be able to identify any 

real category of games that fits into that category.

 And it's important, by the way, to -- to 

note that California hasn't told us whether we should 

judge it for 5-year-olds, 10-year-olds, 17-year-olds. 

If it's 5-year-olds, then it's vastly over-restrictive; 

if it's 17-year-olds, I suspect -- I suspect it wouldn't 

restrict anything because nobody is going to be able to 

convince a -- jury, well, this is an 18-year-old game, 

not a 17-year-old game.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We draw that kind of 

line of course in the death penalty area, don't we? 

Between 18-year-olds?  You are under 18; you can't be 

sentenced to life without parole; if you were over 18, 

you can.

 MR. SMITH:  You do draw that line, Your

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And we do it for 

drinking; we do it for driving.

 MR. SMITH:  But here you're assessing works 

of expression and trying to decide what age they -- they 

would correspond to, and I don't think you can cut it 

that finely and say, well, this is an 18 game; this is 

only a 17 game.  I just don't think that works.  So if 

that's the test, the test Justice Breyer suggested it 

ought to be, then the statute essentially would restrict 

nothing.  If the test is 5-year-olds -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Stick to the X things, 

maybe.  Maybe it would restrict the total gratuitous 

torture.  And if that's what it restricted, why is that 

such a terrible thing?

 MR. SMITH:  Well, first of all -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  And as you experimented 

with other things, as they did in the obscenity area, 

you could discover you could limit it to that.

 MR. SMITH:  I think the "maybe" is telling, 

though, Your Honor.  Somebody, as Justice Scalia pointed 

out, in publishing a game has to know what -- what to -­

what the rules of the game are in advance, subject to 

hundreds of millions of dollars of penalties.  There's a 

$1,000 a game penalty if you have the wrong -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you have your rules, 

so why wouldn't the first step be they'd follow your 

rules?  Your rules.  The X things would be limited to 

people who are over 18, and we'll see if we ever get 

prosecuted for a different one.  And you might never.

 MR. SMITH:  Our rules wouldn't help you at 

all.  They say that -- that -- they're only restricting 

a smaller number, a small subset of M-rated games, 

which, by the way, we say are appropriate for 

17-year-olds.  So you have -- these ratings that the 

State wants us to impose are going to conflict with the 

ratings that are already on the packaging which are 

being used by parents every day to make these judgments. 

So it's actually interfering -- the prospect of it would 

interfere with the information already on the packaging.

 Thank you.

Smith.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ZACKERY P. MORAZZINI

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice.

 I wanted to address one point that has been 

raised about minors' ability to access these games.

Yes, new games do cost $60, but California's law also 

regulates the rental of these video games, which is just 

a few dollars per game.  So minors certainly can afford 

them and can access them.

 But I also wanted to draw out the point that 

California's law really is not an ordinance that's 

directed to a plot of a game.  It's expressly directed 

to games with essentially no plot, no artistic value. 

This is the helpful nature of the third prong of the 

Miller standard.  So it really is only going after the 

nature of the game where the child is acting out -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  If it has a 

plot, it has artistic value?  Is that going to be the 

test for artistic value?  Anything that has a plot?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  It will be one factor to be 

considered, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well -­

MR. MORAZZINI:  The nature of the plot and 

the nature of the -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, one factor to be 

considered, sure.  But you're not telling us that, so 

long as it has a plot, it's okay?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  No.  Your Honor, as this 

Court held in the Jacobellis case, a single quotation 

from Voltaire on the flyleaf of an otherwise obscene

work was not going to make that work non-obscene.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You can't have artistic 

videos that involve maiming and cutting off heads and 

eviscerating people, and pouring gas, right?  So long as 

its artistic, it's okay.

 MR. MORAZZINI:  No, if the -- if the level 

of the violence -- just as in obscenity, if the level of 

the violence causes the game as a whole to lack the 

artistic -- it's -- it's a balance, Your Honor, just as 

it is with sexual material.  Each aspect -- that's why 

violence and sex are so similar -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Artistic for whom?  For a 

5-year-old?  What a 5-year-old would appreciate as great 

art, is that going to be the test?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  No.  Again, minors as a 

class.  So those under 18 years old.  Those under -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's a candidate, meaning,

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Justice Kagan, by 

"candidate," I meant that the video game industry should 

look at it, should take a long look at it.  Now -- but I 

don't know off the top of my head.  I'm willing to state 

right here in open court that the video game Postal 2, 

yes, would be covered by this Act.  I'm willing to guess 

that games we described in our brief, such as MadWorld, 

would be covered by the Act.  I think the video game 

industry -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would a video game that 

portrayed a Vulcan, as opposed to a human being, being 

maimed and tortured -- would that be covered by the Act?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  No, it wouldn't, Your Honor, 

because the Act is only directed towards the range of 

options that are able to be inflicted on a human being.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if the -- if the 

video producer says this is not a human being, it's an 

android computer-simulated person, then that doesn't -­

all they have to do is put a little part or feature on 

the creature and they could sell the video game?

 MR. MORAZZINI:  Under the Act, yes, because 

California's concern -- I think this is one of the 

reasons that sex and violence are so similar.  These are 

base physical acts we're talking about, Justice 

Sotomayor.  So limiting, narrowing our law here in 

California -- there in California -- to violence, 

violent depictions against human beings -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what happens when the 

character gets maimed, head chopped off, and immediately 

after it happens they spring back to life and they 

continue their battle?  Is that covered by your Act? 

Because they haven't been maimed and killed forever. 

Just temporarily.

 MR. MORAZZINI:  I would think so.  The 

intent of the law is to limit minors' access to those 

games -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You think so?  Isn't 

that feedback to Justice Scalia's question?
