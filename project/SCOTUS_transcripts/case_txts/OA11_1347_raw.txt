 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. MANELY 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

circumstances presented here in this international

9  please the Court: 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  because reversal of the district court's judgment could 
17  grant Sergeant Chafin relief in three ways, each 
18  sufficient to preclude mootness. 
19
20
21  district court or court of appeals should order 
22  Ms. Chafin to bring the child back to the United States 
23  and overturn the monetary award.  And, third, it would 
24  effectuate relief in the ongoing Alabama case and the 
25

States is the child's habitual residence.  Second, the 

 Sergeant First Class -- First Class Chafin's 

appeal from the district court's decision is not moot 

Scottish case by, one, letting Alabama courts proceed to 

 First, a reversal would mean that the United

UCCJEA, which is what the State of Alabama would use,

3
4  difference?  Once -- once the decision -- the district 
court decision is vacated, then the State court can go 
5
6  forward.  There is nothing that inhibits it from doing 
7  so.  There is no Federal court order.  So your third 
8  point, I think, is --
9
10
11  there is a home State requirement that the child must be 
12  presently -- six months before the action is commenced. 
13
 Not so much from the district court order, 
14  but coming down from the Alabama Supreme Court, but 
15
16  determined that Alabama was not the home State of the 
17  child.  So it's sort of like the traffic light that we 
18  talk about in our brief.  It would allow the Alabama 
19  courts to say --
20
21 
22
23
24  months be satisfied? 
25

 MR. MANELY:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So how would these six

premised upon the original district court order, it was

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why would it make any

Convention order.  You -- you're not inhibited by 

 MR. MANELY:  Except for the fact that there 
is an error in the determination of habitual residence. 

1  child, we would argue, is wrongfully in Scotland based 
2  upon an errant district court --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you can argue that on 
3
4  the basis of the vacation of the district court's Hague 
5
6  anything, as far as I can see, that the Federal court 
7  has done.  Since it's been vacated, it's as though it 
8  never happened. 
9
10
11
 And I understand what you're saying, but 
12  the -- the res of the controversy needs to be brought 
13  back here.  That -- that would be the appropriate remedy 
14  here, so that we have not only the habitual court -- or 
habitual residence determination in the district court 
15
16  because of reversal, but that we have the child brought 
17  back here.  And then that six --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you don't have -- you 
18
19  don't have that individual -- the residence -- habitual 
20
21
22
23  ability to grant a remedy here, and that is the reversal 
24  of that determination, so that we go back to habitual 
25

residence in the United States.  That's what avoids 

residence determination because it's been wiped out. 

 MR. MANELY:  Yes, Your Honor.  I understand. 
 What our argument is, is that there is an 

5

 MR. MANELY:  Bring the child back.  Yes, 

would be seized of jurisdiction sufficient then to 
determine the habitual residence. 

 MR. MANELY:  Yes, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Whatever the State --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Wouldn't the Alabama --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What you're saying is 
the return of the child, essentially, back to Alabama? 

1  mootness in this case.  There is a remedy that can be 
2  provided here.  It is not impossible. 
3
4
5
6
7  Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so once the child is 
8
9  back in Alabama, that's the remedy, then the State court 
10
11 
12
13
14  well, presumably, the child only comes back if you win. 
15
16
17  the child would come back, and the Alabama courts could 
18  then seize the custody determination.

 MR. MANELY:  The Alabama --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that what you're saying? 
MR. MANELY:  No, the Alabama court would 

MR. MANELY:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So presuming you win, 

 MR. MANELY:  Right.  Proceed under --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the Alabama court would 

not have jurisdiction if the child had been wrongfully 
removed?

habitual residence was -- was in the U.K. 

 MR. MANELY:  Yes, sir.  Yes, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That being the case, the

2  this Court should determine that it is moot when a child 
3  is removed from the boundaries of our -- of our nation. 
4  The Alabama --
5
6  opinion below has been vacated. 
 MR. MANELY:  Yes, sir. 
7
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So there's -- there's 
8
9  nothing which says that this child -- this child's 
10
11
12
13  only question is will the Alabama court proceed, even --
14  assuming that it finds the child's habitual residence

16  been taken out of the jurisdiction?  And I understand 
17  that it would. 
18
19  district court determination in the first place, 
20
21
22  hasn't been.  It's been vacated.  It's as though it 
23  never happened.

 MR. MANELY:  The posture below is that the 
Eleventh Circuit vacated the opinion in February; but, 

was in Alabama, would it proceed, even if the child had

 What we hope to do is, by going back down to 

the Eleventh Circuit, obtaining a reversal --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's bad law.  I 

MR. MANELY:  Yes, sir.  It goes --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Was their reasoning that 

1  as recently as July of this year, the Alabama Supreme 
2  Court said, well, since the matter was determined moot, 
3  then only the divorce can proceed.

8  decision of a Federal court?  My goodness, I never heard 
9  of anything like that. 
10
11
12  the child was initially removed properly because there 
13  had been an order permitting the mother to go? 
14
15
16 
17
18
19  is, since the case is moot, nothing has vacated the

21
 MR. MANELY:  Correct.  And by reversing, 
22  then we're going back to what was argued to make the 
23  case moot in the first place.  We can bring the child 
24  back, and we'll reverse --

 MR. MANELY:  At that moment, yes.  And by --

MR. MANELY:  Yes, Your Honor.  Absent -- and 
she was present at the trial in the district court.  So 
there are provisions that would allow her to return for 
that particular reason.  And, of course, she can 
reapply, I think, after something like five years.  She 
was deported because she had overstayed her visa.

Scotland, we would refer to on a State level, as being a

to stay with.  That's an important time frame.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 Put simply, this case is not moot because an 
appellate decision on the merits would matter.  What the 

1
2
3  please the Court: 
4
5
6  Court has been discussing today is there are various 
7  ways in which the appellate decision might matter. 
8  There are ways that there would be a judgment that the 
9  father either did or did not wrongfully retain the 
10
11
 Part of the wrongful retention determination 
12  is the 900 -- or the $94,000 in money damages.  There is 
13  a question of whether the child might remain in the U.K. 
14  or be brought back to the U.S.  And then there's the 
question of which courts are going to decide custody, 
15
16  Alabama or Scottish courts. 
17
18  this Court doesn't need to figure out all of the 
19  different details of Alabama State law or of custody law 
under the Scottish proceedings.  All the Court needs to 
20
21  decide is that the appellate court's decision would make 
22  a difference here.  And it's -- it's just not the case 
23  that you could say it's moot because it doesn't make a 
24  difference. 
25

 And we don't need to know precisely -- and 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But we don't know it'll

1  make a difference without answering those questions. 
 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, I'm glad --
2
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, you want us to --
3
4  to say it might make a difference, and that's enough, 
5
6
 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, this Court has said 
7  that, as long as there's any possibility of effectual 
8  relief, that the case is not moot.  So --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you should put it 
9
that way, then.  It doesn't -- you don't know that it 
10
11  makes a difference, but you don't have to know, right? 
12
 MS. SAHARSKY:  That's what I would say is 
13  that you don't have to know. 
14
declaratory judgment that the father either did or did 
15
16  not wrongfully retain the child in the U.S., that is a 
17  piece of paper in the world that has consequences to 
18  these parties.  It has consequences in terms of the 
19  money judgment that's been entered, and it has 
consequences in terms of where custody will be 
20
21  determined. 
22
23  Convention case is to get the child in the place of 
24  habitual residence, so that those courts, under their

States, and we -- we start over.  The whole object of 
the return procedure is so that you get the child to a 
place that's a proper place to determine custody; isn't 
that right? 

1
2  mean, the whole object of the Hague Convention is to 
3  stop this shuttling the child back and forth.  But, 
4  because of this unfortunate situation we have, where the 
5
6  you're -- what you're urging is exactly what this 

7  Convention was meant to stop. 

 This child has been in Scotland for 14 

8
9  months.  Now, you say bring it back to the United 

10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  forth.  And we think that the way to accommodate those 
17  concerns are by stays in appropriate cases, where the 
18  four factor test that -- with respect to a likelihood of 
19  success on the merits and a balancing of the equities is 
20
21  appellate proceedings, that those proceedings be 
22  expedited, the decisions made quickly. 
23
24  and say that, if a stay is not in place, that that still 
does not deprive the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction to

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes.  We share your concerns 

about not wanting the child to be shuttled back and

2
 MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes.  That's what we would 

3  say, that the case is not moot.  The court of appeals 

4  should be able to go forward with the case. 

5
6  by the losing party, then the child should be returned 
7  to the country of habitual residence because a 
8  determination has been made that that's the country 
9  where the child should be, and there's not a good 
10
11
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You agree that the 
12  ideal -- the ideal procedure would be, and I quite 
13  agree, that you have a very fast track stay pending 
14  appeal and an expedited appeal.  But there is no rule 
that -- that requires that, so how -- how could that 
15
16  sensible procedure be put in place? 
17
18  under the normal court appellate rules, that that 
19  effectively is what happens using the American stay 
20

22  appropriate four factor showing is made for a stay, that 
23  then a stay would be appropriate, and an expedited 
24  appeal would be appropriate.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes.  And the district court 
1
2  entered a brief order; so the district court did not go 
3  through the various factors, but, presumably, that is 
4  the standard the district court would have used. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I ask a question? 
5
6  Does it matter?  Meaning, whether a stay is granted or 
7  not, you are, I don't think, taking the position that 
8  only if the stay is granted is the court of appeals 
9  seized of jurisdiction.  You're saying the case is not 
10
11
12  mootness question and the stay questions are two 
13  separate questions.  And you don't want to have to say 
14  the person has to get a stay in every single case; 
15
16  appeal. 
17
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Now, under 
18  the Convention, if the child -- if it goes back to the 
19  district court now to fashion a remedy, it could order 
20
21  bringing the child back after 14 months presents a great 
22  risk to the child under the Convention and not order the 
23  return, correct? 
24
25

addresses that; but the district court could make that 

otherwise, their case becomes moot.  They lose their 

return, it could decide under the Convention that 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  We don't think the Convention

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they have the power, 

if they choose it, but they don't have to choose it; 
that's the bottom line, correct? 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So we just don't know 

1  determination using its equitable discretion. 
2
3  what the court's going to do, but some form of relief is 
4  possible.  That's why you used the word "possible." 
MS. SAHARSKY:  That is exactly -- that is 
5
6  exactly our position.  We don't know what the courts 
7  would do.  We're glad to discuss the possibilities with 
8  the Court; but the standard is the possibility of 
9  relief, it doesn't need to --
10
11 
12 
13
 MS. SAHARSKY:  That's exactly right.  The 
14  position of the other side is that there is absolutely 
nothing that the courts can do in these circumstances 
15
16  once the child leaves.  And we just think that the 
17  Convention doesn't say that.  It doesn't mandate that. 
18  It's a question of U.S. mootness law.  And this Court 
19  has said, as long as there's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you aware of -- I 
happen to be because I know this area very well -- the 
English courts have an amici filed with us yesterday, 
and they are sort of sensibly keeping track of what 
we're doing and trying to adjust their proceedings 
accordingly and in the manner they think is most helpful 

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, in the Convention, 

1  to us.  Whether it is or not, I can't comment on. 

2
 Is this common in the custody area?  Is 

3  there discussions between courts about what they're 

4  doing and the why of it? 

5
6  there is kind of two aspects of this.  One is in child 
7  custody proceedings, under the UCCJEA, and one is in the 
8  context of the Convention. 
 The UCCJEA, which deals with competing 
9
States and potentially competing countries' custody 
10
11  determinations, has specific provisions that address 
12  cooperation and communication.  They are, like, Section 
13  110, 111, and 112 --
14
15
16
17  that. 
18
19  cooperation typically occurs through the Central 
Authorities.  Each country has a Central Authority that 
20
21  communicates with each other.  So, for example, if the 
22  U.K.'s Central Authority would like something to be 
23  brought to the U.S. courts' attention, it might enlist 
24  the help of the U.S. Central Authority in, for example,

what -- what might happen in this case, in terms of if 

1
2  nice.  What does that have to do with this case?  I 

3  don't understand that. 

4
5
6  there would be competing court orders or whether the 
7  courts would -- what the courts would do in response to 
8  each other. 
 And I think the point, at least, that I was 
9
getting from Justice Sotomayor's question is that there 
10
11  is a measure of cooperation here, so that the Court need 
12  not be particularly concerned about parallel proceedings 
13  or competing proceedings in other countries.

20
21  sentence from its brief, that "mootness requires that 
22  relief be impossible"?  Do you think that's the right

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What this Court --

Court has always said, if it's an Article 3 inquiry 

1  that asked whether there is a possibility of relief, if 
2  the question is one of literal impossibility, we don't 
3  think that the Court needs to ask --
4
5
6  under standing, and it said that it's not supported by 
7  injury that is speculative or conjectural.  It seems to 
8  me, when you start talking about, well, the Scottish 
9  court might do this or the Alabama courts might do this, 
that -- that sounds pretty speculative and conjectural. 
10
11
 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, I think the Court has 
12  made those comments more in the context of the standing 
13  inquiry at the beginning of a case, as opposed to the 
14  mootness inquiry after a case has gone on for a while, 
15
16
 At the standing -- at the beginning of a 
17  case in the standing inquiry, the party coming into 
18  court really has a burden of showing that this case --
19  that there's something to be adjudicated in court.  As 
the case continues, it's the party who doesn't want the 
20
21  case to be in court anymore to show that there's nothing 
22  the court can do; that even though the court has put 
23  those resources --
24

different, but I don't agree that the standard changes.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Right.  And our position with 

you know, literal impossibility standard.  We just 
understand that to be asking the question, is there 
something the courts can do, even if it's not 
complete --

1  It's just who has to prove it, one side or the other. 
2  But I --
3
4  respect to the standard is simply from language taken 
from this Court's decision, going back to Mills, but 
5
6  also repeated in Church of Scientology and Knox, is 
7  there any effectual relief, whatever; is it possible to 
8  grant relief?  Relief can be partial, it doesn't need to 
9  be complete.  That's things that the Court has said.

it's -- I mean, I know you've got a laundry list of 
things, but, as I understand it, you think it's enough 
that, if the Court issues an opinion, the Scottish court 
might do something as a result of that? 

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, I think that the Court 
issuing an opinion has effects in America, regardless of 
what happens in Scotland, because you have a declaratory 
judgment that sets out the rights of the parties.

6  you have a judgment in the United States about the

 MR. CULLEN:  It's gone in this case, 

on page 16, an appeal was taken off those fees. 

 If you go on -- I believe it's page 17 of

now to do with respect to fees. 

1  pay $94,000 is gone?

7  the Joint Appendix, docket entry 57, you'll see that the

9  So having taken an appeal of the fees and having

 MR. CULLEN:  Well, the premise, though, is 

What this treaty does is it exercises a one-way return. 

 MR. CULLEN:  Right.  So if we assume that 
1
2  the fees survives -- they can pursue the fees issue. 
3  The problem, Justice Kennedy, is that there -- there is 
4  no habitual residence to be determined back in time. 
5
6
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that, of course --
7  on your premise, that's right.  On their premise, it's 
8  wrong, that -- the issue of custody is still alive under 
9  their perspective.  That's what we are arguing about, so 
10
11
12  based in the purpose of this treaty because, back in the 
13  '70s, before this treaty, Justice Kennedy, there was 
14  chaos.  And, in fact, the government is suggesting we 
15
16  between Scotland and Alabama, but --
17
18  you've won a judgment in lower court that says that the 
19  habitual residence of the child is Scotland.  So if they 
appeal, they might win one that says that was wrong, the 
20
21  habitual residence was the United States, but the child 
22  is in Scotland. 
23
24  but they are also bound by this treaty.  So I would 
25

imagine a Scottish court, just as we would do, when they 

should go back to possibly competing custody orders 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't think that's --

Wouldn't it matter to a Scottish court, after all,

7  it was relevant to us what the Chilean courts had held 
8  was the proper law of Chile in respect to that child. 
9
 Wouldn't the Scottish courts do the same? 
10
11  that an American court had decided that the residence 
12  was not bound?  I'd certainly give it – won’t they 
13  give it consideration?

16  Justice Ginsburg said, there is no opinion.  There is 
17  nothing.  There's --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm assuming they win.  The 
18
19  reason that they want to appeal is they want to win.  If 
I were looking at the case as you present it, I would 
20
21  say, of course, you'll win, don't worry.  What are you 
22  worried about? 
23
24  they think they are going to win.  Now, it means nothing 
if they lose.  But if they win on appeal, they then have

4  walk into the Scottish court and they say, oh, Scottish

6
7  think that that judge would take it into account in his 
8  decision.  That's what we do with the foreign -- similar 
9  foreign orders of other foreign courts, and I think we 
should do that, and I think the Scottish courts should 
10
11 
and will.  Now, you tell me where I'm wrong in that. 
12
13  Airdrie would say, why are you handing me a finding 
14  about what habitual residence was 2 years ago?  The 
child's habitual residence 2 years later is clearly 
15
16  Scotland, and we -- we don't look back in time with 
17  respect to that. 
18
19  why they shouldn't give in to this hypothetical American 
judgment.  That isn't my question.  My question is won't 
20
21  they consider it and give it -- and the Scottish courts, 
22  to my knowledge, are not so narrow-minded.  I think they 
23  would pay attention to what other courts have said.

 MR. CULLEN:  Justice Breyer --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I am -- I am quite 
3
4  surprised that you would say that prior residence can 
never bear on present residence.  In custody disputes, 
5
6  this happens all the time.  The child spent 5 years in 
7  this country, 4 years in that country; now, for the last 
8  2 years, the child has been in this country -- the 
9  previous experience of the child has a tremendous

 To say that it's only now, prospective only,

8  to send the child back home, they will think, I've got 
9  to keep the child here, so that the other party has the

panoply of different types of stays.  Now, what's 
20
21  happened in the district court in this instance --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, that -- that 
22
23  actually is not accurate.  The Convention is full of 
24  conditions for the return, the safety of the child, the

 MR. CULLEN:  We don't -- we don't agree with

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I happen to think 

1  whole set of conditions that have to be met before the 
2  child is returned. 
3
4
5
6  court that had -- was making the decision after an 
7  appeal is raised, that that's an inherent condition of a 
8  return order.  But that -- you're arguing against that. 
9  But there are plenty of conditions that could be 
10
11
12  that, Justice Sotomayor.  There are affirmative 
13  exceptions that can be asserted by a respondent, but 
14  there are no conditions.  In fact, Article 19 of the 
15
16  step into any sort of custody determinations at all. 
17
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  You can't -- the 
18  Court can't order custody issues, but it can set 
19  conditions for the nature of the return.  It could say 
20
21  certain expenses in the country the child is being sent 
22  to.  Those kinds of conditions can be imposed. 
 MR. CULLEN:  Those would be limited

Alderson Reporting Company

in terms of the law, what is different? 

The -- the district court was presented with 

a single request for a stay in this case.  The request 
was we may or may not file an appeal.  We haven't filed 
a notice of appeal, so give us a stay, so we can decide 
what we want to do. 

1  interests at stake, and that might be a very good reason 
2  for Congress to step in and try to fix this system, so 
3  that you don't have children shuttling back and forth. 
4  But -- you know, at the risk of sounding hard-hearted, 
5
6
 MR. CULLEN:  Well, what is different is --
7  and I need to answer the question -- two Justices have 
8  asked me about these stays, and I need to answer that,

What should have happened and what usually 
happens is you say, give us a stay, but if you're not 
going to give us a stay, give us a temporary stay.  Give 
us 48 hours, to see if we can get a stay from the 
appellate court. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's not 

quite fair to say we -- we haven't decided whether we're 
going to appeal.  I mean, the -- the stay motion was 
made immediately upon the determination of the merits by 
the district court, and the district court said no.  So, 
I mean, didn't they do everything they could have done 

42

 The notion presented to -- to this Court

19  happened on the ground in Alabama.  That is not what 
20
21
22  and I may be taking the opposite position from one of my 
23  colleagues, but the -- the best thing is to hold things 
24  up briefly, so that the child doesn't go overseas and 
then have to be brought back, particularly if you have 
25

Wednesday.  And what should have happened is, at a 
minimum, a 24-hour or 48-hour request for a temporary 
stay.  And, Mr. Chief Justice, this happens all the time 
in Hague cases.  Hague practitioners ask for stays and, 
if a stay is not going to be granted, ask for a 
temporary stay.

 It seems to me, if you -- if you're correct 

that the decision is moot, it's not going to be a --

2  And I think most appellate courts would appreciate 
3  the -- the benefit of that. 
4

6  there is going to be a rush to judgment by the 
7  individual that wants to take the child away. 
 MR. CULLEN:  No, we don't agree with that,

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. CULLEN:  Yes, Justice Scalia. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you think the -- the 
mere word "forthwith" in the statute is enough to alter 
our normal process of appeal? 

1  because the idea, Justice Kennedy, is we avoid competing 
2  litigation in countries.  We must have one country that 
3  is deciding this.  And it's --
4
effect of the statute implementing the treaty, which 
5
6  uses "forthwith" and all of this, is to, in effect, 
7  require that, unless there is a motion for a stay 
8  pending, the decision of the trial court be carried out? 
9

 MR. CULLEN:  It's the -- as a treaty, it's 
14  the supreme law of the land.  It says, if you decide to 
issue a return, the child is to be returned forthwith.

16  And the plain meaning of those words is you must act 
17  immediately.

One -- you can tell me it's neither, I 

suppose.  But one is this case is moot because there's 
no practical way to enforce any relief that's ordered by 
the Eleventh Circuit, all right?  That's what I came in 
thinking your argument was. 

The second is -- is just no, it's just 

improper for the Eleventh Circuit to enter any order 
granting relief. 

So which is it?  Is it that it's improper to 

enter any order at this point?  Or is it -- you know, 
you can enter an order, but it's just not going to be 
enforced, and, therefore, this case is moot? 

MR. CULLEN:  Justice Kagan, I'm going to 

take your third non-offered offer. 

(Laughter.) 
MR. CULLEN:  And the answer is because the 

Constitution tells us there is no case.  We cannot -- we 
cannot -- and I see Justice Alito --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't understand the third 

option. 

MR. CULLEN:  Because -- because Article 3 
says we have to be able to grant some effectual relief 
in the judicial process.  And since the Mills case in 
1895, right up to the Knox case this year, this Court 
has always said it's effectual relief in this judicial 
process.

 MR. CULLEN:  It is a mootness question 

 So I have to pose the question, Justice --
1
2
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, then you seem to be 
3  saying that if the -- if the law does not permit the 
4  issuance of a particular kind of order, and that's what 
the -- THE plaintiff is seeking -- or that's what the 
5
6  appellant is seeking, then the case is moot.  Is that 
7  your argument?  I thought that's a merits question, not a 
8  mootness question. 
9
because it goes -- it's not -- it goes to the heart of 
10
11  Constitutional mootness.  It goes to the issue of this 
12  may be uncomfortable, and this may be inconvenient, but 
13  once we've effected a remedy -- the only remedy, Justice 
14  Alito, under this treaty -- and once it's been carried 
out and once that child is home in Scotland, no matter 
15
16  what another court does in this judicial process, it can 
17  have no effect on the Scottish custody proceeding --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Cullen, are you 
18
19  saying that the -- under the treaty, there can be no 
rereturn order?  Is that what you're saying?  Whether 
20
21  the -- whether the return order was wrong or right, 
22  there can be no rereturn?

2  rereturn by the terms of the treaty.  So this is an 
3  argument that hangs on what the treaty's terms say; is 
4  that correct? 
5
6  textual, which is, of course, what surprised us so much 
7  in the government's position in this case because, as 
8  you know, Justice Kagan, the last time the government 
9  presented this position, they said exactly the opposite 
10
11

13

16  about the text, and we may give some compelling

government said nothing in the Convention requires

what's been happening over these 18 months, and what 
happened before the 18 months has absolutely nothing to 
do with it.

4  just as well, let me see, because Justice Ginsburg -- I 
5
6
 It's really fact-specific to this case that 
7  you're talking about.  So it just happens that the child 
8  has now been in Britain or in Scotland for 18 months.

7  to decide whether that's the habitual residence.  And it 
8  seems to me that you're adding a factual thing, that 
9  what happened in 18 months earlier has nothing to do 
with whether the child is now a habitual resident of 
10
11 
Scotland. 
12
 And what I want to know -- and I'm not going 
13  to find this in the treaty, I don't think, because it's 
14  not going to say whether it's 11 months or 12 -- but I 
want to know what source I look to, to show that you're

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So everything turns, 

until the U.S. proceedings are done. 

1  the Mills decision, and the Mills decision that tells 
2  you, under Article 3, a case is moot when the issues 
3  presented are no longer live and the parties lack a 
4  legally cognizable interest in their -- the live issue 
5
6
7  under your view, on whether or not the district court 
8  gives the losing party the 48-hour stay or whether the 
9  mother in this case decides to stay in the United States 
10
11
 The incentives if you prevail are for the 
12  custodial or the parent with control over the child to 
13  leave immediately.  Even after a motion has been 
14  filed -- if a motion for a stay has been filed, that's 
not a stay.  Get on the first plane out, and then you're 
15
16  home free.  That seems, to me, to be a very unfortunate 
17  result. 
18
19  agree, and here's why:  We don't agree because, 
initially, the district court judge did not order the 
20
21  instantaneous departure of this child.  She only did 
22  that after considering the motion to stay.  It was 
23  not --
24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  I know, but 
the point is that the other side says that the decision 

 MR. CULLEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, we don't

 (Laughter.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So there has to be 

at least a period before somebody can go up to the court 

 MR. CULLEN:  And it's --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And -- you know, 

1  was wrong. 
2
3
4  most -- not most, but many district judges don't like to 
immediately say, after they have issued a decision, 
5
6  well, there is a good likelihood that I'm wrong, and 
7  therefore, I'll issue a stay. 
8
9
10
11  of appeals and get a stay, and if you're right, what's 
12  happening during that 48 hours or 24 hours is that the 
13  parent with control of the child is trying to find the 
14  first flight out, and once she does, it's all over. 
15
16 
17 
18 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if I understand your 
19
answer to Justice Kagan, your argument is dependent on 
20
21  the proposition that, under the Convention, that once 
22  the child has left this country, a U.S. court no longer 
23  has any power to order the child to come back; is that 
24  right? 
25

MR. CULLEN:  It is all over once -- once the 
doors close on that plane and that child arrives back in 
Scotland, unless the plane turns around and comes back 
again, it is all over.  And it --

MR. CULLEN:  Yes, Justice Alito.

the -- how the Convention -- what the Convention says on 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And I don't see where that 
1
2  was decided, either by the court in this case or in the 
3  Beckier case that the Eleventh Circuit panel here cited. 
4  There is no discussion in either of those opinions of 
5
6  this question. 
7
 MR. CULLEN:  Well, the Beckier case goes 
8  back to Mills and relies on Church of Scientology and 
9  Mills --
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  what makes constitutional mootness uncomfortable because 
it's an answer that Justices and judges typically don't 
20
21  want to hear, but it is the answer.  The answer is there 
22  is nothing left to be done.  The one remedy has been 
23  effected, Justice Alito, and what -- what brings all 
24  this into sharp contrast now is what we lodged last 
25

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, no.  This is not a --
this is not a question about our general standard of 
mootness.  This is a question of the meaning of the 
Convention.  As I understood your argument to Justice 
Kagan, your position is dependent on a particular 
interpretation of the Convention.  And I don't see any 
discussion of that interpretive issue in either of those 
opinions. 

 MR. CULLEN:  Well, this is the -- this is 

week. 

55
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. CULLEN:  Right.  And there would be a 

other sending countries involved could order the child 

 MR. CULLEN:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  And you -- but you say that 

once the child leaves, there can't be an order requiring 
their return.

2  fully participating in the Scottish proceedings. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  If the -- if the Convention 
3
4  said explicitly that a court in this country or whatever 
5
6  back, this case would not be moot; is that correct? 
7
8
9  the Convention, in effect, says exactly the opposite; 
10
11 
12
13  problem, Justice Alito, if we didn't have the motion to 
14  stay concept, if we didn't have all of the alternatives 
for district courts to enter different types of motions 
15
16  to stay.  What -- what at least will happen from the 
17  Chafin case, I'm sure, will be everyone will know that 
18  you need to ask for a motion to stay, everyone will know 
19  you need to ask for different types of motions to 
20

1  asked. 
2
3  when she is allowed to get on the plane, and in this 
4  particular case, probably because she had to come in 
5
6  urgency in this case.  And it was a very young child, 

7  and the Scottish court was ready to beseize the 

8  jurisdiction. 

 Why would Judge Johnson not do what the 

9
treaty was telling her to do?  Get the child back to 
10
11  Scotland, I found habitual residence in Scotland, and 
12  let's let Scotland move forward. 
13
14
15
16
17
18
19  First of all, these courts have inherent authority to 
20
21  reversing the wrong decision of the district court. 
22  When we are talking about the object of the Convention, 
23  it is, in part, rapid return, but that is kind of 
24  putting the cart before the horse. 
25

 MR. MANELY:  Thank you, Your Honor. 
 With that, I'd like to touch on four points. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
 Mr. Manely, you have four minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. MANELY 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

order the child be brought back.  It is a way of 

The critical issue is where is the 

57
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what he says is that, 

after 18 months in Scotland, the Scottish court will 

1  appropriate habitual residence of the child, and that is 
2  the place that then needs to make the custodial 
3  decision --
4
5
6  decide where is the habitual residence of the child.  We 
7  are now in August of year 2, and what happened before 
8  January of year 1 is now totally irrelevant.  So even if 
9  the American courts decided prior to January of year 1 
the correct habitual residence was Alabama, when the --
10
11  when the Scottish courts decide what is his habitual 
12  residence as of 18 months later, they won't pay any 
13  attention at all to that American decision because it is 
14  not relevant. 
15

18
19  argument.  I disagree with it entirely.  As was pointed 
20
21  have to transfer from one place to another.  The closest 
22  case on point I can think of --
23
24  of the Convention, was to cut that out.  That's the 
whole reason for the Convention, that they wanted to 
25

That, I take it, to be his argument, which 
depends on the long time, 18 months.  So what is your 
response? 

out earlier, courts are quite used to having children 

 MR. MANELY:  I think that may well be his 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that was the purpose 

58

wrong.  And then the father, armed with that, can go and 

authorized, assuming that there was a valid return 
order, at least valid when it was entered and when the 
child was returned --

1  stop the shuttling of children. 
2
3  Your -- your thesis is that the -- that, now, the court 
4  of appeals could tell the district judge, you were 
5
6  get a rereturn order from the Scottish court under the 
7  Convention. 
8
9  Convention, was this question of rereturn -- is rereturn 
10
11 
12 
13
14
15
16
 MR. MANELY:  There are no cases because we 
17  don't run into this problem, quite frankly.  And -- and 
18  rereturn is a catch phrase that was created here. 
19  Bringing the child back would be a part of the court's 
inherent authority -- part of the district court or the 
20
21  court of appeals' inherent authority, and it's the basis 
22  upon which Scotland has the child in the first place. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't there a Spanish 
23
24  case? 
25

 MR. MANELY:  Your Honor --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is the incidence of 

rereturn under the Hague Convention?

12  based upon the trial court's decision in that case, and 
13  the child returned from Poland, based upon the Supreme 
14  Court of Spain's decision in that case.  So there is a 
15
16
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Was the child returned? 
17  Or was it just a decision that the appeal could not be 
18  avoided?  Was the child returned by Poland?

20
21  Supreme Court --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's -- see, that's the

amici brief here that says that the Scottish courts will 

 MR. MANELY:  Except that we never have. 
 I mean, this is a fairly young convention. 

1
2
3  We haven't had it that long.  But we never have had that 
4  problem before. 
It's been easy enough -- Ohlander v. Larson 
5
6  out of the Tenth Circuit is a great case to look at, for 
7  where the United States has been very giving in sending 
8  children back.  We have not had this problem before. 
9
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, there is an 
10
11  not pay attention to the habitual residence of a child 
12  at the time of the removal.  The amici brief that was 
13  filed with us yesterday, if I'm reading it correctly, 
14  suggests that the court believes that hasn't been 
15
16
17  well, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That that -- so that 
18
19  proposition is not as settled as the amici suggests? 
MR. MANELY:  Correct.  I think they are 
20
21 
 So you've got Villamonte v. Marquez, where 
22
23  the issue there is it's not moot because it's possible 
24  an extradited person could one day voluntarily return, 
25

settled in English law; is that correct? 

 MR. MANELY:  That's my reading of it as 

waiting to see what -- what we want to do. 

so it's not moot. 

61

 But in this case, there is nothing 

survive this --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that sounds 

to be the sort of concrete injury that's required. 

 MR. MANELY:  The concrete injury has to do 

1
2  preventing the mother, who filed the case before the 
3  district court and is still a party to the case, from 
4  voluntarily returning.  That enough is -- is enough to 
5
6
7  awfully speculative and conjectural.  That doesn't 
8  sound -- whether you're analyzing it under standing in 
9  the first instance or mootness later, that doesn't sound
