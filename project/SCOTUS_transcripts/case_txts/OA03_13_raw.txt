 Landgraf and its progeny provide the basis for a


decision in this case.  In enacting the FSIA, Congress did


not direct that it apply retrospectively to events that


occurred prior to its enactment.  Moreover, application of


the 1976 expropriation exception to alleged conduct that


occurred in and before 1948 would change the legal


consequences of that conduct, and therefore be impermissibly


retroactive.


 QUESTION: What -- why would it change the legal


consequences?  It -- wouldn't it just change where you can, 


where you can sue?


 MR. COOPER: No, in fundamental terms it would


change the legal consequences.  Prior to 1976, there was


complete immunity in this country for claims of


expropriation.  Foreign sovereigns had an expectation that


they would not be hailed into our courts to answer for the

internal exercise of their sovereign activities, and that is


the fundamental aspect of -­


 QUESTION: Did the Tate letter have any coverage


prior to '76, the so-called Tate letter from the State


Department?


 MR. COOPER: The so-called Tate letter changed the


State Department's position with respect to commercial


activities as of 1952.  This conduct all preceded 1952 and


concerned what has always been recognized as essentially


10 

public acts, that is, acts of expropriation.

 But to finish the answer to Justice Scalia, the -­


the issue that underlies the whole concept of foreign


sovereign immunity at its very basis is the question of


whether our courts, in the case of United States' 

jurisdiction, will exercise jurisdiction to question past


judgment on the sovereign conduct of foreign states acting


in their own -- within their own borders with respect to


property within their own country in this case.  And that's


something that as a matter of comity and as a matter of


international concepts of orderly relationships between


sovereigns that we don't tolerate.


 QUESTION: But I thought that -- well, first, I


think you recognize that this suit could be brought inside


Austria, and then one of the countries that don't follow the


-- the absolute rule.  Then it seems to me that Justice

Scalia is right, it's a question of where you can sue.  You


-- your argument is the United States has been self-denying,


but countries like Austria itself that don't follow that


absolute rule could be a proper forum.


 MR. COOPER: With respect, Justice Ginsburg, the -­


this issue of the adoption of the restrictive theory by any


country is really a red herring here.  The expropriation


exception concerns itself with what has always been


recognized as a public act, and that is that the act of


expropriation, something that can only be done by a


governmental entity through the exercise of its governmental


authority.


 QUESTION: But I -- as I understand this claim,


it's not the original ex parte -- expropriation is when


Austria isn't even a country, because this happened in the


Nazi period, right?


 MR. COOPER: No, Your Honor.  The United States'


position throughout World War II and thereafter has been


that Austria retained its sovereignty, that it was an


occupied state by the Nazi regime.  The United States


immediately recognized -­


 QUESTION: Then why was there a second republic?


 MR. COOPER: The second republic was the


reconstituted government of the state of Austria, but the


United States' position, and it is the executive's position

that has binding authority with respect to the sovereign


status, the executive's position was that Austria was always


a state.


 More importantly, Your Honor -­


 QUESTION: But may I continue, because I thought


that this claim, whatever you say about Austria's status in


the, at the time of the Anschluss, that it's not necessarily


about the stealing of the goods, it's about the retention of


the goods.


 MR. COOPER: We don't believe that that's a correct


reading of section 1603 -- 1605(a)(3).  1605(a)(3) concerns


itself with the expropriation of property.  The Congress -­


I articulated the power for the enactment of the


expropriation exception as the power to define and punish


violations of the laws of nations, and it is not even


arguably the case that a possession of expropriated


property, especially as it's been argued by the respondent,


not necessarily even having been expropriated by the


defendant country, is a violation of international law.


 QUESTION: So if you know that you've taken from an


21 

expropriator, that's all right under international law?


22

23 

24 

25 

 MR. COOPER: It's not a question of whether it's


all right.  It's a question of whether Congress decided that


it was a basis for an exception to the long-standing and


general rule of law in this country, that is, sovereign

immunity.  So in other words, has -- has Congress determined


that one of the narrow and specified exceptions to foreign


sovereign immunity is the mere possession of property?


 QUESTION: Is it sovereign immunity or is it the


act of state doctrine?


 MR. COOPER: It's sovereign immunity, Your Honor.


 QUESTION: Well, but, I mean, even -- there -­


there are two things that happen here.  The sovereign can be


brought into court, but more than that, the sovereign can be


held to account for the act of the sovereign on its own


territory.  The latter, it seems to me, can be described as


substantive law, the former, just allowing the sovereign to


come into your -- or allowing your court to entertain a suit


against the sovereign is -- is just -- just where suit goes. 


It has nothing to do with the outcome of the suit.


 MR. COOPER: This Court determined -­


 QUESTION: So I -- I wish you could tell me that it


did have to do with the act of state doctrine, because that


would be -- that would be a substantive change and that


should not be retroactive.


 MR. COOPER: The -- the active state doctrine is an


independent doctrine that is not before the Court today. 


The sovereign immunity doctrine is before the Court today. 


Sovereign immunity, this Court decided in Verlinden, is a


matter of substantive Federal law.  This Court made that

decision after careful consideration and with specific


reference to the FSIA and Congress' power to enact it, and


concluded that it was more than a jurisdictional statute.


 Moreover, in the Hughes case, this Court


determined that merely articulating a statute's terms in


terms of jurisdiction does not remove it from the


retroactivity analysis we urge is the rule of law that -­


that determines the outcome of this case.  Quite the


contrary.  Hughes made it clear that in circumstances very


much like these, where a cause of action was not previously


allowed, and here the immunity kept a -- an action for


expropriation from being adjudicated in American courts


under those circumstances.  As of 1976, there was a


fundamental change in the law with respect to foreign


sovereigns.


 QUESTION: Well, in Hughes -- in Hughes there were


-- there were other changes besides the -- besides the


jurisdictional one.  There -- there were defenses that were


eliminated.  I don't think Hughes is a very good -- good


case for you, but Verlinden, it seems to me, is -- is -- is


closer, but we were determining there whether it was a


substantive law or not for a very different purpose, for the


existence of -- of power on the part of the Federal


Government to -- to enact the statute.  That's a -- that's a


bit different from the purpose for which we're determining

whether it's a substantive law here.


 MR. COOPER: The interest of the United States,


Your Honor, in the -- the administration of cases against


foreign sovereigns has long been recognized by this Court as


being a -- a matter of great national interest.  The


question of when we decide to exercise jurisdiction over


foreign sovereigns is an essential component of the way this


country interacts with other countries.  It's an area in


which the Constitution conferred responsibility on the


political branches.  The executive exercised that


responsibility for the vast portion of this country's


history and then submitted to Congress an act, the Foreign


Sovereign Immunity Act, which Congress then enacted, and


created -­


 QUESTION: But none of that's in question.


 MR. COOPER:  -- very narrow exceptions to the

doctrine.

 QUESTION: None of that's in question.  The only


thing that's in question is when Congress enacted this, did

say -- de-immunizing, if you want to put it that way, prior


acts or not. 


 MR. COOPER: And it -­


 QUESTION: We're -- we're not questioning the


25 

authority of the executive or the authority of the

legislature or the importance of this matter.  Essentially,


the issue is, what did Congress mean by this statute?


 MR. COOPER: And Congress in this Court has clearly


articulated in -- in Landgraf and in the -- the several


cases that followed it, exactly how we determined what it


was that Congress did as it relates to the retroactive


aspects of those changes in law.


 QUESTION: And in -- in our domestic jurisprudence,


we are cautious about retroactivity because it destroys


subtle expectations.  Is that same rationale applicable when


we're talking about foreign sovereign immunity, or are there


other considerations such as the dignity or -- of the


foreign state?


 MR. COOPER: We think when the issue of a concept


of basic fairness so close to the root of our understanding


of what constitutes fair treatment of any individual, that


no less standard -­


 QUESTION: Well, that's why -­


 MR. COOPER:  -- no less rigorous standard than


20 

Landgraf should apply.


21

22 

23 

24 

25 

 QUESTION: That leads to my -- my next question. 


If we're talking about expectations, my understanding -­


correct me if I'm wrong -- is that in 1948 Austria was -­


and all countries -- were on notice that immunity would be


judged later on by acts of the executive, or in this case,

by an act of Congress.  Wasn't the expectation here that


there would be a later determination of whether there was


immunity?


 MR. COOPER: The expectation was that, based on the


general concepts of international law and general concepts


of comity, which are not just a question of whim or


courtesy, but rather a question of fair treatment of one


sovereign by another with the expectation that the sovereign


who is declining jurisdiction would be fairly treated in the


10 

courts of other countries.


11

12 

13 

14 

15

16

17

 QUESTION: But still whether or not there would be


immunity, Austria and all other countries knew, would be a


later determination, so that the expectation they had was to


that extent necessarily, it seems to me, diminished -­


 MR. COOPER: The expect -­


 QUESTION:  -- or qualified.


 MR. COOPER: Expectations are only one of a number


18 

of factors that the Court has referred to in Landgraf.


19

 QUESTION: So it's -- so there are additional


20 

factors other than expect.  What are the additional factors?


21

22 

23 

24 

25 

 MR. COOPER: Well, certainly.  Landgraf quoted


Justice Story in his 1814 articulation of what was relevant,


but the factors are expectations, changed circumstances, and


changed considerations for the parties.  In any case that


increases liability, for instance, for a particular act is

considered to be -­


 QUESTION: Let's just stick -- stick with


expectations -­


 MR. COOPER: -- part of common sense -­


 QUESTION:  -- for the moment.  Let's -- before you


get off of expectations, I don't know that we protect


expectations of the sort that -- that you're talking about. 


Let's assume that a state which has not -- not previously


allowed a tort action by -- by two out-of-state people,


between two out-of-state people, to be brought within that


state.  Let's assume they change their law and they say, you


know, in the future, you -- you can bring a tort action. 


 Do you think that -- that we would say, you're -­


you're disrupting people's expectations if you allow those


persons who are -- who are the parties to a tort in another


state before this statute was passed to sue in the new


state?


 MR. COOPER: Our concepts of -­


 QUESTION: What expectation, you know?  I expected


not to be able to be sued in Virginia.  As it turns out, I


can -- I can be sued in Virginia.  Did that really affect my


action in -- in this case?  I can't believe that Austria


when it took this action had in mind, oh, I -- I know that I


-- that I can't be sued for this in the United States, I may


be sueable a lot of other places.

 QUESTION: I'm sueable here, but I'm not sueable in


the United States.  Who cares?


 MR. COOPER: That kind of particularized reliance


analysis has never been a part of this Court's retroactivity


analysis.  It -- the Court doesn't look for purposes of


civil or criminal cases, can we find evidence that the


individual, when that individual acted, or the party, when


that party acted, had in mind the current state of law.  The


question has been as a matter of common sense understanding,


is the new law a change in the consequences for past


conduct?  And -­


 QUESTION: So you're -- you're distinguishing


reliance and expectation?  An expectation is relevant even


though there may be no reliance.  Is -- do I understand you


correctly?


 MR. COOPER: We are focused on the changed legal


consequences, not the subjective intention of the party in


any respect.


 QUESTION: But is -- do -- do you articulate that


in terms of the country's expectation, even though the


country may not have relied upon that expectation when it


acted?


 MR. COOPER: Not -­


 QUESTION: Are you drawing that distinction?

primarily, although I think expectations could be a factor,


we think that the more important aspect of the analysis is


the changed legal circumstances.  That's -- that's the core


of what the -­


 QUESTION: And the changed legal circumstance that


I understand you're emphasizing here is that, at least prior


to 1976, this particular possession of expropriated


property, as well as the expropriation itself, would not


have been cognizable in the court of any country unless


possibly the country itself, which as an act of grace later,


decided to -- to make its own reparations.  But subject to


that section -- that exception -- it would not be -- would


not have been cognizable anywhere?


 MR. COOPER: That's absolutely correct.


 QUESTION: Okay.


 MR. COOPER: If there are no further questions at

this point, I'd like to reserve time.

the Court:


 The position of the United States has always been


that sovereign immunity bars U.S. courts from adjudicating


pre-1976 expropriation claims against foreign sovereigns. 


As this Court recognized in Dames and Moore, claims by


nationals of one country against the government of another


are frequently sources of friction between the two


sovereigns.


 Since 19 -- prior to 1976, therefore, and absent a


waiver of sovereign immunity, expropriation claims against


foreign sovereigns have always been addressed through


diplomatic negotiations and foreign claims processes, and


not in U.S. courts.  And the United States has entered into


numerous agreements with foreign countries regarding such


claims, always against and with a background understanding


prior to 1976 that such claims could not be adjudicated in


U.S. courts.


 QUESTION: Is -- is the friction that's feared in


part based on changed expectations, or is that just


irrelevant to the analysis?


 MR. HUNGAR: Changed expectations are relevant in,


in the general sense, not the particular -- particularized


expectations of a particular state, but that it is a general


rule and understanding of international laws set forth in


the Vienna Convention on Treaties and elsewhere that changes

in international law, including changes in sovereign


immunity law, are not retroactively applied.  And there are


numerous examples of the latter point cited in our brief at


footnote 14, and -- and it was an absolute rule in 1948 and


before.


 QUESTION: Is the absolute rule based on the act of


state doctrine or on sovereign immunity?  The distinction -­

of World War II, but out of communist government


expropriations and numerous agreements regarding these types

or not confer immunity depending on the decision of the


executive.

expectation or this other reliance is. 


 MR. HUNGAR: The -- the case that -- the doctrine


of absolute sovereign immunity, there were no -- there are


no exceptions.  There could not possibly have been any


expectation or reason to believe that the executive of this


country would deny immunity in an expropriation case because


that had never happened in the history of the absolute


doctrine, immunity doctrine, for 150 years.  No suit, again,


no suit in the United States has been permitted, was


permitted to proceed on any theory against a foreign


sovereign in personam.  It was -- it would be absolutely

unprecedented for such a suit to have been permitted prior


to 1976, in fact, in the expropriation context.  And so -­


 QUESTION: Would that be true of -- would that be


true of Austria itself if the tables were turned?


 MR. HUNGAR: It's unclear whether a -- a court


action could have been brought, at least we're not familiar


with anything in the record that indicates whether a court


action could have been brought in 1948, under, for example,


the restitution law that Austria passed in 1947.


 QUESTION: I think there was -­


 MR. HUNGAR: But that's irrelevant because it can't


be -- the retroactivity analysis has to be a term -­


determined on a section-by-section, or -- or provision-by-


provision basis.  It can't be a case-by-case, country-by-


country rule.


 QUESTION: Well, it was relevant to something that


Mr. Cooper said.  He said this was a matter of fairness and


we want others to be treated -- treat others -- treat others


well so that they will treat us well.  That sounded to me


like he was speaking in reciprocity terms.


 MR. HUNGAR: Reciprocity is also an important


consideration, Your Honor.  If this law were to be applied


retroactively, it could open the United States to reciprocal


claims brought in foreign courts, which would further


complicate our foreign relations.

 QUESTION: Well, how -- how does it work if in fact


you treat the statute as purely jurisdictional?  You have


to, one, establish jurisdiction, they have it under 1330. 


You have to have venue, they established that.  And then you


look to see if it's wiped out by sovereign immunity, and


(a)(3) says this is a case in which rights and property


taken in violation of international law are an issue. 


Right.


 So suppose you said, yes, that is such a case,


even though the expropriation took place in '48 or earlier


perhaps.  Then the State Department could come in and say,


well, you don't win if you wanted to.  You'd say, after all,


there first is the act of state doctrine, and this was not


clearly in violation of international law in 1948, or you


could file, what is it called, it's a -- an information, or


what is it, it's a suggestion of something or other -- it's


a -­


 MR. HUNGAR: Well, prior to -­


 QUESTION: -- statement of interest.  And you say


it's the -- there's a -- there's a foreign policy interest


here, and so that way the State Department's in control, and


if it feels that it would hurt foreign affairs to have the


suit go ahead, it says either act of state if it's not clear


or a statement of interest, and a -- which is a kind of


political question, I guess.

 And so, what -- how does that, in other words,


where am I wrong in thinking there's no real foreign policy


concern here in respect to the application of this statute


as a purely jurisdictional matter?


 MR. HUNGAR: We believe that the -- as we said in


our briefs, and part of the reason we're here today is that


there are foreign policy concerns implicated -­

was wrong with what I just said?  You see, as I was saying

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, I'm not -- understand.  We are


here today saying the United States has an interest in not


having this expropriation exception applied retroactively


because it would undermine the background assumption -­


 QUESTION: I understand that and I'm trying to get


to the reasoning.  And my thought was, I don't see why it


affects foreign affairs.  You can explain why.  I understand


you believe it does and I'm sure you're right, but I just


want to know why, and the reason I find it difficult to see


why is because it seems to me you still, even assuming


jurisdiction, can come in and say this was an act of state,


this seizure in 1948, or you can file a statement of


interest, which I take it is saying there's a big foreign


policy matter here and we're working it out in other forums


and you courts stay out of it.  Now -- now am I wrong about

that?  I'm sure you're going to say I am wrong and I want to


know why.


 MR. HUNGAR: Well, we don't perceive a meaningful


difference between an amicus brief expressing foreign policy


concerns, which is what we have filed, and a statement of


interest expressing foreign policy concerns.


 QUESTION: Ah.  Well, then the correct result in


this case is to say yes, this statute applies, it applies to


1948 seizures, because they were in violation of


international law.  Now, the State Department files a


statement of interest saying to the court, there is a valid


foreign policy reason for not going ahead in this case.


 MR. HUNGAR: But the -­


 QUESTION: I take it, by the way, you promised you


wouldn't in this case, but nonetheless, all right.  So -- so


if -- that would be just up to you, so if you do it, then


the court will not go ahead and adjudicate this case even


though there is jurisdiction under the FSIA.


 MR. HUNGAR: Justice Breyer -­

to me.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, several things.  First of all,

 MR. HUNGAR: That has to do with a particular


agreement entered into in 2001 and it is certainly our


position that that agreement does not cover this case and


that was the position we took.  But again, with respect to


the -- we are expressing the foreign policy concerns that


I've identified, which are generalizing, go through the


retroactive application of this statute generally.  We're


not talking just about Austria here.  There are claims and


potential claims against countless foreign countries, many


of whom -- many of which would involve claims that were


previously addressed -­


 QUESTION: Some of them do not involve the act of


state doctrine and you want us to hold that -- that -- that


this would be a retroactive application of this


jurisdictional statute no matter -- no matter what claim is


made, whether it's an act of state claim or not.  If -- if


you were limiting them to act of state, I could understand


it, because that's a substantive -- a substantive matter,


but you want us to say no -- no suits can be brought that -­


out of actions that -- that arose before this.

it is retroactive or not.


 MR. HUNGAR: This is not purely -- no, Your Honor,

it's true that a similar type claim could have been brought


in Austria at the time, that cannot change the retroactivity


analysis, because otherwise retroactivity would be


determined country by country, and that fact that -- that a


state by -- by an exercise of grace has chosen to allow


claims that somehow deprive it would change the rules, which

which -- which this country previously entered into


agreements which both sides thought had resolved the issue


entirely, and to now retroactively apply a substantive


provision that this Court recognized in Ex parte Peru is a


substantive, not merely jurisdictional, but a substantive

 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hungar.


 Mr. Schoenberg, we'll hear from you.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. RANDOL SCHOENBERG

 We believe there are four independent grounds for


affirming the lower court in this case.  First, as the Court


has just discussed, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act


regulates the exercise of jurisdiction, not the underlying


primary conduct of the parties.  Therefore, the Act does not


operate retrospectively.


 QUESTION: Well, why doesn't it retro -- why -- why


isn't it just as easy to say that it does operate


retrospectively, because the question is, when should it


exercise jurisdiction for a particular purpose?  And on the


one hand there's no point in exercising jurisdiction now if

it's not going to adjudicate later, so so far as the court


is concerned, presumably it's going to adjudicate on a


substantive issue.


 That being the purpose, why can you -- why really


does it make sense to draw that neat line?


 MR. SCHOENBERG: Well, I'm -- I'm not sure that I


understand the question.


 QUESTION: Why -- why -- why isolate jurisdiction


when we all know that the purpose of exercising the


jurisdiction is to exercise it for the purpose of


adjudicating a particular kind of case and to apply a


particular substantive law to it?


 MR. SCHOENBERG: Because the -- the operative


event, the event that's being regulated by a jurisdictional


statute, as the Court has said, is that exercise of the


Court's power, regardless of when the underlying acts took


place, the Court has differentiated between the primary


conduct of the parties and the secondary conduct, which is


the exercise of the Court's power.


 For example, just last term in the Dole Food case,


the Court found that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is


not intended to chill the conduct of the foreign state. 


Rather, it's there to decide whether now presently it would


embarrass the conduct of foreign relations, and the -- 25


years ago, over 25 years ago, Congress decided that cases

such as these should be allowed to go forward.


 QUESTION: Well, the Government of the United


States has just said you're going to embarrass foreign


relations whether the United States' position with respect


to a consideration in interpreting this act is raised now or


whether it's raised after jurisdiction is assumed and you


get to the next stage.  Why not -- why not get into it now


and consider it in interpreting the -- the scope of the act,


in particular its retroactivity.


 MR. SCHOENBERG: This would be a much different


case if the foreign government had ever said that the


prosecution of this case would interfere with foreign


relations, as it has in all of these other cases.  But it


hasn't in this case, it hasn't filed a suggestion of


immunity, it hasn't filed a statement of interest.  A matter


of fact, it required Austria to withdraw the act of state


doctrine defense when it was asserted below.  This case


itself -­


 QUESTION: But I thought it just told us that it


20 

would be an interference three minutes ago.


21

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. SCHOENBERG: The concern, as I understand the


Government's concern, is that in other cases that are


pending against Japan and Mexico, et cetera, there might be


foreign relation issues.


 QUESTION: Well, why -- why should we look further?

If the Government says that, I mean, isn't that conclusive


in a case like this?


 MR. SCHOENBERG: I don't -- I don't think so.  I


think there are two responses.  First, the amount of


deference that is given to the Government's litigation


position under Bowen v. Georgetown and also INS v. St. Cyr.


 QUESTION: Well, those are not cases involving


foreign relations.


 MR. SCHOENBERG: That -- that's correct, and that's


why the second issue is very important.  I believe it was


Justice Powell who said in the First National City Bank case


that -- that jurisdiction is not the same as justiciability. 


And what the Government is talking about is a justiciability


question.  Does the act of state doctrine, for example,


prevent this case from going forward? 


 I'll give you another example, Your Honor.  In -­


the same district court judge who handled our case and


granted jurisdiction in our case, Judge Cooper, also was


given a class action case asserting World War II era claims


against Austria, this is the Anderman case.  And just last


April, she threw out that entire class action, because the


Government had come in and filed a statement of interest and


asserted its interest in the -- in the case, and she found


very similar to the Court's holding in Garamendi last term


that the political question doctrine was implicated when the

Government comes in and says that the prosecution of this


particular case will interfere with foreign relations.


 But I've never heard any -- in any other case the


Government say that a case that does not implicate foreign


relations, as this one does, should be dismissed on


jurisdiction grounds merely because we have justiciability


concerns with other cases.


 QUESTION: What -- what is it if -- what do you


reply to their, what I take is their argument, that if we


say there is jurisdiction here, so that this covers pre-1952


expropriations, think of all the eastern European bloc, what


used to be, millions of pieces of real estate, et cetera,


and Japan, Peru, all over the world, South America, there


have been expropriations, and suddenly our Court becomes -­


become places where you litigate who owns property all over


the world, at least if you trace an interest to an American


citizen, for expropriations that may have taken under


Maximilian of Mexico.  I mean, see -- you see that kind of


problem I think is what they're trying to raise.


 MR. SCHOENBERG: Right.  We're very -­


 QUESTION: What's the answer to that?


 MR. SCHOENBERG: We're very sensitive to the


Government's concern, the can of worms argument here.  And I


think the answer to it is that all of those cases present


much more difficult problems than this one does in terms of,

 MR. SCHOENBERG: I can think of at least five 

problems that cases, old cases, would have.  One would be 

statute of limitations.  Form non-convenience may be a 

problem.  It wasn't in this case.  The act of state doctrine 

we've mentioned is also a serious problem in many of these 

cases.  You have interference with treaties, which is also 

not this case.  And you have interference with executive 

agreements, which is also not this case. 

 QUESTION: Can they come in and file a letter, in 

your opinion, assume you have jurisdiction to say, look, 

Judge, we don't want you to litigate this case, it

Court's doctrine in foreign affair and policy -- foreign


affairs policy -- there is an automatic deference given to


the Government's suggestion that a particular case will


interfere with foreign policy, but in most cases I think it


would be quite clear.  This case -­


 QUESTION: Well, what -- what case is it that says

that the court should decide rather than the executive in a

case like this?


 MR. SCHOENBERG: Well, I believe, for example, in ­


- in Sabbatino, the Court did not immediately accept the


Government's position as to whether a case should or should


not go forward and said that it was -- now, I don't know


whether that, whether Sabbatino, in that part of Sabbatino,


it would still be good law today.  I don't think that's been


considered.

 MR. SCHOENBERG: Right.  It was a plurality


opinion.  But there is a suggestion, it may not be an


answered question, Your Honor.  I'm not sure I can point to


a case that would -- would talk about the deference, but 

again, we're talking about not our situation, because the


Government has not filed any suggestion of immunity or -- or


statement of interest suggesting that this case would


interfere with foreign policy.


 QUESTION: Could -- could I ask about the act of


state doctrine?  I mean, even -- why isn't that in play


here?  I mean, even if giving -- holding Austria here would


not be acting retroactively insofar as the exercise of


jurisdiction is concerned, why wouldn't holding Austria


liable for an act of state which previously would not be a


basis for -- for challenge in this country, why wouldn't

that be acting retroactively?


 MR. SCHOENBERG: Well, we haven't addressed the act


of state because it hasn't been raised and it was an


argument that was dropped.  I -- I can answer the question


though.  The act of state doctrine, as I understand it, is


designed to prevent courts from entering into situations


where there is no settled basis for deciding the case.  In


other words, in the Cuban cases where there's a regime that


has a completely different property system than ours, it


would be unwise for the courts to venture into this


political dispute over whether communism or capitalism is


the appropriate way to adjudicate these cases.


 In our case, we have a treaty, article 26 of the


Austrian State Treaty says Austria must return property


taken from Jewish families during the Nazi era.  So there's


no dispute between the two countries as to whether or what


type of law would apply in this case.  And under Sabbatino,


it's very much qualified by the absence of a treaty


governing the rule of decision.


 So I -- I don't think this case could ever pose an


act of state problem.  Other cases do though.  That -- and


that's -- that's really the point.  These cases against


Mexico, against Japan, against Poland could potentially pose


serious act of state problems.  This particular case


doesn't.  We'd be happy to litigate it.

 QUESTION: Whether it poses a problem or not, the


suit is -- is resting upon -- is challenging an act of the


state of -- of Austria that -- that occurred in Austria. 


 MR. SCHOENBERG: That -- that's correct.  Every


suit against a foreign sovereign that's authorized under the


Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act has the potential of


interfering with foreign relations to the extent that it


concerns the actual foreign country.


 QUESTION: Right.  So the issue would be, should


10 

that be given retroactive application?

 MR. SCHOENBERG: In the act of state context.

 MR. SCHOENBERG: The act of state doctrine is a


choice of law doctrine, as I understand it, and -- and so


it, again, is not something that really operates


retroactively, I think.  I don't think to -- to echo what


was said before that any country could have an expectation


in how the act of state doctrine will apply in the


particular case.


 QUESTION: How about the public acts?


 MR. SCHOENBERG: I'm sorry?


 QUESTION: This is a public act.

 MR. SCHOENBERG: Well, whether it's a public or


private act to collect paintings, I'm not sure is so clear.


 QUESTION: Let's assume it's a public act.  Does it


have an expectation that -- that that will be adjudicated


under the then-prevailing norms?


 MR. SCHOENBERG: I -- well, yes and no.  Yes in the


sense that we do have to establish that -- that this


property was taken in violation of international law, and I


think that part of the statute clearly expects that the


taking be adjudicated according to the state of


international law at the time.  So to that degree I think


yes.  But whether -- whether it's a public or private act I


think doesn't determine the -- the retroactivity question.


QUESTION: But we're told that at least in this 

15 

country such acts were never adjudicated in foreign courts.

 MR. SCHOENBERG: I -- I understood that to be the


Government's position.  I don't know how the Government


explains The Santissima Trinidad case, which is a case


concerning private property on a ship where not one, but


several, sovereigns claimed an ownership interest, and


Justice Story said that our courts, of course, have to


adjudicate the ownership of that private property,


regardless of whether it was taken as part of a public act. 


 In the Santissima Trinidad, it's a confusing case,


25 

and I'm not sure, even having read it many times, how the

ship came to be in its final location, but as I understand


it, it went through many different, many different hands. 


And the question at the end was, because the sovereigns were


claiming the ship, which was potentially a ship of war, does


that mean that the Court could not adjudicate the ownership


of cargo on the ship?  And Justice Story said no.


 QUESTION: No, but he -- isn't the -- the concern


about the applicability of that case to this one is


precisely the reason you said.  It was -- it was a suit


between sovereigns and we're talking here about the


sovereign immunity defense in a suit by an individual, and


it's rather a stretch to take that as -- as the basis for


your law in this case.


MR. SCHOENBERG: Well, I would -- I would think 

that the act of state doctrine, which is what we were


talking about, would -- would be implicated even more


strongly in a -- in a suit involving multiple sovereigns


than it would with regard to just an individual against a


sovereign.  And I -- I -- the Government makes the position


I think for the first time today that the expropriation


clause sort of appeared from nowhere, but I don't think


that's the case.  The first section of 1605(a)(3) very


clearly is the Santissima Trinidad case.  That's the


property is inside the United States in connection with the


commercial activity.

 The second clause I believe arises out of the


Cuban expropriation cases and the Government's experience in


those cases, and it was the intention of the Government in


1976 when the executive branch proposed this law and when


the Congress enacted it to allow our courts to adjudicate


these types of claims.


 QUESTION: Well, what -- what I'm looking for, I'm


beginning to understand his answer better -- I think there


should be a way, not in your case necessarily, but in


general, for the Government to say, court, stay out of this


case, because of the international implications.  And what I


was thinking is if we -- if this is jurisdictional, follow


Justice Powell's distinction, that won't be a problem


because there'll be other ways for them to do it.  You're


gradually closing those doors.


 One way I had thought of was act of state, but you


correctly point out that the act of state doctrine does not


bar anything when the claim rests upon a treaty or other


unambiguous agreement, and your quoting the '55 treaty might


not help you because it's post-'48, but a -- but 1907 might


help you, so you're there with a treaty.


 And so they say, well, we can't use that one, and


there'll be a lot of cases when we can't.  So then I had


mentioned this thing called a statement of interest, which I


was looking for an explanation because I don't know what it

is.  And there's a third thing that you mentioned, which is


called a letter about immunity.  Well, that won't help them


because that's what this statute is. 


 See, so that now we're back to the statement of


interest.  Now, can -- what is this thing, a statement of


interest?  Can -- in other words, is the statement of


interest sufficient to achieve the objective that I was


thinking was important, that not necessarily your case, but


in many other cases there has to be a way for the executive


to stop the judge from deciding the matter where it really


does interfere with foreign relations.


 Now, what's -- do you see where I'm --


 MR. SCHOENBERG: I -­

statement of interest in this case, but -­


 QUESTION: But you can explain to me what a


22 

statement of interest is.


23

24

 MR. SCHOENBERG: Right.


 QUESTION: And whether a statement of interest is a


25 

sufficient legal route to achieve the end that I think is

necessary and that they're arguing for.


 MR. SCHOENBERG: I believe if -- if the Government


were to file a statement of interest saying that the


prosecution of this particular lawsuit would interfere with


the foreign relations of the Government, I think a court


would be proper in abstaining from adjudicating the case


under the political question doctrine, very similar to this


Court's holding last term in Garamendi, I think.


 QUESTION: But it wouldn't have to, in your view?


 MR. SCHOENBERG: I would say it would -- it would


be very -- it would almost always have to.  I think -- I


think the Court should still be allowed to determine whether


-- whether there is really a basis for the Government's


position.  I -- I wouldn't say that our courts necessarily


have to bend always to the Government's position with regard


to a statement of interest.  I think that's the -- the


import of the first National City Bank case and -- and -­


and the -- the Sabbatino case and Alfred Dunhill also.


 QUESTION: But I -- I take it that in no case, in


no instance would you concede the appropriateness of -- of


the statement of interest being considered at the


jurisdictional as opposed to the justiciability of -­


 MR. SCHOENBERG: That's -- that's absolutely


correct.  We're talking today only about the jurisdiction


question.  There hasn't been a statement of interest filed

and there couldn't be a suggestion of immunity.  I'm sorry,


Your Honor.


 QUESTION: No, I'm sorry.  What do you do about


Verlinden?


 MR. SCHOENBERG: Verlinden actually is a great case


for us as I realized in reviewing it.  Verlinden is -- is a


retroactive application of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities


Act.  In that case it was a foreign company against a


foreign state, something for which there was no jurisdiction


in the United States prior to the enactment of the Foreign


Sovereign Immunities Act.  That action arose in 1975 and yet


when it was brought under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities


Act several years later, this Court directed the lower court


to adjudicate jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign


Immunities Act. 


 So that case is exactly a -- if -- if anything is


retroactive, that's a retroactive application of the Foreign


Sovereign Immunities Act.  But again, it goes back to this


Court's statements in Landgraf that jurisdictional statute


which confers or ousts jurisdiction is not impermissibly


retroactive and that -­


 QUESTION: Did -- Verlinden didn't expressly


23 

discuss the right to retroactivity?


24

 MR. SCHOENBERG: It absolutely did not discuss


25 

retroactivity.  It maybe never occurred to any of the

Justices or the parties at that time that a jurisdictional


statute like the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act could be


in any way -­


 QUESTION: No, but they -- but we did say that it


wasn't just a jurisdictional statute.  That's what we said.


 MR. SCHOENBERG: The -- the Court said that it was


substantive in Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman in 1945.  The


Court refers to sovereign immunity as substantive law.  But


I think as this Court has said, whether you label the -- the


law substantive or procedural really isn't the question. 


The question is, on what activity is -- is the statute


operating?  And here it's operating on the claim to immunity


and how that is adjudicated by our courts in deciding


whether the court has the jurisdiction -­


 QUESTION: But that -- that has a bearing on the


Landgraf exception too.  If a statute is more than


jurisdictional, you know, it isn't so easily disposed of


under Landgraf.


 MR. SCHOENBERG: It's correct, but I think this


case presents a much better case than the two cases cited in


Landgraf, the Andrus case and U.S. v. Alabama, although U.S.


v. Alabama you could distinguish as something seeking only


injunctive relief and therefore prospective.  In Andrus,


this is a case brought against the U.S. Government after the


U.S. Government -- or while the case was pending, I think,

the statute is changed to take away the amount in


controversy requirement.  So, in other words, very clearly


before the suit could not proceed, now the statute's been


changed without any suggestion of retroactivity in the


enactment.  And the Court says -- this is 1978, I think -­


it's of no moment that this jurisdictional statute has been


changed now to allow a suit against in -- in a sovereign


entity, the United States.


 So I think this case presents actually a much


better -- much better case, because here, and these are


other points that I wanted to raise, I believe the text of


the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act demonstrates that it


was intended to apply to all claims to immunity, regardless


of when the acts took place, the underlying acts took place.


 Our -- our third point -­


 QUESTION: May I just ask you on that, I mean,


isn't the objection to that that the -- that the subject


matter we're concerned with here is a subject matter which


is defined in terms of property and the history of that


property, and the history of that property as expropriated


necessarily raises the time question?  And if the time is


prior to the -- the enactment of the statute, we


necessarily, by the definition of present subject matter,


get into an issue of retroactivity.  What -- what's the


answer to that?

 MR. SCHOENBERG: Well, the answer is, again, in


Landgraf that not every statute which affects prior events


is impermissibly retroactive, and my point was -­


 QUESTION: But it's not impermissibly retroactive,


but it raises the question about the permissibility of a


retroactive application.


 MR. SCHOENBERG: Well, I -- my view is that the


Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is -- is a statute that is


designed to take away the immunity decision from the State


Department and place it in the hands of judges, and the


purpose of the statute was that henceforth all claims to


immunity should be adjudicated under this procedure, not the


old procedure.  In other words, the U.S. Government's


position should -­


 QUESTION: Yeah, but even -- even that, with


respect, it seems to me that that begs the question.  The


court is going to adjudicate.  The question is whether in


adjudicating them it is going to draw a line based on -- on


-- on this temporal consideration.  That still leaves it in


the hands of the court.  But the question is whether in the


hands of the court retroactivity ought to be a basis for


making the jurisdictional decision.


 MR. SCHOENBERG: I -- I don't -- I don't see -- I


don't think that it is with regard to the text of this


statute.  I -- even though the statute does refer to events

that could take place prior to the enactment, the purpose of


the statute, which is what I think the analysis requires


that we consider, is to change the forum of the adjudication


from the old State Department procedure to the -- to the


court procedure under these specific rules.


 QUESTION: How does your -- the discussion about


the statement of interest then fit in?  It seems to me what


you just said is, they meant to take it away from the State


Department and put it in the hands of the court.


 MR. SCHOENBERG: The -- the immunity consideration,


yes, but I think the statute, the Foreign Sovereign


Immunities Act, was not intended to change the rules, for


example, with the act of state doctrine or with the statute


of the limitations or with any of the other doctrines that


might bar an older claim from -- from entering court. 


 Our third point, this I don't want to spend too


much time on, but it's our view that the Foreign Sovereign


Immunities Act merely codified the common law of sovereign


immunity, and therefore, it did not substantially change the


law.  And this is not only my opinion.  If one looks at the


State Department circular that was sent out in 1976 to


foreign states, it says, this enactment will not


substantially alter the rules for deciding sovereign


immunity questions in U.S. courts.  So it was the position


of the State Department at the time that they proposed this


43

legislation that it merely codified what the State


Department then considered to be the rules of sovereign


immunity. 


 And we have an interesting situation, I think an


unprecedented situation, because the common law itself


depended on the views of the State Department, so we have a


little bit of a reflexive situation.  The way I look at it,


let us suppose, for example, that the -- that instead of


enacting the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act they issued


another Tate letter, another letter that merely said,


henceforth we want the courts to adjudicate things under


this -- under this regime.  So it's not a new statute, it's


just a suggestion to the courts on how to decide cases.


 Under this Court's ruling with regard to common


law, non-statutory law, of course that -- that approach


would have to be applied retroactively, and I don't think


it's any less retroactive just because the executive branch


sent it over to Congress and said, we want you to pass the


statute also.  Our last -­


 QUESTION: Any -- any more retroactive?


 MR. SCHOENBERG: Any more retroactive.  Our last -­


our last point is really the basis for the Ninth Circuit's


decision, and that is, as to these parties in this case,


there is no impermissibly retroactive effect, because


Austria could never have had any expectation of immunity

with regard to Mrs. Altmann's claims.


 QUESTION: That would be a pretty good nightmare,


wouldn't it, if we had to have judges trying to work out on


a case-by-case basis, country by country, whether Turkey in


1921 when it was an enemy, had a -- didn't have an


expectation of being treated as a sovereign, but Hungary in


1962 had a different expectation, et cetera.  I mean, that ­


- that -- I think their point on that's a pretty good one,


isn't it?


10

 MR. SCHOENBERG: Well, it -- it's -- but it's not a


11 

point about retroactivity, Your Honor.  The -­

16 

17 

18 

19

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

 QUESTION: Well, it is because they're saying that


unless you treat these things as a whole, you won't


understand the problem.  And even if in your case the


country had no expectation, there are so many countries that


did that -- and going into it case by case is so difficult


that it would better to have an absolute rule.  That's their


arguments.


 MR. SCHOENBERG: It would be better, but that's not


really how the Court's retroactivity analysis has gone over


the last 10 years, and that's -- that's why I certainly


favor some of the earlier arguments.  I think it's easier to


decide the case on those, rather than the way the Ninth


Circuit did in evaluating the expectations, but if one


doesn't decide in our favor on all of those other arguments,


45

that the statute itself is jurisdictional, that Congress


intended it to apply, that there's really no change in the


law because it's the same as the common law of sovereign


immunity, then really under Hughes one has to look at


whether, as to the parties of this case, there is any


retroactive effect, and that -- that's -- that's what the


Hughes holding is.  It's a statute phrased jurisdictionally,


but let's look at what happened here.  You have a new


plaintiff with new incentives and a defense, substantive


10 

defense taken away.  That's the Hughes case.

16 

17 

18

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

 And so it requires you to look outside the four


corners of the statute to look at what was -- what are you


comparing the statute to, when -- when in Hughes the Court


said if it determines whether a cause of action can proceed


and not where, the where question, of course, implies that


you have to look and see if there are other jurisdictions


where the case could be brought. 


 And in this case, as we've made very clear,


Austria could always have been sued, at least since it was


re-established after World War II for these acts, and as a


matter of fact, Austria was required by the United States to


enact restitution laws that were designed to afford people


like Mrs. Altmann relief.  They have never asserted


sovereign immunity in these claims in their own courts and


they would not have been allowed to by the U.S. Government,

and that sentiment, of course, is echoed in the subsequent


treaty in 1955 and it's echoed in the Bernstein letter in


1948 that as to expropriations, as to property taken from


Jewish families in violation of international law, this


country does not recognize sovereign immunity anywhere, not


in the states where -- where -- that were involved, and not


in the United States, and that -- that's -- that's our last


point and that's the Ninth Circuit's position.


 If the Court has no further questions -­


 QUESTION: Is it -- is it correct that -- that we


would be out of step with all other countries if we -- if we


allowed this suit to proceed?


 MR. SCHOENBERG: Well, certainly not as a matter of

notion of limited sovereign immunity, have they all declined


to -- to apply it in a manner that the Government here would


call retroactive?


 MR. SCHOENBERG: Right.  I -- I don't know how all


states have done it.  I know that, for example, in Austria


we cited the Dralle case, which concerned a post-war


communist expropriation of a -- of a subsidiary company in


Czechoslovakia, and a German company was allowed to sue


Czechoslovakia in Austria concerning the trademarks and -­

and the expropriation, and have an Austrian court rule


whether that expropriation violated international law. 


 So I would say as to Austria, the argument is, and


I think we cited also in our brief a statement by an


Austrian professor, Seidl-Hohenveldern, who said that the


courts -- there's nothing in international law that prevents


courts from adjudicating the rights and property taken in


violation of international law.


 Thank you very much.


 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Schoenberg. 


 Mr. Cooper, you have five minutes remaining.


 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT P. COOPER


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


 MR. COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  Just on


that last point, the Dralle case, which is one that we


address in our reply brief, does not stand for the


proposition that Czechoslovakia's expropriation could be


second-guessed in Austria.  Quite the contrary.  Austria


determined that the legality of Czechoslovakia's activities


in their own -- in its own country were not subject to


reconsideration in Austria.  Austria concerned itself only


with whether, given its own neutrality as between


Czechoslovakia and Germany, whether Austria could give


effect to an expropriation as an act of war.  And it


determined that it could not with respect to property

located in Austria.  That issue has nothing to do with


what's before the Court today.


 Sovereign immunity isn't merely a form selection


rule.  It confers on the foreign state the right to choose


whether and where to be sued.  That's a substantive right. 


It's a right this country has always understood as a right


in a sovereign.  Austria's choice, if it did so choose, the


circumstances under which it would provide remedies in its


own country, either by statute or in its own courts, doesn't


constitute a waiver of the sovereignty to which it had been


accorded in this country throughout the current period up to


1976. 


 So this country has always recognized the


difference between a sovereign's right to create a remedy,


and this country has done so in its own instances with


respect to events that were claimed to be the subject of


reparations, and by doing so it has never suggested that it


thought it was subjecting itself to the jurisdiction of a


foreign court for individual claims to be able to look for


more than the statute of the United States provided for.


 In addition, with respect to the law immediately


prior to the enactment of the FSIA, I think the suggestion


was that somehow the United States had -- had eroded the


expropriation rule or that Congress thought that it was


adopting the -- codifying the law of the land with respect

to expropriation in the FSIA, and that plainly is not true.


The legislative history, and more importantly the statements


of the State Department, in particular the -- the digest by


John Boyd with respect to State Department decisions from


1952 to 1976 cited in our brief make it clear that the State


Department considered this to be a fundamental change in the


law.


 The conduct being regulated here is expropriation


or at the very least possession that goes back to events in


1948 alleged in the complaint.  It is not the mere question


of the exercise of jurisdiction here or, worse yet, this


mere substitution of another tribunal.  This is something


that Congress focused on in each of the expropriation


exceptions.  It identified the conduct that it thought the


foreign sovereign had engaged in that justified one of our


narrow exceptions to the general concept of foreign


sovereign immunity. 


 Whether that was an express waiver under (a)(1),


whether that was the exercise of commercial conduct that any


private party could engage in under (a)(2) or the -- or the


expropriation of property in violation of international law


in (a)(3), Congress identified the conduct that it thought


justified the lifting of the generally applicable foreign


sovereign immunity and decided that's the conduct we want to


regulate.  And that's what we think justifies the variance

from our general rule with respect to sovereigns, and that


is a change in the law that requires application of the


retroactivity analysis to treat those sovereigns fairly.


 If there are no further questions, I have nothing.


 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Cooper. 


The case is submitted.


 (Whereupon, at 12:13 p.m., the case in the above­


entitled matter was submitted.)
