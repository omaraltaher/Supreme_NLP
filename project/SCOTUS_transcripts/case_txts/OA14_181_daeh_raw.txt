CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

this  morning  in  Case  14­181,  Gobeille  v.  Liberty  Mutual

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  BRIDGET  C.  ASAY 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ASAY:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Under  ­­ under  the  principles  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted  in  Travelers,  Vermont's  collection  of  health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

care  data  is  not  preempted.  The  database  statute  does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  affect  ERISA  plans  in  any  way  that  undermines 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA's  core  objectives,  does  not  require  plans  to  offer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits,  affect  the  financing  or  fiduciary  standards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  plans,  or  change  the  way  the  plans  administer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits  to  their  members. 

 

 

 

            

Vermont  is  merely  collecting  standardized 

 

 

 

 

data  that  Blue  Cross  necessarily  generates  and  already 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides  to  the  State  for  itself  and  other  entities. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  it  hasn't  been  argued 

  

 

 

 

 

 

by  Liberty,  and  we  can  ask  them  about  that,  that  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burdensome,  that  it  might  be  different  from  State  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  and  so  forth,  and  it  may  be  that  this  sounds  more

in  conflict  preemption  than  statutory  preemption.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

can  you  just  answer  a  few  questions? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Does  this  apply  to  people  that  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residents  in  Vermont  but  that  have  been  treated  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Vermont? 

            

And  does  it  also  apply  to  people  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  of  ­­ that  are  Vermonters  but  are  treated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  Vermont? 

 

              

I  mean,  what  ­­ who  is  the  universe  to  whom 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  ­­ this  applies? 

 

 

 

            

And  it  seems  to  me  that  that  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difficult  for  plans  to  ­­ to  figure  out. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ASAY:  As  implemented  by  the  board,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor,  the  ­­ the  database  requirements  apply  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Vermonters  receiving  health  care  services  from  a  covered 

   

 

 

 

 

 

insurer  regardless  of  their  location,  so  both  inside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Vermont  and  outside  Vermont,  if  it's  paid  for  by  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covered  insurer.  It  does  not  ­­ the  board  has  chosen 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  to  require  data  from  non­Vermont  residents  receiving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

care  in  Vermont. 

 

 

            

With  respect  to  the  ­­ to  the  burden  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  the  burden  issue  ­­

either,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  We  ­­ we  ­­ we  ought  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider  that,  don't  you  think? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ASAY:  I  don't  ­­ I  don't  believe  so, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  because  the  ­­ the  program  that  has  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenged  here  by  Liberty  Mutual  is  the  program  as  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  been  implemented  by  the  board,  and  that  ­­ that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  it  has  been  implemented. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  this  kind  of  generally  applicable  health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

care  regulation  is  not  preempted  for  the  reasons  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  has  expressed  in  a  series  of  decisions, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

including  Travelers,  De  Buono,  Mackey,  and  Dillingham. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  of  the  point  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy  suggested,  that  ­­ that  States  can  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  reporting  requirements?  So  it's  a  little  bit 

   

  

 

 

 

 

like  Egelhoff  in  that  respect,  that  if  there  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uniform  requirements,  that  would  be  less  burdensome,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  each  State  has  its  own  specifications,  then  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

becomes  burdensome  and  costly. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ASAY:  Your  Honor,  two  responses  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that.  The  first  is  that  there  is  simply  no  evidence  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  record  that  there  is  any  cognizable  burden  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third­party  administrators  who  are  health  care  insurers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  generate  this  data  and  are  providing  it  already  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  capacity  as  insurers.

Second,  certainly  some  States  may  choose  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  these  programs  differently,  but  as  several  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amicus  briefs  explain,  including  the  brief  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

National  Association  of  Health  Data  Organizations,  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  carefully  designed  programs  that  track  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

electronic  transaction  rule  under  HIPAA  that  provides 

 

 

 

 

 

 

national  standards  for  electronic  claims  transactions. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Suppose  States  had 

  

 

 

 

different  reporting  requirements  and  the  plan  showed  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  haven't  ­­ I  don't  think  showed,  but  suppose  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

showed  that  this  was  burdensome.  Does  that  affect  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  of  the  preemption  question? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ASAY:  Only  in  this  way,  Your  Honor:  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  the  Court's  holding  in  Travelers  can  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distilled  to  basically  three  questions.  The  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  is: 

 

            

Does  the  plan  ­­ does  the  State  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically  and  directly  regulate  ERISA  plans  only? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  not  at  issue  in  this  case.  It  does  not. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  question  is  whether  the  State  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulating  in  an  area  that  Congress  reserved  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  or  is  regulating  in  an  area  with  which  ERISA  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principally  concerned.  And  here  the  State  is  engaging 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  classic  health  care  regulation,  so  on  that  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  answer  is  no.

And  then  Travelers  leaves  open  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Excuse  me.  You  could  say 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  it's  engaged  in  health  care  regulation.  You  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  say  it's  ­­ it  is  engaged  in  data  collection.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  say  the  latter,  that  is  something  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA  covers. 

 

            

MS.  ASAY:  Your  Honor,  ERISA  governs  plan 

  

 

 

 

 

 

financial  reporting  and  plan  disclosures  to  the  members. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  ­­ primarily  the  reporting  requirements  that  ERISA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sets  out  are  about  the  plan  finances:  actuarial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statements,  statements  of  audited  financial  statements, 

 

 

 

 

 

information  about  how  the  plan  is  ­­ about  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

degree  of  the  plan's  financial  soundness.  And  nothing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Vermont  is  doing  has  anything  to  do  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Is  that  still  true  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  ­­ after  the  Affordable  Care 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Act?  Doesn't  the  Affordable  Care  Act  include  in  ERISA  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section  authorizing  the  Secretary  to  gather  information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  plans  for  the  purpose  of  improving  health  outcomes? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ASAY:  Yes.  The  Affordable  Care  Act 

  

  

 

 

 

 

made  a  technical  amendment  to  ERISA,  which  in  turn 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporated  the  Act's  amendments  to  the  Public  Health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Services  Act.  Those  do  not  change  the  test  for  ERISA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption.  They're  not  part  of  the  plan's  annual

reporting  to  the  Department  of  Labor. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There's  a  couple  of  reasons  for  that.  One 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is  that  the  Affordable  Care  Act  itself  has  a  ­­ has  a  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  ­­ almost  an  anti­preemption  provision,  a  provision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  says  that  the  Affordable  Care  Act  only  prevents 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  State  laws  that  prevent  the  application  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act. 

            

Part  7  of  ERISA  also,  which  has  those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

amendments  in  it,  is  not  part  of  ERISA  as  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

originally  passed.  That  was  added  by  HIPAA.  And  Part  7 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself  has  a  provision  that  says  it  does  not  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  why  does  it  matter  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  ASAY:  ­­ affect  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  ­­ why  does  it  matter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it  was  in  ERISA  as  originally  passed?  It  is  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA  now.  And  it  is  true  that  there  is  sort  of  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anti­preemption  provision,  but  there  is  also  a  provision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Affordable  Care  Act  that  says  that  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions  that  are  added  have  no  effect  on  the  ERISA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption  provision. 

 

            

MS.  ASAY:  That's  right,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  what  do  you  make  of  that? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ASAY:  What  I  make  of  that  is  that  it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  change  the  test  for  preemption  either  way.  And

Travelers  had  been  on  the  books  for  years.  The

MS.  ASAY:  Your  Honor,  I  think  the  answer  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  probably  depends  on  the  area  in  which  the  State  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulating. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  what  they're  doing  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  have  their  ­­ their  Secretary  of  Health  and  Human 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Services  that  would  like  to  know  how  wealthy  or  poor  the

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  think  that's  a  close 

   

  

 

 

 

MS.  ASAY:  That  is  a  close  question. 

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  In  other  words,  they  can  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

gee,  I  see  case  after  case  here  that  says  that  reporting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements  are  a  central  function.  You  know,  I  ­­

   

   

  

 

 

 

you've  read  them  just  as  well  as  I.  And  ­­ and  it  seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me  surprising  that  they  can  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Isn't  that  the  job  of  the  Labor  Department. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  ASAY:  I  think  that  is  primarily  the  job 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Labor  Department.  And  I  ­­ I  say  that  it  ­­

I'm  not  getting  anywhere  with  this  line  of  ­­ because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  ­­ because  I'm  going  to  say  what  about  health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

care.  That's  the  next  question. 

  

 

 

 

            

My  actual  question  I'm  driving  at  is  this: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  should  have  the  information.  I  have  no  doubt  about 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  But  the  question  is  whether  you  have  to  go  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Labor  Department  first  or  HHS  and  say,  we  want  uniform 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules  here,  or  whether  they  have  to  come  to  you  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules  of  50  States  turn  out  to  be  a  mess. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  you  ­­ you  ­­ you  say  you  want  to  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  and  let  them  come  after  me,  and  I  think  the  other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side  says  no.  If  you  want  to  do  what  you  want  to  do,  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  Labor  Department,  get  a  national  rule  that  gives 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  large  range  to  get  what  you  want. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  ASAY:  And  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  I  don't  know  the  answer 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to  that  question.  That's  why  I  ask  it. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ASAY:  And,  Your  Honor,  the  answer  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  question  is  that,  because  this  is  classic  health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

care  regulation  for  which  States  are  responsible  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insurance  rate  review,  budget  review,  health  care 

 

 

 

 

 

 

research  ­­ it  is  an  area  in  which  States  are  permitted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  regulate.  And  they're  permitted  to  regulate  even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

slightly  differently  from  State  to  State.

government  agrees  with  us  that  this  is  an  area  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA  leaves  to  the  States,  even  though  it  involves  data 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collection,  because  ERISA  cannot  possibly  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended  to  sweep  away  all  collection  of  information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  plans  by  States.  Congress  adopted  a  deliberately 

   

  

 

 

 

 

expansive  definition  of  a  welfare  benefit  plan  and  ERISA 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  includes,  not  just  the  direct  provision  of  medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

care,  but  also  day  care  centers,  apprenticeship 

 

 

 

 

 

 

programs,  prepaid  legal  services.  These  are  all  areas 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  which  when  plans  would  act,  they  would  necessarily  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providing  information  to  States. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  ­­ I  see  that  ­­ I  ­­ I 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

see  that  argument  as  to  ERISA  as  originally  enacted,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  am  very  troubled  by  the  fact  that  it  now  authorizes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  collection  of  data  for  the  purpose  of  improving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health  outcomes  ­­ health  care  outcomes.  I  ­­ I  don't 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

see  how  that  ­­ unless  the  anti­preemption  provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saves  the  day,  I  don't  see  how  that  does  not  undermine 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  principal  argument,  which  is  that  ERISA  may  preempt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reporting  of  financial  data  and  that  sort  of  thing,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  doesn't  preempt  the  collection  of  data  regarding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health  care. 

 

            

MS.  ASAY:  Your  Honor,  the  ­­ the  scope  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA's  preemption  provision  in  1144  is  governed  by  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  intended  when  it  passed  ERISA  in  1974.  And  the

include  the  language  that  says,  "does  not  affect  or

considering  the  scope  of  the  ­­ of  the  areas  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  left  to  the  States  in  1974  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  really  don't  see  how  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

can  possibly  be.  If  Congress  enacted  an  amendment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

tomorrow  that  says  one  of  the  core  purposes  of  ERISA  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  collect  health  care  information,  and  here  is  a  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  is  the  health  care  collecting  requirement,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  say,  well,  that's  not  preempted,  because  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  the  purpose  when  they  enacted  the  preemption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision,  originally. 

 

            

MS.  ASAY:  I  would  certainly  say  that  was 

    

 

 

 

 

 

not  preempted  if  it  was  added  to  Part  7,  which  says  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Part  7  does  not  affect  the  test  for  ERISA  preemption  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1144. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  saying  it  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

affect  the  test  is  quite  different  from  saying  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  nothing  changes.  The  test  remains  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same,  but  now,  that  test  is  applied  to  collection, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  ­­ which  the  Labor  Department  is  itself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conducting,  or  is  itself  authorized  to  conduct.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  changing  the  test.  It's  simply  ­­ it's  simply

or  the  law  to  which  the  test  has  been  applied. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ASAY:  It  would  change  the  test,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor,  because  if  ERISA  was  now  considered  to  have  a

Travelers  and  De  Buono.  And  again,  Congress  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  that  doesn't  change 

  

 

 

 

 

the  test.  Our  test  would  still  be  the  same  whether  it's

That's  my  opinion.  I  may  be  the  only  one  who  thinks

forms  you  have  to  go  through. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  if  we  take  you  and  say,  I'm  going  to  ask 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ I'm  really  asking  the  government  this  question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  I  don't  see  why  they're  on  your  side,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they'll  have  an  answer  to  that.  See,  I  want  to  find 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out.  But  what  I  want  to  find  out  is  this:  The  factor  I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saw  was  93  million  people  have  these  plans.  And  if  93 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

million  people  have  these  plans,  there  can  be  50  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  50  different  sets  of  regulations  imposing  a  huge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

financial  burden  upon  health  care. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  were  that  to  happen,  suddenly  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  we're  trying  to  help  under  this  plan  will  find 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves  much  worse  off,  and  purely  for  bureaucratic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons.  If  I  take  their  side  of  it,  I  can  have  some 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

assurance  that  the  purpose  of  Congress  in  these  statutes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  be  fulfilled,  because  there  will  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unnecessary,  conflicting  reporting  requirements,  which 

 

 

 

 

sound  like  nothing,  but  they're  very  expensive  to  ­­ to

subset  of  standardized  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You're  not  going  to  collect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

anything.  All  they're  going  to  say  is  in  our  reg,  you

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  ­­ I  know  your  time  is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

running  up,  but  consider  two  cases.  Case  one:  Vermont 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  only  State  that  requires  this.  Case  two:  50 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

states  requirement  ­­ require  this  and  it's  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  and  it's  burdensome. 

 

 

 

            

            

Same  preemption  analysis?
 

 

 

MS.  ASAY:  Yes,  Your  Honor,  same  preemption
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

analysis 
 

as	  in  Travelers  and  De  Buono  and  Mackey. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  same  result? 

  

 

 

 

            

MS.  ASAY:  Yes,  Your  Honor,  same  result.  As 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  Mackey,  where  this  Court  held  that  State  garnishment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  procedures  as  applied  to  the  very  benefits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  plan  was  paying  out  were  permissible.  Clearly, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  were  going  to  vary  State  by  State,  and  involve  the

FOR  UNITED  STATES,  AS  AMICUS  CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

               

SUPPORTING  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

              

I  would  like  to  start,  if  I  could,  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer's  questions,  and  then  hopefully  I  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

move  on  to  Justice  Alito's  questions  about  the  ACA  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy's  questions  about  the  burden  here.  Let 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  set  out  how  we  see  the  interaction  of  the  preemption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

framework  and  recordkeeping  requirements,  and  then  turn 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  what  I  think  DOL's  role  is  here. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

Both  sides  agree,  essentially,  that  ERISA 

 

 

 

 

 

plans  can  be  subject  to  some  reporting  requirements, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably  many  reporting  requirements,  incident  to  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws  in  other  substantive  fields.  So,  for  example,  the

Solicitor  General  gave  the  example  of  day  care  centers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA  plans  can  run  day  care  centers.  I  don't  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anyone  doubts  that  you  can  have  all  sorts  of  reporting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements  to  make  sure  the  staff  is  trained,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facilities  are  safe.  And  so  forth. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

This  Court's  case  in  De  Buono  upheld  a  tax 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposed  on  employer  contributions  to  an  ERISA  medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  plan  that  provided  the  medical  benefits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly.  And  we  told  the  Court  at  the  time  that  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tax  had  all  sorts  of  reporting  requirements.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially,  the  question  is  here,  where  to  draw  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line  between  reporting  requirements  that  are  permissible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  those  that  are  nonpermissible. 

 

 

 

 

            

As  I  take  Respondent's  view,  it's  that 

   

 

 

 

 

they're  ­­ it's  certain  information  that  is  so  core  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  plan  that  you  simply  can't  have  State  law  reporting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements  about  that  information. 

 

 

 

              

I  don't  think  that  can  be  right.  Take,  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  real  property  held  in  trust  by  a  pension  plan. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

DOL  requires  reporting  on  that.  Obviously,  you  need  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  the  assets  the  pension  plan  has,  but  certainly  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  taxing  authority  can  require  reporting  about  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  information  to  assess  a  property  tax. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

The  same  was  true  with  the  tax  in  De  Buono. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  same  is  true,  by  the  way,  in  Dillingham.  That  was  a

case  about  an  ERISA­run  apprentice  program.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

California  law  said,  you  either  follow  our  standards  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apprenticeship,  or  you  have  to  pay  a  higher  wage.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  that  was  as  core  as  you  get.  It  was  literally  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  the  apprenticeship  program  was  set  up. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  don't  think  the  test  can  be  whether  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  is,  in  some  sense,  core  to  ERISA.  I  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  test  has  to  be,  is  this  reporting  requirement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incident  to  a  law  in  the  field  governed  by  ERISA,  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

vesting,  funding,  fiduciary  duties  and  so  forth  ­­ or  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  incident  to  a  law  in  health  care,  or  in  day  care 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

center  regulation? 

 

            

Here,  I  don't  think  anyone  disputes:  This 

   

  

 

 

 

information  is  used  for  hospital  budget  review,  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health  insurance  rate  review,  for  medical  research. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's  no  question  that  it's  incident  to  classic  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health  care  regulation. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Why  isn't  there  also  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  that  the  law  just  not  be  burdensome  over  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  level? 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  It  ­­ it  is,  Justice  Kagan.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  think  I  cut  short  my  test. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

The  first  inquiry  is:  Is  this  incident  to  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

field  that  ERISA  doesn't  govern?  I  think  that's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied  here.

But  then  there's  still  another  question 

 

 

 

under  Travelers,  which  looked  to  both  purpose  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effects  of  whether  the  effect  of  the  law  is  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burdensome  that  effectively  frustrates  or  impedes  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

design  of  ERISA  plans  or  the  administration  of  ERISA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plans.  And  I  think  a  law  like  this  that  imposes 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

reporting  requirements  on  a  claim  could  theoretically  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  burdensome.  And  so  when  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  How  is  that  any  different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

than  conflict  preemption?  How  does  that  give  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  effect  to  the  statute  here?  I  mean,  you  could 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  that  argument  if  there  was  no  preemption  provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  Well,  I  ­­ I  think  the  way  it's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

different  than  conflict  preemption,  or  at  least  one  way, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  if  it  actually  is  in  the  core  field  governed  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA,  I  mean,  if  the  State  said,  we  just  want  to  make 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure  these  pension  plans  are  well­funded,  so  we're  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  ask  for  reports  incident  to  that  role,  it  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempted  even  if  the  requirements  weren't  particularly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burdensome. 

              

I  mean,  the  Court  has  never  held  that  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific  case,  but  I  think  the  Court's  analysis  leans 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

towards  that  direction.  So  it  could  either  be  within 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  preempted  field,  in  which  case  it  relates  to  ERISA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plans  and  it's  out,  or  it  could  be  so  burdensome  that  it

your  opinion  and  the  opinion  of  a  few  other  justices 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  suggested  we  should  shift  to  field  preemption.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  if  the  Court  were  to  say  what  we've  been  doing  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

along  is  field  preemption,  and  it  makes  more  sense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrinally  to  classify  it  that  way,  from  the  Department 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Labor's  perspective,  that  would  be  fine. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  we  would  be  a  little  bit  concerned 

   

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  Court  signaled  to  lower  courts  in  its  opinion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  was  marking  a  big  shift  in  its  jurisprudence

saw  93  million  people.  And  there  are  associations  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  the  place  that  are  worried  about  this  problem.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  have  a  big  chart  where  they  show  the  possibilities 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ of  conflict.  You  yourself  are  worried  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conflict.  Conflict  among  States  in  requirements  means 

  

 

 

 

 

 

money.  A  lot  of  money.  That's  what  they  say,  and 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  plausible. 

 

            

So  what  I  want  to  know  is:  What  do  you  all 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

propose  to  do  about  that  in  the  U.S.  government?  One 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  to  do  about  it  ­­ and  I've  looked  up  the  regs,  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe  Justice  Scalia  disagrees,  but  I'm  talking  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  I  think.  All  right? 

   

  

 

            

The  ­­ the  ­­ it  seems  like  they  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  to  issue  regs  either  way;  blocking,  or  getting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permission  first.  That's  where  I  ended  up,  and  that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  I  wanted  your  view  about.  You  see  what  I'm  saying? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  I  see  what  you're  saying. 

    

 

 

 

 

There's  two  pieces  there,  whether  this  actually  has  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden  and  what  we  could  do  about  it  if  there  was.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  mean  to  suggest  we  think  it  has  a  burden. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It's  the  view  of  the  Department  of  Justice

essentially  what  Justice  Kennedy  said.  It's  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  50  States  devise  50  different  requirements  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this,  different  formatting,  different  particular 

 

 

 

 

information  requested,  that  just  all  adds  up  to  a  lot  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hassle,  which  all  adds  up  to  a  lot  of  money. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  Two  points.  I  mean,  first  it 

    

  

 

 

 

 

seems  far  less  burdensome  than  State  laws  this  Court  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already  upheld,  or  that  State  laws  that  I  think  most 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  would  agree  have  to  be  upheld. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  the  tax  ­­ or  the  surcharge  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Travelers  ­­ that  was  the  case  where  you  bought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial  insurance,  you  had  to  pay  a  surcharge  up  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24  percent  more  on  medical  purchases,  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unbelievably  burdensome,  and  surely  had  reporting 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements  associated  with  it.  And  having  to  pay

vastly  different  surcharges  in  50  States  could  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burdensome  too. 

 

            

What  this  Court's  precedents  have  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

including  Travelers  and  Dillingham  and  De  Buono  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  mere  burden  is  not  enough.  What  has  to  be  shown  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  interferes  with  the  administration  of  benefits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

So  in  Egelhoff  ­­

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  a 

  

 

 

 

 

consistent  theme  in  our  cases,  when  you  say  a  mere 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden  is  not  enough,  is  that  the  government  wants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employers  to,  one,  set  things  up  ­­ they  don't  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ and  two,  they  want  the  money  to  go  to  benefits,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  go  to  administrative  and  bureaucracy  expenses. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is  it  your  view  in  analyzing  this  question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  we  look  at  what  would  happen  if  50  States  adopted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  programs,  or  do  we  look  at  just  Vermont 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  Vermont  happens  to  be  first? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  The  former.  Our  view  is  you  have 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  contemplate  the  50  States  would  adopt  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regimes? 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Yeah,  I  think  that's 

   

  

 

 

 

right.  So  you  don't  think  50  different  regimes  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reporting  is  going  to  require  a  significant  diversion  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  away  from  benefits  to  administration? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  Not  ­­ not  on  this  record.  Mr.

Chief  Justice,  recall  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  kind  of  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

record  do  you  need  to  show  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  BASH:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Of  course  you  can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  record  of  what  50  States  are  doing  if  it's  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical  question. 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  Well,  I  think  there's  a  couple 

   

   

  

 

 

ways  Respondent  could  have  made  the  showing  here.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  at  minimum,  Respondent  could  have  had  its  own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third­party  administrator  come  in  and  say  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reporting  requirements  are  burdensome;  this  is  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've  had  to  do.  We've  had  to  change  the  way  we  process 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  because  they're  so  burdensome.  I  suspect  they 

    

 

 

 

 

 

could  not  have  made  that  showing  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  you  have  pages  26  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

27  of  the  Blue  Cross  Blue  Shield  brief.  And  there  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  big  chart,  and  there  are  all  these  organizations 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  there  that  are  trying,  like  the  Uniform  Law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commissioners,  to  create  uniformity.  That's  why  I  say 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that's  why  I'm  puzzled  as  to  what  to  do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Am  I  supposed  to  write  an  opinion  that  says 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  though  Blue  Cross  Blue  Shield  feels  it's  a  big  mess 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  trying  to  straighten  it  out,  they  didn't  make  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  record  in  the  Vermont  trial  court?  How  do  I  write

that  opinion? 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  Going  to  the  ­­ the  chart  point, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  the  chart  actually  doesn't  show  conflicting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements.  Most  of  the  counterpoints  they  have  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  not  required.  I  don't  think  there  are  conflicting 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements. 

            

And  even  if  you  look  at  the  end  of  the  Blue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cross  Blue  Shield  brief,  they  never  actually  say  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  mean,  I'm  serious.  How 

    

  

 

 

 

do  I  write  the  opinion?  I  suppose  it  could  happen,  but 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  hasn't  happened  yet.  How  do  I  write  the  opinion? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  BASH:  I  think  ­­ I  think  the  opinion  is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

written  like  this:  One,  this  is  a  reporting  requirement 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

incident  to  a  field  that  is  not  governed  by  ERISA, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health  care  regulation.  It's  presumptively  valid,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we're  going  to  look  and  see  if  Respondent  has  made  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

showing  that  it's  so  burdensome,  it  fundamentally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changes  the  way  plans  are  administered  or  designed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent  has  not  made  that  showing  here.  That  is  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  opinion  is  written. 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  this  Court  has  never  actually  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  a  burden  is  so  bad  that  it's  preempted,  even  if  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operates  in  a  field  outside  of  ERISA.  It  has  suggested 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  dicta  that  it's  possible,  but  that  is  inherently  a

factual  determination,  and  it's  hard  to  see  how  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  could  reach  that  conclusion  without  some  factual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

showing  ­­

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  we  go  through  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  point  ­­ all  of  a  sudden  there  ­­ the  11th  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  does  this,  and  it's  the  11  different  things,  we  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  a  burden?  Is  that  a  sufficient  burden?  We  say 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

no.  But  then  when  30  States  do  it,  maybe  it's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  answer.  That  seems  like  a  very  odd  preemption 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

analysis. 

            

MR.  BASH:  Well,  I  ­­ I  don't  think  it 

   

   

  

 

 

 

should  turn  on  that,  Mr.  Chief  Justice.  I  do  think  it's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate  for  a  court  to  consider  what  if  50  States 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose  different  requirements  like  this.  But  just  like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  different  States  might  have  different  requirements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  daycare  centers,  or  for  prepaid  legal  services, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that,  I  don't  think,  is  the  sort  of  burden  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  this  goes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  basic,  very  comprehensive  reporting  of  data.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  simply,  well,  if  you  run  a  daycare  center,  you  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  comply  with  the  rules  about  daycare  centers.  Of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course  you  do.  It's  quite  different. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

One  of  the  things  ERISA  plans  do  is  report 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data  and  compile  data.  And  it  seems  to  me  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  that  says,  well,  daycare  centers  you  can.  That

do  it  in  two  sentences. 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  that  the  burden  here  is  far  less 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial  than  the  burden  of  complying  with  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apprenticeship  regulations  for  the  way  you  designed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

program  in  Dillingham.  Here,  most  self­insured  plans 

  

 

 

 

 

 

use  third­party  administrators.  And  often  those 

  

 

 

 

 

third­party  administrators  are  insurance  companies  that 

 

 

 

 

 

already  have  the  infrastructure  in  place  for  reporting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements  as  applied  to  them  which  cannot  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempted  under  ERISA.

nationally  under  nationally  uniform  rules  of 

 

 

 

 

 

administration,  first  and  foremost,  rules  about 

 

 

 

 

 

recordkeeping  and  reporting. 

 

 

            

 

Now,  of  course  ERISA  plans,  like  other 

 

 

 

 

 

regular  businesses,  are  subject  to  ancillary  regulation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  maintaining  a  safe  workplace,  paying  minimum  wage 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and  prevailing  wage  laws,  paying  their  State  real  estate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taxes  on  their  headquarters,  and  if  they  choose  to  run  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hospital,  run  a  law  firm  for  their  legal  services, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  program,  run  a  childcare  center,  they  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

subject  to  local  regulation  like  other  providers  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  local  services. 

 

 

            

But  in  every  single  case  in  this  Court,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  lower  court  decision  that  I  have  found  in  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts  have  upheld,  State  by  State,  reporting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements,  it  has  always  been  incident  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantive  obligation  that  the  State  could  impose.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  one  contends  that  Vermont  could  impose  substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  on  the  claims  that  Liberty  Mutual  pays  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  employment  plan. 

 

 

            

            

Now,  I  want  to  go  to  the  point  of  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Waxman,  why  was  it  that

lower  courts  here?

is  the  subject  to  the  subpoena.  But  we  did  introduce 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial  evidence  in  the  record  below,  and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  of  it  is  included  in  the  Joint  Appendix,  and  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  pages  that  are  extra  long  folded  in,  about  what  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  we  have  to  do,  both  in  Vermont  and  in  the  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  other  States  that  imposed  very,  very  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reporting  obligations. 

 

            

So  we  didn't  put  a  dollars  and  cents  in,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  did  make  the  lower  court,  the  district  court,  on  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

request,  very  aware  of  this  very  substantial  burden.

MR.  WAXMAN:  Well,  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ so  I  ask  you:  If  it 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

does  come  about,  if  it  should  come  about  and  you  lost 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case,  why  can't  your  clients  go  right  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department  of  Labor,  whose  regulations  I've  read,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibly  ACCA,  and  say,  we  want  you  to  impose  a  uniform 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

national  data  collection  system  or  the  equivalent,  put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limits,  and  then  preempt  the  conflicting  State  limits? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  it  may  be  other  members  of  the  Court  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  agree  with  this  approach,  but  I've  written  a  case, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MetroMedia,  where  I  think  the  agencies  have  a  lot  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

power  there,  and  I  think  they  have  more  capacity  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide  this  kind  of  thing  than  a  group  of  judges. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

points: 

            

So  what  about  that  for  you? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  WAXMAN:  Justice  Breyer,  a  couple  of 

   

  

 

 

 

First,  in  the  lower  court  and  in  this  Court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neither  party  on  the  other  side  has  disputed  what  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  is  the  self­evident  proposition,  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department  of  Labor  and  now  the  Department  of  Labor  and

kind  of  recordkeeping  and  reporting  requirements  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Vermont  and  now  17  or  19  other  States  do.  They  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  disavowed  that.  The  ­­ the  SG's  brief  at  both  the

suggests  that  that's  right,  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  that  sounds  like  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

one­size­fits­all  solution,  and  there's  some  value  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  being  able  to  think  about  their  own  health  care

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  to  think  about  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

things  they  want. 

 

 

            

So  I  mean,  just  again,  let's  go  back  to  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden  because  it  is  a  very  intuitive  idea  that  you  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  your  side:  50  different  States;  that's  a  lot  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

money.  But  I  guess  I  wonder  why  it  is  a  lot  of  money. 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  as  I  understand  what's  going  on  here,  that  all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  data  that's  being  requested  is  data  that  Blue  Cross 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Blue  Shield  generates  anyway.  That  all  the  data  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  requested  is  data  that  Blue  Cross  Blue  Shield 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reports  for  other  people.  That  really  this  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formatting  question,  even  with  respect  to  the  wide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

variety  of  States,  that  the  States  have  started  getting

before  Congress  that  small  plans  were  spending  up  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  percent  of  their  entire  assets  on  State  reporting.

information  with  respect  to  individuals  that  its  own

providing  the  information  for? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  Justice  Ginsburg,  the  Blue 

  

 

 

 

 

Cross  Blue  Shield  Association  has  actually  filed  a  brief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  its  ­­ in  this  case,  and  it  explains  at  great  detail, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  does  the  brief  of  the  multi­employer  plans,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  Liberty  Mutual  operate  in  50  States,  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden,  about  the  fact  that  Blue  Cross  Blue  Shield 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  have  all  this  information  in  the  normal  course, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  multi­employer  plans  don't  have  it,  and  Blue  Cross 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Blue  Shield,  as  a  third­party  administrator,  has  told 

   

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  just  exactly  how  burdensome  and  how  expensive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is. 

 

            

Of  course  they  could  do  it  for  Liberty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mutual  in  Vermont.  The  only  question  is  how  much  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  cost  and  how  much  they're  going  to  charge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  look,  for  example,  at  since  this  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

since  this  litigation  began,  the  Commonwealth  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts  has  now  told  Liberty  Mutual  that  it  wants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reporting  under  its  APCD  statute.  And  as  we  recount  at

States  ­­ more  and  more  States  adopt  these  mandatory

And  the  Blue  Cross  Blue  Shield  Association  amicus  brief

he  finds  that  such  data  or  information  is  necessary  to

adverting  to  Justice  Alito's  comments,  in  the  ACCA,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Secretary  has  the  authority  to  require  the  production

So  the  notion  that  preemption  here  is  sort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  like  an  ­­ operates  like  an  accordion  ­­ if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department  of  Labor  has  the  authority  to  get  it  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hasn't  chosen  to  exercise,  it's  not  preempted;  but  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  did  promulgate  a  regulation,  either  of  your  color 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  Justice  Scalia's  color,  that  it  would  be  preempted  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  crazy  ­­ is  a  crazy  notion. 

   

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  might  think  this  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sane,  but  what  I'm  ­­ the  way  I'm  seeing  it  here  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  two  competing  problems.  One  is  they  should  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able  to  get  information  like  this  in  the  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

But  two,  there  is  a  problem  of  burden. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

And  I  think  there  are  probably  100  or  200 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  in  Department  of  Labor  and  HHS  that  could  write 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regs  that  reconcile  those  problems  and  allow  both.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  can't,  because  I'm  a  judge. 

   

 

 

 

            

So  what  I'm  trying  to  figure  out  is  how  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret  this  statute  in  a  way  that  achieves  those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

objectives.

MR.  WAXMAN:  How  to  interpret  this  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

as  to  say  that  in  exchange  for  blanket  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  of  these  plans,  now  augmented  in  the  context 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  health  care  plans  by  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  Federal  government,  the  States  are  preempted  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulating  the  core  functions  of  what  an  ERISA  plan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does.  And  there  is  nothing  more  core  than  the  payment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  benefits. 

 

            

If  the  State  is  attempting  to  regulate, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it's  by  substantively  regulating  or  imposing  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recordkeeping  or  reporting  obligation  about  the  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity  that  defines  it  as  an  ­­ as  an  ERISA  plan,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

payment  of  benefits,  that  State  law  necessarily  relates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to,  because  it  has  a  connection  with,  an  ERISA  plan. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  frankly,  it's  pretty  ironic  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  and  the  government  claim  on  the  one  hand  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  so  important  to  get  this  information  from  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plans  because  60  percent  of  all  citizens  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  get  their  health  care  from  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­funded  plans,  and  yet  requiring  them  to  keep  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  records  that  the  State  wants  and  to  report  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  a  quarterly,  annually,  or  monthly  basis,  has  no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

relation  to  or  connection  with  the  plan.  I  don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  how  both  of  those  thoughts  can  inhere  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  time.

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Waxman,  I  guess  I  just 

   

   

  

 

 

don't  understand  this  argument.  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  mean,  I  ­­

    

   

   

   

 

 

 

I  understand  completely  that  there  should  be  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restriction  on  overly  burdensome  State  regulations  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  kind.  You  know,  it  could  be  taxes,  it  could  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day  care,  it  could  be  anything.  Right?  But  why  is  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  regulation  falls  in  a  different  category  than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

taxes  or  childcare  or  anything  else?  Because  the  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  clearly  is  not  attempting  to,  and  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulating,  payment  of  benefits.  It's  doing  something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  has  an  effect  on  your  operations,  no  doubt,  but  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  is  operating  in  a  completely  separate  area  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely  separate  purposes  in  a  way  that  does  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

trump  or  conflict  with,  or  anything  else,  the  choices 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ERISA  has  made  as  to  payment  of  benefits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  Okay.  I  ­­ I  want  to  ­­ I  want 

    

   

   

  

 

 

 

to  come  to  the  end  and  dispute  that  premise  that  you  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  end  of  your  question.  But  if  the  ­­ if  you  look  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  cases  that  have  set  about  to  evaluate  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden,  or  at  least  included,  as  in  the  last  section  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Travelers,  a  section  that  says  of  course  if  this  were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terribly  burdensome  there  might  be  another  question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  are  cases  ­­ and  it's  Travelers,  Dillingham,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

De  Buono.  We  all  agree  on  that  ­­ those  were  all  cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  which  there  was  a  burden  being  placed  on  an  entity

that  wasn't  ­­ in  Travelers  it  was  hospitals;  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

De  Buono  it  was  hospitals;  in  Dillingham  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apprenticeship  programs,  all  of  which  affected  the  price 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ERISA  plans  might  have  to  pay  to  get  benefits  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

services  from  those  kinds  of  providers. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  it  took  several  sentences  in  each  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  ­­ several  paragraphs  in  each  of  those  opinions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  to  explain  how  putting  a  tax  on  the  non­Blue  Cross 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insurance  plans  in  Travelers,  or  respecting  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevailing  wage  rate  in  California,  actually  had  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  on  any  ERISA  plan  anyway,  because  they  weren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  of  the  plans,  per  se.  They  were  indirect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations.  And  when  the  regulation  is  indirect,  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  it  is  not  a  regulation  that  is  directed  at  the  very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity  that  makes  the  plan  an  ERISA  plan,  you  do  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  burden.  And  indirect  regulation  obviously  can  occur. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  if  ­­ as  this  Court  explained  in  the  last  section  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Travelers,  if  it's  too  burdensome,  it  might  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preempted. 

            

But  where  the  regulation  is  direct,  where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  is  requiring  reporting  because  the  self  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  self­insured  plan  is  engaged  in  the  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity  that  brings  it  under  ERISA  that  qualifies  it  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  ERISA  plan,  that  obviously  relates  to  and  has  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

connection  with  the  plan,  and  is  preempted.

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You're  ­­ you're  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

that  the  State  simply  cannot  have  an  all  ­­ all­payer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

database,  that  that's  out  because  ERISA  precludes  it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  though  it's  going  to  leave  a  big  hole  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  that  the  State  has  about  that  health  care 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being  given  to  its  citizens, 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  I  don't  think  that  that's  at 

    

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  case,  Justice  Ginsburg,  and  I  don't  want  to  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misunderstood  about  this. 

 

 

            

The  State  of  Vermont,  just  to  take  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example:  The  database  statute  authorizes  the  relevant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Secretary  to  obtain  this  information  from  everybody,  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  who  pays  for  health  care  in  Vermont,  but  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hospitals  and  clinics  that  provide  it.  But  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Secretary,  the  executive  official  has  chosen  not  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require  that  information  from  hospitals  and  clinics  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctors  in  Vermont. 

 

 

            

There  is  also  no  doubt  that  if  all­payer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  databases  so  badly  need  the  information  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­funded  plans,  and  it  turns  out  that  the  self­funded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plan  ­­ a  significant  number  of  self­funded  plans  say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

no,  that's  preempted,  the  Federal  government  has  all  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  it  needs  to  get  that  information  and  require 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  information  be  provided,  either  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Secretary  and  then  to  the  States,  or  directly  to  the

And  in  fact,  they  can  do  what  often  happens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  areas  of  field  preemption  and  express  preemption, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  to  make  it  worth  the  plan's  while.  You  know? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  can  offer  all  sorts  of  benefits  to  self­employed

explanation  whatsoever  from  the  State  of  Vermont  at  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stage  as  to  why  they  haven't  requested  the  actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providers  of  these  health  care  services  to  provide  the

Circuit  oral  argument  transcript,  which  is  recorded  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussed  in  Judge  ­­ Judge  Straub's  dissenting  opinion, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  was  asked,  you  know,  look,  how  important  is  it

your  point  ­­

 

 

            

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  No,  you're  not. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  ­­ it  seems  to  me  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

much  ­­ much  easier. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  It  ­­ perhaps  it's  easier,  but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here's  the  point.  And  this  is  the  insight  of  the  ERISA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption  provision:  The  hospitals  in  Vermont,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

clinics  in  Vermont,  the  medical  practices  in  Vermont  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  subject  to  varying  regulation  in  50  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States.  They  operate  locally.  They're  subject  to  State 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

regulation. 

            

Here,  we're  talking  about  plans  that 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  wanted  to  encourage  that  would  do  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new,  that  would  provide  health  care  benefits  and  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  benefits  on  a  national  basis,  and  in  order  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foster  that,  to  subject  them  to  a  single  set  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reporting,  recordkeeping,  and  regulatory  obligations. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that,  it  seems  to  me,  is  the  insight  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ERISA.  And  it  was  the  ­­ the  bargain  that  ERISA  plainly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

struck. 

              

I  ­­ I  simply  noted  in  response  to 

   

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg's  question  that  the  State  statute  gives 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  the  authority  to  do  it.  There  aren't  that  many 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hospitals  in  Vermont.  They  already  have  all  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  about  what  services  are  or  aren't  being

The  State  could  have  said,  no,  no,  no.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely  can't  get  by  without  this.  But  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

representation  at  oral  argument  in  front  of  the  judge, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  has  also  been  transcribed  and  is  in  the  record, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  ­­ the  lawyer  representing  the  State  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  was  sort  of  trying  to  settle  this  case  and  said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  how  much  do  you  really  need  this  information? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  response  was,  we  don't  really  need  it.  This  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  a  couple  of  employees.  This  is  just  one  plan.  But 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  principle  here. 

   

 

            

And  we  agree  with  that.  And  we  also  agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  representations  of  my  friends  on  the  other  side 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  question  for  this  Court  ­­ it  has  to  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account  of  the  possibility,  which  is  the  emerging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reality,  that  all  50  States  and  the  District  of  Columbia 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Puerto  Rico  will  have  their  own  mandatory  all­payer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  databases  that  will  require  different  things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  if  I  can  just  anticipate  Justice

look,  as  I  said,  at  the  Massachusetts  APCD  statute, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  the  only  other  State  that's  actually  come  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Liberty  Mutual  so  far,  and  look  at  our  discussion  of  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  Page  36,  the  stuff  that  they  are  asking  for  is  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  critical  to  what  the  plan  does. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  this  is  ­­ this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

information  is  provided  by  Blue  Cross  for  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­insured  plans,  right? 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  I  believe  that  ­­ I  believe 

    

   

 

 

 

that  the  record  shows  that  Blue  Cross  Blue  Shield 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides  this  information  to  Vermont,  not  only  on  behalf 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  itself  as  an  insurer,  but  also  some  other  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  do  we  know  ­­ do  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know  what  costs  Blue  Shield  then  passes  on  to  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  self­insured  plans? 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  We  don't  know  it.  We  were  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

able  to  get  it  from  Blue  Cross  at  the  time  the  case  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  the  district  judge. 

 

 

 

            

But  in  any  event,  as  the  Chief  Justice's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  suggests,  the  ­­ this  issue  doesn't  end  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Vermont.  It  ­­ it  has  to  take  account  of  a  burden  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  was  very,  very  aware  of,  it  was  very  cognizant

And  I  really  commend  to  the  Court  the  amicus 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  filed  by  the  multi­employer  plans  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These  are  plans  that  are  essentially  union­sponsored 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plans.  They  are  not  fancy  plans.  Every  dollar  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  have  to  spend  comply  ­­ gathering  the  data  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

each  State  ­­ that  different  States  say  they  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  comes  directly  out  of  the  benefits  that  they  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay.  Just  as  if  ­­ if  Vermont  decides  next  week,  if  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wins  this  case,  that  it  wants  to  get  information  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pension  plans,  and  how  they're  being  administered,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  benefits  are  being  provided  and  not  provided,  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  all  100  percent  self­funded  plans.  If  my  employer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  to  provide  all  that  information,  that  is  coming  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  my  401(k)  benefits. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Waxman,  could  a  State 

   

  

 

 

 

pass  a  tax  law  that  requires  information  about  ­­ about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pension  disbursements,  about  claim  payments,  about 

 

 

 

 

 

assets  held  in  trust?  Could  a  State  do  that? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  I  don't  think  that  a  State  ­­

requires  information  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  taxing  the  right  things. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  In  other  words,  we  want  to  tax 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  benefits  that  you're  getting  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Do  you  think  that  a  State 

   

  

 

 

 

 

tax  law  can't  require  any  information  about  any  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  that  ERISA  does,  that  the  plans  do,  pension 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disbursements,  assets,  claim  payments,  nothing? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WAXMAN:  I  ­­ I  think  not.  I  think  that 

    

    

   

 

 

 

the  State  ­­ I  mean,  I  don't  think  this  case  turns  on 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  but  thinking  about  it,  if  the  State  could  say,  look, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  just  want  to  know  all  the  benefits  that  you  pay  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  our  residents,  I  think  that  would  be  preempted. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As  I  say,  that's  ­­ that's  not  what's  going 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  here.  And  even  if  I'm  wrong  about  it,  it  seems  to  me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  is  quite  different.  You  know,  there  is  a  lot 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  discussion  on  the  other  side  of,  you  know,  this  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  the  press  of  a  button  and  all  the  information 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes. 

            

And  our  brief  goes  on  for  pages  and  pages, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  other  amici  ­­ amicus  briefs  show  how  that  is  so

far  from  true.  In  order  to  comply  with  these,  it's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  a  question  of  saying,  oh,  yes,  we  paid  Seth  Waxman 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

$300  in  benefits  last  year.  This  requires  that  we  keep

differ  from  one  State  to  another.  And  for  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons,  unless  the  Court  has  questions,  I  will  submit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  judgment  should  be  affirmed. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Ms.  Asay,  you  have  three  minutes  remaining. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

          

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  BRIDGET  C.  ASAY 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  ASAY:  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

I'd  like  to  begin  with  Justice  Sotomayor's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  about  the  standardized  data,  because  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  ties  in  nicely  with  many  questions  from  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  question  of  burden. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  way  that  electronic  claims 

 

 

 

 

 

transactions  work  is  not  something  that  the  State  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Vermont  invented.  It's  part  of  HIPAA.  It's  a  Federal 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

regulation  called  the  Electronic  Transaction  Rule,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  sets  standardized  coding  and  formatting  requirements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  transaction  between  the  payer  and  the  provider. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we  ­­ we  don't  even  have  to  look  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  for  that,  although  that's  in  45  C.F.R.  Part

160,  but  it's  actually  in  the  record  at  Joint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix  66.  This  is  the  agreement  between  Blue  Cross 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Liberty  Mutual,  which  says  that  Blue  Cross  shall  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capable  of  transmitting  electronic  data  for  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transaction  standards  have  been  promulgated  in 

 

 

 

 

 

compliance  with  HIPAA  Electronic  Transactions  Rule  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall,  to  the  extent  possible,  transmit  electronic  data 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  accordance  with  that  rule. 

 

 

 

 

            

That  is  how  third­party  administrators  work, 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  is  why  self­insured  plans  nearly  always  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third­party  administrator,  which  is  typically  a  health 

   

 

 

 

 

insurer  to  process  claims,  because  although  it  may  look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  surface  as  though  these  reporting  requirements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  ­­ the  data  collection  seems  very  complicated, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  complicated  not  because  of  anything  Vermont  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done.  It's  because  there  is  the  standardized  national 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  for  how  this  data  is  collected,  which  is  fairly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific,  fairly  detailed,  and  they're  already  doing  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  it  is  generating  a  pool  of  tremendously 

   

 

 

 

 

 

helpful  data  that  has  incredible  potential  to  help 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  and  the  Federal  government  figure  out  ways  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bend  the  cost  curve  and  improve  the  provision  of  health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

care  delivery  to  everyone  in  the  country.

experimentation.  It  authorized  the  Federal  government 

  

 

 

 

 

to  provide  Medicare  claims  data  to  the  States.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized  ­­ it  created  the  Center  for  Medicare  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Medicaid  Innovation,  which  then  authorized  States  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experiment,  to  develop  new  models  for  delivery,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then  need  to  be  tested  and  evaluated.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  has  explained  in  its  brief  that  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

programs  depend  upon  the  collection  of  all­payer  data, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  something  only  the  States  are  doing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  promise  here  is  enormous,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  ­­ and  the  loss  of  this  data  to  the  plans  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tremendous.  I  would  like  to  address  briefly  one  issue 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  my  friend  raised,  which  is  the  question  of  provider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data.  Vermont  does,  in  fact,  collect  provider  data,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've  collected  it  for  a  very  long  time.  It's  called 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hospital  discharge  data,  and  it  was  one  of  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

data  sets  that  researchers  looked  to.  But  it's  not  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

helpful  as  all­payer  data,  and  here's  why. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Hospitals  don't  have  information  that  tracks 

 

 

 

 

 

care  across  an  episode  of  care.  If  someone  has  their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knee  replaced,  it  starts  with  the  doctor's  visit,  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surgery.  There's  an  anesthesiologist.  There's  a  stay 

   

  

  

 

 

at  a  rehab  facility.  There's  follow­up  physical 

   

  

 

 

 

therapy.  And  if  you're  trying  to  compare  outcomes  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

costs  for  a  procedure  like  that,  it's  the  payer,  the
