CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 02-1343, Engine Manufacturers Association and


Western States Petroleum Association v. the South Coast


Air Quality Management District.


Mr. Phillips.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


In 1967, Congress enacted section 209(a) of the


Clean Air Act, which is reproduced in the petitioners'


brief at page 1. 


That statute prohibits States and their 

localities from adopting or attempting even to enforce,


quote, any standard relating to the control of emissions


from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines. 


In this case, a political subdivision of the


State of California has adopted fleet rules that prohibit


the purchase by certain fleets of various classes of -- of


vehicles that are otherwise certified for purchase in the


State of California and, indeed, have essentially


precluded the purchase by those organizations of diesel-


fueled vehicles in toto.


QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, this is a facial

challenge? 


MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, Justice O'Connor, it is a


facial challenge. 


QUESTION:  Claiming total preemption.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, claiming total preemption.


QUESTION:  What if we were to think that at


least as applied to the district's own purchases of


vehicles, that it could limit itself to what kinds of


vehicles it wanted to purchase and therefore is valid at


least in part?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the -- there are two


answers to that.  One, the district doesn't need a statute


in order to purchase its own vehicles.  There is no basis


for adopting a standard that controls that particular 

situation. 


QUESTION:  Well, but let's suppose it wants to


establish a standard to apply now and in the future for


itself and for any other jurisdiction, public


jurisdiction, within its area?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, if it goes beyond --


QUESTION:  If it's authorized to do that.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, if it goes beyond what it


wants to purchase itself and imposes requirements on


others, then it seems to me that's a standard that falls


within the ambit of the preemption.

 QUESTION:  What if -- what if the State -- what


if the State of California says that all of our officials,


including the Governor, shall have a low emissions


vehicle?


MR. PHILLIPS:  I think that -- that there is a


serious question as to whether or not that would be


preempted.  I -- I don't think it's presented, obviously,


by the particulars of this case.  I mean, it still look --


sounds like a --


QUESTION:  Well, but it seems -- it seems to me


that -- that it is from -- from the standpoint of -- of


governmentally owned and operated vehicles.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think the answer to the


question at the end of the day, Justice Kennedy, would be 

that you would require a clearer statement from Congress


than what you have in section 209(a) to interfere with the


kind of purchasing decisions that localities are -- are


making in contrast to this.


QUESTION:  Right, but -- but it seems to me not


-- not an answer to Justice O'Connor's concern to say that


it goes beyond the particulars of this case because when


you make a facial challenge, you are going beyond the


particulars of this case.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I understand that, Justice


Scalia.  Well, there are two answers to that, one that I

was trying to answer before which is I don't think that


this provision actually covers that particular situation


because you don't need this provision in order to have


authority as a local jurisdiction to make purchases on


your own as to what you're going to buy.  That's not, I


don't think, a standard within the meaning of the statute.


But second of all, I also don't think that the


-- it must be unconstitutional in all respects as the


controlling standard of law in this particular context


either.  It is clear that there is a significant component


of this -- of these fleet rules that is preempted, and


perhaps all of them are preempted.  But we were dismissed


out at the earliest stages of these proceedings without an


opportunity to demonstrate the metes and bounds of the 

regulations as they would particularly apply at this -- at


-- at this particular juncture.


QUESTION:  No, but we may --


QUESTION:  I'm still not sure -- sure where we


are.  It -- it seemed to me that the regulation talks


about some private vehicles, trash hauling and airport


shuttles, but it also talks about exclusively


governmentally owned vehicles.  And it seemed to me that


the State can do whatever it has -- whatever standard it


wants for its own vehicles.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, our -- our challenge is not

intended, frankly, to interfere with the local


jurisdiction's ability to purchase their own vehicles on


their own behalf.


QUESTION:  Local jurisdictions.  I mean, you


know, what's that?  Are you saying that it is a standard


if the City of Los Angeles has a regulation through the


city council that applies to the purchasing of every


little local area?  Or suppose the State of California has


a general regulation respecting only governmental


purchases.  Are you saying right now that all those -- in


other words, rules, regulations, standards, practices by


the State of California or some part thereof -- that does


nothing more than control purchasing by governmental units


of that State is fine?  They can do that. 


MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  That's what we're saying.


QUESTION:  All right. 


MR. PHILLIPS:  We don't -- we don't have any


challenge to that.


QUESTION:  In that case we're now down to the


possibility that we're talking about some garbage trucks,


I think, and some airport vehicles because I think all the


rest of it did just involve the State.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it's difficult to know


precisely what the metes and bounds of it is, but the


portion of this that offends us and the portion that we

think does not require a clearer statement, which is that


which goes directly to non-governmental entities.  If --


if you're talking about regulating the purchasing choices


of pure governmental entities, then you expect Congress to


speak with a -- with a clearer voice. 


But the purpose of these fleet rules is not


simply to restrict the purchases by governmental entities. 


It is quite clear that the purpose of these fleet rules is


to regulate the purchasing choices that are made with


respect to a much broader scope of purchasing entities,


including private entities, and it is that portion of the


regulation, frankly, that we are challenging and


challenging on its face.


QUESTION: 


Mr. Carter, if these regulations had 

been adopted by the State of California rather than a


regional district as its 246, in -- in lieu of the Federal


plan, would that have been permissible?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Assuming, Justice Ginsburg, that


you -- that California took -- complied with all of the


requirements of section 246, and there are specific


requirements in order to get a -- in the -- in the State


action plan that -- State implementation plan that need to


be satisfied.  But to be sure, the Congress clearly


envisioned that for States with nonattainment problems,


that they would be able to use fleet restrictions as a

mechanism for promoting their overall emissions quality.


QUESTION:  So your objection is to this on a


regional basis.  Statewide you say is permissible provided


you follow -- I guess you need EPA approval?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, providing you comply with


the standards of section 246.


QUESTION:  But -- so -- but the substance of it


would be okay statewide.  So -- so --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I don't know if the precise


terms of this -- of these rules would qualify under


section 246 or not.  Nobody has actually analyzed that


point, but the truth is it's clear that you could have


certain fleet rules implemented that are consistent with


section 246. 


But realize, Justice Ginsburg, that what -- by


saying all our concern is is that every -- every one of


thousands of jurisdictions can impose purchase and sale


requirements on vehicles --


QUESTION:  Well, it's not sale requirements. 


It's a purchase requirement. 


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, under the respondents'


theory of this case which limits the term standards to


production mandates imposed on manufacturers, then it


seems to me that it clearly extends to all purchases and


sales and whether it extends to fleets, it wouldn't --

it's not limited to fleets at all.  Under the respondents'


theory of this case, the field that has been preempted


here really is limited to the manufacturers.  And to allow


every local jurisdiction to come in and bring forth


additional requirements is to make a hash out of a scheme


that was clearly designed to create a unitary market for


the manufacture, sale, purchase, and licensing of new


motor vehicles.


QUESTION:  Well, if -- if one local jurisdiction


affects other governmental jurisdictions, but the latter


don't care, then it's just as if, as the hypothetical just


posed, the State had the -- had -- had the rule. 


Is there sort of an ultra vires component to


your argument that this -- that this district here is 

affecting what other governmental entities can do and


that's the problem? 


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, this Court has long


recognized that you can't analyze a preemption case solely


on the basis of the single action by a single actor, that


in fact you have to consider the possibility that all 50


States or, in this case, every local jurisdiction could


follow suit.


And remember, it's not just follow suit with


respect to this kind of fleet rules under the respondents'


theory of this case, which is that all purchase and sale

restrictions --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I had not understood your


argument to be based on any conception that this


particular district would be treated differently than the


State as a whole, but I -- I -- am I wrong in that?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the State of California


would have certain prerogatives, obviously, under the


entire scheme that are different, but even if California


had simply done what the district did here, which is to


just announce a set of fleet rules, not made any effort to


comply with 246, not made any effort to comply with


section 209(b) --


QUESTION:  Well, what -- what does -- what does


246 provide?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Section 246 provides that in


certain nonattainment States, one of the options they have


available in order to eliminate the overall -- or to -- to


improve the overall ambient air quality is to adopt


certain types of fleet rules.  And the provision is very


lengthy.  It's very detailed about -- and you have to


include that in your State implementation plan. 


What California did was it used the substitute


route and adopted its LEV rules saying that those would be


equally effective.


QUESTION:  So it didn't comply in your view with

246.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, it clearly didn't comply.  I


don't think there's any question that California has made


no effort to satisfy the Clean Air Act with respect to


this.  But this Court --


QUESTION:  Your -- your argument, as I


understand it, going back to your answer to Justice


Ginsburg, is that although there is an avenue for the


State, as it were, to get where -- where it might want to


go on a -- on a fleet policy under 246, the district


simply does not have that avenue open to it.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, that's absolutely clear.


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. PHILLIPS: 


And that's -- and that's part of 

the way this entire scheme operates.


QUESTION:  But that gets me back to my question. 


If we disagree with you, to the extent we think some


application of the district's fleet rules are not


preempted, then how does that leave your challenge, which


is a facial one?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I -- I think the answer is


that there are various components of the fleet rules, and


I think unlike if you're -- if you're seeking pre-


enforcement of a statute, where you'd have to find every


application of it, the question is are there subcomponents

of these rules that are properly challengeable and


therefore properly enjoinable rather than being allowed to


go in.  I don't -- I don't understand --


QUESTION:  That eliminates the doctrine


entirely, I mean, the doctrine that facial challenge has


to show the statute is -- is invalid in all its


applications.  You could always say, well, we're not


challenging all of its applications.  We're -- we're just


challenging this particular set of applications.  I mean,


that -- that --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, no, Justice Scalia, I think


it's a little more complicated than that because what


you're really talking about is a -- is a host of rules. 


And if you look at the appendix to the respondents' brief 

with all of the rules that are laid out there, there are


literally dozens of rules.  And in order to challenge the,


quote, fleet rules in the sense of recognizing that there


are clearly areas of those rules that intrude into


preempted Federal activities, it doesn't seem to me that


you have to challenge the entirety of the rules.  You


should be entitled to pick those rules that you're going


after and a complaint and go forward.  And that's --


QUESTION:  But --


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- that's what we've done.  I


understand if you have a simple unitary statute that

you're challenging, the Salerno rule may suggest that the


statute has to be unconstitutional in all its respects,


but if you adopted a rule that if part A is good and part


B is not good, you should be allowed to -- to challenge


part B facially without worrying about part A.


QUESTION:  But I thought -- I thought this was


the case in -- in which part A applies both to the


district, as in Justice O'Connor's question, and to non-


governmental entities so that it's not that A applies to


-- to one kind of buyer and B to another.  There's a --


there's a rule that applies to buyers.  And Justice -- and


correct me if I'm wrong.  Justice O'Connor's question in


effect says, if there is a substantial -- if there is an


application of that rule that in a substantial number of 

cases at least would not be preempted, then isn't that the


end of the facial challenge? 


MR. PHILLIPS:  And my answer to you is I don't


think that's the proper application of Salerno and I don't


-- I mean, I recognize --


QUESTION:  I'm not applying Salerno.  I'm -- I'm


applying a substantial application rather than a one-


instance kind of rule.  And -- and your answer to that


was, well, we don't have to challenge all rules.  We could


challenge A but not B.  And my response is the rule that


covers the governmental situation and the private

situation is the same rule, and if that rule has a


substantial number of constitutional applications or -- or


non-preempted applications, doesn't that, in -- in effect,


defeat the facial challenge? 


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, except for the fact that if


-- if we don't get past the ruling of the court below at


this stage, which is that none of this is preempted, that


-- whether it's a facial challenge or a non-facial


challenge, we're going to have rules that are out there


that are being implemented at this stage and will be


upheld as constitutional under the Ninth Circuit's ruling


as the -- as the controlling rule of law, and we won't be


in a position even to get at any portion of those rules


that are clearly unconstitutional because they --

QUESTION:  You can, can you not -- I'm just


trying to draw this back because it seems to me you're not


challenging the public part.  So if you're not challenging


the public part, then -- I've looked at pages 7 and 8 of


the SG's brief where he's listed these rules.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 


QUESTION:  And I take it what you're challenging


is rule 1194 insofar as it applies to private operators.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Right. 


QUESTION:  Rule 1193, the same, and rule 1186.1,


the same, and nothing else.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I think that --


QUESTION:  In each of those rules, having looked


at them, it does say at the beginning, these apply to


public and private.  So I take it it's those two words,


and private, written in the text of those rules that


you're challenging. 


MR. PHILLIPS:  That -- that is our -- I mean,


our primary concern.  The -- the problem here is --


QUESTION:  Well, but that's what you're


challenging, nothing else.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Well, I mean, the


question is whether or not -- I mean, I'm not sure that is


precisely what we're challenging.  It seems to me there is


a difference between a public entity deciding on its 

own --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- that it will make a certain


purchasing decision as a purchasing decision.  There is a


fundamentally different proposition when another entity


demands that it must make a purchasing decision based on


emissions control.


QUESTION:  What do you mean?  Another public or


private?


MR. PHILLIPS:  A public entity.


QUESTION:  Oh.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  What I was saying is -- what --


what I meant to answer your question earlier, Justice


Breyer, was to say if you're asking me can public entities


make purchasing decisions free of the restrictions of the


Clean Air Act, I think the answer is yes because I don't


think Congress spoke to that.


But if what you're saying is can a -- can one


governmental entity demand that another governmental


entity make a decision for purely environmental reasons


and not as a -- as a contracting matter, no.  That seems


to me is still a standard --


QUESTION:  Well, now just let's think --


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- that controls emissions and is


unconstitutional. 


QUESTION:  -- of the complexity of State and


central government in light of what you just said.  You're


saying that the State of California board A couldn't say


all the -- I mean, I don't know where to go with this.  Do


you see -- do you see the problem? 


MR. PHILLIPS:  No, but the -- the problem is


much simpler than that, Justice Breyer, because there's a


scheme in place where if you don't like the way the


regulatory arrangements are worked out, you can take the


issue to California and California can take it to the EPA.


I mean, the whole purpose of this enterprise was

to devise a unitary market and make it very simple.  And


there's nothing in the -- in the suggestion that --


QUESTION:  -- the merits.  My problem is to try


to figure out what's being challenged. 


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, we're challenging the


effort by the district to impose these kinds of


requirements, these standards which control emissions.


QUESTION:  On its --


QUESTION:  But if California --


MR. PHILLIPS:  On everyone.


QUESTION:  -- if California accepts that as a


matter of its domestic law, who are we to say otherwise?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, because that's what the


Clean Air Act is all about.  California is free to do that


if it complies with section 209(b) which says you can


obtain a waiver.  You can make these the Federal


standards.  I mean, there's no question that these fleet


rules could have been adopted by the State of California


and be approved by the EPA and be operating completely


tomorrow if they want to go through that process.  That's


the specific process Congress had in mind, a process that


the district has abandoned.  And all we're suggesting is


that's what they ought to do.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Mr. Phillips, I don't want to


intrude into your time, but I -- I hope you have time to

comment on your adversary's argument that the word


standards just refers to numerical figures and so forth


and that you -- you have a -- it means the same thing when


the government is -- Federal Government is implementing


its own standards and it is in this provision.  Do you --


do you have a response to that basic argument? 


MR. PHILLIPS:  So there -- there are two answers


to that.  One, section 202 is not limited to production


mandates, those kinds of numerical standards, even -- even


within 202.  And second, the language that -- that


Congress used about standards relating to the control of


emissions is inherently broader than 202 in any event, and


if you expected 209 and 202 to be read in para materia,


you would have expected Congress to cross reference. 

QUESTION:  Because they were enacted at


different times, I think, the two sections.


MR. PHILLIPS:  They were enacted at different


times. 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  What about the distinction between


standard and requirement? 


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the use of requirement in


the second sentence is simply a recognition that there


could be standardless requirements imposed by States


requiring a certification or some other kind of

documentation that don't have standards.  So the first

with standardless obstacles to implementation.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MR. OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


The South Coast rules prohibit the purchase of


certain motor vehicles and require the purchase of others


based on explicit emission standards. 


Under respondents' 

reasoning, every other State and local government agency


in the United States could adopt its own individual and


unique blend of prohibited and permitted motor vehicles. 


But --


QUESTION:  General Olson, does -- does the


Government take the position that petitioner has just


taken, that these rules are invalid even insofar as they


apply to governmental subdivisions in California? 


MR. OLSON:  I think the answer is -- is no, but


let me explain, that to the extent that agencies of


government, the State or subdivisions, are purchasing

their own vehicles, we do not contend that that is


unconstitutional.  They can purchase --


QUESTION:  No, no.  I'm not talking about


whether their doing of it is unconstitutional.  Whether


the State's -- whether the State's prescribing that they


do it violates the statute.


MR. OLSON:  Our -- our position -- I don't --


I'm not sure I know the answer to that because I don't


know what authority this agency has with respect to


requiring different units of -- of the government of the


State of California to purchase or not purchase vehicles. 


And it hasn't -- it's not a subject that was briefed, if


at all, extensively in the briefs. 


But the -- the force -- the force of the


preemption provision here is that Congress determined that


there should be a uniform standard with respect to


controls on the emissions of motor vehicles.  California


was given an exception provided that certain requirements


were met.  This is in section 209(b) that these provisions


be submitted to the EPA and approved under a process


that's open and transparent and allows the national agency


to make sure that there are uniform standards that can be


met that also comply with the requirement that the


national economy not be disrupted, so that there would be


different -- by different standards in every little

community of the United States.  That's the thrust --


QUESTION:  Has it happened, General Olson?  One


pier that you raise is if -- that -- if this district can


have these fleet rules, so can every district in the


country, and these -- these rules have been in operation


now for some years.  Have other districts in other States


copied what this one has done?


MR. OLSON:  Not that I know of.  They've --


they've only been in existence since the year 2000.  The


-- the district was given the authority to adopt these


rules in 1987, if I'm correct, did not adopt them until


the year 2000. 


The arguments -- the principal arguments that


are made by respondents that standards are production 

mandates finds no basis in the statute.  The language of


section 202 or section 209 is not so limited.  The -- what


-- what section 202 and 209 do, talk about emission levels


or emission standards.


And there should be no mistake about it.  These


fleet rules are directly related to emission standards. 


One of them, for example, rule 1194, uses the phrase,


emission standards, 12 times and it requires all


purchasers to be vehicles that meet certain emission


standards, adopting by reference the State of California


CARB rules.  It picked out a subset, as the respondents

put it, of one in column A, two in column B, no diesel. 


There must be some clean fuel.  It's another -- it's a


totally different package.


And Palm Beach County or -- or Waco -- the City


of Waco could do something exactly like what the


respondents are contending because they say the controls


with respect to emissions don't apply if they're


purchasing requirements. 


EPA, in fact, enforces the standards that it


adopts under section 202 pursuant to the provisions of 203


by restricting the sale or introduction into commerce of


motor vehicles and under section 219, under certain


circumstances, the purchasers of fleets, bus fleets.  So


the implementation of the limitations that -- that -- the 

standards that EPA adopts are through purchase


restrictions or purchasing restrictions.  They're not


production mandates.  It's my understanding and I'm


informed that the EPA has never implemented the Clean Air


Act with respect to production mandates.  They say what


can be sold or what can be purchased.


QUESTION:  But -- but, Mr. Olson, why can't a


local agency or community decide it's going to buy


vehicles and will buy no diesel vehicles?  And why is that


the imposition of a standard?


MR. OLSON:  Well, it is not -- we -- we are not

contending, Justice O'Connor -- I want to make it very

district -- I -- the -- the --


QUESTION:  Well, does this district have the


authority to so provide for its own purchases?


MR. OLSON:  For its own purchases.  If it -- I


don't know whether it does or not.  This is a quality


control district.  I don't know how many vehicles they


have.


QUESTION:  Does it have authority to -- to make


that requirement for cities within its jurisdiction?


MR. OLSON:  We don't think that it has the


authority to require other governmental agencies based 

upon emission standards to do something. 


QUESTION:  Well, that's a matter of State law.


MR. OLSON:  That is a matter of State law, and


it's -- and -- and what we're talking about here is the


requirement by particular agencies to pick out different


types of motor vehicles that may or may not be sold.


QUESTION:  Well, I suppose the separate States


could do that for its own purchases.


MR. OLSON:  For their own -- for their own


purchases, Justice Kennedy.

 QUESTION:  -- they can't --


QUESTION:  And could they also do that for all


their governmental subdivisions?  The State of Nebraska


says that the State and all of its subdivisions will have


some very strict standards --


MR. OLSON:  I agree with the -- with the way


that the Chief Justice put it, that that's their own


purchasing decisions, and it's a matter of State law as to


whether they can -- but that is not what this case is


about. 


This case is about whether the South Coast


district can impose those standards, including Federal


Government vehicles, postal vehicles, FBI vehicles,


private vehicles that go to the airports and so forth. 

And the justification that they say is that we can control


the sale of motor vehicles willy-nilly by -- by


controlling the purchase.  By controlling the purchase,


you control what can be sold and thus can what be


manufactured.  They are claiming an authority in southern


California that they -- that they claim the EPA doesn't


even have.


QUESTION:  Maybe, but most of what it covers is


simply the -- the purchase by governmental units.  If you


acknowledge that the State can require its subdivisions to


-- to purchase only certain kinds of vehicles, as you've

just acknowledged, why can't the State create a district


as here and allow that district to require --


MR. OLSON:  Justice --


QUESTION:  -- subdivisions to purchase only --


MR. OLSON:  From the standpoint of the United


States Government, we're not contending that the State or


an individual can choose whatever vehicle he or she or it


wants to purchase.  What we're contending is that the


whole scheme of the EPA and the Clean Air Act and the --


and the preemption provisions prevent different agencies


by using the -- the mechanism.


The entire argument that respondents advanced


here, by using the word -- by -- by prescribing what can


be purchased, they can -- they can control what vehicles 

will exist and what vehicles will be run.  It isn't


limited.  The authority that they're claiming isn't


limited to their own vehicles.  This same authority --


they would make the same arguments if the South Coast


District said all persons or all persons that have more


than one vehicle or all persons that live in a certain


portion of southern California.  The authority that they


claim by using the word purchase, which is not in the


statute, is not in the preemption provision, and is an


authority that the -- the EPA specifically uses to a


certain extent under section 219 --

 QUESTION:  General Olson, you mentioned that


there are Federal vehicles involved, postal vehicles, but


you also are stressing purchase.  Suppose the Federal


Government buys its vehicles that it's going to operate in


California in Nevada.  These rules wouldn't apply.  So the


-- the United States is not inhibited in any way in its


purchases, is it?


MR. OLSON:  Well, A, I think that is an


inhibition.  B, I think the respondents will say that


these -- these purchasing requirements are imposed upon


fleet owners that -- that requires them to make purchases


of certain vehicles.  So I think the premise of your


question is not correct. 


If southern California or if the State of


California wishes to impose fleet requirements, there is a


mechanism.  It's a logical, consistent, transparent, open


mechanism under -- that was thoughtfully put out by


Congress.  The whole mechanism is thoughtfully calibrated


by Congress to allow the EPA to make judgments.  Does this


make sense from a national standpoint?  Will this make


sense from other States' standpoints?  Is it -- will it


impose a dislocation on the marketplace for motor


vehicles? 


The twin objectives of the Clean Air Act are,


one, to produce cleaner air, but two, to do it in a way

that does not disrupt the national economy and the


marketing of motor vehicles, which is an important part of


the economy of this Nation.


QUESTION:  Just so I have it clear, because it


-- this is very important to me.  It's your position that


the State may require municipalities only to buy certain


kinds of cars.


MR. OLSON:  To the extent that -- yes.  I'm --


because I don't know the answer to the State law question


that the Chief Justice alluded to.  Assuming that the


State of California was one and the same and decided that


it owned or had the authority under State law to purchase


those vehicles, the answer would be yes.


QUESTION: 


Thank you, General Olson. 

Mr. Waxman, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The question in this case is whether section


209(a) of the Clean Air Act, which is reproduced at page


36a of our brief, preempts very modest fleet purchase


rules which apply only to vehicles that are already


commercially available, that is, that cannot have an


effect on manufacture -- cannot require manufacturers to

produce or sell anything, and which were adopted by a


unique airshed in which 90 percent of all toxic air


pollution derives from motor vehicles. 


And the answer to that question is no because


the text and the context of the Clean Air Act, title II of


the Clean Air Act that deals with motor vehicles, show


that Congress intended the word standard in section 209 to


be used in the same way that it is used in section 202


and, indeed, throughout the entirety of title II -- title


II.  It's used 100 times, I'm told by an amicus, in


section 202 alone, and every single time that it is used


there, it is used to refer to an obligation placed on


manufacturers, that the vehicles they produce and sell


meet specified emissions characteristics.  No one contends


that that definition, the way the word is used in section


202, covers the rules in this case. 


Now, express preemption -- it requires


discerning Congress' intent.  It's not an exercise in


definitional possibilities, this Court has reminded us


many times.  Now, you can read every brief from our


opponents.  Every different brief offers up some other


definition, and their briefs in related cases have done


the same.  And we've heard no definition this morning. 


They look to the dictionary definition of standard or


criteria or test, and they're reproduced in their briefs.

But they -- they concede that there is no dictionary


definition that they offer that coincides with the rule


that they seek because they concede that Congress did not


intend to cover incentive programs or tax programs even


though, like purchase rules, they operate through the


market on manufacturers and not directly on manufacturers.


QUESTION:  Suppose that California passes a law


and says no one can sell a diesel bus in California.


MR. WAXMAN:  Well --

permission if you want a rule like that.  Right?


MR. WAXMAN:  A -- a rule that --


QUESTION:  The rule is exactly what I said:  no

MR. WAXMAN:  But, Justice Breyer, please let me


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. WAXMAN:  This is a very important point. 


The challenge here is that these rules are expressly

preempted -- it's in the question presented in the


petitioners' brief -- expressly preempted by the first


sentence of section 209(a), and it is expressly preempted


because these are standards.  And our submission is --


QUESTION:  I'm -- for purposes of my question,


I'm rejecting that argument.  I'm trying to figure out


what is the correct way of dealing with the statute.


MR. WAXMAN:  Yes, and --


QUESTION:  And where I was going, if you want to


see, I'll show you because then you -- it -- it seems to


me clearly you'd have to ask question -- nobody can sell a


diesel bus in California.  You have to get permission from


EPA. 


Second, they change it. 


No one can buy a diesel 

bus.  All right?  It's the same. 


Third, they say no governmental unit can buy a


diesel bus, but it turns out that the only buses anyone


has ever bought or sold in California are diesel units. 


And it's at that third point that's bothering me because


it seems to me whether it's preempted or not turns upon


the effects.  Have you, in effect, required the


manufacturer to change its assembly line or not?  And I


don't know where to go with that.  That's what I'm posing.


MR. WAXMAN:  Here is my -- here is my first


effort at an answer.  The word standard, as it is used in

202 and in the other provisions of title II that deal with


different types of standards, the standards with respect


to fuel, standards with respect to buses, standards --


standards in section 243 that deal with the Federal clean


fuel purchase program, are all obligations that are placed


directly on manufacturers.  The Congress and the EPA


recognized when section 246 was enacted, which is the


Federal fleet purchase program --


QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman, can I interrupt you just


a moment?  You say there are obligations that are placed


on the -- which is also true.  But the word standard as


used in the statute over and over again refers to things


that are express in terms of so many units per mile and so


many -- so forth and so on. 


The term standard, it seems 

to me, refers to the -- the numerical definitions rather


than to how they're enforced or implied. 


MR. WAXMAN:  Well --


QUESTION:  I think it may well be they're -- and


-- and we don't have to worry about the enforced or


implied in the terms that a statute because all it has to


be that -- the only prohibition is against anything


relating to a standard.


MR. WAXMAN:  No, it's --

numerical term -- I don't find in the text of the -- of

any part of the statute here your -- your point about


enforcement against.  That's -- that's what -- what is


done with the standard.  It's not what the standard itself


is. 


MR. WAXMAN:  Justice --


QUESTION:  I have the same problem, if I could


second it.  It seems to me the fact that you use standard


99 times in discussing manufacturing standards doesn't


mean that when you use it a 100th time to refer to some


other aspect of the whole thing, it must refer to


manufacturing.  It just doesn't follow. 


MR. WAXMAN:  I'll try -- I'll be efficient and


try and answer two questions at once then. 


First of all, 209 doesn't refer -- doesn't 

prohibit anything relating to a standard.  It prohibits


standards relating to motor vehicle emissions just as


section 202 in the very first sentence authorizes the


Federal Government to promulgate standards applicable to


the emission of motor vehicles. 


Now, standards, as the word is used in 202 and


throughout title II, refers to emission characteristics or


the obligation of manufacturers to sell and produce cars. 


If you look at section 202(g) or 202(h) and 202(i), for


example, those are instances of subsections where it is


used not just to refer to the emissions characteristics

themselves, but also the obligation on manufacturers and


sellers. 


And in fact, if you look at section 203 of the


act, which is called Prohibited Acts -- it's the


enforcement provisions -- it is directed at manufacturers


and sellers. 


QUESTION:  I agree with you completely that the


statute imposes these obligations on the manufacturers to


comply with the standards.  But the word standard is -- is


a different concept from the obligation to comply with the


standard.


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I think the -- the word


standard -- I'll -- I'll say this one more time and then


retreat to another -- another argument.  The word


standard, as it is used, for example, in 202(g), is used


both to refer to the emissions characteristics, numerical


or otherwise, and an obligation placed on manufacturers


and sellers to do something about that. 


And the -- let me -- let me give you my second


line of argument here --


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Now you say it's not just


manufacturers.  It's manufacturers and sellers.  I thought


it was just manufacturers. 


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, there are provisions in


section 203, which is the Prohibited Acts, that it -- it

is imposed on the people who make cars and requires them


or limits them in what those people can make.


QUESTION:  I mean, it -- it's hard enough to say


that the word standards on its own is automatically


limited to manufacturers, but it's doubly hard to say it


is limited not to just to manufacturers, but to


manufacturers and sellers, but not to manufacturers,


sellers, and purchasers.


MR. WAXMAN:  It -- it is -- Justice Scalia,


there is a provision in section 203 of the act, the


Prohibited Acts, that deals with the instance in which a


manufacturer, for example, produces cars overseas and then


tries to sell noncompliant cars through a distributor or


some other entity. 
 Those people are covered. 

But when Congress considered in 1990 its own


fleet purchase rules, we're talking here about very


limited fleet purchase rules that -- talking about my


rules -- have a commercial availability exception.  They


do not -- they cannot be read to require manufacturers to


make anything they don't make or sellers to sell anything


they don't sell.


QUESTION:  Yes, but as soon as there's -- as


soon as there's one commercial vehicle available, that's


going to have effect on the manufacturing. 


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, there may be -- the -- the

vehicle has to be -- the rules make quite clear that the


vehicles have to be available and able to be used by that


user in the locality, the fuel --


QUESTION:  And you -- and you have to get --


apply for an exemption which the petitioner says is very


difficult to get.


MR. WAXMAN:  There -- the petitioner does not


say it's very difficult to get, and that footnote 7 on


page 8 of their brief is truly the 13th chime of the clock


in their argument.  The -- if we had to establish a


factual record in this case -- and there is none -- I am


told by my client that these exemptions are sought for


some of these rules never because the vehicles are -- are


readily available, for example, with respect to street 

sweepers, and on other vehicles, they are readily given. 


If somebody --


QUESTION:  What's -- what's that 13th chime?  I


lost you.  I thought you said --


(Laughter.) 


MR. WAXMAN:  The 13th chime of the clock is --


QUESTION:  Yes, I know.  I know what it is. 


Where is it?  At page --


MR. WAXMAN:  It's on page 8, footnote 7 of their


reply brief.


QUESTION:  The reply, all right.

 MR. WAXMAN:  They say that, oh, well, about


commercial availability, it's just not true.  The district


that promulgated these rules said it only applies when


it's commercially available.  The State that enacted a


provision that authorized these rules has filed a brief in


this case saying it applies only when it's commercially


available.  No one in this case or any other case has ever


argued that that commercial availability exemption doesn't


exist until footnote 7 of their reply brief, and it is


simply wrong.


But my point generally about the -- the meaning


of the word standard in the Federal act, title II, is in


1990 Congress enacted its own fleet purchasing rules, and


they are codified in --


QUESTION:  When you say its own, you mean fleets


that were going to serve Congress? 


MR. WAXMAN:  No, no.  Congress put into --


amended the Clean Air Act to require certain States that


have nonattainment areas to include within their State


implementation plans either a fleet -- a set of fleet


purchase rules or some alternative that they would propose


that would be equally efficacious in cleaning the air.


QUESTION:  Just to be clear on your position, do


you think that California as a State could enact a law


saying that no purchaser of a motor vehicle in California

can purchase a gasoline-powered vehicle?


MR. WAXMAN:  I --


QUESTION:  Is that -- is that preempted or not?


MR. WAXMAN:  It is not expressly preempted by


section 209(a).  It would be subject to conflict


preemption principles, as this Court went through in Geier


v. American Honda, if it could be shown that --


QUESTION:  Well, by any theory.  Is that


preempted or not in your view?


MR. WAXMAN:  I think -- I think it may well be


preempted by -- under conflict preemption principles, not


express preemption, if it could be shown that this is


really a sales or production -- this is really an


obligation that is masquerading as a purchase requirement. 

That would be the analysis --


QUESTION:  Nobody can buy a gasoline-powered


vehicle in California would require the manufacturers


totally to dramatically change the kinds of vehicles they


produce.


MR. WAXMAN:  To be sure --


QUESTION:  So why wouldn't it fall right within


the word standard relating to the control of emissions for


motor vehicles?


MR. WAXMAN:  Because standards, as I said --


QUESTION:  That isn't a standard?  What it says

is --


MR. WAXMAN:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  It's not a standard?


MR. WAXMAN:  That is correct. 


QUESTION:  Because? 


MR. WAXMAN:  A standard is -- is a requirement


that is imposed on manufacturers and that distinction is


drawn throughout title II --


QUESTION:  Well, it is a -- what -- what do you


do with 209(b) which says -- it -- it authorizes EPA to


waive application of 209(a) in the case of, quote, any


State which has adopted standards, other than crank case


emission standards, for the control of emissions from new


motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines? 

Now, most of the States do not have automobile


manufacturers located within the States.  How could they


possibly impose a requirement on automobile manufacturers? 


It is obviously referring to State standards that deal


with the operators of -- of cars -- you have to go in and


-- and have your -- your emissions checked -- or the -- or


the purchases of cars. 


MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Scalia, it's -- I actually


think that 209(b) is important proof for our premise that


section 209(a), the word standard, has to be read -- it


has to be read to be used in the same way as section 202.

 And clearly the way that -- when I -- when we


talk about production mandates, I -- it's -- it's actually


the Congress in section 249(h) used the word production or


sales mandates.  The EPA in its rules and in its letter


that was submitted under a primary jurisdiction referral


to the First Circuit talks about production requirements.


It's shorthand.


But I readily agree that when 209(b) or 209(a)


or 202 apply -- when I'm talking about production


mandates, I'm talking about an obligation that's placed on


the manufacturers about what they produce and can sell. 


It's one and the same.  There was a presumption that they


would try and sell what they produced and they would


produce the things that they want to sell. 


The point is that in -- when Congress enacted


the Federal fleet purchase program, it drew a -- the same


distinction that is shot through title II between


standards, which has a very limited meaning, and


requirements.  It's a distinction that exists in section


116 of the act, which is on page 3a of our appendix, that


preserves State authorities.  And what Congress said and


what the EPA said and what Senator Levin, who was very


ably representing the interests of Detroit in 1990, said


is these fleet purchase rules, because they are directed


at purchasers may very well have a tremendous impact on

manufacturers.  They may cause a race to the top.  But


they are different than production standards, production


mandates, or requirements placed directly on


manufacturers.


QUESTION:  I -- I don't understand your response


to my question.  My question is -- you just said again,


that standards always refer to manufacturing standards. 


But in 209(b), they clearly do not refer to manufacturing


standards.  Any State which has adopted standards for the


control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor


vehicle engines.  Those standards are -- are just not


applied to the manufacturer.  Most States don't have


manufacturers that they can control.


MR. WAXMAN:  Justice --


QUESTION:  Those standards are imposed at the


purchase -- or at the operations stage.


MR. WAXMAN:  They are imposed on the people who


make the cars when they sell them.  That's because,


Justice Scalia--


QUESTION:  Why don't you just say they are


imposed upon the sellers?  And that's the way they get


imposed upon the manufacturers. 


MR. WAXMAN:  I -- I wish that I could have said


it that concisely, but that's the point that I'm making.


QUESTION:  They're not imposed upon the users?

 MR. WAXMAN:  They are --


QUESTION:  Virginia cannot impose them upon the


users of cars in Virginia? 


MR. WAXMAN:  My submission to the Court, Your


Honor, is that standards, as the term is used throughout


title II, refers to the supply side of motor vehicles, the


people who make them and the people who sell them, and


that when Congress wanted to make a rule that dealt with


purchasers, which applies only indirectly against


manufacturers, it used the word requirement.  And that's


because --


QUESTION:  So that this provision in 209(b) does


not authorize a State to conduct emissions tests of old


vehicles that have already been sold. 


It has nothing to 

do with manufacturers, nothing to do with sellers at this


point.  It has to do with whether the user is keeping the


emissions system in -- in proper operation.  You say that


is not covered by 209(b) because 209(b) does -- does not


say requirements.  It says standards. 


QUESTION:  No.  It's not --


MR. WAXMAN:  Both 209(a) --


QUESTION:  -- covered by 209(b) because 209(b)


is a limitation on (a) and (a) only talks about new


vehicles.  So you could get around this whole thing if


California adopted a rule that said any vehicle 6 years --

6 months old has to meet certain standards.  The whole


statute wouldn't apply. 


MR. WAXMAN:  Look, section -- subsection (d) of


209 applies to vehicles that are not new.  209(a) and


209(b) apply to new vehicles.  What -- 209(b) is the


presumptive waiver for California alone of the preemption


provision in 209(a).


I -- I don't want to be pedantic, but let's --


we -- we started talking about 1965 and 1967, and I think


it's tremendously revealing, in terms of the purposes,


what Congress intended by standard in 209, to understand


that in 1963 Congress enacted the first version of the


Clean Air Act.  And it basically didn't authorize the


Federal Government to do anything other than help States 

do their part in cleaning up the air. 


That didn't work very well, and in 1965 Congress


enacted the provision that is now 202 that says we are


going to take from the realm of a traditional State


authority this much for the Federal Government.  They can


and will set standards applicable to motor vehicle


emissions. 


Now, for the intervening 2 years, the


manufacturers came to Congress and said this doesn't make


things better, it makes things worse because there are a


number of States that are promulgating their own mandates

on how we build engines and what kind of equipment we


have.


And in footnote 7 of our brief, we cite a report


by HEW that categorizes what each State was doing.  It's a


1976 report.  And what they were doing was not putting


requirements on purchasers.  They were saying to


manufacturers, if you want to sell a car in our State,


it's got to have a whiz-bang or a doodad, or it has to


meet the following characteristics.  And the manufacturers


said, we can only engineer and manufacture to one


standard.


So in 1967, Congress responded to that by


enacting what is now section 209, and it compromised.  It


said, well, we're not going to make you manufacture and 

engineer only to one standard.  We're going to make an


exception for California, which was there before the


Federal Government was there. 


But other than California, which is subsection


(b), no State can do what it is that the EPA is doing in


section 202.  And there are a number of rules of statutory


interpretation, leaving aside the presumption against


preemption in this area of historic police -- State police


power, that require you to read for an express preemption


point, not a general, broad conflict preemption argument


that is not advanced here, that the word standard is to be

read as narrowly as reasonable to preserve as much for the


States as possible.


QUESTION:  Is --


MR. WAXMAN:  And it has to be -- it's only


coherent if it means that the States are precluded from


doing what EPA was mandated to do, which is to tell


manufacturers, if you've got a vehicle over 6,000 pounds,


it can't emit more than X, Y, and Z grams per mile. 


What the manufacturers cared about was that they


not have to make what is -- was subsequently called a


third car.  They didn't want to have to build different


cars and engines for different parts of the country.  And


that's why a rule that is directed only at purchasers and


has built within it an exception for anything that is not 

commercially available or can't be used for the purpose


that the user wants to use it for is not a standard.


QUESTION:  All right.  Maybe that's --


MR. WAXMAN:  It's a difficult question that --


QUESTION:  -- Justice Breyer. 


MR. WAXMAN:  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  I want you to finish what you're


doing, but I want at some point to get back to this


effectiveness -- the effect thing.  I don't want to cut


you off.

MR. WAXMAN:  I'm here to answer questions, and I


apologize. 


QUESTION:  Do it in the order you want and you


can just that I've just been off base, and I'll put out


the three propositions that -- that I'm thinking.  Now,


you'll see it in a second.


I'm thinking, one, this case isn't a big deal


because all California has to do is go ask EPA and EPA is


almost bound to approve whatever they want.


Two, that you can't do it on language, that you


have to figure out the purpose.  The purpose is to stop


the manufacturers from having to make different cars, and 

therefore, why don't you, in these circumstances, look to


the effect?  And -- and if in fact the effect is that


they're going to have to make some different cars, it's no


good. 


But all the examples you give in your brief, all


those things are fine.  They don't -- they don't involve


this and -- and they're not commands.  You have to go the


command and have an effect.  This is a command.  And I


don't think it does have an effect, nor do you, but they


think it might.


MR. WAXMAN:  I think it's --

you're way off base, and I want to know why I'm way off

base. 


MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Breyer, you are not way off


(Laughter.) 


MR. WAXMAN:  You're slightly off base, but not


way off.

QUESTION:  There, there, Justice Breyer. 


MR. WAXMAN: 


You've raised -- you've raised 

three points, and I'll try and address them in turn. 


They're -- the -- they're -- what they're saying


is, look, there's no big deal because -- because this


airshed, one of 33 in California, could take the concerns


of its citizens -- even though it's mandated by the State


to promulgate these rules, it could go to the bureaucracy


in Sacramento and try and get that bureaucracy to include


in its list of what it sends to the centralized command


and control bureaucracy in Washington permission to enact


rules that scientific studies show cause 9,000 premature


deaths in the district a year.  Now, it's true, but it

would not avail, that is, particulate emissions from motor


-- toxic emissions from motor vehicles and diesel


vehicles.


Now, what about Houston?  Houston -- right now


the South Coast is the only extreme nonattainment zone in


the country, but Houston has been knocking at the door for


several years.  The -- the waiver provision that they're


referring to in 209(b) would not avail Houston.  It


wouldn't avail Phoenix which has its own unique airshed


problems with particulate emissions.


And therefore, our submission is if it's a


standard, yes.  If you say this is a standard, we will go


to the State of California and say please sponsor this


rule and please ask the EPA to give permission for us to 

be able to impose these fleet purchasing rules.


QUESTION:  The district could not apply directly


to EPA.  It would have to go through Sacramento?


MR. WAXMAN:  I believe so.  There is a provision


in the California Health and Safety Code that says that


the California Air Resources Board is the relevant State


agency for purposes of 209(b).


But more generally, if the -- the point here is


do you determine what Congress' purpose is by the effect. 


That's fine.


QUESTION:  It's not determined what Congress'

purpose is by the effect.  You have things that you're


talking about, standards telling the -- the manufacturers


what to do, and then you have close-to things, things not


quite that, but close to that, selling, purchasing.  So


there, where it's a command in this slightly different


form, we look to see whether it really has the effect that


the statute is aimed at preventing.  And if so, go to the


EPA and ask them.  If not, don't. 


MR. WAXMAN:  No.  If -- if it is a command to


manufacturers with respect to emissions characteristics of


the vehicles they make, it is a standard, as that term is


used throughout title II.  If it is directed at purchasers


and, as Senator Levin and the EPA explained in 1990, only


affect manufacturers and sellers through the marketplace, 

even though it may have a substantial effect, it is no


different than the many incentives and differential tax


programs that they say aren't covered.


Look, California --


QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman, I think -- maybe I'm


wrong, but I think the effect that Justice Breyer is


thinking about is the effect of -- of being forced to


manufacture the third car.


MR. WAXMAN:  Yes, indeed. 


QUESTION:  Yes.

 QUESTION:  And -- and I thought your answer to


that was because you don't have to buy anything that is


not commercially available, that nixes the third car


effect argument, and therefore there isn't preemption.


MR. WAXMAN:  That is absolutely correct.


QUESTION:  No, but that's completely wrong in


principle for the reason that the rules don't talk about


commercial availability but in averages. 


MR. WAXMAN:  No. 


QUESTION:  So, in fact, if they're only supposed


to make three ZEV's -- see, they're only supposed to make


three ZEV's.  ZEV is commercially available.  But you


could have a rule say buy only ZEV's and that would be a


major change in the EPA rule.


MR. WAXMAN:  With respect, Justice Breyer --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. WAXMAN:  Here you are completely off base. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. WAXMAN:  The rules each -- I'm not talking


about CARB's statewide standards, but the rules challenged


here have an exception for anytime somebody can show that


the vehicle they want is either not commercially available


or can't be used.


Look at page 50a of the joint appendix.  The


rules are all in the joint appendix.  That happens to be

the rule that deals with the one that my book opened up


to.  It's buses.  And it says on page 50 of the joint


appendix that this -- an exception -- an exemption to


these fleet purchase rules where no alternative-fuel


engine and chassis configuration is available commercially


or could be used. 


And so this is the situation that -- our


submission is that these things can't possibly have --


impose a mandate on manufacturers.  And in fact, look --


we -- we discuss in our brief a little bit that California


has a program where it provides, I think, a 75 or 90


percent rebate to school districts if they buy buses that


are fueled by alternative-fuel vehicles.  Now, is that


going to have an effect on the kinds of buses that school 

districts buy?  Of course.  And is it going to have a big


effect on manufacturers?  Sure.


And therefore, when we're talking about


something that is mandatory, as opposed to something that


is voluntary, they -- on page 7 of their reply brief, they


make a distinction between voluntary standards and


mandatory standards.  From the relevant perspective, that


is the perspective of the manufacturer, they are the same,


as Senator Levin and the EPA explained.  They operate on


the manufacturers through the market.


Now, to be sure, there -- you can come up and I

think Justice O'Connor came up with the extreme example of


no one in our State can buy a diesel vehicle.  And what


I'm saying is that one could argue and one might make a


very good argument that if it is a mandate that's imposed


on manufacturers or sellers that is masquerading as a


purchase rule, where it really has that effect, you may


find that substance will prevail over form, or you may


find -- I think it would be more appropriate -- that this


simply conflicts with the fundamental objective of the


Clean Air Act under the Hines v. Davidovitz test.


But that's not the challenge that was brought


here, and that's --


QUESTION:  It would be conflict preemption, not


express preemption.


MR. WAXMAN:  Conflict preemption and not express


preemption.  And that will -- that analysis and that mode


of analysis will allow the courts to deal with this parade


of horribles that has never come true and may never come


true if the political branches don't.


But if you look at the history of what was going


on in 1965 or 1967 -- this is Congress' purpose -- no one


was talking about -- no manufacturers were concerned about


purchase rules.  They were concerned about having to


engineer and manufacture a third vehicle.


QUESTION:  But if you need -- if you need

conflict preemption to answer such a basic hypothetical as


that put by Justice O'Connor, the statute doesn't mean


very much.


MR. WAXMAN:  Oh, I think -- no, no, no.  With --


with respect, this -- this statute shut down cold, Justice


Kennedy, precisely what was going on in 1967.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Waxman.


MR. WAXMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, you have 2 minutes


remaining. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


Let me start with Justice O'Connor's


hypothetical.  We are told in language that I think a 6-


year-old would have a hard time understanding that a flat


ban on all gasoline-fueled engines in the State of


California is not a standard relating to the control of


emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle


engines. 


Justice Kennedy is absolutely right.  It has


rendered the scope of preemption.  There is no field of


preemption.  There is not even a divot of dirt of


preemption that is created under that interpretation. 


It's not consistent with the language of the word

standard.  Standard means more than what manufacturers do. 


It's not simply how it gets enforced.  It's broader, and


Justice Stevens is clearly correct in that regard.


The one provision that seems to have gotten lost


in the -- in all of this, which I think is terribly


important, is section 177 which states that State -- and


this is at the -- the respondents' brief's appendix at 4a


-- 4a.  The States are not authorized to prohibit or limit


directly or indirectly the manufacture or sale of a new


motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine that is certified in


California. 


That is precisely what is being done here, is


that vehicles that are certified in California are


prohibited by a subagency. 


The State can't even do this, 

which is why I submit the answer to your question, Justice


Scalia, is the State wouldn't have the authority to place


the kind of restriction on its own subentities without


running afoul of section 177.  And the only way California


could get approval for that would be to go to the EPA in


the way that Justice Breyer has already described.


QUESTION:  Mr. Carter, Mr. Waxman said in his


brief that the position he's taking is the position that


EPA takes, and EPA is not with us this morning.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, I believe EPA is very much


with us this morning because the Solicitor General speaks


54 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005

for the United States, and EPA is clearly a part of the


United States Government.  And -- and the EPA has made it


absolutely clear, Justice Ginsburg --


QUESTION:  So you -- you say that's just wrong


when --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, absolutely that's just wrong. 


There is no -- there is no way -- I have seen nothing to


justify departing from what the Government's brief says.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Phillips.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:13 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
