CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 00-1737, The Watchtower Bible and Tract


Society of New York, v. The Village of Stratton, Ohio.


Mr. Polidoro.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. POLIDORO


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. POLIDORO:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it


please the Court:


It's 11:00 Saturday morning in the Village of


Stratton.  Good morning.  In light of recent events, I've


made a special effort to come to your door to speak to you


about what the Prophet Isaiah has referred to as something


better.  That's the good news Christ Jesus spoke about,


the good news of the Kingdom of God.


It is a criminal act to go from door to door in


the Village of Stratton and deliver that message unless


one has first obtained a permit from the village to do so. 


It is also illegal to go from door to door and hand out a


leaflet that says, democracy is wonderful, please vote


next week.


In drafting a permit scheme designed to address


fraud and privacy that includes those interested in pure


discourse, Stratton has eliminated the ability to engage

in door-to-door, one-on-one political advocacy.  As such,


we submit the ordinance is overbroad and unconstitutional.


QUESTION:  I don't see how it has eliminated any


chance of a political -- going door to door in a political


discourse if you register with the mayor and you can't be


turned down if you fill out that form.  You can go door to


door, except where there's a no-trespassing sign.


MR. POLIDORO:  Your Honor, we are not suggesting


at all that a resident cannot post a no-trespassing sign


and keep all away from their door.  However, in order to


get the right to go to that door, one must go to the


mayor, give his name, give a brief description of the


cause they want to speak about, as well as their


association or affiliation.


We believe that this Court in McIntyre said


there's an interest in having anonymous works enter the


marketplace of ideas, and that unquestionably outweighs


any interest in requiring disclosure as a precondition to


entry.


QUESTION:  Well, do you focus on the right of


anonymity, or the right of unrestricted speech, as of the


time you get to the door, or when you go to the mayor's


office, because our most recent cases talk about going to


the door, and that's where your brief focuses on.


It seems to me that what you've begun with, and

it's also troubling to me, is that you have to make the


disclosure to the mayor as well, so I take it those are


two different parts of your case.


MR. POLIDORO:  Correct, Justice Kennedy.


QUESTION:  But you emphasize only the latter,


really, in your briefs.  Are the records that the mayor


keeps, are they open to the public?


MR. POLIDORO:  They are, absolutely, indeed,


Your Honor.  Under Ohio State law those records are open


to the public, so anyone would be able to go to look at


the record, which would include the name, your message,


and your associations.


QUESTION:  So you would have no objection to


this statute if you didn't have to give your name?


MR. POLIDORO:  Your Honor, we --


QUESTION:  It's perfectly okay to say, you can't


talk to anybody without getting a permit, so long as you


don't have to give your name when you get the permit?


MR. POLIDORO:  Your Honor, we believe the name


is the constitutional infirmity in deed.


QUESTION:  That's the only problem, so if this


were revised somehow so that all you had to give was a


reference, maybe somebody in the community who would vouch


for the integrity of these Jehovah's Witnesses, that would


then be okay, because they wouldn't have to --

 MR. POLIDORO:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  The only problem is if they have to


give their name.  You see, I would have thought you would


have objected to the necessity of going to the mayor and


saying, please, Mr. Mayor, can I talk to your citizens


going house-to-house, but that's not your problem.  Your


only problem is that you have to disclose your identity.


MR. POLIDORO:  No, Your Honor.  We do not


believe that anyone needs to go to the Government for


permission to speak to their neighbor about any message,


most importantly, a message --


QUESTION:  I think that's the strongest part of


your case.


MR. POLIDORO:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  But you call them neighbors, but I


take it in many cases they're simply strangers who come


into town.


MR. POLIDORO:  Well, actually, Your Honor, in


this circumstance the Village of Wellsville, which is a


neighboring village, has assumed responsibility for


preaching door to door in the Village of Stratton, and


many individuals are, in fact, known to each other, and


that's common in most areas of this country.  We don't


believe that one is required to go to the Government to


get permission to speak to a private resident owner when

the power belongs to that private resident owner to keep


all away from their door if that owner so chooses.


QUESTION:  Can you tell me why that is?  I agree


that at some level it seems contrary to our traditions,


but if we can focus just on going to the mayor's office,


it seems to me that one of the strongest parts of your


case is that you have to identify your cause.  That seems


problematic to me.  Is that part of your case, and if so,


what is the root constitutional principle that's violated


there?


MR. POLIDORO:  Your Honor, Jehovah's Witnesses


have a long historical memory as to what they've suffered


at the hands of municipalities --


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. POLIDORO:  -- purely to go door to door to


speak the good news.  In this instance, the village is


compelling disclosure of name, cause, and associational


information.


QUESTION:  What's wrong with identifying the


cause?


MR. POLIDORO:  Your Honor, we believe that under


this Court's holding there are some individuals who do not


want to identify their cause.  It opens them up, as


McIntyre said, to official retaliation, to economic


retaliation, to social ostracism, and perhaps, as McIntyre

said, they just don't want to disclose more of their


privacy than they have to.


We don't believe that on this record the village


has shown a necessity to so incumber pure discourse that


is not the source of harm.  There's no allegation in this


case that pure religious speech, or pure political speech,


cause the harm that the village seeks to protect its


residents against.


QUESTION:  But I take it your argument only goes


to the political speech, because as I understand it,


Jehovah's Witnesses do not object to identifying


themselves, and your concern is with the overbreadth that


goes into the political sphere, is that correct?


MR. POLIDORO:  That is absolutely correct,


Justice Souter.  Jehovah's Witnesses will, indeed,


identify themselves at the door, but it's their personal


decision to do so.


QUESTION:  And yet the question that you phrase


says that this permit, which contains one's name, now,


when we turn to the village's brief, they say, no, it


doesn't.  The permit doesn't require any names.  You have


to have your name at the mayor's office, the mayor has to


accept all-comers, as long as you're not fraudulent. 


There's no discretion that is what infected the old


prohibitions against the Jehovah Witnesses' speech, so

here anybody can go door to door.  The name is at the


mayor's office.  The name doesn't have to be disclosed to


the homeowner.


Now, you said in your brief the name has to be


disclosed to the homeowner.  They say in their brief, no,


it doesn't, so which one is right?


MR. POLIDORO:  Justice Ginsburg, if I might, at


the joint appendix on page 248a there's a copy of the


blank permit and it says, permit to canvass, to solicit,


et cetera, and it says, in accordance with the relevant


provision of the statute, the mayor of the Village of


Stratton, Ohio, has issued to the above applicant a


permit, the above applicant a permit, so we believe on the


plain language of the permit, the name is, indeed,


disclosed.


QUESTION:  Did you ever apply for a permit?


MR. POLIDORO:  We never did, Chief Justice 


Rehnquist.


QUESTION:  So you don't know, as a matter of


practical fact, how that would work out?


MR. POLIDORO:  That's correct, with respect to


Jehovah's Witnesses.


QUESTION:  It might be a number, applicant


number 5.


MR. POLIDORO:  There's no showing, Justice

Souter, in the ordinance that there's any sort of


numbering scheme.


QUESTION:  Well, no, there's no -- that's the


trouble, I think, with the argument.  There is no showing,


but I suppose the exhibit is consistent with a numbering


as well as a naming system on the permit card.


MR. POLIDORO:  But Justice Souter, I believe the


exhibit would be inconsistent with the concession of the


village that name disclosure is, in fact, required at the


door.  At page 27 of their brief, and page 29 to 30 of


their brief, they do say that name identity is compelled


to be disclosed by a resident or by a police officer in


further of his official business.


QUESTION:  They said about five times in their


brief that the permit that must be shown to the police


officer or the homeowner does not have a name on it --


does not have a name on it.  Now, it's very confusing, but


this -- I looked at this and said, well, maybe this is the


bottom -- you have the application, then, you know, you


tear off the bottom, and this is the bottom, and the


applicant is above, but the permit that you put in your


pocket doesn't have that name.


If that's the case, then why isn't this case


just like the Buckley case, where this Court said, the


badge doesn't have to have the name on it, but we

recognize that the Colorado law also says that with every


set of petitions the circulator has to have an affidavit,


and that affidavit is filed with the petition, so there is


an official record of the name and the address of the


circulator.  Why isn't this just the same thing?


MR. POLIDORO:  It's different for two reasons,


Justice Ginsburg.  First, Buckley dealt with the mechanics


of the electoral process, and clearly that's a compelling


governmental interest to ensure there's no corruption in


that process.  The circulator in Buckley wanted to make


herself part of that process.  The rules of that game are


that you submit your name when you submit the affidavits. 


We have something different here indeed.  We have just


pure speech unrelated to the mechanics of the electoral


process.  The interesting --


QUESTION:  I thought you were saying it only


applied to those who were engaged in the political -- I


thought that was the point of your overbreadth objection.


MR. POLIDORO:  I think there's a distinction,


Justice Souter, to just pure speech, the dissemination of


information and ideas, and speech that in some way


involves the mechanics of the electoral process.  You're


going to do something with the information that you obtain


from that householder, and then submit yourself to an


area, an arena that the Government has a right to have

some play in.  We don't submit that the Government does


have a right in one-on-one intimate conversation about


religion or politics, to have a play there.


QUESTION:  But one of your examples was that


door to door solicitation of signatures for an initiative


to put on the ballot, and that's exactly what was involved


in the Buckley case.


MR. POLIDORO:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but that


disclosure took place after the one-on-one dissemination


of information was done.  If that individual did not want


to submit those affidavits, she could have maintained her


anonymity.  The question is, when can the Government


compel you --


QUESTION:  She could not have been a circulator,


then, because a condition of being a circulator -- she


could not have submitted her petition, because to submit 


her petition she has to have this affidavit, and I don't


see -- I really can't see any difference in consequence


whether the official form is made before or made after. 


The point is that the name and address is in an official


record.


MR. POLIDORO:  Because of the compelling


governmental interest that's involved, Justice Ginsburg,


and that's the distinction.  When we have one-on-one --


QUESTION:  That doesn't handle your example.  I

mean, why don't you just say it was a bad example?  You


shouldn't have used the example.  It's not worth your


time.  You shouldn't have used the example of a petitioner


circulator.  You are concerned about people who just want


to come up and say, I want to talk to you about why you


should vote for Smith.


MR. POLIDORO:  That's correct, Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  Is that the case?


MR. POLIDORO:  It is, indeed, the case.


QUESTION:  Is it the case that your clients


don't ask for any money, not a penny, and they don't sell


Bibles, and they're not selling anything, all that they do


is say, I want to talk to you about religion?  They don't


ask for any --


MR. POLIDORO:  Your Honor, the record is


absolutely clear, in the Village of Stratton, Jehovah's


Witnesses did not ask for money.  In other jurisdictions


the record is equally clear that sometimes they will


mention a voluntary donation arrangement.  However, to


make our interest absolutely clear, what we're involved


with in Stratton, we did not mention the voluntary


donation arrangement.  We are not seeking a solicitation


of funds.  We're merely seeking to talk to people about


the Bible.


Now, Justice Ginsburg --

 QUESTION:  Don't you hand out the Watchtower,


too?


MR. POLIDORO:  We do, Your Honor, on a no-cost


basis if someone's interested in reading it.  We would


send that out.


QUESTION:  So you said just -- you briefly


mentioned -- because you know, I've had many fine


conversations with Jehovah's Witnesses.  It's fine.  But


I've never noticed any of them objecting to anything about


giving their name.  I mean, is this a real issue here,


that for some reason this particular group objects to


giving their name?  What's the situation?


MR. POLIDORO:  No, Your Honor, Jehovah's


Witnesses have no objection to giving their name.  The


objection to giving their name comes in the realm of


anonymous political discourse.  Jehovah's Witnesses have


felt that this ordinance, which is designed to regulate


business transactions, need not have reached pure


religious speech, need not have reached pure political


speech.


QUESTION:  But you would say that without


reference to the name.  Isn't your position that you don't


have to go to the mayor and ask for permission to talk to


a neighbor about something that's interesting?


MR. POLIDORO:  That's correct, Your Honor.

That's quite correct.


QUESTION:  Is that here in front of us?  I mean,


what I'm having a hard time getting our hands on is, it


looks as if a group of people who really don't mind giving


their name are objecting to the name of a different group


of people who might not, and those might be people who


might want to say, vote for Smith, and what's worrying me


about deciding this case in the context which is obvious


from the briefs is, that might have considerable legal


implications for the question of whether you can require


disclosure of campaign contributions, which is a totally


different issue, but would seem legally related, so I'd


appreciate those three things that I've mentioned -- you


see what I'm -- what the blur is in my mind, and I'd


appreciate your views on that.


MR. POLIDORO:  Justice Breyer, it has been our


contention that the ordinance was drafted in an overbroad


manner, meaning reaching speech that was not the source of


harm, including our religious speech, but also including


pure political speech.  When we put forth the interest of


those interested in anonymous political discourse, that


was under this Court's overbreadth doctrine, and we don't


believe that the Court has to wait until a violation takes


place to remove this potential weapon, some sort of weapon


from the hands of the village.

 QUESTION:  Of course, to do that we would just


say, you can't require the names to be disclosed.  We can


still require you to check in with the mayor before you go


door to door.


MR. POLIDORO:  Your Honor, we don't see how --


QUESTION:  Have you photograph taken, maybe, you


know.  You don't have to give a name, but we'll have your


photograph on file just in case.  That's okay, then,


right?


MR. POLIDORO:  No, Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  That's what you want us to do?


MR. POLIDORO:  No, not at all.  We don't


believe --


QUESTION:  I didn't think so.


MR. POLIDORO:  We don't believe that this Court


should sanction a regulation of a Government that requires


one citizen to get a license to speak to another citizen


at that citizen's home.


QUESTION:  Okay, but the basis -- as I


understand the nub of your argument is -- goes back to


your answer to Justice Ginsburg, and that is -- in


distinguishing Buckley, and I think what you were saying


was, in Buckley the Government had an interest because it


had an interest in checking the veracity of the


endorsement solicitation, the petition solicitation

process, are these real people, go to the person who asked


and check, whereas here, if we're not talking about the


solicitation of money and of signatures in a political


sphere, there's nothing for the Government to verify, and


therefore there is no interest here, whereas there was an


interest in Buckley, and that's the distinction.  Is -- am


I --


MR. POLIDORO:  Precisely.


QUESTION:  -- stating your argument correctly?


MR. POLIDORO:  Precisely, Justice Souter.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. POLIDORO:  Precisely.


QUESTION:  The brief didn't mention -- you took


Buckley as being 100 percent in your favor, and that's


what surprised me, is that Buckley made the very


distinction that you say is inappropriate here, that is,


face-to-face encounter, you don't have to have your name,


but back in an official's office, you do.


MR. POLIDORO:  Your Honor, I think that Buckley


followed on language in Your Honor's portion of the


opinion in McIntyre, where you spoke to limited -- there


might be larger circumstances where identification might


be required, and in the electoral process, the mechanics


of how an election works, those are larger purposes.


We don't think those larger purposes are present

in one-on-one conversations --


QUESTION:  You have in your case -- most of the


Jehovah's Witnesses cases dealt with that official who was


exercising discretion to keep out the Witnesses but


letting in the Republicans, and that was that line of


cases.  Then we have the, what I call the Village Green


line of cases.  McIntyre would fit in that category.


But is there any precedent for saying that if


you want to go into private homes in this town, we want to


know who you are, and -- but anybody, that applies to


anybody, and we will give the permit to anybody.


MR. POLIDORO:  Justice Ginsburg, the only


precedent that I'm aware of with respect to identification


schemes comes from the dicta in Cantwell and Martin that


speaks about a municipality, a municipality's interest in


knowing strangers in the community when connected with the


solicitation of funds.  I don't believe there's any --


QUESTION:  Don't you think that the practice


around the country of various towns and cities is to


require permits for people to go door to door in


residential areas?  I think I even live in a community


that probably does that.  The concern may stem from a


concern about preventing burglaries and unfortunate


incidents in the area, and they want to identify the


people who are going door to door.

 MR. POLIDORO:  Justice O'Connor, my experience


is quite to the opposite, that after the battles between


Jehovah's Witnesses and the municipalities in the thirties


and forties, municipalities have stopped attempting to


regulate Jehovah's Witnesses by forcing them to get a


permit to go from door to door.  This is an experience


that we're having in the past few years, that more and


more municipalities are now requiring not only a permit


but, as Justice Scalia touched on, finger-printing.


QUESTION:  Well, there was a story in the paper


just last week here about the double murder up at


Dartmouth, how the kids who did it went from house to


house purporting to be taking a survey, and then what they


were actually doing was casing the houses for robbery, so


that's certainly something that a municipality can take


into consideration, isn't it?


MR. POLIDORO:  Chief Justice Rehnquist, we think


it's implausible to think that someone intent on


committing a violent crime would stop at the city hall to


get a permit or in any way be deterred, and in the


circumstance Your Honor posits of someone just going door


to door and observing, or taking notes, the ordinance in


this instance doesn't prevent that.  The only time the


ordinance comes into play is --


QUESTION:  But it does give a record of who it

was, which would probably deter someone.


QUESTION:  I think you're wrong when you said,


only if they speak, that the mayor requires anybody who


rings door to door.  That was my understanding of this


ordinance.  Anybody who rings door to door has to sign up


in the mayor's office.


MR. POLIDORO:  No, Chief Justice -- no, Justice


Ginsburg, I believe it's anyone who wants to go door to


door to discuss a cause, and that's the language of the


ordinance.  It's the --


QUESTION:  Now, suppose --


QUESTION:  It goes broader than that.  It would


apply if you were leaving a leaflet saying, I repair


roofs, or I do painting, and I'm just going to leave it at


the door.  It obviously covers all of that without saying


a thing.


MR. POLIDORO:  Which is a speech interest,


Justice O'Connor.  That is a speech interest.


QUESTION:  But suppose I am concerned that the


mayor, in my view, or the Government has no right to


demand previous registration or to give his consent before


I go to my neighbors to talk about neighborhood problems,


or whatever.  What case do I put down when I write the


opinion to that effect for --


MR. POLIDORO:  Excuse me, Justice Kennedy, I --

 QUESTION:  What's your best case, or best --


what are your best cases for the proposition that it is


simply unconstitutional for the Government to require a


permit before you go door to door to talk about a cause? 


What are your best cases?


MR. POLIDORO:  Martin, predicated on Lovell,


predicated on Schneider.  There are interests that the


Government may have to interpose themselves into that


process, Your Honor, but there has to be some sort of real


substantial basis.  We think the equity lies with --


QUESTION:  Most of those cases -- I think


they're the closest, too, but they're not right on point,


because they were concerned with the discretion --


MR. POLIDORO:  Justice Kennedy --


QUESTION:  -- that the official had --


MR. POLIDORO:  -- there is discretion in this


instance.  If we look at the ordinance --


QUESTION:  And also may I say there's language


in those cases that suggests that it would be -- you read


it yourself, this stranger has to identify himself or


herself.  That runs in those cases as well, but those were


all cases where the danger was the official who was going


to pick and choose, and it was wide-open discretion.


MR. POLIDORO:  If I might, Justice Ginsburg and


Justice Kennedy, when we look at the ordinance on appendix

4a, and it's section 116.03(b)6), it says that the mayor


can ask for such other information --


QUESTION:  4a of the petition?


MR. POLIDORO:  Of -- I'm sorry, it's our brief


for petitioners, Chief Justice Rehnquist, page 4a, section


(b)(6), such other information concerning the registrant


and its business or purpose as may be reasonably necessary


to accurately describe the nature of the privilege desire.


Now, in this instance --


QUESTION:  That has been taken out of the case.


MR. POLIDORO:  No.  No, Justice --


QUESTION:  I thought that the only thing that


the mayor asked -- isn't -- wasn't there something in the


district court opinion that cut that back?


MR. POLIDORO:  No, Your Honor.  That is still


very much in the case, and very much part of the case. 


The only thing the district court cut out was the


reference to Jehovah's Witnesses in the administrative


paperwork.  The Court also said that it was an onerous


requirement to make individuals list all the addresses one


wanted to visit, and said the village could cure that.


QUESTION:  But I thought the village made a


concession.  It says, all we're going to ask is the name. 


Didn't the village make that concession in some court?


MR. POLIDORO:  No, Your Honor, not at all.  This

provision --


QUESTION:  I'll ask the village if they did,


because I remember something that said we're going to ask


only for the name and the address.


MR. POLIDORO:  No, it --


QUESTION:  Even if that's so, I mean, where a


slight state of confusion is, I thought this case now


sounds very theoretical.  I thought it would have to do


with requiring your name on a permit.


Now I get into it, and I discover we don't know


if they require the name on a permit.  Then I thought,


well it had to do with requiring the name when you go to


the city hall, and now I see there's a problem here


because your group doesn't mind, but you're trying to talk


through somebody else.  Then I thought, well, maybe it


requires a matter of discretion at the city hall, but then


I get a record which is forcing me to decide this on the


assumption, all you do is go to city hall, and they give


it to you automatically.  Then I thought it had to do with


fraud, but there's no money.


So now I think it has to do with somebody who


goes there and asks for a permit, which he gets


automatically, and what's the objection to that?  You


don't want to do it, and what's to be said on the other


side, not much --

QUESTION:  -- but I guess they'll say, well,


here at least he'll read the rules.  At least he'll see


that there are some people who don't want any


solicitation, and we can be sure that that will happen, so


it looks like there's something on the one side and I


don't know how much on the other.


QUESTION:  Mr. Cantor, I'm confused here.  I


thought that you object to this even if the name doesn't


have to be disclosed, and even if there is not excessive


discretion with the mayor.


MR. POLIDORO:  Exactly, yes.


QUESTION:  Is that your objection, that you do


not want to have to go to city hall in order to ring


doorbells --


MR. POLIDORO:  Precisely, Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  -- no matter what?


MR. POLIDORO:  Precisely.


QUESTION:  They want you there because they know


at least you'll find out which homeowners don't want


people around, and you'll read what the rules are, all


right.  Is that good enough?


MR. POLIDORO:  Justice Breyer, we have not


contested that provision of the ordinance, section 116.07,


which allows a homeowner to post a no-solicitation sign

and then go to the village and say, I want this group and

QUESTION:  But your position is, of course, that


Governments always want to know what it's people are


thinking, but they don't have any right to find out.


MR. POLIDORO:  Well, that's an expression of the


residents' interest in who they want.  It's not the


Government making the decision for them.


Now, with respect to the --


QUESTION:  I'm talking about your clients.


MR. POLIDORO:  Your Honor, we --


QUESTION:  Take it.  Take it.  It's good.


(Laughter.)


MR. POLIDORO:  I think that's an appropriate


point Chief Justice Rehnquist asked.  If I may reserve the


balance of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Polidoro.


MR. POLIDORO:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Mr. Cantor, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ABRAHAM CANTOR


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. CANTOR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Stratton is exercising its police power when it


seeks to protect the privacy of its residents, when it

seeks to deter crime.  The no canvassing or soliciting on


private property ordinance simply requires preregistration


and the carrying of a permit during the course of the


door-to-door activity.


QUESTION:  Do you know any other case of ours


that has even involved an ordinance of this breadth, that


involves solicitation, not asking for money, not selling


goods, but even, you know, I want to talk about Jesus


Christ, or I want to talk about protecting the


environment?  Is there -- have we had a case like that?


MR. CANTOR:  There is --


QUESTION:  The mere fact that -- I'm familiar


with something like -- maybe they've become current now,


but the mere fact that I don't even know of such cases,


over two centuries, makes me --


QUESTION:  You haven't been around that long.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  I -- do you know of any?


MR. CANTOR:  Your Honor, there's no holding by


this Court that identifies this --


QUESTION:  Never mind a holding, a case.  A case


in this Court involving -- the breadth of this thing is


novel to me.


MR. CANTOR:  There is no case that identifies


the breadth of this case, but perhaps that might be part

of the beauty, beauty in the sense that it is content-

QUESTION:  You think it's a beautiful idea that


I have to ask the Government for permission before I go


down the block, where I don't know all of the people, I


wave to them but I don't really know them, I say, I want


to talk to you because I'm concerned about the garbage


pick-up, because I'm concerned about our Congressman,


whatever.  I have to ask the Government before I can do


that?


MR. CANTOR:  No, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  It's astounding.


MR. CANTOR:  No, Your Honor.  What we are


talking about is canvassers, hawkers, and those who are


going door to door for a cause.


QUESTION:  Well, how about trick-or-treaters? 


Do they have to go get a permit?


(Laughter.)


MR. CANTOR:  Interesting --


QUESTION:  Under this ordinance it looks like


it, doesn't it?


MR. CANTOR:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  And they're soliciting, too.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  They are.  Does it cover them?  I'm

MR. CANTOR:  The answer is no, and --


QUESTION:  Why not?  Literally it does.


MR. CANTOR:  The track --


QUESTION:  You may not enforce it, but it


literally covers them, doesn't it?


MR. CANTOR:  That hypothetical was raised by the


trial court judge, Your Honor, and it was answered by


Mr. Bruzzese to the negative, and the reason why it was


answered to the negative is that these people are not --


who are going door to door are not seeking to communicate,


they are begging candy, and therefore --


QUESTION:  That's Girl Scouts.


MR. CANTOR:  Yes, Girl Scouts would be covered.


QUESTION:  Or Christmas carollers?

because it addresses only communication.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Anything else is okay.  It's only


communication that we're concerned about.


MR. CANTOR:  The limiting language, Your Honor,


deals with canvassing and hawking of the area.


QUESTION:  Okay, go back to Justice Kennedy's


example that started all of this.  The neighbor wants to


go up and down the street because he doesn't think the


garbage collection is very good.  That's a cause.  He's


got to register, right?


MR. CANTOR:  No, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Why?


MR. CANTOR:  Because it is not the type of cause


that the communication is directed at.


QUESTION:  Well, who knows?  I mean, where's the


restricted definition of cause?


MR. CANTOR:  Within the beginning of the


ordinance.


QUESTION:  And what's the language that you rely


on?


All right, you're on page what?


MR. CANTOR:  I'm looking at section 116.03.  It


is in the respondent's brief, page 3a.

you're reading from, and let's go --


MR. CANTOR:  No canvasser, solicitor, peddlar,


hawker, itinerant merchant, or transient vendor of


merchandise or services who is described in 116.01 of this


chapter, and who intends to go in or upon private


property, or a private resident of the village, for any


other purposes described in .01, shall go in or upon such


private property or residence without first registering.


QUESTION:  Okay.  Well, in .01, where does the


definition exclude people with a cause, like Justice


Kennedy's neighbor who wants the garbage picked up?


QUESTION:  I mean, unless you're interpreting


canvasser very literally, in which case it wouldn't


include Jehovah's Witnesses -- why are Jehovah's Witnesses


covered?  Are they canvassers, solicitors, peddlers,


hawkers, itinerant merchants or transient vendors of


merchandise or services?  They're none of those, are they?


MR. CANTOR:  The district court determined that


they were canvassers.


QUESTION:  They were canvassers.  So you have a


very broad definition of canvassers, if it includes


Jehovah's Witnesses.  I would have thought a canvasser was


somebody who said, I'm doing a survey, I'm canvassing


public opinion, or something like that, but if it includes


Jehovah's Witnesses, it certainly includes the, you know,

the garbage canvasser, so --


QUESTION:  The dictionary says canvasser is a


person who's looking for a vote.  It doesn't include them


at all, at least the dictionary definition wouldn't, but


you've -- it's conceded that the city does -- what's the


purpose?  That is, what -- your brief is all about fraud,


but fraud seemed to have to do with money, and the


ordinance seems to have to do with money.  I haven't read


anything in your brief that says what the purpose is for


requiring these people who are not interested in money,


not interested in selling, not even interested in votes,


to go the city hall and register.  What's the city's


purpose?


MR. CANTOR:  The city's purpose is to prevent


annoyance of the property owner.  Chief Justice Rehnquist


mentioned that there was a no-trespassing provision within


the ordinance.  There is also a no-solicitation -- there's


a no-trespassing portion in the ordinance.  There's a no-


solicitation portion in the ordinance.  That portion


allows a registrant who lives within the community and who


has private property to register with the community and


indicate they do not want to be solicited, they don't want


to be canvassed.


QUESTION:  That's not challenged, as I


understand it.

 MR. CANTOR:  That is correct, Your Honor, that


is not challenged.


QUESTION:  All right, so given that, what's the


purpose of the registration?


MR. CANTOR:  The purpose is to prevent -- the


purpose of the registration, the initial registration is


to identify who in the community is going door to door.


QUESTION:  Because?


MR. CANTOR:  Because of two factors, the privacy


of the person who is --


QUESTION:  How does it work?  Spell it out.  I


mean, how does it work?  I mean, what's the connection


between the purpose and the result, which is you have to


come to the mayor and get a permit?  It's not obvious to


me.  Maybe I'm being dim, but I don't see it.  I see it


with asking for money.  You want to know who's asking for


money so if they lie, you find out later, but where


they're just interested in a cause, spell it out, if you


can, please, for me.


MR. CANTOR:  In Martin v. Struthers, Your Honor,


in footnote 5, this Court relied upon the utilization of a


book as well as an FBI bulletin to determine that those


who go door to door may be doing so as a guise.  The Sixth


Circuit Court of Appeals identified that you cannot


determine who is going door to door with regard to the

criminality aspect of it, and therefore it would not


suffice to simply say that just because you are having a


concern over money or sales, that that's enough.  You can


go door to door for a purpose such as spreading the new,


giving additional information.  That can be the outward,


the outward point of view, but in reality it could be


something very different.


QUESTION:  It could be, and I suppose you could


say everybody who gets up on a soapbox may provoke a riot,


but you know, this seems to me one of the normal risks of


life.  It doesn't let the Government go around making it a


privilege to go -- I love the last provision of the


ordinance -- what is it, 116.03(b)(6) says that the mayor


can demand such other information concerning the


registrant and its business or purpose as may be


reasonably necessary to accurately describe the nature of


the privilege desired, the privilege of going about to


persuade your fellow citizens about one thing or another. 


I just can't understand that.


QUESTION:  That was the provision that I thought


was out of it because of the concession that the city


made.  If I'm wrong on that --


MR. CANTOR:  Your Honor, the provision remains. 


The provision is a catch-all to determine -- make sure


that the identifying information is present, the

identification of the individual as well as the cause.


QUESTION:  Wasn't there some point when the


mayor said, all I'm going to ask is the name and the


address?


MR. CANTOR:  The first five sections of that


subsection give the information.  That information is


consistent with this Court's suggestion in Martin v.


Struthers at footnote 14 as well as Cantwell.


The purpose has also been discussed in the


context, Your Honor, of how it would benefit the


community.  There was testimony at the time of trial from


Helen MacMurray, chief of the public -- chief of the


Consumer Affairs Section of the Iowa Attorney General's


Office, and she determined that legislation of this type


is helpful because it deters individuals who have an


improper motive from signing up and going door to door.


QUESTION:  Well, footnote 14 of Martin has to do


with solicitation of funds.


MR. CANTOR:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And your ordinance is much broader


than that.


MR. CANTOR:  That's correct, Your Honor. 


There -- it is indistinguishable to determine who was


going door to door.  The -- Justice O'Connor had indicated


a situation where people were claiming they were going

door to door prior to the commission of a murder.  They


were going for a reason that was --


QUESTION:  No.  No.  No, the -- footnote 14 of


Martin v. Struthers --


MR. CANTOR:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- you cited when we were talking


about whether or not you can at least give your name, said


this is necessary for those who solicit funds, but your


ordinance goes much -- sweeps much more widely than the


solicitation of funds, so footnote 14 doesn't support the


ordinance that is now before us.


MR. CANTOR:  I'm going to suggest to Your Honor


that it does, and the reason that it does is because it


requires identification information, and that


identification information is necessary regardless of


whether someone is going to solicit funds, or whether or


not he is going to go door to door for some other purpose,


as a pretext.


QUESTION:  Well, what about using the telephone?


I -- you know, that's a common ploy of people who want to


commit a crime.  You know, my car broke down, can I use


the telephone.  Is there a risk of that?  Of course.  Of


course there's a risk.  So should you require everybody


who rings a doorbell to get finger-printed at city hall


before you can ring a doorbell?  That minor risk of a

crime occurring is enough to require everybody who wants


to ring a doorbell to register at city hall?  Of course it


isn't.


MR. CANTOR:  The determination of the nature and


the amount of risk is perhaps highlighted by MacMurray's


testimony.  She found that legislation of this nature had


previously been suggested in communities where disasters


had occurred.  It was her opinion that, as a result of


this type of legislation, that potential fraudulent


transactors decided to not register within the community


and would bypass it.


In addition, it was an aid to law enforcement in


the event that there was, in fact, some type of


criminality, and finally, it was an aid to the elderly,


and it was an aid to the elderly because it gave them a


bright line to determine whether or not the individual


before them was one that was properly registered.  In


otherwise, it heightened the awareness of the propriety of


the individual at the door.


Both the district court as well as the Sixth


Circuit Court of Appeals determined that this was content-


neutral legislation, that it applied to the parties in


this case --


QUESTION:  Well, McIntyre suggests that an


anonymity requirement makes it content-based.  What are we

to do about that?


MR. CANTOR:  Your Honor, the issue in -- at the


registration aspect deals with that we are not at the


point of persuasion.  McIntyre was a automatic inclusure


of information when the reader took the document and was


attempted to be persuaded.


The pre-registration format is probably closer


to Buckley, where that is the other end of the book end,


where this is not at the point of persuasion.  Buckley is


after the persuasion occurs, so we would suggest to you


that it is appropriate to register in advance of going


door to door to prove the purpose of the ordinance.


QUESTION:  Well, the disclosure means that it


certainly is not anonymous.  How do we resolve the dispute


on what the permit has to contain, whether it contains the


name or not?


MR. CANTOR:  Your Honor, I would suggest that


you would resolve it based on the record.  The record


identifies the permit.  The record identifies an


identification of that permit, which is the testimony of


the village's mayor, and it is found at page 386 of the


joint appendix.  That is the only information concerning


the identification of the permit.


QUESTION:  Well, we're not supposed to be


resolving these back-door questions.  In the first

instance you can't tell from that form whether it has an


applicant's name or a number or nothing.


MR. CANTOR:  Your Honor, this case was tried on


the registration requirement.  This, we would suggest to


you, is a belated attempt on the issue of the content of


the permit to bring it before the Court.


QUESTION:  Well --


QUESTION:  You mean, it originally was that they


just didn't want to register, anonymous or not?


MR. CANTOR:  No, Your Honor.  The attack was


always on the registration issue.  The attack was always


to determine whether or not they were included within the


phraseology --


QUESTION:  Right.  Right.


MR. CANTOR:  -- of the language.


QUESTION:  Well, the question we took refers to


display upon demand.


MR. CANTOR:  The permit --


QUESTION:  We've not limited the case to that.


MR. CANTOR:  The display, there is a display of


the permit required on demand.


QUESTION:  One of the things in this record that


you did delete, at one time you gave the homeowners a


choice specifically of Jehovah Witnesses in or out, but --


MR. CANTOR:  Yes, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  And that, now you've deleted that,


but could the village say to the homeowner, it's your


choice, you tell us who you want and you don't want, and


we'll enforce that, so if you don't want the Jehovah


Witnesses you don't have to have them, you don't want the


Democrats you don't have to have them?  Would that be


permissible for the village to do to facilitate the


homeowner's choice?


MR. CANTOR:  The village would be acting as a


bulletin board.  It would be the homeowner, the private


resident would be making a determination as to who would


be making the content, so in that type of a context --


QUESTION:  And the village could enforce that


private discrimination?


MR. CANTOR:  Your Honor, there is no requirement


that anyone decide that anyone allow someone else to come


into their home whether for a good or a bad purpose.  The


individual has the right to exclude even valid ideas from


their home place.  It is the privacy issue here that we


are suggesting --


QUESTION:  Does the State -- when the State


assists that private choice -- we're talking about


limitations on the State, not on the homeowner.


MR. CANTOR:  Well, we're only assisting -- the


prior cases that this Court has considered deals with the

Government being some type of a censor or a limiter of the


speech that is going.


Stratton doesn't do that.  Instead, it says,


everyone's going to come to your door unless you register


to indicate no solicitation.  At that point in time, the


identification of who can come to the door is identified


by the resident of that dwelling.  That information is


provided to the person who is going door to door not to go


to this particular place if you fall within the framework.


QUESTION:  Suppose the homeowner said, only


Caucasian solicitors?


MR. CANTOR:  No, I believe that that would be


invalid on its face.  The -- it would not be different


from something in a title search situation, where there


would be something, a remnant from the forties.


QUESTION:  How is that any different from no


Jehovah Witnesses?


MR. CANTOR:  Because the issue there is that


this is a speech that is not -- that they do not wish to


accept.


QUESTION:  That's very nice.  I don't know.  I


don't know.  We have general trespass laws, and I suppose


if somebody doesn't want a Jehovah's Witness to trespass


and is perfectly willing to let everybody else trespass, I


guess the State might enforce that.  I don't know.

 MR. CANTOR:  Well, the issue here, Your Honor,


is dealing with whether or not this is a consensual


intrusion.  If it's with consent, then there is no


trespass.


With regard to no solicitation, it should be


reminded that the record below would indicated that the


Jehovah Witnesses do not consider themselves as


solicitors, and therefore would not abide by a no


solicitation sign, and that -- they, however, would abide


by a no trespassing sign.


QUESTION:  I take it there are many gated, so-


called private communities where the solicitor can never


go in at all.  I don't know, maybe that -- I assume that's


the way they work.  I'm not sure.


MR. CANTOR:  In the Village of Stratton --


QUESTION:  And in a sense, I guess you're just


trying to give your residents the protection that people


have when they live in a closed-in place.


MR. CANTOR:  That would be appropriate to


compare it to.


QUESTION:  Although I don't -- I haven't seen


any cases.  That would be like Marsh v. Alabama, perhaps.


MR. CANTOR:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Cantor.


We'll hear from you, Mr. Gormley.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. GORMLEY


ON BEHALF OF OHIO, ET AL., AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS


MR. GORMLEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The ordinance in this case differs from the


statute in McIntyre in two critical ways.  First, it


applies only when someone goes onto the private property


of a village resident.  Of course, in McIntyre, that Ohio


statute required Mrs. McIntyre to put her name on a piece


of paper wherever she wanted to distribute it, on a public


sidewalk, even in her own home, outside a polling place,


anywhere.  This ordinance is much more narrow.  It only


applies when the speaker wants to go onto someone else's


private property.


QUESTION:  Not necessarily.  I mean, you're


envisioning little cottages with a pathway up to the door. 


Don't you have anybody who's in an apartment building,


where the Jehovah's Witness knocks on the door?  He's not


on that person's private property.  He just knocks on the


door.


MR. GORMLEY:  But Your Honor, the ordinance --


QUESTION:  Or maybe another house, that they


don't have a setback restriction, the door is right, you


know, right on the public sidewalks, knocks on the door.

 MR. GORMLEY:  But the point is, Your Honor, the


ordinance is designed to protect the concerns that village


residents have, no matter how much space is between them


and a sidewalk.


QUESTION:  That's a different point, but I mean,


I don't think you can say that the difference is that this


involves only speech that occurs on private property, not


necessarily.  Not necessarily.


MR. GORMLEY:  Nonetheless, Your Honor, the point


would be that when someone knocks on a door, no matter how


far away they are from a sidewalk or a street, there is


concern on the part of the resident that this often a


stranger, certainly an uninvited person, is here on my


property, perhaps just a few inches away from a public


way, but nonetheless coming to my home, perhaps asking to


actually enter my home, and I think the village is


entitled to say, we're concerned about that kind of


activity.


QUESTION:  Oh, you're concerned about people who


were even not concerned about it.  I mean, that's the


problem.  Those people that are concerned can put up a


sign that says, no solicitors, but the village is saying


even those people who welcome Jehovah Witnesses, they're


sitting their lonely, they would love to talk to somebody


about anything --

 (Laughter.)


QUESTION:  -- and these people still have to go


register with the mayor to get the privilege of ringing


their doorbell.


MR. GORMLEY:  But Your Honor, that's no


different than the Frisby case decided by this Court 14


years ago.  It may well be that some people are not


concerned about picketing outside a home.  Nonetheless,


the Court upheld an ordinance there that was content-


neutral and so described by the Court, and said a village,


a city was entitled to enforce it.  The same is true --


QUESTION:  Well, we have always said that


picketing is an activity which is focused, it's constant,


it repeats a message over a long period of time, and


that's simply different from a single encounter, which is


what you prevent.


MR. GORMLEY:  Nonetheless, I think in both


situations, Your Honor, the Government is rightly


concerned about an activity that causes some public


problem.  In the one case, certainly annoyance of a


continuous nature, in the other, natural fear on the part


of people when some uninvited person shows up on their


property, and --


QUESTION:  But that is met, as has already been


pointed out, by the opportunity to put up a no-

trespassing, no solicitor sign.


MR. GORMLEY:  It addresses --


QUESTION:  Why does the ordinance have to do


more?


MR. GORMLEY:  Sure, well, certainly no


trespassing signs address some of the problem, but those


often provide after-the-fact remedies, if someone actually


invades the space you can prosecute, but by then you may


well not be able to find the person any more, and even


with the no-solicitation registration form that the


petitioners have not challenged, that does not protect the


person who, for whatever reason, chooses not to put up


such a sign.


Perhaps people want to be visited by solicitors


once they've registered and, in fact, it may well


encourage some people who would otherwise put up a no-


solicitation sign on their property to take that down,


because they now have confidence in this village that


these people are registered, there'll be some way to track


them down if something goes wrong.


QUESTION:  Well, what standard of review should


we apply, do you suppose, in looking at this ordinance?


MR. GORMLEY:  Well, I think that both of the


courts below applied the proper approach.  It's a content-


neutral, time, place and manner regulation.  The mayor has

no discretion in terms of issuing the permits.


QUESTION:  Well, that would be intermediate


scrutiny?


MR. GORMLEY:  That's what the court of appeals


called it, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And under that standard, aren't


you -- the Government required to show that it restricts


no more speech than is reasonably necessary to accomplish


its interests?


MR. GORMLEY:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  I take it that's the standard?


MR. GORMLEY:  Yes, Your Honor, and I think


that's true here, because every time that someone


approaches the private property, comes onto the private


property of a village resident, those residents are


rightly concerned about who this uninvited person is, and


what are they going --


QUESTION:  Why couldn't you serve all those


purposes if you just print up some signs that people can


put up if they want saying, no canvassers without a


permit.  People who want to get all that assurance can get


it, people who don't, don't have to.


MR. GORMLEY:  But I think the village rightly is


concerned with having some information --


QUESTION:  Given, say, the imaginary signs, what

is the purpose?  What is the purpose to require them just


to come down to the mayor?


MR. GORMLEY:  Because it gives some record on


file about who these people are, thereby giving village


residents a little greater sense of security that if


something goes wrong when this person is on my land, I'm


not going to be left without any --


QUESTION:  If that person turns out to be a con


man, too, it would enable a better chance of locating him


to make --


MR. GORMLEY:  Absolutely.  In the worst case


scenario though, the purposes are certainly clear, I


think.


QUESTION:  Can you give me an example of a con


man who doesn't want any money or anything else?


(Laughter.)


MR. GORMLEY:  Oh -- just coming into --


QUESTION:  We're serious.


MR. GORMLEY:  -- into your house, maybe he wants


to steal your property.  I don't know if that's


necessarily taking money, but he might want to come in

MR. GORMLEY:  Sure.

rape and burgle, but stops short of failing to register at


city hall, right?


(Laughter.)


MR. GORMLEY:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  This gives your citizens treat


confidence that --


(Laughter.)


MR. GORMLEY:  But, Your Honor, I think the fact


that the ordinance is not going to catch everyone who's


going to do something wrong doesn't mean that the village


is not entitled to try to do something to give its


residents some comfort.  You probably passed people this


morning on the highway who don't have a license to drive. 


It doesn't mean the Government can't --


QUESTION:  The question is, how much?  How


necessary is it?  We can all stipulate that the safest


societies in the world are totalitarian dictatorships. 


There's very little crime.  It's a common phenomenon, and


one of the costs of liberty is to some extent a higher


risk of unlawful activity, and the question is whether


what this is directed at stops enough unlawful activity to


be worth the cost of requiring the privilege of ringing


somebody's doorbell.


MR. GORMLEY:  I think it does, Your Honor, and


it's a very modest restriction.  Remember, there's nothing

that the mayor can do to prevent someone from getting the


permit.  It's essentially a declaration that I intend to


go door to door in your community, and whether the mayor


wants to give it out or not, he's going to do it, but that


seems to me much different than a --


QUESTION:  It's so modest that we can't find a


single case reporting a single municipality that has ever


enacted an ordinance of that type.  I don't think that's


modest.


MR. GORMLEY:  Well, but I think, Your Honor,


it's a -- it shows that this village is perhaps trying to


take some proactive steps that other communities have not


to try --


QUESTION:  Do we know where the village got it


from?  I don't think it was original with this village,


was it?


MR. GORMLEY:  I'm not sure.  In Richard Riordo's


amicus brief, he refers to similar ordinances in Plano,


Texas, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and Grand Rapids Township,


Michigan.  I believe that the village solicitor -- and odd


title, the village's attorney came up with the draft of


this ordinance on his own.  There had been, as I


understand it, similar ordinances in this village dating


back into the forties.  My guess as they probably had the


same defects that Cantwell and other ordinances had.

(Laughter.)


MR. GORMLEY:  I think --


QUESTION:  That's extraordinary.


MR. GORMLEY:  I think he was speaking about the


Jehovah's Witnesses, Your Honor.  At the time of the


hearing in the district court, six people had requested


permits and received them.  Those begin on page 230 of the


joint appendix.  I believe now 15 people have received


permits.


QUESTION:  Could the city say, to facilitate the


homeowners' choice, we're going to say, nobody rings bells


for anything, but the homeowner -- make the homeowner the


one to come to sign up in city hall to say, I don't mind


having solicitors.?


MR. GORMLEY:  Certainly that's the part of the


ordinance that the petitioners have not challenged here. 


Homeowners can both post the no --


QUESTION:  But suppose, in order to meet the


objection that the solicitors don't want to sign up, or


the canvassers don't want to sign up, the city says, well,


we'll just have a total ban on ringing doorbells, but any

homeowner who wants to have it can?


MR. GORMLEY:  I mean, given your -- the Court's


decision in Martin, I'd be hesitant to say you can have an


outright ban on ringing doorbells or knocking.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gormley.


MR. GORMLEY:  Thank you, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Mr. Polidoro, you have 4 minutes.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. POLIDORO


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. POLIDORO:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  If


I make a few points, please.


Justice O'Connor asked a question as to whether


this would apply to trick-or-treaters.  I open to the


joint appendix, page 199, which is one of the no-


solicitation registration forms, Your Honor.  Indeed,


trick-or-treaters are -- and specifically, point 13,


trick-or-treaters during Halloween are mentioned, so


they're encompassed under the ordinance.


Too, I heard a point being made about the


ordinance being a way to help track down the bad guys. 


There's no independent verification mechanism in this


ordinance at all.  I can go to the village hall and say


I'm Abraham Cantor and get a permit and go from door to


door.  Mr. Bruzzese at page, transcript page 174, and


Ms. MacMurray, page 478a, both recognized the ordinance

has no verification mechanism to tie in to the person


who's asking for the permit.


With respect to discretion, Mayor Abdullah


testified that -- and this is in the transcript, pages 124


and 126, that if someone came, gave their name, address,


cause, and said they were unaffiliated with an


organization, he would likely not issue a permit to them. 


We believe that this is manifestly exercise of discretion.


And lastly, Your Honors, I've heard our door-


to-door activity be referred to as an annoyance to be


compared to obnoxious picketing at the home.  I


respectfully suggest that our activity indeed lies at the


heart of the First Amendment.


QUESTION:  I wanted to ask you, if you're


through --


MR. POLIDORO:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- I don't want to take your rebuttal


time -- as I looked at page 199 and I thought that was a


list of exceptions to the ordinance.


MR. POLIDORO:  It is, and what --


QUESTION:  So that in other words the trick-or-


treaters are expressly excepted, just like Christmas


carollers and the others listed.


MR. POLIDORO:  Well, what had happened there,


Justice Stevens, they would be accepted if the box was

checked and they were allowed, and on that particular


form, no one was allowed at the door.


QUESTION:  You mean the person applying for the


ordinance has to check all these things to be -- I don't


quite understand how it --


MR. POLIDORO:  No, what --


QUESTION:  This is the homeowner who allows


certain solicitations.  This is the homeowner's form.


MR. POLIDORO:  That's the homeowner's form.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Polidoro.


MR. POLIDORO:  Thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:11 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
