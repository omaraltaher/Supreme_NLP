CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We’ll hear argument 

next this morning in Case 08-1214, Granite Rock 

Company v. the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. 

Mr. Mathiason. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARRY G. MATHIASON 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. MATHIASON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

This case involves two questions.  Taking 

them in the order that the Ninth Circuit addressed 

them, we look first at whether the complaint contained 

sufficient facts to support a cause of action against 

a non-signatory international union that engages in a 

company-wide strike that violates the no-strike clause 

of a contract between the local and the employer. 

This is not a strike for higher wages, 

better benefits; it's a strike for an amendment to the 

contract that would provide immunity for the 

international and other locals with regard to past 

wrongdoing.  The --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's a tort action, 

right? 

MR. MATHIASON:  It is a tort action by being

structured as inducement and interference.  It is 

grounded in contract.  Specifically, what you would 

look for, for jurisdiction, is to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose --

grounded in contract.  I suppose the existence of a 

contract is an evidentiary matter that you have to 

establish, but the cause of action is still tort, and 

of course 301(a) is limited to violations of 

contracts. 

MR. MATHIASON:  Your Honor, 301(a) provides 

jurisdiction if there's a suit for a breach -- if 

there's a suit for violation of a contract, and that 

can be between a nonparty and a party, and then the 

contract is between the union and the employer. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't see how 

somebody who is not a party to the contract can 

violate the contract.  They can be liable for all 

sorts of things, but I don't see that they can be 

liable for violating the contract. 

MR. MATHIASON:  Mr. Chief Justice, the 

concept that we are advancing is the plain language of 

the statute.  Violation of a contract is right at the 

heart of this suit.  You have for 150 years, 

jurisprudence where in enforcing contracts, which is 

the central mission of the statute, there --

you, without the -- establishing the existence of a 

contract? 

MR. MATHIASON:  I can't imagine how you 

would.  You might have a different --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, I suppose 

that’s --

MR. MATHIASON:  -- kind of tort. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- tortious 

interference with -- what is it, the ability to enter 

into a contract, I think, is recognized in some 

jurisdictions. 

MR. MATHIASON:  That's -- that's cognizable. 

That's certainly not here. 

What we’re doing is looking at a very minor 

adjustment in what would otherwise be a 

straightforward contract action; and that is that you 

have a situation where the international displaced the 

local after the contract was entered into, took 

control, and that control we manifested in several 

specific points within our complaint.  And another way 

-- it's effectively an agency relationship between the 

-- at that point between the international and the 

local, but it's an agency relationship to control them

to effect the breach. 

Official 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, then you could have 

sued on an agency claim, couldn't you? 

MR. MATHIASON:  We did originally look at an 

agency claim.  The problem with that is that under an 

agency claim, at the time the contract was formed, 

it's clear the local was not operating on behalf of 

the international.  It was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but I mean -- if 

you’re coming up and saying, well, we have a 

principal-agent here, I could understand that, but 

that's I didn't think the question we are here to 

decide. 

MR. MATHIASON:  The question to decide is 

whether there’s a cause of action. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  On -- on the tortious 

interference as to whether or not that's under 301. 

Sure, agent-principal, I understand that.  But that --

that's a new argument so far as I'm concerned. 

MR. MATHIASON:  Your Honor, that argument 

really isn’t new at all.  With regard --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it your briefs?  Is it 

part of the question? 

MR. MATHIASON:  It is in our briefs.  It is 

directly in our briefs.  With regard to a footnote, we

actually say that --

Official 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but the -- the basic 

question is -- the Chief Justice began with it --

isn't this -- isn't this a tort action?  You say, 

well, it's grounded in contract.  I -- I really have a 

problem with the word "grounded."  If you say it 

necessarily implicates or it's entangled, then I could 

understand that.  But grounded in contract -- we ask 

what the source of the original obligation is.  And 

these parties were not -- or the international was not 

part of the -- part of the -- part of the contract. 

MR. MATHIASON:  We take the position that 

the contract has within it the protection of the 

contract.  In other words, if you have a party that is 

in a position to control one of the signatories to the 

contract and they cause that signatory to breach the 

contract, and -- then in every regard that is the 

equivalent of a violation of contract.  They are the 

responsible party.  They -- to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So suddenly it's all a lot 

of things that would have been pre-empted to go to the 

board.  For example, you have a labor dispute on a 

construction business, and one union's out there 

telling the other:  Keep on going.  And then some 

other group comes in and says:  Don't let them do that

to you.  And another says:  You don't have to do that 

under your contract.  And there are 19 unions and they 

are all fighting about -- each other, and everybody is 

going to end up suing each other in Federal court. 

I thought the purpose of the LMRA was to 

stop that.  The purpose of the Labor Act, the Wagner 

Act was to stop that.  They didn't want Federal courts 

any more than State courts interfering in that kind of 

thing.  So why should we read an exception into this? 

MR. MATHIASON:  Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It would reproduce the 

situation that led all the Congresses and Presidents 

in the 1930s to stop it. 

MR. MATHIASON:  Your Honor, the very essence 

of section 301 was to deal with midterm contract 

strikes. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, that's right, and they 

said:  Here's how we’ll deal with that.  We’ll deal 

with that by giving the employer and the union a right 

to go into court and enforce the contract or get 

damages for its violation.  That we figure furthers 

labor relations. 

But it's pretty hard for me to see how it 

could further labor relations by letting any third 

party under the sun come in and say everything that

went on during a labor dispute is a -- is a tort in 

respect to the contract that might not even have been 

signed yet. 

MR. MATHIASON:  Your Honor, what you have 

just described in terms of the impact on labor 

relations is exactly what we are focused on here. 

This is not any party.  This is the international that 

effectively displaces, takes control, tells the 

employer that they have the independent ability to 

resolve the dispute --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You are not arguing us 

creating Federal common law for tortious interference. 

You are saying they’re the actual party to the 

contract.  So which theory are you -- are you arguing? 

MR. MATHIASON:  We originally made the 

argument that they were -- they were the moving party, 

the undisclosed principal, that actually caused the 

contract to come into existence.  We can't factually 

support that.  They were upset with the decision to 

enter into the contract. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you've given up the 

agency argument? 

MR. MATHIASON:  We abandoned it only with 

regard to formation.  We absolutely did not and do not 

abandon that argument thereafter for the breach.

Thereafter, what happened is you have the 

international taking control of the local and causing 

the local to breach the contract.  And that 

differentiates it from many, many other circumstances 

where you have third parties. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it seems to me the 

strongest argument you have is that this tortious 

interference is pre-empted under State law.  So we 

have a -- a vacuum if we don't accept -- accept your 

view. 

Let me ask you this:  My understanding is --

correct me if I am wrong, please -- this Court has not 

said that they -- that the State law cause of action 

for interference with contract relations is pre­

empted.  This Court has not said that.  Am I correct 

about that? 

MR. MATHIASON:  This Court would --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The circuits have said 

that, but we haven't said that.  Am I right about 

that? 

MR. MATHIASON:  Your Honor, with all due 

respect, I think this cause of action would clearly be 

pre-empted under Allis-Chalmers and subsequent 

decisions. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no.  I’m talking --

I’m talking specifically that -- interference with 

advantageous business relations or interfering with an 

existing contract -- that, we have not addressed in 

this Court. 

MR. MATHIASON:  In Allis-Chalmers, the Court 

did address the pre-emption doctrine and indicated 

that it would extend to torts. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but it did not --

it did not include interference with a -- with a 

contractual relation.  We have not, as a specific 

holding -- tell me if I’m wrong.  I will look at 

Allis-Chalmers. 

MR. MATHIASON:  No, Your Honor, I think 

you're correct, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Allis-Chalmers involved the 

two parties to the contract, a tort claim by one party 

to the contract against the other party to the 

contract, right? 

MR. MATHIASON:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And this involves a tort 

claim by one party to the contract against a third 

party.  It seems to me it's quite -- quite different 

from Allis-Chalmers. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It -- it would seem to me 

that one of your strongest points is that this is pre­

empted by State law.  If -- if that's not true, then 

we would be deciding the case based on a premise that 

is -- is unclear. 

MR. MATHIASON:  Your Honor, we have taken 

the strong position that it is pre-empted by 301.  It 

will involve an interpretation of the contract and an 

application of the contract.  To view that as 

otherwise not pre-empted would be to start attacking 

301 in terms of a uniform national system of 

administering contracts in Federal labor law. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, what is -- what is 

the contractual issue?  What is the issue of 

interpreting the contract that this case presents if 

you let the 301 case go forward? 

MR. MATHIASON:  The issue would be whether 

the action of engaging in the strike violates the no­

strike clause of the collective bargaining agreement. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Is there any dispute about 

that? 

MR. MATHIASON:  I think there is a dispute 

about that. I think there’s a dispute about the 

underlying existence of the contract, and then the --

the no-strike clause is complex. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How is that issue still 

alive?  Wasn't there an NLRB order in May of '06 that

said -- or directed that the contract become effective 

as of July 2nd? 

MR. MATHIASON:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Did anybody appeal that 

order or challenge it? 

MR. MATHIASON:  Yes.  That order was 

appealed to the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit 

affirmed it.  From our perspective, it's a final 

determination that July 2nd is the starting date of 

the contract.  However, you still have a formation 

issue. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So did -- but how -- if 

you lost in your appeal to the Ninth Circuit and the 

contract is effective July 2nd, what issue remains for 

anybody to decide with respect to contract formation? 

MR. MATHIASON:  We --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because there has been a 

final adjudication of the question of the effective 

date of the contract. 

MR. MATHIASON:  That's our position.  We 

succeeded on that issue before the Ninth Circuit. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So now the only question 

that appears to be extant in my mind is whether or not 

there was a breach of the no-strike clause.  So why 

isn't that subject to arbitration by the very terms of

the arbitration clause? 

Official 

MR. MATHIASON:  We agree that that would go 

to arbitration, and it's scheduled to go to 

arbitration between the local and the company.  The 

second question that was brought to play in this 

particular case is whether the formation question goes 

to an arbitrator or goes to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but what -- there is 

no doubt about the formation, just as Justice 

Sotomayor said.  There is a contract, the contract 

that was signed on December 17th.  It is formed.  You 

don't doubt that it's formed.  They don't doubt that 

it's formed.  And that contract has an arbitration 

agreement in it.  And one of the questions that will 

be arbitrated, I take it, is whether that December 

17th contract, because of its retroactivity 

provisions, provides damages for what happened in 

July.  And part of that will require the arbitrator to 

interpret the December 17th contract --

MR. MATHIASON:  Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- to decide whether it 

does cover that event of July 2nd.  Now, what has this 

got to do -- I mean, I would have thought -- is that ­

- I mean, what is your argument?

issue isn't the NLRB ruling, although that’s going to 

have to be drawn upon.  There is a denial that a 

contract was formed on July 2nd that continues to 

today.  And the question is:  Where does that get 

decided?  Does it get decided in a court, as we did 

before with a unanimous jury verdict?  Or does that 

now get vacated and sent to an arbitrator with no 

agreement --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why is there -- is 

there anything, any question about formation, given 

that there is a contract?  The contract is retroactive 

to May, so if the contract is retroactive to May, then 

certainly a contract was formed and that issue is --

is academic, but --

MR. MATHIASON:  You're -- Justice Ginsburg, 

this is right at the center of the analysis in that we 

contend, the company, that there was a formation on 

July 2nd.  The other side contends that something 

happened on August 22nd that would constitute the 

formation event.  There was no -- if our contract --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why does it matter? 

Why does it matter if we have a contract?  A contract 

has been formed; everybody agrees about that.  And 

everybody agrees that the effective date is May. 

MR. MATHIASON:  It's of critical importance

which contract was formed, because there’s a quid pro 

quo in labor law that's critical, and that is that you 

agree to arbitration in exchange for a no-strike 

clause.  That happened on the 2nd.  If we had not had 

formation on July 2nd and the first formation was on 

the 22nd of August, then we would have been denied all 

of the benefit of the contract.  We never would have 

made the same deal. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So, why isn’t --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose it's a 

question for your friends on the other side whether 

they think the ratification or the contract that was 

entered into in December that’s effective in May -- if 

that makes them liable for violating the no-strike 

clause, right? 

MR. MATHIASON:  Mr. Chief Justice, there’s a 

critical issue in labor relations, and that is clearly 

when it's ratified brings into effect the no-strike 

clause.  That's embedded --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So what happens if 

it's ratified retroactively?  Is the no-strike clause 

in effect? 

MR. MATHIASON:  The no --

MR. MATHIASON:  Well, it would be -- it 

would be completely imprudent for to us say that in 

May the no-strike clause was in effect.  It wasn't, 

because the parties were still in a labor dispute and 

negotiating.  July 2nd, that's when the no-strike 

clause came into effect. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I think people are not 

communicating.  Imagine on December 17th you and I 

enter into a contract and it's all written in red, all 

right?  And one of these red sentences says:  I will 

pay you $32 extra an hour from the moment that the 

blue contract went into effect.  See? 

Now, whether -- that moment when the blue 

contract went into effect is a question, isn't it, 

that we would turn over to the arbitrator, the person 

who is arbitrating the meaning and application of the 

red contract.  That's simply a question of fact and 

contractual meaning like any other. 

Now, what have I said that's wrong? 

MR. MATHIASON:  Your Honor, what's really 

central is the fact that when we signed in December, 

we signed the agreement of July 2nd.  That is 

critical.  If there had been no ratification on July 

2nd, there would be no contract.  And when the union 

signed, they take the position that they signed a

contract ratified on August 22nd.  Those are radically 

different events, and the -- the real issue then is, 

where do you determine this core initial issue? 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why is that a difficult 

issue?  I can easily modify the hypothetical.  The red 

contract says:  Joe Smith will be paid $32 extra an 

hour from the moment when this red contract takes 

effect. 

Okay?  And, now we have an issue, when 

everybody's agreed, we'll send the meaning of the 

contract to arbitration.  We’ll send the application 

of the contract to -- to arbitration.  One of the 

questions is:  When, for purposes of the $32, did this 

contract, which we have admittedly signed, take 

effect?  Why isn't that question for an arbitrator? 

Is there any authority at all --

MR. MATHIASON:  Yes --

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- anywhere that says it 

isn't -- I can't -- I can't even know what authority ­

- what reasoning it would be. 

MR. MATHIASON:  Justice Breyer, the second 

contract, if it's the contract as proposed by the 

other side, never would have had a clause with that 

much money in it because we would have had to absorb 

for the strike.  We signed the contract on the

assumption that it was the contract entered into July 

2nd, and --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Am I correct that neither 

you, neither Granite Rock nor the local, thinks that 

the December collective bargaining agreement really 

was fully retroactive?  They don't think it was --

MR. MATHIASON:  That's correct. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- it meant that the no­

strike clause was in effect on the day when the old 

collective bargaining agreement expired, and you don't 

think that the new arbitration clause was in effect on 

the day when the old collective bargaining agreement 

expired, or do I not understand your positions? 

MR. MATHIASON:  Justice Alito, that’s 

exactly right.  We agree with that.  It wasn't.  I 

mean, there is a crystal-clear understanding between 

the parties that the time of ratification is the time 

that the no-strike clause came into effect, and if 

there was no ratification on July 2nd, we wouldn't 

have signed the contract with the wage levels that are 

described in December. When we signed it, we signed it 

with the assumption that it was the contract that was 

formed on July 2nd. 

And the issue of formation was never given 

to arbitration.  The arbitration clause in this

particular case is what arises under the contract. 

It's a much narrower clause than this Court has seen 

in other cases and was not submitted --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But I keep going back 

to:  That issue was decided.  It was decided by the 

NLRB, and that was affirmed by a court of law, and so 

-- by the Ninth Circuit.  I don't understand what the 

extant issue is.  The -- the -- now what's left is 

applying that in arbitration to the question of the 

effectiveness of the no-strike clause. 

But it has nothing to do with whether or not 

the issue of ratification has been decided and by 

whom. 

MR. MATHIASON:  Justice Sotomayor, we take 

the position, much like you've indicated in your 

hypothetical or actual description, that the NLRB 

decision is definitive.  But there has to be a body, 

an entity, that actually adjudicates whether this is 

preclusive, and the question is:  Does that go to a 

court, as it already has, with a unanimous jury 

verdict finding that it was ratified, or does it go to 

an arbitrator, who then looks at the NLRB decision and 

says, I guess I am bound by it? 

We never agreed to submit the formation 

question to arbitration.  There is no clear and

unmistakable agreement to do that, and so, 

consequently, it's the forum issue of where that's 

decided.  We couldn't agree more that it's a futile 

act.  In other words, the contract is now final and 

over, it starts on July 2nd, and we should go right 

into the issue of whether there’s a breach of 

contract. 

But there’s this interim step because we 

don't yet have agreement from the other side that that 

issue is moot and resolved. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If the contract had read, 

not simply "claims arising under this contract," but 

in addition said "including the formation or breach 

thereof," if the -- if the arbitration clause had 

included formation, then you would have no argument. 

MR. MATHIASON:  There would be no --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It would go to the 

arbitrator. 

MR. MATHIASON:  Justice Ginsburg, there’s no 

question that the parties could agree to have 

formation arbitrated if they do so in a clear and 

unmistakable way.  The problem that we have here -- we 

agree with that -- the clause, if -- if the clause 

included formation, then that issue would go to the 

arbitrator.  But the issue then becomes is there a

contract?  And that's a threshold issue, that you have 

to bring life to the agreement to get subject matter 

jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought of another way of 

putting this because I am having a hard time with it. 

You and I could do this, couldn't we?  We could try to 

enter into a contract on May 1, and who knows what 

happens, we disagree about what happened, and by the 

way that had an arbitration clause in it.  Now, 

whether -- since we disagree about it, that would go 

to the judge, whether we formed that contract with its 

arbitration clause, because everything's up in the 

air. 

A year later, we enter into another 

contract, and what that contract says is, we are going 

to arbitrate every dispute between us, including that 

old dispute about whether there was that old contract, 

okay?  And we could do that, and then you would -- you 

would certainly arbitrate the issue of contract 

formation, even for the old one, because we said we 

would do it, right? 

MR. MATHIASON:  If --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So why isn't the 

December 17th contract that second contract in respect 

to the July 2nd?

MR. MATHIASON:  Your Honor, if that had 

been, let's say, 4 years later, and we entered into a 

new contract willingly and getting the exchange, the 

no-strike clause for the arbitration, and that new 

contract said, this is going to deal with all past 

disputes, including prior contracts, fine. 

When we executed that contract in December, 

we executed the contract that we believed was formed 

in July.  There is no meeting of the minds.  In other 

words, the union's execution was on a contract they 

say was formed on the 22nd. 

There is a major, major issue here, and that 

is on July 2nd we made the concessions on wages, 

working conditions, and the rest of it, with the 

explicit understanding that it would be ratified at 

that time.  Stipulated fact number 16, I think it's in 

the joint appendix 377, has that qualification in it. 

If it wasn't ratified on July 2nd, then what 

happened is it was withdrawn, it exploded, there was 

nothing, there was nothing to be signed in December. 

We only signed what was agreed to on July 2nd and 

maintained that position because we believe we got the 

benefit and the protection of a no-strike clause all 

the way through that time period. 

And so that is the critical distinction.

And now I couldn't agree more with this Court that 

it's an academic exercise to go to either an 

arbitrator or a court on whether it is in effect as of 

July 2nd.  We believe the NLRB decision is preclusive 

in that regard. 

But there is underneath it, there has to be 

a forum.  There has to be somebody to say that.  If an 

arbitrator got the case, looked at it, said, well, I'm 

not sure I really agree with the NLRB, and I think I'm 

going to decide it differently, and that then went to 

review in a court, and the arbitrator made a mistake 

of law, a mistake of fact, it's not completely clear 

to me that we would be able to come back to this Court 

and get it effectively changed. 

We are saying that the issue of formation 

was submitted to the court, it was litigated. 

And I would like to very much, Chief 

Justice, reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

I’d like to turn to some questions that were 

just raised.  This is not a question of whether there 

is a contract dated July 2nd, nor is this a question 

of whether there was a contract dated August 22nd. 

Those are issues of contract ratification. 

There is only one collective bargaining 

agreement.  That collective bargaining agreement was 

attached as an exhibit to the employer's first amended 

complaint.  The trial court recognized this fact, in 

joint appendix page 231. 

The contract was attached to the -- to the 

complaint lodging a breach of contract against this 

labor organization.  There can be no doubt that that 

collective bargaining agreement says, on the very 

first page and the very last page, that the effective 

date is May 1st, 2004, and its expiration date is 

April 30th of 2008. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, if there was a 

contract beginning May 22nd, then that included the 

no-strike clause? 

MR. BONSALL:  The issue, Your -- Mr. Chief 

Justice, would be whether the parties when they 

entered into that agreement and made that entire 

agreement retroactive to May 1st of 2004, whether the 

parties intended that the retroactivity clause would

apply for all purposes to any disputes arising to the 

parties.  For example --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so you don't 

think -- I guess this is following up on Justice 

Alito's question.  You don't think it included the no­

strike clause --

MR. BONSALL:  Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- for -- that would 

apply to July 2nd? 

MR. BONSALL:  We contend that it would not, 

and here's the reason why.  If --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if it doesn't 

-- I'm sorry to interrupt you.  But if it doesn't 

include the no-strike clause and the question is 

whether the July 2nd one does, all this talk about the 

December agreement being retroactive to May is really 

kind of beside the point. 

MR. BONSALL:  Well, I think that it’s 

important for two reasons.  First, factually, if the 

Court places itself in the position of the parties on 

July 1st, at that point in time some things are clear. 

The union and its members have been out on strike for 

approximately 3 weeks, and they have engaged in tough 

negotiations at the bargaining table trying to reach a 

new contract, because that old contract had expired

almost 2 months ago.  And the parties reach a 

tentative agreement on all the wages, hours, and terms 

of conditions of employment.  But then the parties 

also incorporate a retroactivity clause, to make sure 

that all these rights and benefits would inure to the 

union members beginning May 1, the day after the last 

contract expired. 

The Court should ask itself that -- when the 

union and its members are engaging in lawful, 

protected, concerted activity, a strike, on July 1, 

did they intend to convert that lawful economic 

activity into a breach of contract? 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And you say no, but what do 

you say about the -- but you say that the arbitration 

clause was intended to be retroactive. 

MR. BONSALL:  Excuse me, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But you say that the 

arbitration clause -- or do you? -- in the later -- in 

the agreement that was ratified in December was 

retroactive? 

MR. BONSALL:  No, I think --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Neither one is retroactive? 

MR. BONSALL:  On July 2nd, as counsel has 

indicated, there is a real dispute, a continuing 

dispute, between the parties whether the contract was

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, I understand that.  I've 

having difficulty -- can we just put the December --

in the view of both sides, can we just put the 

December agreement aside?  It has nothing to do with 

the argument that's before us. 

The argument before us has to do with the --

whether there was a ratification on July the 2nd. 

MR. BONSALL:  We think that the -- there is 

only one contract, Your Honor.  That contract was 

executed on December 14th by management's 

representative and December 17th by the union's 

representative.  That's the labor agreement.  Now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well -- I'm sorry, 

but that's the central issue.  Your friend says no, we 

had a contract on July 2nd, and that's for the court 

to determine, not the arbitrator, because it's a 

question of formation. 

MR. BONSALL:  Well, the fact that counsel 

has reiterated over and over again that this is a 

question of contract formation -- in fact there is no 

formation issue when the Court is being asked to 

decide whether there is an arbitral issue.  The Court 

needs to look at the collective bargaining agreement; 

and the contract that was in effect at the time that

the party -- the union -- made its demand for 

arbitration clearly indicated that there was a 

contract in place, and it contained a -- an -- excuse 

me -- extremely broad arbitration provision, that 

requires that all disputes -- all disputes arising 

under the collective bargaining agreement would be 

subject to the grievance and arbitration provision. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that the 

union's initial position was that there was no 

agreement, and it refused to arbitrate.  Isn't that 

what -- wasn't the union's refusal to arbitrate what 

precipitated this case? 

MR. BONSALL:  That is not correct, Your 

Honor. 

On July 26th of 2004, the union was 

confronting a Boys Markets injunction that was being 

sought by the employer.  The issue before the trial 

court was whether the union should be enjoined, its 

strike should be enjoined.  And counsel for the union 

took the clear position that there was not a contract 

in place at that time on July 26th, but even if there 

was, the injunction should not issue because of this 

Court's decision in Buffalo Forge. 

The matter that was continuing to be an 

issue in conflict did not arise under the collective

bargaining agreement because it involved other labor 

organizations and essentially a back-to-work 

agreement.  So on July 26th, the union did take the 

position that there was no contract, but the reason 

why an injunction was not appropriate was because of 

Buffalo Forge. 

I don't know if that addresses --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that at that 

time the union refused to arbitrate. 

MR. BONSALL:  No.  There was no question 

about arbitrating anything.  The employer didn't ask 

to have arbitration at all at the July 26th hearing. 

The only question at that point in time was whether 

there was ratification or not.  The employer insisted 

that the union's representative had made a 

communication to the employer's representative that 

the contract had been ratified. 

Having the witnesses for both labor and 

management in the courtroom, Judge Ware said, well, 

I’ll take evidence regarding whether this 

communication occurred.  Did George Netto represent to 

Bruce Woolpert that in fact a contract had been 

ratified? 

That was the very narrow issue decided by --

have had the NLRB's -- the NLRB has weighed in and 

said that there was a contract as of July 2nd, why 

isn't that conclusive? 

MR. BONSALL:  We think that there's still an 

issue that is being sent to the arbitrator, the breach 

of contract and damages, but as a precursor to that, 

we contend that the issue never should have been 

litigated at all by the trial court about whether 

there was formation, because there was no question of 

formation at that time.  It was only a question of 

contract ratification, and that issue falls within the 

scope of the broad arbitration provision under the 

collective bargaining agreement.  When we go back --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought you answered 

Justice Alito "no," but I thought his question was a 

very simple one.  You’re taking the position, I think, 

that there’s no dispute that on -- in December a 

contract was formed. 

MR. BONSALL:  Correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It was made retroactive 

to a date before July.  It started in May --

MR. BONSALL:  Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and it covers a time

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The dispute between the 

parties is what that retroactivity under the contract 

means and which provisions are in effect or not. 

Isn't that what your argument is -- that this is not 

contract formation; this is a question of -- of the 

applicability of individual provisions to a set of 

facts? 

MR. BONSALL:  Absolutely correct, Your 

Honor.  The employer is alleging that there is a 

breach of the no-strike clause.  The union is alleging 

a defense to that allegation by asserting a merits­

based issue regarding whether, in a certain narrow gap 

period, falling in between the effective date of the 

contract --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So your answer to 

Justice Alito should have been:  We are arguing that 

the no-strike clause was not in effect, but we do take 

the position that the arbitration clause was --

MR. BONSALL:  That’s --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- made retroactive. 

MR. BONSALL:  That's exactly correct, Your 

Honor.  And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And what do you 

expect the arbitrator to do?  The arbitrator -- since 

you agree that there’s a contract in effect --

not. 

MR. BONSALL:  He will not. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And the contract has 

a no-strike clause. 

MR. BONSALL:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you expect the 

arbitrator to say you get the benefit of the contract 

that lets me decide something, and even though there’s 

a no-strike clause in the contract, you want the 

arbitrator to say that no-strike clause is not 

operative on July 2nd? 

MR. BONSALL:  We expect the arbitrator to 

take a look at the facts that existed on July 2nd and 

make a determination whether in fact at that point in 

time the union has a meritorious claim that the 

contract was not ratified, and therefore the no-strike 

clause --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even though -- I'm 

sorry to interrupt you.  But even though the later 

agreement was that it would be retroactive?

representatives sign a collective bargaining 

agreement.  The employer was entirely free, if it was 

inclined to do so, to suggest that they would not sign 

an agreement unless the union consented. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So in substance, you -- you 

think that the arbitrator would decide the issue of 

contract formation, whether --

MR. BONSALL:  No. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I thought you just 

said that the arbitrator would decide whether there 

was an agreement on July the 2nd. 

MR. BONSALL:  The arbitrator would not be 

deciding contract formation.  The arbitrator would be 

deciding within the scope of the collective bargaining 

agreement whether the no-strike clause was effective 

to bind the employer -- excuse me -- to bind the union 

from a short period of time from July 2nd to August 

22nd.  That would be the only real claim, because the 

union actually -- there’s no question -- was out on 

strike.  This is not in dispute. 

What the trial court did in this case was to 

usurp the function of the arbitrator.  The parties 

selected one arbitrator. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, perhaps you can 

clarify one thing for me.  I thought that these two go

together -- two things that go together:  One is the 

no-strike clause, and one is the arbitration clause. 

MR. BONSALL:  Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you are trying to 

uncouple them, and so, even though one is quid pro quo 

for the other, you would say the union wants to keep 

what favors it, that is the arbitration clause, but 

reject what favors the employer, that is the no-strike 

clause. 

It seems to me that if you have one, you 

have the other, but you can't say, oh, yes, we have 

the arbitration clause, but we don't have the no­

strike clause. 

MR. BONSALL:  Yes, I -- I think this Court 

has addressed that very issue, Justice Ginsburg, in 

Drake Bakeries.  An employer was confronted with a 

strike.  The employer immediately went into Federal 

court and filed a breach of contract action against 

the labor organization, and it insisted that these two 

contract provisions, the right -- the no-strike clause 

and the grievance procedure, were inextricably tied. 

And this Court pointed out that they are not in all 

circumstances exact counterweights. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, they’re not in all

-- on July 2nd if they didn't think they were going to 

get the benefit of the no-strike clause? 

MR. BONSALL:  When they signed the 

agreement, Your Honor, they absolutely did get the 

benefit of it.  There was no strike at all after 

August 22nd that was --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  If they had the benefit of 

the no-strike clause --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you say there 

was no strike, and I -- I thought the other side said 

there was. 

MR. BONSALL:  There absolutely was a strike. 

It began in the early weeks of June. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

MR. BONSALL:  And it continued, actually, 

through September 22nd of 2004.  That was the duration 

that the union was on strike. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right, but their 

position is that there was a contract on July 2nd that 

included a no-strike clause --

MR. BONSALL:  Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- that you 

violated. 

MR. BONSALL:  That's correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  And your 

answer is, one, that there is no contract, right? 

MR. BONSALL:  Our defense to the allegation 

of the no-strike clause before the arbitrator would be 

that at that time the parties had not ratified the 

agreement, and that ratification did not occur until 

August 22nd, which also appears as a concession by the 

employer in paragraph 27 of their third amended

ratified on August 22nd. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But that would be an issue 

for the -- you think that that would be an issue for 

the arbitrator to decide, whether there was a contract 

ratified on July the 2nd? 

MR. BONSALL:  Or August 22nd, yes, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And if the arbitrator 

thought that it was in existence on July 2nd, then --

MR. BONSALL:  Then --

JUSTICE ALITO:  So that's an issue of 

contract formation; is it not?  In substance it is. 

MR. BONSALL:  If I may finish? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, sure. 

MR. BONSALL:  In substance it's contract 

formation if you can place yourself back in time on 

July 2nd or August 22nd.  It is moot and entirely 

academic when the parties ratify an agreement at some 

point in time and sign the contract in December. 

There is no question of contract formation in this 

case.  There’s only a question of contract

ratification during a very narrow period. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And that -- and that 

position depends upon your answer to Justice 

Ginsburg's question, that you are severing arbitration 

and the no-strike obligation? 

MR. BONSALL:  Under Drake Bakeries, we do 

not believe that we are severing at all.  We think 

that when an employer brings a breach of contract 

claim in Federal court under a collective bargaining 

agreement that contains a broad arbitration clause, 

their remedy is to seek that breach of contract and 

damage claim before the arbitrator.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. NUSSBAUM 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

There are three basic points that I would 

like to discuss with the Court this morning with 

regard to the section 301 issue. 

The first is that, in our view, the issue as 

to whether or not a tort claim can be brought under

301 begins and ends with the clear language of section 

301, which talks about suits for violation of 

contract. 

The second point I’d like to make is that 

allowing the tort action, as Granite Rock is urging, 

would work a big change in the structure that Congress 

has established by which it has decided that major 

issues of labor law, such as the weapons -- economic 

weapons that parties can use, should be decided by 

Congress through statute and by the National Labor 

Relations Board through the application of the 

statute. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you take the position 

that the cause of action for interference with a 

contract has been pre-empted insofar as State law is 

concerned? 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  That's, of course, not an 

issue in this case because it was never attempted --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is your position on 

that point? 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  The law in most of the 

circuits is that any case which involves the 

interpretation of a contract is pre-empted.  I'm not 

sure that this Court has --

your client take the position that that law is 

correct, that the Federal law has pre-empted State law 

actions for interference with -- with contract 

relations? 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  So then you 

are submitting to this Court that the purpose of the 

National Relation -- Labor Relations Act and its 

effect was to give immunity to unions for intentional 

interference with contractual relations? 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  No, that is not what I 

believe happened. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, isn't that the 

effect of your argument here? 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  No, I do not believe it is. 

Let me just first clarify something, that the pre­

emption of State torts is not dependent on section 

301.  State torts for interference with contract would 

have been pre-empted prior, under Garmon or Machinists 

pre-emption, because of those two doctrines, that it 

would interfere with conduct that is arguably 

prohibited or arguably protected, or that it is in an 

area unregulated by Congress.  But it doesn't leave 

the employer remediless in a situation like this, far 

from it.

This employer had a breach of contract 

action under the contract that it is pursuing --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not against the 

international? 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  Not against the 

international.  That's correct. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If it's true -- if it's 

true, which we can take for purposes -- for the 

current purpose, that the international really did 

induce the local to continue the strike, you said 

there's no action in State court because that's pre­

empted.  Unfair labor practice proceedings is against 

the local, not the -- not the international.  So 

there's nothing. 

It is in your view, you -- you said, well, 

there’s relief against the local, but there’s no 

remedy at all against the international, even if the 

allegation is true that this strike would never have 

occurred if it hadn't been for the pressure from the 

international. 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  No, I disagree.  There is an 

avenue that Granite Rock could have pursued but did 

not pursue, and that was to have filed a charge 

against the international with the National Labor 

Relations Board, which is the body that should be

making this precise decision as to whether this action 

by the international, an economic weapon, is 

permissible or is outlawed by the National Labor 

Relations Act.  Granite Rock chose not to file an 

unfair labor practice, but it could have. 

And we cited -- it's cited, actually, in the 

amicus brief by the AFL-CIO, the Paperworkers case, 

which demonstrates that an international union that 

interferes with the bargaining of local unions can 

itself be guilty of an unfair labor practice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I'd like 

your broader perspective as a representative of the 

international, because I think it's an important issue 

of labor policy.  If I think that the cause of actions 

available under 301(a) and the pre-emptive effect of 

301(a) ought to be coextensive, which -- which do you 

prefer, a broader 301(a) or a narrower pre-emption?  I 

think it makes a difference. 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  I'm not -- I'm sorry -- I'm 

not sure I understand the question. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think 301 -- I 

think whatever -- I don't think there should be a no­

man's land between you can bring your action under 301 

and it's pre-empted by 301. 

In other words, if -- if you are right, that

they cannot bring a tortious interference action under 

301, I don't think it should be pre-empted.  If you 

are wrong and they can bring it, then I can understand 

that it should be pre-empted. 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  Let me -- let me try to 

answer your question, as I'm -- as I'm understanding 

it.  First, the issue as to whether or not they could 

bring a 301 action under -- a tort action under 301, 

it was not pre-empted by 301. 

The question is whether 301 allows that type 

of claim at all, whether Congress intended that, and I 

think the language of the statute, violation of 

contract, indicates no, because a violation of 

contract, you can only violate a contract against --

bring an action against someone who --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it was pre-empted 

by 301, and they cannot bring it under 301? 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  Not a Federal court claim 

under 301. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  A State claim, a State tort 

action under 301, would be pre-empted.  What will 

happen then is -- is similar to what happened in the ­

- in the Rawson case.  What happens if a State court 

tort is brought?

It would be pre-empted because of complete 

pre-emption because it involves a contract and the 

interpretation of a contract.  That doesn't mean that 

the -- that it's gone.  What the Federal court does 

then is look at the claim and say, with what was pled 

in the complaint, does that fall within the parameters 

of 301?  And that's exactly what the Court did in 

Rawson.  It said the State court tort action was pre­

empted.  Now, we have to look and see, is there a 

claim under 301? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And so if Granite 

Rock brought this claim in State court, you would say 

it's pre-empted by 301? 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  Yes, but we'd be in exactly 

the same position. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And then, if they 

turned around and brought it in Federal court under 

301, you would say, no, there is no cause of action 

under 301? 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  Yes, you would get to the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay. 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  You would get to the same 

result, and the process is exactly the same.

with contract just can't be brought anywhere? 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  It -- it -- for tortious 

interference, no, you cannot -- you cannot bring that 

claim, but what I was saying before is, it doesn't 

leave them remediless, even with regard to a claim 

against the international because a charge could be 

filed --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They could always go 

to the NLRB --

MR. NUSSBAUM:  -- under 8(b)(3), and the 

board would decide, the -- the conduct in this 

context, and the board is always looking at the 

context of it, is this something which is prohibited, 

something which is protected, something which is 

unregulated?  And it is the board that Congress 

entrusted that -- that job to. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What remedies -- I'm 

sorry. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  What is the remedy --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Just before you finish, 

Chief, is it all right if you -- I'm not quite clear 

on how this pre-emption works, and I perhaps didn't 

have it right.  But imagine 301 had never been 

enacted.  I thought, had that never been enacted,

claims of interference with labor contracts, for 

example, might have been pre-empted anyway by the 

Labor Relations -- by the -- by the LMRA. 

I thought that did the basic pre-emptive 

job.  And then where it is pre-empted by the LMRA, 301 

creates an exception to the pre-emption, so that it 

isn't pre-empted, if you have a suit.  Now, my 

thinking is probably out-of-date and wrong, so I would 

like you to explain how it works. 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  I -- I think perhaps we are 

saying the same thing --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, because I think 

that your response to the Chief Justice's question, 

which is why I became uncertain, is that it is the 

LMRA -- not the LMRA at all that pre-empts tort 

actions and State activities that interfere with labor 

relations, as this might.  It is, rather, section 301 

itself that pre-empts it, and then it is odd because 

it pre-empts it, but it says, we won't give you any, 

and -- and that's why I became uncertain. 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  Let me try because I think I 

understand why I confused you.  I think, before 301, a 

tort action would have been pre-empted by either the 

doctrines of Garmon pre-emption or Machinists pre­

emption.

MR. NUSSBAUM:  No -- well, no, it would have 

been -- it would have been pre-empted in Federal court 

also.  It would have been within the primary 

jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board. 

That's where -- who it goes to. 

What I think has happened, Justice Breyer, 

is, since the enactment of 301, and particularly with 

this Court's doctrine of complete pre-emption for 

removal purposes, which I know there’s some debate 

about, when courts look at State law torts, they tend 

to look at 301, rather than going back to Garmon and 

Machinists pre-emption. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you, what is the 

remedy for an unfair labor practice?  Can they get a 

damage remedy? 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  Yes.  It would be, first, a 

cease-and-desist order. 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right. 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  And then a make-whole remedy.

sense because this is over, but what would the make­

whole remedy entail? 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  It would have to be a proof 

of damages that resulted from the unfair labor 

practice, from the unfair conduct, which, in this 

situation, would have been the interference into the 

bargaining process.  And how the NLRB would decide 

what the damages would be, for the international as 

opposed to the local union, I'm really not sure, but 

there is certainly the capacity under the NLRA for 

there to be a make-whole remedy. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you -- while saying that 

there’s no cause of action for this tort claim, you 

nonetheless say that the tort claim can be considered 

an unfair labor practice by the labor board.  Why does 

that make any sense? 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  Because what Congress -- what 

Congress did in 301 was to create limited jurisdiction 

for one type of claim and one type of claim only, 

violation of contract, breach of contract, an action

against the party that has the obligations under it. 

But that doesn't mean that there isn't any 

claim outside of 301 against a third party.  In this 

case, the third party is the international, and the 

claim could be made under the National Labor Relations 

Act.  The Paperworker case is an example. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if it's outside 301, 

where does pre-emption come from, Garmon? 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  The pre-emption -- well, in 

this case --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If I could interrupt just 

for a moment?  Allis-Chalmers was 301.  Allis-Chalmers 

says 301 covers contract, and, therefore, there’s a 

pre-emption.  So I take it you’re not talking about 

Allis-Chalmers pre-emption.  You are talking about 

Garmon or Machinists or something. 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  Well, both of them end up 

pre-empting a State law tort.  In this case --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if you say both of 

them, then we’re back where we started.  If 301 pre­

empts, then it should be within the ambit of 301's 

jurisdiction to the Federal court. 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  No, it pre-empts exactly for 

the purpose that this is an issue that should be 

decided by the regulatory agency, which Congress

entrusted with making exactly these decisions.  What 

economic weapons can an international union, can a 

parent employer use in a labor dispute? 

For the courts to be getting involved in 

that would be directly contrary to what Congress has 

been doing since 1935, of saying those decisions of 

economic weapons are not to be decided by courts 

applying common law tort principles.  We tried that, 

and we didn't like it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that 

applies in 301.  They’re not touching the contract. 

They’re not touching the parties to the contract. 

This is outside the contract.  So why should it be 

pre-empted? 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  It's -- well, again, the 

claim that they brought in Federal court was not pre­

empted.  It was a claim.  You looked at the claim. 

You read the complaint, and you said, you don't have a 

claim under 301 because it's not one for violation of 

contract, good-bye. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand that. 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  End of it.  The question that 

Justice Kennedy was -- was addressing to me was:  Does 

that leave them without any remedy?  And my answer is, 

no, it doesn't.  Aside from the remedies they have

against the local, they also had a potential remedy 

against the international through the National Labor 

Relations Act. 

And that -- that was the basic point that I 

was making. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Has -- has the board, in 

fact, declared a party who is not a party to the labor 

contract guilty of an unfair labor practice in prior 

cases? 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  The Paperworkers case that we 

cite -- the answer to your question is:  I'm not aware 

of a case.  The one we cited, the international was a 

party to the case.  However, it's clear that the fact 

that it was a party to the case was not the 

determinative factor, because what the NLRB did was 

instruct the international union to strike the pooled 

voting provision that was in the constitution. 

So they didn't say:  It's just no good in 

this case where you are a party to the contract.  They 

said:  You can't do it in any situation.  That clearly 

showed that the -- that the NLRB was focusing on the 

broader type of interference where they didn't have to 

be a party to the contract. 

But even if the NLRB -- and I want to stress 

this -- were to find that there wasn't a remedy under

the -- the facts of the particular case, that would 

simply mean that it is protected conduct under the 

National Labor Relations Act.  And the NLRB has made 

that decision, and it is the agency that should be 

doing it, rather than having courts get involved in 

this area of law making up rules, because when you 

talk about interference, as we know, the tort isn't 

for all interference; it's for improper interference. 

As the Associated General Contractors 

indicates, that would call into play the courts 

looking at various factors such as societal values, 

and that's exactly what Congress didn't intend. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

MR. NUSSBAUM:  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Mathiason, you

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARRY G. MATHIASON 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. MATHIASON:  Categorically, Your Honor, 

the NLRB has no jurisdiction over this case.  In 

footnote 18 of our reply brief, we recount the 

history.  That Paperworkers' case that was just 

referenced, the international was a signatory.  It was 

the exclusive bargaining representative, and, 

therefore, it had status under section 8(b)(3).

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Where is 

that again?  Footnote 18? 

MR. MATHIASON:  It’s footnote 18 of our 

reply brief, and we recount the history that was 

litigated both at the Ninth Circuit and beyond.  There 

is no remedy before the NLRB --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that may be, but then 

you might have -- then you’d have a remedy in State 

court.  I think the argument was that -- anyway, I 

have this argument:  301 doesn't pre-empt anything but 

the contract claim. 

Now, go bring your claim in State court. 

You might have a good claim in State court that isn't 

pre-empted.  Suppose one of their employees hit 

somebody over the head.  You’d have a great claim, and 

that isn't going to be pre-empted.  Now, yours might 

be, because there is a set of tort actions in State 

court that the labor acts pre-empt; in particular, 

those that involve conduct that is arguably protected 

or arguably forbidden by the labor acts. 

So, if you fall outside that category, you 

are not pre-empted.  And if you fall inside the 

category, you should be pre-empted; not by 301, but by 

the labor law which gave this kind of decision to the 

labor board to make.  What is -- is that argument

sensible?  Is it right?  What do you think? 

MR. MATHIASON:  Justice Breyer, there is a 

fundamental aspect of that that’s just not right, and 

that is that the conduct involved here was causing a 

violation of a contract.  The international took 

control of the local and forced the breach.  This is 

the -- this conduct would never be sanctioned if the 

jurisdiction of the NLRB had access to it, but the --

wisely, I think, the structure of the National Labor 

Relations Board is -- the 8(b)(3) remedy is against an 

exclusive agent.  They have to be the bargaining 

agent.  International is not the bargaining agent. 

And so, consequently, if we accepted the position 

of the international, you would create a no-man's zone 

that would apply throughout this country, whereby 

collective bargaining agreements entered into by 

locals could be destroyed, violated, by an 

international that would choose to impose itself on 

the local and cause that to happen.  Most 

internationals are responsible. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you seriously think 

that if that becomes a problem, that the NLRB won't 

declare it an unfair labor practice, or if they don't, 

that they won't go to Congress and say:  There is a 

no-man's land; now give a remedy like you did in 301?

You’re -- you’re begging Justice Breyer's 

question, which is:  If the law pre-empts this claim 

and it's doing so unjustly, who should make that 

determination?  Should it be you in a State court, you 

in a Federal court, or should it be in the first 

instance the NLRB who says this is or isn't an unfair 

labor practice, and if it rules it's not because the 

law doesn't cover it, or it's not authorized to issue 

this --

MR. MATHIASON:  Your -- Your Honor, I think 

it's well-established this is not an unfair labor 

practice, because you don't have jurisdiction under 

section 8(b)(3). 

What is suggested here is that maybe there 

is a no-man's zone that Congress should go to and 

regulate, but if you back up to 1947 and the passage 

of section 301, it's inconceivable that in passing 

that statute Congress intended to leave all 

international unions, or anybody that controlled a 

party, completely free from any reach of law. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why isn't it under 

8(b)(3)?  How does 8(b)(3) read?  What is it in 

8(b)(3) that would exclude this from the labor board's 

--   

MR. MATHIASON:  Well, it is not an exclusive

representative.  In other words, 8(b)(3) contemplates 

a bargaining obligation on the part of an exclusive 

representative, and the international is not in that 

capacity. 

They had control, but they aren’t designated 

in that manner, and there’s not one NLRB case in the 

history of that agency that deviates from that, or we 

would have been on it immediately.  And it just isn't 

there. 

So we were looking at our options, and State 

court appeared to be very clearly pre-empted by Allis-

Chalmers and a row of cases.  So that meant that the 

Federal law, section 301, as suggested by Lincoln 

Mills, would absorb. 

Please recognize that what we are seeking 

here -- the labels of tort and contract create, I 

think, a false distinction.  We are effectively 

bringing a contract action for violation of a 

contract.  The linkage is strictly to add in the 

international as the acting party. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
