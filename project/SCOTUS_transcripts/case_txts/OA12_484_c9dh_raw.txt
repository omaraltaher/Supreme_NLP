 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL L. JOSEFFER 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Our last case of the

Center v. Nassar.

12  the work in this case, and the plain language of the 
13  1991 amendments to Title VII do the rest. 
14
retaliation was the but-for cause of the challenged 
15
16  employment action, unless Congress has specifically 
17  relieved him of that burden by authorizing a mixed 
18  motive claim. 
19
20
21  claims that challenge -- that challenge discrimination 
22  based on membership in a protected class, not for 
23  retaliation claims, and, for that reason, a Title VII 
24  retaliation claim must prove but-for causation. 
25

 In the 1991 amendments, however, Congress 
authorized mixed motive treatment only for Title VII 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In the -- in the age

Alderson Reporting Company

discrimination context, there wouldn't be a difference 

between the discrimination claim itself and the 

retaliation. 


 They'd both be governed by the same 


not permit any mixed motive claims. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes. 
MR. JOSEFFER:  So, for this purpose in the 

standard, isn't that right, in the age discrimination 
area, the but-for causation.  Or am I wrong about that? 
 MR. JOSEFFER:  Yeah.  Well, the Age Act does

11  Age Act, everything is but-for, that's correct. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But your argument is 
12
13  that, in Title VII, where it's very clear what the 
14  standard Congress wants to have for the discrimination 
15
16  retaliation. 
17
18  traveled together, whatever the standard is for 
19  discrimination is the same for retaliation. 
20
21  extent, within Title VII, that is the question in the 
22  case, but what we have here is an amendment within Title 
23  VII.  It is first in Title VII, where it's set forth 
24  discrimination based on class and discrimination based 
on retaliation as separate types of discrimination, and 
25

claim, you're going to have a different standard for 

 So, in these statutes, I thought these two 

MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, that -- I mean, to some

this provision treats them differently. 
 It specifically limits the --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess the question, 

Mr. Joseffer, is, is there any other discrimination 
statute in which one can say that there's a different 
standard for proving retaliation than there is for 
proving substantive discrimination?  Because, as I sort 
of survey the universe, it seems as though whatever the 
standard is, the standard is the same for both, and 
there's no statute in which the two have been divorced.

10
 Am I wrong about that? 
11
 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, I mean -- the reason I 
12
13  answer the question -- I would agree, in the sense that 
14  if what we're talking about is but-for versus mixed 
motive, right?  It's -- it's but-for everywhere, except 
15
16  for within the meaning of this one amendment.  Congress 
17  clearly intended to make an exception here to the normal 
18  but-for, so the question is to the scope of it. 
19
20
21  a different standard of causation for a retaliation 
22  claim than we do for a substantive discrimination claim? 
23
24  everywhere, except for this one amendment. 
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'll try again. 
Is there any other statute in which we have 

 MR. JOSEFFER:  No, because it's but-for 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, is there -- I mean, 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

it's but-for everywhere. 

Official 

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Not -- I can't point to 

anything specific because what we had, right, 
was -- there was -- I can't point to anything specific 

 Is there even any time at which whatever the 

standard that applied -- you know, pre-Gross, is there 
ever a moment and is there ever a statute in the history 
of antidiscrimination laws, where there has been a 
divorce -- a different standard for retaliation than for 
substantive discrimination? 

1 
2
3 
4 
5
6 
7 
8
9 
10
11  on that. 
 Up until the statute, the whole point of 
12
13  Gross, right, is that the statute carves out a narrow 
14  exception from but-for and --
15
16  Gross was a couple of years ago.  It said but-for covers 
17  the -- the ADA and outside Title VII -- you know, we've 
18  had a lot of discrimination statutes since 1964.  We've 
19  had a lot of different standards applying to those 
20
 And you're coming in here and asking for the 
21
22  first time, in all of those many decades, that we should 
23  divorce the retaliation claim from the substantive 
24  discrimination claim and make them follow two different 
25

discrimination statutes since 1964. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  All I'm saying is -- you know, 

standards; is that correct? 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. JOSEFFER:  No.  And the -- I mean, the 

If we're talking about other aspects of 

retaliation and other types of discrimination, there are 
differences in the statutes. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Did this court ever hold 

that the Price Waterhouse framework applied to retaliation 
claims? 

the sense that, if we're talking about but-for versus 

mixed, right, yes, that's a creature of this specific 

statute we're talking about.

7

10
11
12  backdrop here, which is the whole point of Gross, right, 
13  is that, as of Price Waterhouse, we had -- you know, a 
14  somewhat confusing and murky alignment of opinions, 
15
16  this -- interpreted only at Section 2a, the 
17  discrimination based on class provision. 
18
19  this amendment to specifically identify what it wanted 
to do about mixed motive.  And Gross says that, except 
20
21  for when Congress has specifically called for this mixed 
22  motive treatment, it's but-for, is the holding of Gross. 
23
24  mean, there are different ways of looking at it, but one 
25

would be to say that I'm not aware of any statute that 

that -- and I think everyone agrees with 

 Then, two years later, Congress came in with 

Official 

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, I mean, yes and no, in 


 And when we look to this provision -- I

has a specific retaliation provision, where this Court 
has construed discrimination based on class, generally, 
to encompass retaliation because that would make the 
retaliation provision here in 3a absolutely surplusage. 

It would make the other statutory 

cross-references to 3a surplusage because you'd be 
taking the specific retaliation provision within Title 
VII and subsuming it within a general treatment of 
discrimination based on -- on class, race, and so forth. 
And this basic structure of these provisions 

1

4 
5

7

10
11  of Title VII is that, when Congress wants to refer to 
12  all Title VII discrimination claims, it will refer as it 
13  did in subsection 2n to a claim of employment 
14  discrimination, generally. 
15
16  to an unlawful employment practice, which would cover 
17  the waterfront, but when it wants to cover a specific 
18  subset, it refers to retaliation, as spelled out in 
19  3(a), or to discrimination based on membership in one of 
20
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I somehow 
21
22  lost what you were saying.  Isn't the law -- and our 
23  presumption in Jackson -- that, when we talk about 
24  discrimination on the basis of race, that it includes 
25

It will refer as it did, also, in Section 2, 

the five protected classes.  And here --

retaliation, generally? 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, the reason -- well, 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, different because 

it was the beginning of this sort of endeavor on 

creating a statute. 


what Jackson says, of course, then is that Title VII is 
vastly different.  And the --

1
2 
3 
4
5
6 
 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, the distinction that 

7
Jackson draws and, also, that Gomez-Perez draws -- you 

8 
know, expressly, in distinguishing this type of 

9 
situation, is if you have a broad general prohibition on 
10
11  discrimination or discrimination based on race, without 
12  more -- without more specificity, the Court will presume 
13  that that would include retaliation. 
14
15
16  describes, in detail, the different types of prohibited 
17  discrimination, including, specifically, retaliation, 
18  this Court has never overridden that specific statutory 
19  text to put one of those specifically broken-out types 
20
21  discrimination based on race, which is why --
22
23  difference it makes. 
24
25

 But, when you have a statute, like this one, 

that specifically singles that -- specifically 

of discrimination into another more general one, such as 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm -- I'm not sure what 

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, because, otherwise, you 

are taking the --

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, other than in 

the outcome you want here. 

 MR. JOSEFFER:  As a matter -- well, I mean, 

as a matter of statutory interpretation, right, which 
then drives the outcome, the difference is that if -- if 
you treat a specific retaliation reference or provision 
as being subsumed within a more general one, a 
discrimination based on race, for example, you are 
treating the specific retaliation reference to be 
surplusage, to have no effect and to not need to be 

1

3
4 
5
6 
7 
8 
9 
10
11  there. 
12
13  cross-references to it as also being surplusage, which 
14  is why, when Congress does speaks more directly, this 
Court's never overridden -- never said that it will take 
15
16  a specific retaliation provision and treat it like it's 
17  not there and toss it and -- based on race, for example. 
18
19  general cases they cite, those are our cases because 
20
21  different for this very reason. 
22
23  Title VII is written before any of these cases come 
24  along.  So Title VII is written, and it says we have an 
a substantive antidiscrimination provision, and 
25

Jackson specifically says that Title VII is vastly 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Joseffer, I mean, 

 And that's why -- I mean, that's why those 

 And you're treating the other statutory 

anti --

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

we have a retaliation provision. 

Official 

 And then the Court starts issuing cases. 

 And so then, in 1991, Congress comes back, 

And it says, by the way, you actually don't need both. 
One will do the job for you because one includes the 
other.  And that's in Sullivan, and that's in Jackson, 
and that's in Gomez-Perez, and I'm sure I am missing a 
few.  Three, four, five times, the Court says this. 

1 
2
3 
4 
5
6 
7 
8
and it says, we want to make some amendments, what do we 
9 
have to do?  Do we have to amend both the anti -- the 
10
11  substantive provision and the retaliation provision? 
12  Well, no, we have been told five times that, as long as 
13  we say one, it means both.  And so that's what Congress 
14  does in 1991. 
MR. JOSEFFER:  There are a couple -- if you 
15
16  just look at '91, there are a few reasons that we know 
17  from the '91 that doesn't work.  One is, at almost at 
18  the same time in 1991, Congress enacted the Americans 
19  With Disabilities Act, where it, again, separately broke 
out discrimination based on disability and retaliation, 
20
21  treated them separately.  So Congress hadn't forgotten 
22  that it was treating them differently. 
23
24  Rights Act of 1991, Congress specifically 
25

cross-referenced both the part of Title VII that 

 Also, in this very provision, the Civil 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 I mean, I think we presume that anyhow, but we 

know it from the actual statutory text of the '91 -- of 
the '91 Act.  And then --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, it seems that the 

contains the general provision and the part of VII, 

Section 3, that contains retaliation.  So it's 

specifically dealing with these separate provisions, 

acknowledging that it has in fact, presumptively, at 

least, has read them and understands the distinction. 

1 
2 
3 
4 
5
6
7 
8 
9
overall purpose of the '91 Act was to overrule decisions 
10
11  of this Court that Congress thought had not interpreted 
12  Title VII properly. 
13
14  motivating factor -- a motivating factor, that is more 
plaintiff-friendly than the -- than the standard that 
15
16  the Court declared in -- in Price Waterhouse? 
17
18  that -- that the motivating factor provision governs, 
19  it's more plaintiff-friendly, yes. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So it's -- it's really 
20
21  odd to think that, in wanting to go beyond what we did 
22  in Price Waterhouse, the Court meant to set up an 
23  entirely different standard for -- for retaliation. 
24
25

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, that was, basically, 
the same argument that this Court rejected in Gross, 

 And am I right that what they put about 

 MR. JOSEFFER:  For -- for those cases 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

in -- in that Gross involved another absolutely 
identical statutory provision, that was lifted, in fact, 
deliberately lifted verbatim, from Title VII to be put 
into the Age Act.  And what this Court held, basically, 
it was that, look, whatever Congress's overall purpose 
or general purpose behind the 1991 act, as a whole, 
right, what we have to do is look at what it actually 
did, what lines it actually drew in any given situation. 

1 
2 
3 
4 
5
6 
7 
8 
 And here --
9
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, even looking --
10
11  let's look at what they actually did.  If we look at 
12  this (m) section, it says, "except as otherwise provided 
13  in this subchapter."  I take it that would include 
14  retaliation as well, in the subchapter. 
MR. JOSEFFER:  Yes. 
15
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  "An unlawful employment 
16
17  practice is established."  And then, when we go over to 
18  the retaliation provision, it says, "It shall be an 
19  unlawful employment practice." 
So why doesn't that suggest that the -- "an 
20
21  employment practice" under the retaliation provision is 
22  the same as "an employment practice" under this --
 MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, the -- under Title VII, 
23
24  there are basically three different ways to establish an 
25

unlawful employment practice.  One is the general 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

provision for discrimination because of membership in a 
class.  One is because of retaliation.  And this is 
another one. 

 So this defines, basically, a third way of 

establishing whether an employment practice is unlawful. 
And what it says is that any employment practice that is 
motivated by one of the five listed factors is an 
unlawful employment practice.  So this is why it all 
keeps coming back to do those five factors, those five 
motivations, do they or do they not include retaliation? 

1 
2 
3 
4
5
6 
7 
8 
9 
10
11  We agree with the Government that that's what it all 
12  comes down to. 
 And, as to that question, I mean, there was 
13
14  discussion, earlier today, about -- you know, the weight 
15
16  squarely addressed this.  They've all agreed with us 
17  because Title VII's text and structure are so clear, 
18  that Title VII -- and that's what -- that was the basis 
19  for the distinction of Title VII in Gomez-Perez --
20
21  provisions of the Age Act, made the same point. 
22
23  different for this reason --
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I can't understand you very 
well.  Could you -- maybe you have to lift up your mike, 

Excuse me.  Gomez-Perez distinguished the identical 

of authority.  I mean, nine courts of appeals have 

 Jackson, again, said Title VII was vastly 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

or maybe you have to speak more slowly.  But I'm having 

an awful time following you. 


 MR. JOSEFFER:  I apologize, Your Honor. 

 I was just saying the basic point is that, 


as Jackson and Gomez-Perez indicated, the specific 
controls the general.  And, when Congress breaks out 
retaliation, that's a different subset of discrimination 
that's not then subsumed within discrimination based on 
class.

10
11  retaliation provisions and making them surplusage, which 
12  is why all of the many courts of appeals that have looked 
13  at this unanimously agreed with us. 
14
15
16  Court has already disagreed with the EEOC.  The EEOC has 
17  two footnotes and informal guidance that say that, under 
18  the 1991 amendments, retaliation claims can be proven 
19  under a mixed motive theory for any of the statutes that 
20
21  Gross. 
22
23  contain -- what it contains, basically, is -- you know, 
24  policy analysis of why they would like that to be the 
result, but no textual analysis whatsoever.  There's --
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The EEOC didn't. 
MR. JOSEFFER:  Right.  Well, the -- this 

the EEOC administers, which is clearly contrary to 

Otherwise, you are reading out the 

 And that informal guidance does not

so the guidance in one doesn't get deference because 
it's contrary to the plain text of the statute, as 
numerous courts of appeals have recognized. 

Sullivan, that could have possibly led Congress to a 

 And, two, in terms of its power to persuade, 
I mean, this Court has already rejected it, and, even as 
applied to Title VII retaliation -- you know, courts of 
appeals have unanimously rejected it as well because 
there is just policy there.  There's no actual textual 
analysis.

JUSTICE ALITO:  As of 1991 -- well, 
10
11  Gomez-Perez and Jackson came after 1991, right? 
12
13
14  any case -- any decision of this Court other than 
15
16  conclusion that the general prohibition against 
17  discrimination included a prohibition of retaliation? 
 MR. JOSEFFER:  I think you are right about 
18
19  the timing.  And Sullivan was so general that -- I don't 
know that the law was a whole lot different in 1991 than 
20
21  it had been in '64 on this.  But--
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but, Mr. Joseffer, in 
22
23  CBOCS, we said that, because of Sullivan, alone -- just 
24  because of Sullivan, there was no need for Congress to 
exclude explicit language about retaliation.  In other 
25

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Yes, the others before. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  So, as of 1991, was there 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

words, we -- we said Sullivan made the point clear. 

 Now, Justice Alito was right.  After that, 

it goes on.  We have done it many more times after 1991. 
But we have said that Sullivan, itself, made the point 
clear that you did not need explicit language about 
retaliation. 

1 
2
3 
4 
5
6 
 MR. JOSEFFER:  Right, but the -- and the 
7
main point is the one I was making earlier, that, in 
8 
1991 itself, Congress was continuing to distinguish 
9 
between retaliation and discrimination based on class 
10
11  and in provisions of this Act and also in the almost 
12  simultaneously enacted Americans With Disabilities Act. 
 But there has been another provision in the 
13
14  Disabilities Act that treats retaliation and 
discrimination based on -- on disability is 
15
16  significantly different, in terms of the remedies that 
17  are available for the two.  So, even at the same time, 
18  Congress has, elsewhere, also been distinguishing 
19  between the two. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, here's what 
20
21  you're -- this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's 
22  question -- but here's what you're asking us to accept, 
23  Mr. Joseffer:  Congress comes along, in 1991, in a world 
24  in which there has -- there have never been separate 
25

standards for retaliation and substantive 

17
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

discrimination. 


Official 

 Congress is trying to codify and make even 


 They do that, they follow the --


essentially, the drafting manuals that we have given 

them in Sullivan.  And you're saying, well, no.  What 

stronger the Price Waterhouse decision, right? 

They -- you know, they say, basically, we like Price 

Waterhouse, but it's kind of confused, and the court was 

kind of fractured, we're going to really put it into 

place legislatively.

Here --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Gross is talking about 
outside of Title VII.  And -- and whatever might be said 
of Gross outside of Title VII, here, where Congress is 
specifically trying to make Title VII conform with Price 
Waterhouse, with the backdrop of our legislative

11  drafting instructions and with the backdrop of never

14  you want to be? 
This would be, like -- talk about elephants 
15
16  in mouse holes or talk about -- you know, we can take up 
17  all our cliches, the dog that didn't bark -- you know, 
18  Congress doesn't do things like this without saying 
19  something. 
20
21  because, in this statute, as in others, it distinguishes 
22  between discrimination based on membership in a class 
23  and retaliation, but it wants to cover all of it, it 
24  uses a more general phrase.  When it wants to cover one 
25

of them, it says one.  Here, it said one. 

MR. JOSEFFER:  Well, first off, it did

 Well, if that negative inference applies in 

other statutes, it would sure apply within the same 
statute that -- that this provision exists in and is 

 But, beyond that, again, in terms of the 
backdrop, though -- I mean, the -- the whole point of 
Gross is that you -- you stick to the plain language of 
'91, and that's -- that's where mixed motive treatment 
is permitted, and, also, elsewhere there's a -- there's a 
negative inference elsewhere that is so strong that, as 
you said, it applies even in other statutes.

 This provision then applies to the five 
practices and leaves out the two types of protected

 MR. JOSEFFER:  Yes.  And, textually -- but 
it then describes seven different unlawful employment

16  is the secondary of them.  Second, it sweeps -- by its 
17  nature, retaliation sweeps so much broader, well outside 
18  of the traditional workplace, that while Congress was 
19  thinking about jettisoning traditional burdens of proof 
and relieving a plaintiff of the -- of the traditional 
20

And if you then flip the burden, so the 

plaintiff doesn't have prove its own claim, the 
plaintiff can point to the timing of his own complaint, 
the inevitable employment action that would have happened

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. LAUTEN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 MR. LAUTEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

Congress to have created two causation standards under 
the same statute in 1991 without saying anything about 
it at all.  There are three good reasons why Congress 
had not to amend e-3(a) in 1991.

14  included retaliation.  So, in 1991, Congress knew that

 Point number 2 --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why did they -- why did

18  they include it in a separate section?  If they knew

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand that.  Why did 

retaliation? 

 MR. LAUTEN:  Well, when Congress added e-2 

28
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 And the third reason is imagine if they had 

e-3(a) because there were policy -- the Burlington 
Northern case, for example, where this Court held that 
retaliation is considerably broader, that provision, 
where -- where the Court held that retaliation in 
Burlington actually went beyond conditions in the 
workplace, that was the second reason.

9 
We would be here saying, well, why did they do that, if 
10
11  they had already knew in Sullivan, since 1964, why would 
12  they amend the Act? 
13
14  Congress could have very well put an e-2(m) under this 
15
16  individual's race, color, religion, sex, national 
17  origin, but what it did was it said a complaining party 
18  must demonstrate -- and then it lists those things.  And 
19  then it says, "for any employment practice." 
20
21  an unlawful employment practice.  So the text of e-2(m), 
22  which, again, was a new provision altogether -- Congress 
23  did not go in and amend e-2(a) through e-2(d), as it 
24  easily could have done, but it created a new provision.

 MR. LAUTEN:  Not at all, Your Honor, and 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I know it's not going 

to go away.  Let me give you this example -- this 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I take -- I take you back to 

your opening statement, that there is no reason why 
Congress might have wanted to have a different standard 
for substantive discrimination and retaliation. 

Would you disagree with the proposition that 
the motivating factor analysis creates special problems 
in the retaliation -- in the retaliation context? 

1
2 
3 
4

this is the reason -- and this Court needs to keep this 
9 
in mind.  Motivating factor causation is not going away 
10
11  no matter what this Court holds today.  It's in e-2(m), 
12  it is going to apply to substantive discrimination. 
13  With respect to how it's submitted --
14
15
16  hypothetical.  An employee thinks that he is about to be 
17  fired.  And let's -- let's suppose that the employer 
18  really has a good, nondiscriminatory reason for firing 
19  the employee.  On the eve of that, the employee makes a 
spurious charge of discrimination and does it in a way 
20
21  to maximize the embarrassment to the employer. 
 Then the employer formally makes the 
22
23  decision to terminate the employee.  And what the 
24  employer says at that time is, we were going to fire 
25

so-and-so anyway for all these other reasons, but, now, 

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

because he has done this and really embarrassed us 
publicly, we are really happy that we are going to fire 
him. 

 Now, how does that work out under the 

motivating factor analysis? 

 MR. LAUTEN:  Very easily because, in that 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that correct?  Can't 

situation, the employer wouldn't even have to prove the 
affirmative defense because the employee wouldn't be 
able to prove a violation of the Act because it was a 
spurious claim.  That's point number 1.  But point

15
16  retaliation claim under e-2(m) without proving, first, a 
17  violation of the Act, and that is the distinction 
18  Congress made in e-2(m) for Price Waterhouse, whereas 
19  Price Waterhouse held there was no violation, as long as 
20

22  prove a motivating factor and a violation of the Act, 
23  only then do you get to the affirmative defense. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I really don't

the Court doesn't even get to that issue because the 

statute applies.  If e-2(m) applies, then motivating 

factor causation applies.  If it doesn't apply, if the 

Court rejects our statutory argument, then, by default, 
we are under the Price Waterhouse framework, and 
motivating factor causation should apply.

 MR. LAUTEN:  There is nothing in the 

1 
2
legislative history in 1991 that supports that.  In 
3 
fact, I would argue the contrary.  When Congress passed 
4 
Section 101 in 1991, which is 42 U.S.C. 1981, in that 
5
provision where it overruled Patterson v. McLean and the 
6 
Court held that retaliation was encompassed within the 
7 
substantive discrimination provision, which is what the 
8 
Court held in CBOCS v. Humphries, in the House bill that 
9 
accompanied the Act, it said that Congress intended for 
10
11  retaliation to apply to Section 101, but it's not in the 
12  section at all that became 101 that was in CBOCS. 
13
14  this Court held the absence of retaliation provision 
15
16  argument that retaliation was included, even though 
17  Congress had a separate anti-retaliation provision in 
18  the private sector.

 I want to start, Justice Alito, with your

As this Court recognized in Clark County,

the courts of appeals have uniformly, in opposition

cases, required there to be a reasonable good-faith

belief that the discrimination actually occurred.  So,

if we are talking about truly frivolous claims, I know I

am going to get fired -- you know, I might as well say 
10
11  my boss is -- you know, sexually harassing me, that's 
12  not going to happen; those cases are going to be weeded 
13  out.

could certainly raise on partial summary judgment that 

would severely limit the remedies available. 


 The other point I would make is it does 

still needs to be a motivating factor.  It needs to 
actually play a role in the employment decision, and so 
that is the standard.  And it's a standard that -- you

to substantive discrimination claims.

is a means of proving an unlawful employment practice. 

 And we know, when you look at 3(a), which is 

on page 17a of our brief, that retaliation is an 
unlawful employment practice.  Congress used that phrase 
"unlawful employment practice" in Subsection (m).  It's 
an unadorned phrase.  It didn't limit it.  It didn't say

16  that race is a motivating factor in an employment 
17  decision that is based on retaliation when you've 
18  complained about race discrimination. 
19
20
21  Title VII.  And so the only argument, I believe, that 
22  Petitioner is making is that there are things elsewhere 
23  in the statute that might make you think otherwise here. 
24
25

 And we would argue that none of them --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but under -- under 

 And so the language of (m), the plain 

language, clearly encompasses the retaliation claims in

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  I think that defines what 

that analysis, you don't need the final clause on page 
17a of your brief of 3, "because he has opposed."  Race 
is enough. 

1 
2

4
the protected activity is.  I don't think it is any 

5
different than in Jackson or Gomez-Perez.  In those 

6 
cases, it was a general discrimination provision, but, 

7 
once retaliation claims are recognized, there -- there 

8 
still actually needs to be protected activity.  There 

9 
has to be opposition.  There has to be participation of 
10
11  some sort.  And so I don't think it's any different in 
12  that respect. 
 Justice Scalia, you were talking about 
13
14  g-2(a), and, if I could just take a moment on that, 
because that is one of the arguments that Petitioner is 
15
16  making, my colleague made the point that it was adopted 
17  by the 1964 Congress.  It was adopted before Sullivan. 
18  And so if I could focus on the 1991 Congress 
19  that -- that enacted both subsection (m) and subsection 
g-2(b), that Congress was acting in light of Sullivan. 
20
21
22  knowledge of Sullivan, because that's exactly what this 
23  Court said in CBOCS.  CBOCS involved Section 101, 
24  rather, of the 1991 Act; this involves Section 107 of 
25

 And we know it was legislating with full 

the 1991 Act. 

53
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 And it's a common rule of statutory 


 So we know that, when Congress was writing 
(m) and when it was writing g-2(b), it knew, because of 
Sullivan, that it didn't need extra words.  It didn't 
need redundant words.  It didn't have to say, "under 
Section 2000e-2 and Section 2000e-3."  It could simply 

say exactly what it said in (m), and that would do the 

trick.

interpretation that you don't add extra words if you 

9 
don't need them.  And so what Congress did in (m) is it 
10
11  adopted exactly what words it needed to effectuate its 
12  purpose, which is to have one causation standard, a 
13  motivating factor standard available, with respect to 
14  all intentional discrimination claims under the statute. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the maxim that you 
15
16  don't add words where you don't need them doesn't --
17  doesn't help your case.  It hurts your case because, in 
18  the other provision that was carried over from the prior 
19  law, you -- you were making a nullity of the -- the 
20
21  of race, of -- you know, retaliation.

24  what happened in 1991, Congress didn't add that

addition after referring to discrimination on the basis

 To answer that question, it's important --

Official 

 And I think it's completely reasonable, when 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
 Mr. Joseffer, you have three minutes 

Congress is faced with a choice of deleting language 
that had been there for 25 years, that wasn't a problem, 
it's just, at worst, was redundant, chose to leave it in 
place, lest any negative inference arise from the 
deletion, and simply legislate, perspectively, in 
subsection (m), in g-2(b), based on the new 
understanding that the Court adopted in Sullivan.

17  simple legislative drafting rules or interpretive 
18  principles.  The first is, in -- from Gross, we know 
19  that Congress doesn't relieve the plaintiff of the 
traditional burden of proof, unless it specifically 
20
21  indicates so.  And so then we talk to subsection (m), 
22  where the relevant bases are the litany of race, color, 
23  sex, religion, and national origin. 
24
25

MR. JOSEFFER:  Thank you. 
 This case seems to boil down to two very 

 So the second interpretive principle is, 

then, does that litany here encompass -- you know,

 When Congress breaks it out, the surplusage 

complaining about unlawful conduct and participating in 
an investigation, which are the protected conduct for 
purposes of retaliation.  That principle comes straight 
out of Jackson and Gomez-Perez, that, when Congress 
broadly refers to discrimination on the basis of race in 
the statute, without greater specificity, the Court will 
read retaliation in.

canon -- and I agree with Justice Scalia, I really 
9 
didn't understand why they were talking about that --
10
11  and, also, the general canon is the same canon, which 
12  is, put differently, is that specific provisions -- you 
13  know, control over general ones; they're not subsumed 
14  within them. 
15
16  speaking more specifically, it's speaking more 
17  specifically.  Here, that tells Congress, very clearly, 
18  how to amend these statutes when it wishes to, which it 
19  does all the time, and how the courts -- and how lower 
20
21
22  especially clear because the same subsection 2 within 
23  Title VII, when it wants to refer to all types of 
24  employment discrimination, it will say, "a claim of 
25

employment discrimination."  And, by the way, the 1991 

That tells us that, when Congress is 

courts should construe them. 

 In addition, Title VII, as a whole, is 

56
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Congress put that provision in there. 

Official 

 So this Congress knew how to say, "any claim 

 They're asking you to read various statutory 

of employment discrimination," as it did so in 
subsection (n), which comes right after this one. 
Congress will also say, "an unlawful employment 
practice," when it's referring to all of them, but, when 
it wants to specifically refer to one subset or another, 
it does so.  That's a clear, logical, coherent reading 
of the statute as a whole that every court of appeals to 
consider the question has adopted.

12  provisions to be surplusage, and there's simply no 
13  reason to do so, especially because -- looking just at 
14  1991, Congress, at that point, was not saying, oh, in 
light of Jackson, we can now just speak more generally, 
15
16  because it, specifically, in 1991, cross-referenced the 
17  anti-retaliation provision of Title VII when it wanted 
18  to, and it specifically used broader phrases like "a 
19  claim of employment discrimination," when it wanted to. 
20
21  Gross -- or much of the point of Gross was to replace a 
22  totally unworkable and confusing regime with something 
23  that is clear and straightforward, you've done that. 
24  And the question, now, is whether to retreat back into a 
25

jurisprudential morass where, within the very same 

And especially since the whole point of 

57
 

Alderson Reporting Company

statute, the drafting rules this Court has otherwise 
articulated, no longer apply. 

 The final point I'd make is that, yeah, 
there's this question about are -- are we treating --
you know, retaliation and -- and substantive 
discrimination differently within one statute, and the 
answer is, well, yes, as Congress did.  The other way of 
looking at it is they want to treat retaliation 
differently in this statute than it's treated in every 
other statute.
