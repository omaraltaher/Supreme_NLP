CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 00-957, Kansas v. Michael Crane.


General Stovall. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARLA J. STOVALL


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. STOVALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and


may it please the Court:


The Kansas Supreme Court has erroneously read


this Court's decision in Kansas v. Hendricks as requiring


a showing that a potentially sexually violent predator


cannot control his behavior and that such a requirement


has supplemented the two requisites for civil commitment


that this Court has approved in and since the Addington


case.  Those two requirements, as you know, are mental


illness and dangerousness. 


The volitional impairment that the Kansas


Supreme Court has ruled was constitutionally required for


civil commitment ignores the fact that psychological


disorders, such as antisocial personality, can impair an


individual in behavior, cognitive, perceptual, emotional,


and even intellectual capacities. 


This Court has never indicated that there's


anything constitutionally significant about a volitional

impairment. 


QUESTION:  There was a good deal of reference in


our Hendricks opinion to the -- to the apparent fact that


the person there had what was volitionally impaired. 


You're saying that was descriptive rather than essential


to the holding? 


MS. STOVALL:  I'm saying it was descriptive. 


Mr. Hendricks had apparently, and according to himself


only, an inability to control his own behavior.  So, when


the majority wrote about Mr. Hendricks, they used that


kind of a description. 


QUESTION:  Well, but we also relied on prior


authority that made some reference to lack of control. 


I 

don't think that what was done by the court below was


totally off the wall in light of what was said in our


prior cases.  What if there is some element but perhaps


not to that extent?  How would you draw the line?


MS. STOVALL:  Well, if this Court says that


there needs to be some volitional impairment displayed, we


would suggest that it just be merely some impairment.  To


have a total impairment is something that the


psychiatrists will even tell us is an impossible standard


to show. 


QUESTION:  You think that's the standard adopted


in the court below that we're reviewing?

 MS. STOVALL:  I do. 


QUESTION:  Total impairment? 


MS. STOVALL:  I do. 


QUESTION:  Do you acknowledge that lack of


ability to control one's unlawful conduct and volitional


impairment are one and the same thing? 


MS. STOVALL:  No, I do not. 


QUESTION:  Suppose I'm delusional and -- and I


think that -- that people I see are Satan.  I'm fully able


to control myself and -- and do not attack people who are


not Satan, but I think that some people are Satan. 


MS. STOVALL:  Your Honor, that's --


QUESTION:  Do you call that a lack of volitional


control or delusion? 


MS. STOVALL:  I would consider that delusional


and not a -- a lack of volitional control.  And the


problem with the Kansas Supreme Court's decision is that


it says the only thing that we consider is volitional


impairment, but there are many kinds of impairments


individuals have that are the result of their mental


disorder, and so the Kansas court is necessarily limiting


the psychiatric diagnosis to say only volitional


impairment --


QUESTION:  What is there -- I thought there


could be cognitive impairments.  I think Justice Scalia

has described one.  There could be emotional impairments.


MS. STOVALL:  Yes, sir. 


QUESTION:  And there could be volitional


impairments.  Now, is there any other category? 


MS. STOVALL:  Perceptual, intellectual.  There


-- there are many kinds that are talked about within the


psychiatric material. 


QUESTION:  But are these --


QUESTION:  Is there any kind relevant here other


than volition?


MS. STOVALL:  Yes.  I think they all are, all of


those that we mentioned, and perhaps even those --


QUESTION:  Are relevant in this case? 


MS. STOVALL:  Not -- yes.


QUESTION:  I'm saying is there any one relevant


to the particular individual at issue here other than


volition.


MS. STOVALL:  I don't believe psychiatrists can


tell us what it is that -- what kind of impairment Mr.


Crane has.  They're not -- the -- the literature will say


that psychiatrists can't tell whether or not Justice


Scalia was acting because he's hallucinating or because


it's some other volitional impairment, if it's an


irresistible impulse, if you will, whether it's emotional,


perceptual, intellectual.  They can't tell.  They can't

get in somebody's mind.  And what they have to do then is


simply rely on what the individual says. 


Mr. Crane told this -- the court below -- he


told the experts below, rather.  He didn't testify.  He


told the experts below that he could control his behavior. 


Mr. Hendricks had testimony that you refer to in the


Hendricks decision that said he couldn't control his


behavior.  So, because the psychiatrist can't make a


determination objectively, we're left with a potential


predator telling us who applies -- who's eligible for this


law and who isn't. 


The other point I would make to this Court is


that Mr. Hendricks said I can't control my urge to molest


children.  But he could.  He never molested little


children in front of their parents, never in front of his


wife, never in front of law enforcement --


QUESTION:  Well, but that's not the premise that


Hendricks proceeded upon.  Now you're -- now you're saying


that Hendricks rested on an insecure factual assumption.


MS. STOVALL:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  I don't


understand. 


QUESTION:  Well, you're -- are you trying to say


that what we said in Hendricks was -- was dictum or --


MS. STOVALL:  I --


QUESTION:  -- just was -- was wrong in the -- in

the context of that case? 


MS. STOVALL:  I'm certainly not saying you were


wrong, Your Honor.  I'm saying that you did not create a


third constitutional standard, that the impairments that


I --


QUESTION:  Well, was the Court under some


misimpression as -- as to Hendricks' ability to control


himself? 


MS. STOVALL:  There wasn't evidence before this


Court that would say whether or not Hendricks suffered


from a volitional impairment or not.  All we have is what


he himself said. 


QUESTION:  But then, it seems to me, that we're


back to square one.  I -- one reading of Hendricks -- and


tell me if this is wrong -- is that we want to find some


measure of determining how dangerous this person is to


society because that's in the statute.  And because many


criminals are -- have personality disorders and are


dangerous to society, we want to narrow it somewhat.  So,


we -- so the Court added this volitional control aspect.


Is that a fair reading of Hendricks?


MS. STOVALL:  Your Honor, I don't believe it is


because Mr. Hendricks, in particular, didn't suffer from a


personality disorder.  He had what is classified under the


Kansas statute as an abnormality mentally and that was

being pedophilia.  The Kansas statute specifically says


there are two kinds of impairment that we could look at. 


They're emotional as well as volitional. 


QUESTION:  Well, is the test -- are there


different requirements if you proceed based on a


personality disorder than if you proceed from a mental


abnormality? 


MS. STOVALL:  Well, the Kansas court seems to


think there is because there is no definition in the


statute of a personality disorder.  It wasn't defined --


QUESTION:  Well, I was -- I was suggesting that


you thought there was based on the answer you gave to me.


MS. STOVALL:  No, Your Honor.  What --


QUESTION:  You think they're both one and the


same.  You have no different requirements for mental


abnormality or personality disorder.  In -- in either


case, the test for civil commitment is the same.


MS. STOVALL:  Based on the Kansas Supreme Court


decision or based on the --


QUESTION:  Based on what you think the law ought


to be and what the -- and how the statute is properly


interpreted. 


MS. STOVALL:  We believe there is no


distinction.  There should be no distinction between


mental abnormality and personality disorder, that as long

as we -- we show that mental condition and the


dangerousness, that there should not be a distinction.


QUESTION:  So, anybody with a personality


disorder that's a danger to himself or others can be --


can be civilly committed regardless of volitional control. 


That's -- that's your position. 


MS. STOVALL:  Right.  They have to have some


sort of impairment in order to have the diagnosis of a


personality disorder.  That's part and parcel of a


diagnosis of the DSM.  But it would be our position it's


not limited to volitional control, but could be that


laundry list of emotional capacity -- emotional


impairment, which is even what the Kansas statute


contemplates for mental --


QUESTION:  -- the DSM that you're mentioning, if


you look at the definition of personality disorder and


they say pick three out of a list of seven, you could pick


out habitually doesn't work, doesn't pay debts, is


reckless, irritable.  That's something -- I mean, it's


considerably less than what is defined as an abnormality


like pedophilia.  There are a lot of ordinary people who


would fit that description. 


MS. STOVALL:  What -- what I want to be able to


do today, Your Honors, is to convince you that actually


that's not true, that an antisocial personality disorder

is a severe mental pathology that really does give us


sociopaths and psychopaths that cannot conform to our


rules.  There are a lot of individuals in this country and


certainly in our prisons that break the law, and they may


suffer from antisocial personality traits, but that's


entirely separate and distinct from having a full-blown


diagnosis of an antisocial personality disorder.


QUESTION:  Well, your statute itself, when


you're talking about a sexually violent predator, you say


mental abnormality or personality disorder, which makes


the person likely to engage in repeat acts of sexual


violence.  So, that certainly qualifies the personality


disorder.  It's not any personality disorder that would do


that. 


MS. STOVALL:  That's exactly right, Your Honor. 


The point is that it's a severe diagnosis, for one thing,


and then secondly, it has to tie directly to the kind of


dangerous behavior that we believe these individuals will


commit if they don't have the treatment. 


QUESTION:  And I take it what your -- what your


statute is trying to get at is -- is something more than


mere repetitive conduct, mere recidivism.  Is that fair to


say? 


MS. STOVALL:  Absolutely. 


QUESTION:  And -- and is the element that

distinguishes this kind of behavior from mere


repetitiveness some element of lack of control, not


necessarily volitional control, but some element of lack


of control, perhaps lack of control resulting from


delusion, perceptual difficulties and so on, but -- but


some -- some aspect of the personality that -- that gives


that individual a -- a lesser chance of controlling


behavior in -- in a way that avoids committing crimes.  Is


that fair to say? 


MS. STOVALL:  With a slight exception.  It's the


dangerousness, the risk of recidivism tied to a mental


disorder.  To get the diagnosis of a mental disorder,


there will be an impairment that's part and parcel of


that.


QUESTION:  Right. 


MS. STOVALL:  But I want to be clear that we


don't think there needs to be a -- a third separate, very


distinguishable constitutional element --


QUESTION:  I guess what I'm -- I guess what I'm


getting at is it -- it seems sensible to call somebody who


is just an habitual offender at some dangerous crime or


serious crime dangerous.  And I take it that what the


Kansas statute and other statutes like it is trying to get


at, by speaking of mental disorder or personality


disorder, is some extra element beyond the mere

probability of doing an act which society has called


dangerous.  And I think -- I think --


MS. STOVALL:  That's 100 percent accurate.


That's exactly where we are, Your Honor.  And we think


that having that mental abnormality or mental disorder


gets us away from just predicting who's going to be


dangerous. 


QUESTION:  But what is that -- what is that? 


That's exactly the issue.  What is it that you -- how --


what form of words will you use to define what counts as a


mental disorder that will distinguish the people whom you


want to civilly commit from your mine-run recidivist


criminal? 


MS. STOVALL:  That they have to have a mental --


QUESTION:  Yes, but what -- that's the problem


in the case.  The problem is what counts as a mental


disorder.  And the Kansas court thought what counts as a


mental disorder is a total inability to control behavior.


MS. STOVALL:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  You say that's not the right


definition.  Very well.  What is? 


MS. STOVALL:  What is in the statute, a severe


mental --


QUESTION:  No, no.  What is the definition of


the word, mental disorder, that appears in the statute?

If a person were to say every person who commits a crime,


15 times running, is a sociopath and thereby falls within


DSM-IV, you're not going to permit that.  You want to


distinguish that sociopath from a person who is really


mentally disordered and he isn't your mine-run criminal. 


All right.  Give me the form of words that will do it. 


MS. STOVALL:  I believe they are there now,


that --


disorder.


QUESTION:  All that's there now is mental


MS. STOVALL:  Well, actually it's mental


abnormality and personality disorder.  You and this Court


in the Hendricks decision said that pedophilia certainly


qualifies as a --


QUESTION:  Well, and here we have -- we have


here an antisocial personality disorder.  That -- that was


the diagnosis. 


MS. STOVALL:  That's right.  Along with


exhibitionism. 


QUESTION:  And the State's own expert said in


Mr. Crane's trial that approximately 75 percent of the


prison population has antisocial personality disorder.


Now, this is an unusual statute where after the


person serves a sentence for the crime, the State can then


proceed again and get them locked up for a very long time

because of his dangerousness.


MS. STOVALL:  And the mental disorder. 


QUESTION:  We're trying -- okay.  But most of


them -- 75 percent of them was the testimony -- suffer


from antisocial personality disorder.  So, is the State


going to be able to proceed again against 75 percent of


the prison population?  What is the added element beyond


an antisocial personality disorder? 


MS. STOVALL:  I would suggest to you that there


doesn't need to be an additional element.  While I


acknowledge the expert said 75 percent suffers from that


in the deposition, he wasn't -- he certainly didn't quote


empirical studies to demonstrate that.  I would suggest


that probably 90-95 percent of the prison population


suffer from antisocial personality traits, but that's


different than a disorder. 


The antisocial personality disorder, psychopaths


and sexual -- psychopaths and sociopaths with actual


diagnosis -- and Ted Bundy is the best example of that. 


These are really serious individuals not 75 percent of the


population. 


QUESTION:  What is it -- what is it about them


that we can isolate that shows that they are really


serious beyond the mere repetition of their crime? 


In other words, let me put the question this

way.  Under -- under the rule you want us to adopt in


which, as you put it, there is no third element, why


aren't you free to go after, let's say, every second


offender of a sexual crime at the time of release and say,


this person is dangerous within -- sufficiently dangerous


within the meaning of the statute to -- to commit here?


Now, you're not claiming you can do that, but I


want to know what it is that you have to prove that stands


in the way of your being able to do that. 


MS. STOVALL:  We have to show a mental illness.


QUESTION:  And -- and --


MS. STOVALL:  And that's a psychiatrically


approved condition that --


QUESTION:  No, but --


MS. STOVALL:  -- you can get an expert --


QUESTION:  -- anything in the DSM.


MS. STOVALL:  Right. 


QUESTION:  Then you're --


MS. STOVALL:  I'm sorry.  Not anything in the


DSM. 


QUESTION:  Then you're back to Justice


Ginsburg's question, which -- which is very much like


Justice O'Connor's.  If all you've got to do is satisfy


one criterion in the DSM, you're going to pick up, in


Justice O'Connor's reference to the experts, 75 percent

probably of your prison population and -- and based on the


-- the categorization Justice Ginsburg described, it would


seem to me you would pickup a substantial part of the


population outside of prison. 


Now, I know you don't want to do that, but on


your theory that there is -- there is no third element


beyond this categorization, what stands in the way of your


doing that? 


MS. STOVALL:  The actual diagnosis that those


folks actually have those diagnosis and are sexually


violent.  Being sexually violent absolutely limits that. 


What I would --


QUESTION:  All right.  Are you saying then that


in the example Justice Ginsburg gave you -- what was it --


four out of seven in the list? 


MS. STOVALL:  Three of seven. 


QUESTION:  That -- that as -- as long as -- as


the -- the expert witness says, yes, this person is


subject to four out of those seven personality traits,


that that person, if a sexual offender, could be locked up


under the statute? 


MS. STOVALL:  They could be committed for


treatment under this -- this statute, yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Wow. 


MS. STOVALL:  And Mr. Crane -- what -- what I

Of the seven criteria that are listed, that can certainly


be supplemented by independent judgment of psychiatrists,


of the --


QUESTION:  But it would be very -- it -- it


would be -- on Justice Ginsburg's example, it would be


very easy to prove. 


MS. STOVALL:  It could be if they actually have


that diagnosis and have those personality traits and have


done that behavior. 


If I -- although it is not in the record, what I


would like this Court to know is that out of 5,000


individuals that have been screened in this process in


Kansas, a mere 1 -- less than 1 and a half percent have


actually been civilly committed.  And we have --


QUESTION:  -- the prosecutor then, but I mean,


that's not something that -- that we would generally do. 


I mean, if we thought of all prosecutors as being wise and


kind and good, then there would be a whole lot of rights


that we wouldn't have to worry about. 


MS. STOVALL:  I understand. 


QUESTION:  But Justice Kennedy brought up in --


in Hendricks a concern, and this case seems to fit that.

That is, this man entered a plea bargain. 


MS. STOVALL:  I'm sorry? 


QUESTION:  He entered a plea bargain.  Right? 


And he got a relatively short time.  And then, through


this civil process, without beyond a reasonable doubt as


the standard, just a preponderance --


QUESTION:  No.  There is a reasonable -- beyond


a reasonable doubt, yes. 


MS. STOVALL:  It is beyond a --


QUESTION:  But it is a civil proceeding.


MS. STOVALL:  It is but we have that higher


standard. 


QUESTION:  May I --


QUESTION:  Still, you could -- you could get to


where you were or even beyond.  You could get to the full


amount of time that the person could have been sentenced


if there had been no plea bargain, and if you -- the


maximum penalty because this is indefinite.  Right? 


MS. STOVALL:  It's indefinite with annual


reviews, and they are allowed to be released when they


have been determined safe to be at large.  And while it is


not part of the record, I would want you to know that Mr.


Crane is in transitional release now, after about 3 years


in this treatment program. 


QUESTION:  What do the annual reviews -- what do

they deal with?  Is it possible at -- at the end of an


annual review for the person to be released? 


MS. STOVALL:  Yes.  Could go to the transitional


release phase and then the conditional release phase and


then ultimately to final discharge.  The annual release


ensures -- the annual review, rather, ensures that they're


not warehoused, that they have an opportunity to come to


the court on an annual basis. 


QUESTION:  What does the court have to find in


order to release them?  It is no longer beyond a


reasonable doubt that --


MS. STOVALL:  Then it's -- the State has to show


-- I'm sorry.  The -- the respondent has to show probable


cause that they have changed.  The State, as a matter of


policy, never objects when there are psychiatrists say


they're safe to be in the next phase of the program or the


next.  We've never objected to that.  We have six that are


actually out of the facility now and in either


transitional and/or conditional release.


QUESTION:  And isn't it a frequent case, though,


that the psychiatrists say, well, we can't tell until we


clinically re-observe him and we can't clinically observe


him until he's in a normal environment?  I mean, can


psychiatrists --


MS. STOVALL:  It hasn't happened in the six so

QUESTION:  The American Psychiatric Association


says in their brief that the, quote, antisocial


personality disorder, end quote, which is DSM-IV at 701-


706, applies to 40 to 60 percent among the male-sentenced


population.  So, are you saying that 40 to 60 percent of


the male-sentenced population could be committed for life


civilly?  Are you saying that DSM-IV is not the standard,


or are you saying that the American Psychiatric


Association is wrong when it tells us 40 percent to 60


percent fit within the DSM-IV definition? 


MS. STOVALL:  In terms of the antisocial


personality disorder alone, I don't know.  What I would


say is that certainly 40 to 60 percent --


QUESTION:  All right. 


QUESTION:  Did they say how they know?  I -- I

not.

are beyond a reasonable doubt suffering from an antisocial


personality disorder?

 MS. STOVALL:  I doubt that, and I doubt that --


that it applies to --


QUESTION:  The reason -- the point of my


question is, is DSM-IV the standard and if DSM-IV is not


the standard, what is?  That's what I think all of us, or


several of us anyway, are trying to get to.  And it may be


you -- you cannot address that further, but if you could.


MS. STOVALL:  The DSM-IV absolutely is the


standard in the psychiatric profession, but it is not the


Bible and is not the only thing psychiatrists use.  They


very much can supplement that with their own judgment, and


in fact, that's part of the prefatory language in the DSM.


QUESTION:  May I ask you this question?  And I'm


concerned about whether the instructions were adequate and


whether you think the instructions were adequate.  And one


of the reasons I have the question is they do not seem, on


their face, to require any finding of volitional


impairment.  And it seems to me we might look at


volitional impairment in three different ways, one that


has to be total inability to comply, some inability to


comply, or that it's totally irrelevant to the issue. 


Which of those three positions is yours? 


MS. STOVALL:  The last, that it's irrelevant to


a diagnosis. 


QUESTION:  There's no need to show any

volitional impairment in order to obtain a commitment


under this statute, so the instruction is correct. 


MS. STOVALL:  That -- that is absolutely the


State's position. 


QUESTION:  And I think it's also unnecessary to


show any other kind of impairment in addition to the two


elements that you're describing. 


MS. STOVALL:  In order to get a -- in terms of


the instructions, that's true because to get a diagnosis,


you have to have an impairment.  You can't be diagnosed


with anything under DSM without having an impairment.  So,


it's part and parcel. 


QUESTION:  -- the actual difficulty in


controlling, not -- not utter inability to control


conduct, but difficulty in controlling conduct.  Don't you


have to show that? 


QUESTION:  She said -- she didn't say that. 


MS. STOVALL:  I don't believe we have to show


that.


QUESTION:  How could the person be dangerous --


MS. STOVALL:  Because they have this --


QUESTION:  -- by reason of the personality


disorder if the personality disorder does not produce a


difficulty in -- in controlling conduct?

 QUESTION:  I must say, I thought -- I thought


you conceded that you have to show difficulty in


controlling conduct, and if you don't, this is a quite


different case from what I thought. 


MS. STOVALL:  And I misspoke, Your Honor.  The


-- within the definition of the mental abnormality itself,


we don't have to show lack of control, but the statutory


language then leads us into that you have this mental


abnormality or disorder that makes you likely or that


predisposes you.  So, there is the connection that we have


to show. 


QUESTION:  Well, no --


QUESTION:  In other words --


QUESTION:  It predisposes you to do things you


want to do. 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  So that, it seems to me, doesn't


answer the question. 


MS. STOVALL:  Our --


QUESTION:  Where is it in the statutory language


that talks about volitional control?  It doesn't. 


MS. STOVALL:  The mental abnormality is defined


in the statute and it does mention both volitional and


emotional capacity --


QUESTION:  A personality disorder does not.

 MS. STOVALL:  It is not defined and I think


that's because it's such a common term, the legislature


didn't define it.  Mental abnormality was a very unique


term.  So, I think they chose to define it, but they


include emotional as well as volitional impairments there. 


And if the Kansas Supreme Court is right, then you must


strike out emotional because we could prove it under the


statute by an emotional impairment that they say is not


valid.  Only a volitional impairment is allowed.  And --


and so --


QUESTION:  But you say emotional is, and -- and


I guess emotional impairment I suppose would describe


every sociopath in the country.  I mean, I thought a


sociopath by definition was somebody who just didn't care


about society's standards. 


MS. STOVALL:  That is absolutely one part --


QUESTION:  That would satisfy as an emotional


impairment, wouldn't it?


MS. STOVALL:  It is an emotional impairment,


yes, Your Honor.  That's true. 


QUESTION:  So --


MS. STOVALL:  But the Kansas court would say


that --


QUESTION:  -- in fact, we -- I think we get back


to the point that on your theory any sociopath who has

committed a -- a sexual offense can be committed under


this statute upon release. 


MS. STOVALL:  But it takes more than having the


likelihood of committing more sex crimes and/or not having


any empathy before you could be diagnosed with an


antisocial personality disorder.  And so, there --


QUESTION:  It would take -- it would take four


out of seven on Justice Ginsburg's list. 


MS. STOVALL:  It takes three, actually three of


seven.  But it does make a significant diagnosis.  It is a


mental pathology.  It isn't something that --


QUESTION:  Beyond a reasonable doubt. 


MS. STOVALL:  Again, Your Honor, you're exactly


right.  Beyond a reasonable doubt we have to be able to --


QUESTION:  If we take just those three things


beyond a reasonable doubt, that definition doesn't say


trait.  It says antisocial personality disorder, and


you're familiar with this list.  You could be a liar.  You


could be a malingerer and you could not pay your debts,


and you'd make those three. 


MS. STOVALL:  I would suggest to you that's part


of the evaluative process of a psychologist then in saying


this is someone who is likely to continue to be sexually


violent.  If that's all they've done --


QUESTION:  The prosecutor says, DCM, this

category fits, antisocial personality disorder, any three


of -- and I just gave you three from the list. 


MS. STOVALL:  Right, but that doesn't mean that


one of the experts would say that makes them fit under


this law to be sexually violent predators.  They may have


an antisocial personality disorder, but not that it makes


them likely to re-offend, not that the -- the


psychiatrists at Larned would suggest they need to be


civilly committed. 


QUESTION:  General Stovall, you have read


Hendricks, as all of us have.  And -- and the part that's


on substantive due process is not long.  It's four pages,


and in those four pages, there are six references to


people -- not Hendricks, but people who are unable to


control their behavior, confinement for those who are


unable to control their dangerousness.  Are you -- you're


essentially saying we should just read out that language. 


It was incautious.  Is that what you're telling us? 


MS. STOVALL:  I am because I don't believe that


was central or necessary to the holding.  What I believe


is in the majority opinion, you were using that to


describe the mental abnormality, just to talk about --


it's a substitute.  On -- on page 360 of the --


QUESTION:  The holding -- the holding was,


indeed, described differently.  It at one point said -- it

did mention volitional impairment, but it said the


following.  The Kansas act is plainly of a kind -- these


other civil commit -- and statutes.  It requires a finding


of future dangerousness and then links that finding to the


existence of a mental abnormality or personality disorder


that makes it difficult, if not impossible for the person


to control his dangerous behavior.  That seems to me --


MS. STOVALL:  That's -- that's exactly --


QUESTION:  -- the crux of the holding of the


case and that portion does not say anything about


volitional impairment, just inability or difficulty in


controlling behavior. 


MS. STOVALL:  And what I would suggest to you is


on page 360 of -- of the opinion, it becomes very clear


the way that that phrase and those phrases were being


used.  This admitted lack of volitional control, coupled


with prediction of future dangerousness adequately


distinguish Hendricks from other dangerous people who are


perhaps more properly dealt with through the criminal


proceedings. 


The way of saying admitted lack of volitional


control is another way of simply talking about the mental


impairment.  Couple that with dangerousness, and then you


get the two historic requirements of mental illness and


dangerousness that you've always required.

 QUESTION:  If -- if a jury instruction were


couched in the terms that Justice Scalia just quoted, as


stating the holding in Hendricks, would you find that jury


instruction correct and satisfactory?


MS. STOVALL:  I would find it longer than it


needed to be and more inclusive than it needed to be


because --


QUESTION:  Would it be -- would it be


constitutionally erroneous?  Would you --


MS. STOVALL:  Yes.  I -- I would say that it --


that it would be --


QUESTION:  So, we --


MS. STOVALL:  -- because it goes beyond --


QUESTION:  That's the holding in Hendricks. 


We've got to pull back from Hendricks then in your view.


MS. STOVALL:  My view is that what you said in


Hendricks was mental illness that makes somebody dangerous


in sexually violent ways. 


QUESTION:  Yes.  But if Justice Scalia's


quotations correctly stated the holding in Hendricks, I


think you are telling us we have got to draw back from


Hendricks. 


MS. STOVALL:  Again, what I'm saying, the mental


illness makes them likely to re-offend in sexually violent


ways.

behavior, of controlling their behavior.

dangerousness and links that finding to the existence of a

they have a mental abnormality.  They've committed the


past acts.  They're likely to do it in the future.  They


have this diagnosis.  And so, it's part and parcel, and


common sense would tell you that there's a link and a


bridge, but not that it's a separate statutory term that


needs to be shown and certainly not a constitutional one.


QUESTION:  Thank you, General Stovall.


We'll hear from you, Mr. Donham. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. DONHAM


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. DONHAM:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please


the Court:


I think the major disagreement between the State


-- the State's view of this and Mr. Crane's view is not


how dangerous is an individual, but why are they


dangerous. 


The Kansas Sexual Predator Act was clearly


written to limit the application to those who are


dangerous on account of their mental illness.


QUESTION:  You have a nice speaking voice, but


could you raise it just a little bit? 


MR. DONHAM:  I'm sorry, Judge.  I'm sorry, Your


Honor.  Excuse me.  Is that better?  Okay. 


Mr. Crane sought a jury instruction at his trial


that was consistent with this Court's decision in

Hendricks.  There is or was known to Mr. Crane at that


time only three forms of a mental abnormality or a mental


illness that historically satisfied involuntary,


indefinite civil commitments, and that was the inability


to care for oneself, the absolution of criminal


responsibility or incompetency, and the inability to


exercise self-control. 


Now, that term, inability to exercise self-


control, is defined in the passage of volitional control,


the ability to exercise choice and to make a decision


concerning your behavior. 


QUESTION:  You say it's defined.  Where do we


find that definition, Mr. Donham? 


MR. DONHAM:  Your Honor, in the Kansas statute


itself.  It's 59-29a02.  The definitional portion defines


what a sexually violent predator is.


QUESTION:  Can you tell us where we find that in


-- in the papers? 


QUESTION:  It's the first page of the appendix


to the petitioner's brief I think. 


MR. DONHAM:  Your Honor, joint appendix --


excuse me.  Joint appendix, page 157.  That would have


been instruction number 9 that was given to the jury. 


QUESTION:  We're not talking about the


instruction.  We're talking about the statute.  What is

the statutory provision that's in question that -- that


makes -- that requires -- you say this Kansas statute


requires a volitional impairment.  Isn't that what you


said? 


MR. DONHAM:  No.  I'm sorry.  The -- it's --


it's our opinion that the Kansas Sexually Violent Predator


Act must be limited to that narrow subgroup of


recidivists, those individuals who cannot control their


behavior.


QUESTION:  So that a recidivist who will be a


recidivist because he's delusional and he thinks that


every woman he meets is inviting crude sexual behavior --


he's fully able to control himself if he doesn't think


that the woman is inviting crude sexual behavior, but he


happens to think that every woman he meets is inviting


him, and he would not be covered because that is not a


volitional impairment.  He cannot constitutionally be


covered. 


MR. DONHAM:  I agree with that, and -- and may I


-- may I follow that up with perhaps -- the Kansas Sexual


Predator Act has a number of subsections, one of which is


directly -- directly focused on the type of individual you


just mentioned in your hypothetical. 


QUESTION:  Which one is that?  Subsection.

not that the act didn't cover your client, but you're --


you're supporting the holding of the Kansas Supreme Court


that the act does cover your client, but inasmuch as --


insofar as it does, it's unconstitutional if it goes


beyond volitional impairment.  Isn't -- isn't that what


this case is about? 


MR. DONHAM:  Your Honor, this -- the facts of

the Crane case dealt specifically with Mr. Crane and Mr.


Crane alone.  Prior to his criminal trial, he sought a


defense of insanity, and that was ruled out by the State. 


That left him with only one feasible mental illness which


might qualify him for commitment under the Sexual Predator


Act, as understood by Mr. Crane, following your decision


in Hendricks.  And that was that he was unable to control


his dangerous sexual behavior. 


QUESTION:  Does not --


QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Can I just -- I really


don't know what we have before us here.  I understood the


issue before this Court to be the fact that the Kansas


Supreme Court held the Sexually Violent Predators Act,


which we had just said in Hendricks was constitutional --


the Kansas Supreme Court held it unconstitutional, yet


again, as applied to someone who, like your client, has


only an emotional or personality disorder rather than a


volitional disorder.  Isn't that what the Kansas Supreme


Court opinion said?  There has to be a volitional disorder


or else it is unconstitutional to apply the Kansas


statute. 


MR. DONHAM:  That's what the Kansas Supreme


Court said.


QUESTION:  All right.  Now tell us why -- why it


is constitutional to commit someone who -- who makes

sexual advances to women because of a volitional


impairment, but not constitutional to commit someone who


is delusional.  He is just as dangerous.  He is just as


mentally impaired, and the only difference is he's


delusional rather than cannot control his -- his will. 


Why is the one unconstitutional and the other


constitutional?  I don't understand it. 


MR. DONHAM:  Your Honor, if -- if I have to


fault the opinion in the -- of the Kansas Supreme Court is


-- it is that it expanded its decision that was directly


for Mr. Crane under the specific subsection of the Kansas


Sexual Predator Act that dealt with individuals who had


been found criminally responsible.  And it expanded that


and its terminology to give effect to all commitments.


The -- the Sexual Predator Act is and should be


available for individuals such as your hypothetical,


individuals who, because of some psychosis or


hallucinations, have in effect lost their ability to


control their behavior as well, although perhaps through


some better recognized form.  There is -- there are


specific subsections of the Kansas Sexual Predator Act


that would pull those people in for a commitment


proceeding even though they don't go forward -- forward


with a trial or if they've been found not guilty by reason


of insanity.

 Mr. Crane, however, was in that unique section


of people who have -- who have been found legally


responsible, who are competent to stand trial, who are


imprisoned, and upon release this -- this new group of


individuals that are now subject to involuntary commitment


for some mental disorder this Court found that the


appropriate level of -- of mental illness, if you will,


for Mr. Hendricks was his professed inability to control


his behavior, and that --


QUESTION:  You say we -- we found that.  I


realize that the opinion refers to the fact that he was


unable to control his behavior.  Are you saying that was


-- that was the holding of the case? 


MR. DONHAM:  Your Honor, as -- as I read --


Hendricks stands for the proposition that the Kansas act


is constitutional because, as with Mr. Hendricks, what it


determined was that the State was not seeking to


involuntarily commit people based on dangerousness alone,


which would have been absolutely unconstitutional under


Foucha v. Louisiana.  It seized upon this additional


element which separated and distinguished Mr. Hendricks


from the larger class of just garden variety recidivists. 


It held that given that limiting factor --


QUESTION:  Which -- which limiting factor was


difficulty or impossibility of controlling behavior.

Right? 


MR. DONHAM:  The -- I think the exact language


of the Kansas statute, or at least of Mr. Hendricks -- I'm


sorry.  The opinion of Mr. Hendricks was that he admitted


that he was unable to control his behavior.  The only way


he himself could be sure he would never offend again was


for him to die. 


QUESTION:  I just read -- I just read the


portion of the -- of the opinion that I think the most


relevant, and what it says is difficult, if not


impossible, to control behavior.  To show utter


impossibility to control behavior would be very difficult. 


That's -- that's what it said. 


Now -- now, you equate that difficulty or if not


impossibility to control behavior with volitional


impairment.  Why do you -- why do you equate that, as I


think the Kansas Supreme Court did?  They -- they seemed


to say that if there's no volitional impairment, there


cannot be this difficulty or impossibility of controlling


behavior.  But that doesn't seem to me to be true.


MR. DONHAM:  Well, when Mr. Hendricks professed


that he could not control his behavior, that's an


indication that when confronted with temptation, he was


unable to exercise his free will. 


QUESTION:  That's right.  In Hendricks it

happened to be a volitional impairment.  But why do you


assert that that is the only reason for which one can say


a person is unable to control his behavior?  Why isn't


delusion a reason why a person can't control his behavior? 


He doesn't know what he's confronted with. 


MR. DONHAM:  Your Honor, I'm not trying to limit


the -- what a psychiatrist or a psychologist might be able


to say affects the ability of an individual to conform his


behavior to society's requirements.  I'm not standing here


today as a psychiatrist or a psychologist.  It's a murky


subject at best, and even those who work in it disagree. 


The principal distinction that I take from the


Hendricks decision is that Mr. Hendricks could not have


been constitutionally involuntarily committed absent that


additional element that set him apart from others who


simply behave out of clear choice because they lack any


respect or moral value. 


QUESTION:  Well, I would have thought, really,


that that is not what we limited it to in Hendricks, that


a delusional lack of control would be entirely sufficient


constitutionally as -- as it relates to a lack of control,


that it could be volitional or delusional, that the Kansas


court went too far in requiring only volitional as a


constitutional standard.


MR. DONHAM:  Your Honor, I would agree with

that.


QUESTION:  Yes, so if you --


QUESTION:  You think the court erred. 


MR. DONHAM:  I -- I agree with that and I hope I


haven't misled the Court.  I -- I've been acting on behalf


of Mr. --


QUESTION:  So, you agree that the Kansas Supreme


Court went too far.


MR. DONHAM:  I agree that they perhaps imposed


too strict a limit on these additional elements that have


to be found in order to involuntarily commit. 


QUESTION:  But that there has to be some


additional elements. 


MR. DONHAM:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  And the most appropriate one at hand


in this case was volitional.  Were there any other


additional elements that might have been argued in your


case?  And if not, what are the additional elements that


might -- we might encounter in cases somewhat like this?


MR. DONHAM:  Your Honor, to the first part of


your question, the only available argument that we could


have made, the only conceivable jury instruction that


would have been consistent with the contradictory evidence


at trial and this Court's opinion in Hendricks was a -- a


demand for a jury instruction, requiring the jury to find

that it was his mental abnormality or his personality


disorder that made him be likely to re-offend because it


interfered with his ability to control his behavior.


QUESTION:  So, what are the words that you want


there?  That is, imagine I'm talking about the set of


people who are very dangerous.  Imagine I'm talking about


the set of people who are very dangerous because of a


mental problem.  In defining mental problem, we could have


one subset that has a cognitive disorder well beyond the


normal person, including the normal prisoner.  We could


have a set of people who have an emotional disorder well


beyond what the ordinary prisoner recidivist has, and we


could be talking about what the Kansas Supreme Court


thought it was talking about in this case, the set of


people who arguably have a volitional disorder.  In


respect to that, it sounded to me, if that's the subject


of this case, that the Kansas court used the word cannot


control, whereas our Court used the word difficult, if not


impossible, to control.  The only argument here being if


there is some difference between those two, and I would


think there is. 


But how should we put that in your opinion? 


Would it satisfy you if we said this case is about


volitional disorders, and there the Constitution permits


us to take a dangerous person and commit him civilly if

his ability to control his behavior is significantly, a


lot, quite a lot less than the ordinary person, including


the ordinary prisoner sentenced in a -- in a penitentiary? 


How do you want -- in other words, I'm looking for the


proper standard.  Cannot sounds too tough.  Difficult, if


not impossible, maybe that's all right.  But that's caused


confusion.  So, what's your standard?


MR. DONHAM:  Your Honor, I know the State has


touted the -- the descriptive adjective adequate control. 


I'm not sure if I know how to answer that.  I would think


that if you perform the criminal act, your control was not


adequate.  And so, it would seem that what the medical


personnel are going to have to end up testifying and what


eventually will be a question for the jury to decide is


whether or not, given the opportunity and the chance for


success at committing a criminal act, this individual


chose to do that as an exercise of his or her free will or


whether or not some overriding mental condition compelled


them to act or disabled their capacity to refrain from


acting. 


QUESTION:  I don't -- I really don't understand


where we are now.  You're -- you're objecting, as I


understand it now, just to the jury instruction.  I mean,


we didn't take this case to decide whether the jury


instruction was right under the statute or not.  You don't

challenge the statute.  You think the statute is fine. 


It's just a bad jury instruction that occurred?


MR. DONHAM:  Your Honor, as -- as I read the --


the Kansas statute, the legislative body intended that the


mental defect caused the individual to be likely to commit


future predatory acts of violence.


QUESTION:  No.  It -- it says exactly that, and


you think that's okay.


MR. DONHAM:  Yes, and this Court --


QUESTION:  And the Kansas Supreme Court didn't


think it was okay. 


MR. DONHAM:  I disagree with that.  I -- I think


-- and allow me to follow up.  This Court in Hendricks


reinforced the notion that the Kansas act is


constitutional because there did exist, at least with Mr.


Hendricks, an additional element that because of that,


because of his mental illness, he was likely to offend.


The State -- or the Kansas Supreme Court was


presented simply the fact pattern in Mr. Crane's case, and


-- and that fact pattern was essentially -- or at least


the State's position was we don't have to prove any kind


of additional element whatsoever. 


QUESTION:  Well, they have to prove the


causality.  You're saying they don't have to prove


causality.  I mean, the way the statute reads is:  who

suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder


which makes the person likely to engage in repeat acts of


sexual violence.  It's not just that he's likely to -- to


commit future acts of sexual violence, but it also must be


shown that the reason he's likely to do it is because that


is caused by a mental abnormality or personality disorder. 


I mean, it seems to me, the statute says exactly what you


think it ought to say, and you're just -- you're now


complaining about the jury instruction? 


MR. DONHAM:  We did object to the jury


instruction because we felt it did not adequately address


the theme that the State carried to the jury.  What the


State presented to the jury, through all four of its


expert witnesses, is that Mr. Crane satisfied the


definition of a sexually violent predator because of his


prior repetitive history of criminal offenses.  Their own


expert, Dr. Mabugat, even testified on the stand that if


-- that in satisfying this definition, if the jurors only


take his current mental status, coupled with his instant


offense for the aggravated sexual battery, he's not a


sexually violent predator. 


Dr. Mabugat went on to testify --


QUESTION:  Well, just -- just a minute, Mr.


Donham.  The question presented by the State is -- in its


petition for certiorari is -- is a very general one,

whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires the State to


prove that -- and I think if you're going to bring up a


jury instruction, you're required to cross petition for


certiorari and raise that yourself.  You didn't do that,


did you? 


MR. DONHAM:  Yes, sir, I did.  I -- I filed in


my response an objection to the --

jury instruction bad, did it not?

Supreme Court held that the jury was not properly

QUESTION:  It was not properly instructed not


because it was not instructed in accordance with the


Kansas statute, but because if it had been instructed in


accordance with the Kansas statute, that would have been


unconstitutional.  Wasn't that the basis of the holding? 


And you're saying the Kansas statute is not


unconstitutional.  I mean, the whole basis for the Kansas

Supreme Court thinking that the jury instruction, which


followed the statute, was unconstitutional was, of course,


that the statute was unconstitutional. 


But it seems to me what you're saying here is


that the statute is okay.  Didn't you say the statute is


okay now? 


MR. DONHAM:  What I said, Your Honor, is that


the statute requires that an individual susceptible to


being involuntarily committed must have a mental illness


that makes him or her likely to re-offend.


QUESTION:  What it says, right?


MR. DONHAM:  That's correct. 


What we ask -- our jury instruction was intended


to -- to clarify or to put a face to what is intended by


this word make.  The term make has a lot of definitions,


and our -- our version of it was that Crane's antisocial


personality disorder had to compel him to behave in a


certain way or --


QUESTION:  The Kansas Supreme Court appeared to


hold that a person must be completely unable to control


his behavior in order to meet what it thought the


constitutional standard is under the Due Process Clause. 


That's how I read the Kansas opinion, that it thought that


there had to be a total, complete lack of control, not


just substantial, not just adequate lack, a complete lack

in order to meet U.S. constitutional standards.


MR. DONHAM:  I agree with that.  It --


QUESTION:  Well, I don't think I do.  I don't


think that's what Hendricks said was the constitutional


standard.  Some lack of control, but I hadn't thought it


had to be 100 percent or complete.  I thought the Kansas


court got it wrong and went too far.  There has to be


something there, but probably not complete.


MR. DONHAM:  Your Honor, I suppose the


difference may lie in -- in what is meant by total or


absolute lack of control.  No doubt an individual who has


certain designs to commit an act may exercise at times


some degree of control over his or her behavior. 


The -- the essential element in these


involuntary commitment statutes that must be kept in mind


is, number one, they're -- they're civil.  They're not --


they're not criminal.  Number two, it's to commit the


person to a mental hospital for treatment of the mental


disease or defect, and this mental disease or defect must


be significant enough to warrant depriving this person of


their liberty.


QUESTION:  Yes.  A -- a significant or


substantial lack of control, but to try to move toward an


irresistible impulse standard would fly in the face of


what the American Psychiatric Association thinks is

likely.  I mean, it just -- it seemed to me the Kansas


court went somewhat too far in establishing the -- what it


thought the constitutional requirement was.


MR. DONHAM:  I'm sorry.  Was that a question? 


Excuse me. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  You can interpret it as you wish. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  You're free to dispute my


interpretation of that --


MR. DONHAM:  Well, some of these terms are --


are pretty slippery, and of course, they're all taken in


context of what does a psychiatrist mean by them.  I'm not


a psychiatrist or a psychologist, but I think that this


Court can set a -- a benchmark that can be followed by --


QUESTION:  We're not psychiatrists or


psychologists either.  That's -- that's part of the


problem in --

QUESTION:  -- in our setting as precise a


benchmark as you would like us to set.


QUESTION:  Well, what -- did the Kansas Supreme


Court quote the very words from Hendricks that Justice


Scalia referred to before to make this finding by linking


future dangerousness to a mental abnormality, a

personality disorder, that makes it difficult, if not


impossible, to control such behavior?  That's what the


Kansas Supreme Court repeated.  You seemed to have


conceded that it went beyond that. 


MR. DONHAM:  No.  I think my concession to the


-- to the fact that the Kansas Supreme Court may have


expanded its decision for Mr. Crane too far and -- and by


doing that, it in essence, if you will, limited the


application of the act.  By taking the particular fact


pattern of Mr. Crane for which the only available and the


only reasonable qualifying mental defect would have been


the inability to control behavior and saying that it's now


required for all persons, what the Kansas Supreme Court


did was effectively cut off, I think unfairly, the ability


of the State to incapacitate people who have other type of


significant mental disorders such as Justice Scalia has


pointed out, the hallucinations, the psychoses.  Those are


a different breed of mental illnesses with different


effects. 


QUESTION:  Would -- would your objections and


the -- and perhaps the Kansas court's objections have been


met if instruction no. 9 at page 156 of the joint appendix


said that mental abnormality means a congenital or


acquired condition substantially affecting the emotional


or volitional capacity?

 MR. DONHAM:  If I were to write the instruction,


it would have read it is a acquired or congenital


condition that affects the emotional or volitional


capacity to the degree that the person is unable to


exercise self-control.


QUESTION:  Just -- what about a person who


thinks other people are -- are like rocks?  You know?  I


mean, he can control himself.  He just has a totally


bizarre emotional -- totally bizarre emotional situation,


an autistic kind of person unable to understand emotions


at all.  What do we do with that person, absolutely mad as


a hatter, in common parlance, and also dangerous?


MR. DONHAM:  Well, if he's dangerous because --


QUESTION:  Yes.  He's dangerous because he's


autistic or has no sense whatsoever of what a feeling is. 


All right?  Now, can he control himself?  Absolutely.  He


has no volitional impairment.  He just has this bizarre


emotional situation.  What do we do about that person? 


And, of course, I'll imagine it as bizarre as you want.


(Laughter.) 


MR. DONHAM:  I -- I would say that he's an


appropriate for an involuntary commitment under the


provision --


QUESTION:  Right.  So, what standard there do we


use?

 MR. DONHAM:  That he would be unable --


QUESTION:  So, they can't do it with control


because control has to do with volition.


MR. DONHAM:  This would be a person susceptible


to commitment because he's unable to care for himself, and


therefore poses a danger. 


QUESTION:  No.  He cares for himself perfectly. 


He just has this emotional impairment.  What do we do? 


It's a problem. 


MR. DONHAM:  Yes, it is.  It's a significant


problem because were talking about depriving people of


their liberty, and we're -- we're basing it on the


testimony of people who don't fully understand their field


of expertise at times, which is why this Court should set


a high benchmark to preclude the inadvertent commitment of


someone who really shouldn't have gone to a mental


hospital. 


I'm particularly distressed over the use of an


antisocial personality disorder in that it is -- it is


given simply to someone who has a history of offenses. 


So, that history of offenses provides the basis for the


diagnosis, and it provides the basis for the prediction of


future dangerousness.  In effect, the State seeks to


involuntarily commit someone because they have a long


prior criminal history.
