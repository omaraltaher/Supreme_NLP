CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in case number 01-131, Gary Gisbrecht vs. Jo Anne


Barnhart. 


Spectators are admonished, do not talk until


you get out of the courtroom.  The Court remains in


session.  Mr. Schnaufer? 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAUFER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:  We are asking this Court to recognize a


simple principle that a federal statute requires that an


attorney fee be contingent on success in litigation, that


when the court determines an attorney fee pursuant to that


statute, an attorney fee should reflect the contingent


nature of the fee, thus because 406(b) requires a


contingent fee in Social Security cases, when the district


court determined the reasonable fee pursuant to 406(b)


that attorney fee must reflect the contingent nature of


the fee. 


QUESTION:  Let me ask you a question about the


limits of the extent of the prohibition, whatever is in


406(b).  I think that can be read to deal only with the


question where the attorney is seeking a recovery out of

the plaintiff's recovery. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it's


possible to interpret the statute in a way that would not


criminalize charging a claimant a noncontingent fee,


however the existing practice in the bar is to take it as


prohibiting charging a noncontingent fee? 


QUESTION:  Well, there anything more


authoritative as the existing practice of the bar that


would lead to that conclusion? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  I would direct the Court's


attention to the 406(b)(2) where it sets forth the


criminal penalties for violation of the statute.  There is


only one appellate court to address whether or not a


noncontingent fee may be charged as the third circuit in


Coup, but it doesn't reach the issue.  Also one district


court in Hutchinson cited in the amicus brief from the


claimants representatives addresses that. 


No.  I think even if the statute did not


require a contingent fee when there was no judgment


favorable to the plaintiff, I believe that the vast


majority of claimants would voluntarily choose to enter


into contingent fee agreements. 


QUESTION:  Because that's how they get counsel?


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Absolutely.  So even if the


statute didn't criminalize charging a noncontingent fee,

this would be the voluntary selection of the vast majority


of --


QUESTION:  Well, if the statute, 406(b) reads


as though when there is a judgment favorable to the


claimant, the court may allow a reasonable fee.  And could


apparently determine that fee any way it saw fit? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  I believe this Court's decision


in Christenberg Garments is relevant.  That case also


addresses whether the term, whether the court may award


attorney fees interpreting that the court did, the


attorney matter wasn't up to the court, that the court


would generally award the attorney fee in that fee


shifting context.  So yes, there are situations in which a


different --


QUESTION:  Well, it suggests perhaps that the


court would allow a fee, but it seems open-ended that it


will allow the court to determine the fee any way it wants


on the lodestar method or via, by some other method.


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Justice O'Connor, I believe


the statute should be interpreted relative to the legal


context in which it was enacted in 1965, which additional


role of state courts rule on contingent fee agreements was


to decide where the agreed upon amount between the parties


was excessive or abusive. 


QUESTION:  That wasn't personal to any

statutory mandate, was it?  Wasn't that that just the


supervisory power of the courts over fees? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes, the federal courts in the


early '60s, in 1965, doubted whether they even had the


authority to rule on the appropriateness of a contingent


fee.  Congress clarified that by specifically providing


406(b) so the court, the district court would determine


the reasonableness of a 406(b) fee.  I believe that the --


QUESTION:  Well, you think the language of the


statute requires a contingent fee?  At only reasonable fee


can be a contingent fee? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  That any attorney fee has to be


contingent on success in the litigation that could be


different fee agreements.  For example, a plaintiff may


agree to charge or to pay his or her attorney a flat fee


contingent on success in litigation or a specific hourly


fee contingent on success in the litigation or for


example, a complex formula based on the success in


litigation. 


But the attorney fee in our view --


QUESTION:  But you think that the implication


of this statute is that the court has to base it on the


agreement of the attorney and the attorney's client? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes.  I believe the relevant


inquiry --

 QUESTION:  Because it done say that.  I think


you are reading something in that isn't there.  And you


are basing that on practice of lawyers at the time or


something? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  But, Justice O'Connor.  I


believe that clearly in 1965, Congress could not have


intended to adopt for this statute the lodestar method


given that the lodestar method had not been invented until


a decade or so later and not really adopted by this Court


until its decision in --


QUESTION:  Well, before lodestar, there were


other descriptions for reasonable fees that depended on


hours, degree of difficulty, etcetera etc.  I mean,


lawyers did that for decades. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes.  Yes, Justice Kennedy, and


when a court was involved, the question would be whether


the agreed upon fee is reasonable or unreasonable, the


court would not itself in the context when there was an


existing fee, fee agreement determine what it felt was the


most appropriate fee, so the primary question when there


is a fee agreement and a fee request is whether the fee


request, the agreed upon fee is reasonable. 


QUESTION:  I think this is a very difficult


case because either way, we are going to be, I mean on


which circuits involved, we are going to be upsetting

standard arrangements, contingent fees in some cases.  In


this case, in the Ninth Circuit, are you saying that the


fee, the fee the Ninth Circuit set was not reasonable? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes, Justice Kennedy.  For


several reasons the attorney fee that the district courts


in Ninth Circuit set was not reasonable.  First and


foremost, the district courts did not address the primary


question whether the agreed upon fee was a reasonable fee. 


Second, the district court who decided, who ordered the


fees in Gisbrecht, Miller and Sandine, did not take into


account, did not have the attorney fees reflect the


contingent nature of the fee.  The district courts awarded


in all three cases noncontingent hourly rates,


noncontingent fees when by law, the attorney fee must be


contingent on success. 


QUESTION:  Well, but, of course, that assumes


that you are correct here.  But based on a standard of


fair compensation, was this unfair compensation? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Quite without reference to your


statutory argument? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes.  Because when an attorney


fee is contingent on success in the litigation, the


attorney fee should reflect the contingent nature of the


fee.  In this case, even if there were not a prohibition

on charging noncontingent fee, the parties had freely


contracted that the attorney would be paid more taking


into account the risk of loss. 


QUESTION:  But it seems to me you have got to


get back to the statute and say why the statute should be


read the way you want it to.  This isn't an ordinary


situation event or of a contingent fee say in a personal


injury case which the court may have supervision over in


the general sense.  Here the court doesn't say that the


attorney shall enter into an agreement and the court shall


enforce it.  It says the court may determine and allow as


part of its judgment a reasonable fee for such


representation.  I think you have got to build from that


and say why you think that the amount of the contingencies


specified in your contract is the one that the court has


to follow. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Mr. Chief Justice, I believe


that the practice before 1965 is relevant.  Attorneys were


entering into contingent fee agreements with their clients


to represent full representation in civil actions. 


Congress in an act in 406(b), did not void those


agreements, did not say that attorneys should not charge a


contingent fee, but instead, chose to regulate the


contingent fee agreements. 


If Congress had, if Congress had intended to

prohibit attorneys from engaging, from making contingent


fee agreements with their clients, force representation in


federal court, Congress really could have said so.  I


think we have cited. 


QUESTION:  But it doesn't say anything in


(b)(1)(a) about contingent fees, does it? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  No.  (B)(1)(a) reflects that


the attorney be must be contingent upon a favorable


judgment. 


judgment --


QUESTION:  Well, if you get a favorable


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Right. 


QUESTION:  You can get a fee. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Which isn't quite the same thing. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  We believe that the purpose of


the statute expressed by Congress is fully implemented by


our view. 


QUESTION:  Let me -- I'm having trouble


following your argument.  And one reason is because I am


using the words differently than apparently you are.  I


understand we are in a universe where you are only going


to get paid under this statute if you win.  Am I right


about that.


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes.

 QUESTION:  All right, so we all assume in that


sense every fee is contingent. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  But then I thought we were trying to


distinguish within that universe between some circuits


that say the way we should calculate that is by looking to


what they call the lodestar, and other circuits that say


the way we calculate it is we look to the agreement and if


the agreement is for 25 percent of the recovery, that's


where we start.  Am I right? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes, Justice --


QUESTION:  All right.  Now what is it that we


are trying to decide?  Are we trying to decide whether --


what is it that you see us trying to decide within that


universe? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Well, there are significant


variations of the lodestar method. 

The government now


proposes that the lodestar method be the lodestar method


from the fee shifting context, not taking into account the


contingent nature. 


QUESTION:  All right.  As far as I can see, the


Ninth Circuit says we start with the lodestar, but then it


can be adjusted for 12 factors.  Number six of which is


what I would call the contingent fee, namely, the one 25


percent of the judgment written into the contract which is

what I will use the word contingent to refer to, and so


you have the Ninth Circuit says first the lodestar


adjusted for that, and then some other circuits say first


start with 25 percent contingency, but adjust it if that


isn't reasonable.  Now, that's how I was seeing it.  Now,


am I right? 


Correct me if I'm not. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Justice, I believe there are


variations. 


QUESTION:  And there are some variations, but


those are the two basic things.  All right.  As between


those two basic things, what is it you want us to say.


MR. SCHNAUFER:  We ask the court to, to specify


that when a district court determines a reasonable fee


under 406(b) it should start by asking first the question


what is the agreed upon amount and is the agreed upon


amount --


QUESTION:  Okay.  You said circuits start with


the 25 percent contract and adjust, rather than the


circuits that say start with the lodestar and adjust. 


Okay.  And the statute says may.  And now why should we do


what you want rather than letting the Ninth Circuit free


to do it the way it wants? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  I believe, Justice Breyer, that


there could be possible, you could allow different

circuits to do things in different ways, but the interest


is in uniform federal law.  I believe that the method, the


traditional method of determining contingent fee is best


served, best serves the purpose of the act.  Hence the


lodestar calculation is generally an expensive,


time-consuming endeavor best suited to complex litigation. 


Social Security cases only take generally 30, 40 or 50


hours to accomplish. 


If attorney fee litigation using, trying to


proof up the Hensley hourly rate is required, then


attorneys will have to spend five, maybe 10, in this case


much more hours trying to collect a compensatory fee. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Schnaufer, can I ask you this


question?  As I understand it, 406(a)provides that for


representation before the agency, the agency shall


prescribe a maximum fee.  Is -- is -- am I correct in


that.


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes.  Justice Scalia. 


QUESTION:  So the agency sets a fee and it


doesn't matter what the parties have agreed to before the


agency.  They can agree to whatever they like.  The agency


says this is the maximum fee.  Why would Congress in B


adopt a totally different regime for representation before


the courts?  As a, you know, before the agency, your


agreement with your lawyer doesn't make any difference,

but before the courts basically what governs is your


agreement with the lawyer.  I don't know why they would do


that? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Justice Scalia, I believe that


the statute does not say.  That the statute does not


require the agency to ignore an agreement between a


plaintiff or a claimant and his or her attorney when


determining a fee for administrative work.  In fact, if


you take a look at the regulations --


QUESTION:  Well, it requires them to ignore it


if it goes beyond what the agency determines is the


maximum amount that ought to be charged. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes, Justice Scalia.  In that


way 406(b) and 406(a) are the same.  To the extent that


any agreement between an attorney and the Social Security


claimant is inconsistent with the statute provision that


agreement is void.  The long-standing provision --


QUESTION:  What about the provision at the


administrative level that does refer to an agreement? 


This is, what is it, (a)(2), an agreement --


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  It controls with a cap of $4,000 at


the agency level. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  The


statute there is elucidative of Congress' acknowledgment

and lass the agency's acknowledgment of the capacity of


Social Security claimants to contract with their attorneys


for representation in federal court.  We are not asking


specifically for the court to adopt the presumption, the


conclusive presumption in 406(a)(2), instead, we maintain


that the attorney has the ability, has the burden as the


fee applicant to establish the reasonableness of the fee. 


That is somewhat different than the more lenient rules of


406(a)(2). 


QUESTION:  May I ask, just a question of what


this fee is composed of.  Say the claimant loses at all


three levels of the administrator, the administrative


level, then wins in court.  Do the hours before the agency


count and then would they be computed differently because


the 406(a) --


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Justice Ginsburg, it depends on


whether or not the claimant was represented during the


administrative proceedings.  If the claimant was


represented during the administrative proceedings, then


the claimant's attorney can apply to the agency for


compensation for their services after the --


QUESTION:  After winning in court, so they


would be completely different.


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes.  They are dual


entitlement.  The attorney with seek both 406(b) fees from

the court, for the court work, and 406(a) fees from the


agency for the agency work. 


QUESTION:  I believe there is another scheme I


think that's more adhered than this Social Security


scheme.  For veterans' benefits purposes, you are probably


familiar with the provision that provides for filing an


agreement and then if there is, when they reach such an


agreement, the total fee payable to the attorney may not


exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due


benefits awarded.  That's an express scheme for filing of


an agreement and the agreement enforceable. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  I


believe that Congress does, has addressed specifically on


occasion when a court, when the court should look to an


agreement or the agency should look to the agreement to


determine a reasonable fee.  However, I believe that in


the context of the legal context in 1965, Congress would


have understood that a district court determining a


reasonable fee for representation in court for the --


would look first to whether or not there was a contract


between the attorney and the claimant and whether or not


the agreement upon amount was reasonable.  That would be


the method by which the judge would be expected to


proceed.  The judge would not be expected to determine


independently a lodestar amount or try to determine a

reasonable fee.  If the fee agreed to between the attorney


and the client was reasonable, then that fee would be


approved. 


QUESTION:  So you are saying this is a more --


this same statute came later, but that essentially, that


they operate the same way? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes, but with important


differences.  The 406(a)(2) administrative fees creates a


presumption in favor of the reasonableness of the fee.  We


are saying that the attorney has the burden under 406(b)


to prove the reasonableness of the fee.  We are not


suggesting that there is any presumption that the fee


requested or that 25 percent is a reasonable fee.  The


attorney has to prove that the reasonable fee is the


agreed upon fee.  Of course, it's important in many cases


the attorney will not request the full agreed upon fee but


oftentimes will request much less. 


For example, in the case of Anderson that this


court denied cert on, the request was not for the full


amount of the contract, but for significantly less.  I


believe the attorneys have a strong interest in not


making, requesting inordinately large fees from the court


because one, it would be improper, unreasonable, two, the


government would be likely to object, and three, the court


would be unlikely to award it and so attorneys generally

are going to make a fee request to the court under 406(b),


they are going to be within the raping of reasonableness. 


QUESTION:  If you place an objection to the


lodestar method, you said this becomes a litigation that


is embarrassingly longer than the litigation over the


client itself.


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Justice Ginsburg, our objection


to the lodestar method depends on how you, what you mean


by the lodestar method.  There is a lodestar method using


the fee shifting context that is a noncontingent fee. 


There is also a lodestar method that may allow enhancement


for contingency and that would be a fee-shifting context. 


QUESTION:  The district court here relied on


the bar fees in the Portland area, didn't it, for lawyers


that have been practicing a certain amount of time? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  The


hourly rates used were established as noncontingent hourly


rates however since the attorney services were contingent


on success, an attorney fee awarded at that rate would not


be fully compensatory.  That when an attorney fee is


contingent on success, the attorney fee, a reasonable


attorney fee should reflect the contingent nature. 


QUESTION:  Well, every fee is in a sense


contingent on success.  I mean, if you lose the lawsuit,


you don't charge the same amount as if you win the

lawsuit, whether or not the fee agreement is contingent? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes.  Mr. Chief Justice.  In


this case, the government maintained that $125 for one


attorney was the appropriate reasonable noncontingent


hourly rate, however, the government also concedes that


the class-based risk of loss in these cases is two out of


three.  We have set forth agency's own statistics showing


that 1/3 of Social Security plaintiffs end up receiving


past due benefits and so on average, an attorney will


receive 1/3 of that noncontingent hourly rate if that


noncontingent hourly rate is all the compensation that the


attorney can obtain. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Schnaufer, here's my problem


with, with your basic argument, which is look at the


parties who negotiated a fee in another context, that


negotiated fees with what the court begins with.  This is


not other contexts.  All three of the contracts involved


in this case provided for a fee of 25 percent of the back


benefits, right? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes, Justice Scalia. 


QUESTION:  And there is testimony in this case


that that is the universal practice, the universal


practice of all the lawyers that represent these kind of,


these kinds of clients. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes, Justice Scalia.

 QUESTION:  And that, that 25 percent of back


benefits is the maximum allowed by law? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes, Justice Scalia. 


QUESTION:  Now, what, what reason is there to


believe that this is a, you know, an honest evaluation by


the two parties of what the, of what the lawyers' services


are worth?  The lawyers are simply going for the absolute


maximum that the laws allow.  I don't know why we should


"approach this" or why Congress would have approached it


as cases in which well, you know, after all, the parties


struck a deal at the beginning at arm's length and that


should be the starting point.  This is not that kind of a


situation.  It is a closed market in which these, these


plaintiffs take what the bar gives them. 

That's about


it. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Justice Scalia, I believe that


if the statute specified a 5 percent maximum fee or 10


percent maximum fee, the attorneys would also generally


charge, almost universally charge that same five or 10


percent.  It's important to take a look at the 25 percent


cap on past due benefits in relative context.  This is 25


percent of past due benefits.  It's not 25 percent of the


whole value of the case.  In normal civil litigation an


attorney recovers not 25 percent of a small part of the


judgment but the lifetime benefit.

 QUESTION:  Sometimes it would be a larger part


of the benefit.  It depends entirely on how long the case


goes on.  It's entirely fluky, and in all of the cases,


the lawyers come in and say 25 percent.  That's the max I


can get, and that's what I'm going to ask for. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  I think that, Justice Scalia, I


think in this case it's useful to look at an example and


see what that 25 percent cap actually does.  The


government in this case maintained that the noncontingent


hourly rate was $125 per attorney.  Also the government


does not dispute that the risk of loss is one in three and


so a fully compensatory hourly rate would multiply that


hourly rate times a three multiplier for $375 an hour. 


However, in these cases, the actual, the 25 percent cap


came in, would have been met at $280, $190 and roughly


$270. 


QUESTION:  But your multiplication assumes a


fictitious market.  If I'm an attorney and I'm practicing


in this area and I know I'm going to win only one out of


every three cases, I'm going to tell the judge my hourly


rate in order to make a decent level in this part of the


law and this special is X dollars an hour, $150 an hour. 


I have to get that.  And I take it the trial judge would


say yes, that's right, $150 an hour is the prevailing


rate.  That's what you get.

 MR. SCHNAUFER:  Justice Kennedy, I believe the


hourly --


QUESTION:  You, you, you made the assumption of


a, of a fictitious market. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Justice Kennedy, I believe that


the government concedes that there is a preloss in a


typical Title II case and also the government's position


was that the appropriate noncontingent win, lose or draw


hourly rate was $125 for one of these attorneys. 


Therefore, under the government scheme, paying $125 an


hour to an attorney for services will only mean that the


only grosses only $44, roughly, roughly a third of that


amount.  And so the way the government is counting, the


establishing of the hourly rate at $125, admitting to the


class based risk of loss as one of not contesting that,


can you see that the attorney's recovery is actually much


lower than that noncontingent hourly rate, given the --


QUESTION:  Well, it will be --


QUESTION:  Let me ask you a question I have


been trying to get in for a while here.  What would you,


what would your reaction be to a rule that says the


district judges shall require the applicant for a fee to


one, file any contract he has, two, file a statement of


his hours, three, file his normal rate that he normally


charges and based on the district judge's knowledge of the

proceedings, he shall set a reasonable fee? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Justice Stevens, I believe that


that would accomplish the goal readily, a local district


court could adopt such a rule which would be consistent in


406(b).  I think that the court should also at the same


time consider whether or not there is any offsetting award


under the Equal Access Justice Act.  Also, whether or not


there is any fee, fee liability under 406(a). 


QUESTION:  Well, the district court here


expressed, perhaps it was a magistrate judge, expressed


some skepticism as to the number of hours, I think, put in


on one of these cases. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Mr. Chief Justice, I believe


that the district court judge disputed whether there was


any special expertise involved.  The government did not


contest that all the hours in these cases were reasonably


spent, the 25 hours, the 39 and the 52 hours. 


QUESTION:  Well, the fact the government didn't


contest it doesn't mean that perhaps we shouldn't pay some


attention to the view of the district judge. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  The district court judge did


award the number of hours requested.  The district court


judge did not reduce the hours at all in terms of the


hours.  I'd like to take the rest --


QUESTION:  Why should we consider the separate

fee under the equal access to justice act?  A reasonable


fee is a reasonable fee.  Why does it matter that some


money may be forthcoming from a different source to pay


for it? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  The statute concerns how much


the client will actually end up paying his or her


attorneys that the Equal Access Justice Act --


QUESTION:  And it says that they should pay a


reasonable amount. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  All right.  Yes.  A reasonable


amount.  And for example, the out-of-pocket attorneys fees


in this case with the EAJA offset was 29,675 for all three


claimants who received $114,000 in back benefits.  And so


in that context I believe that the attorney fees, the


judge should consider the equal access to justice act


because how much the claimant pays is very important. 


QUESTION:  How does it work under the


fee-shifting --


QUESTION:  The equal access to justice fee is


for the benefit of the lawyer, rather than the client. 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  The EAJA itself, the offset


provision states that the attorney should keep the larger


of the 406(b) and the EAJA fee so the statute itself


contemplates that the attorney is entitled to the larger


fee.

 QUESTION:  In the context of a fee-shifting


statute where EAJA applies, the lawyer gets the fees from


the Defendant under EAJA.  Can the lawyer have an


agreement with the client that the client is going to pay


an override above, above what the lawyer gets from the


Defendant? 


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes.  We rely quite heavily,


Justice Ginsburg, on this Court's decision on Venegas vs.


Mitchell, recognizing that an attorney fee paid by a


client to his or her own attorney can be in addition to


the amount of a fee-shifting statute.  A fee-shifting


statute such as the EAJA will not provide a fully against


tore fee in almost all cases.  This is particularly true


since the EAJA's hourly rate has an artificial cap.  It is


not the prevailing market rate based upon the attorney's


services in the legal community.  If I may, I take the --


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Schnaufer.  Mr.


Salmons, we will hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. SALMONS:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please


the Court:  For three reasons the Court should use the


lodestar method to determine and award a reasonable


attorney's fee under the Social Security Act.  First, the


lodestar method best reflects the plain language and


25

purposes of Section 406(b).  Second, it is consistent with


the strong presumption in favor of the lodestar approach


announced in this Court, attorneys' fees cases and third


it best furthers the statute's directive that the fees


awarded in each case must be reasonable. 


QUESTION:  Does the lodestar method take into


account the contingent nature of the recovery? 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, the lodestar method


permits district courts to take a number of factors into


account in determining the reasonable hourly rate and the


reasonable fee under this Court's decision in Dague,


however, courts are not permitted to increase what would


otherwise be a reasonable fee based on the mere fact that


it was contingent. 


QUESTION:  Would it be a reasonable fee if it


included in the hourly rate reference to the fact that


there is only a 1/3 success rate?  As a judge, I want to


practice in this area.  I know the area very well.  I win


only a third of the time, therefore my hourly rate takes


into account the fact that I'm going to win only a third


of the time and my hourly rate is $200 an hour.  Can the


district judge accept that?


MR. SALMONS:  No, Your Honor.  I think under


Dague that would not be permissible.  This court in 


Dague --

 QUESTION:  Then that's a false market the


district judge is using in order to award the fee.  I


don't understand that.  And, of course, I see the


consistency of your position because if you said yes well


then I would say well doesn't the contingency fee do the


same thing.  So I'm -- but -- I'm concerned about how the


district judge can award in effect just $40 an hour. 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I think there are at


least the three responses to that.  First, this Court in


Dague rejected the notion that contingency enhancements


were necessary in order to determine a reasonable fee in


the context of fee-shifting statutes. 


QUESTION:  What in that case, what statute were


we interpreting? 


MR. SALMONS:  That involved Section 1988, Your


Honor. 


QUESTION:  Yes.  Not this one. 


MR. SALMONS:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Not cases like this where there is a


low success rate, and where the language of the statute


says a reasonable fee. 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  I mean, why isn't the court, why


can't the court determine it as it wishes, so long as it


finds at the end of the day it's reasonable?  An hourly

rate that it enhances somewhat or the risk factor, or even


a contingent fee could be reasonable, as long as it


doesn't exceed 25 percent.  Doesn't this statutory


language leave that open? 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I think the statutory


language is open to this Court and to courts generally to


construe a standard that best furthers the purposes of the


act.  This Court has long held --


QUESTION:  Do you think the statute requires


that one particular method be selected or does it leave it


up to the judge? 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, it certainly leaves


it up to courts.  That's true in fee-shifting statutes as


well as with this statute. 


QUESTION:  Well I'm not, I'm not sure that


fee-shifting statutes are necessarily an appropriate


analogy here because perhaps there is no reason for


requiring a Defendant to pay a lot of money because of an


arrangement between the plaintiff and his attorney was


contingent, and the attorney doesn't win many cases.  But


I think if you are talking about an agreement between the


plaintiff and the client in the actual case, there may be


more of a case for it. 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I think actually to


the contrary in the contempt of fee-shifting statutes this

Court has long recognized that the purpose of those


statutes is merely to encourage lawyers to undertake that


litigation, and nevertheless, this Court has said that a


contingent enhancement is not necessary to provide that


extra inducement that a lodestar calculation is adequate


and appropriate in striking the balance that Congress


intended when Congress only intends to encourage


litigation.  In this context, by contrast, Section 406(b)


is not merely a statute designed to encourage litigation,


but is designed to protect Social Security claimants and


their awards of back --


QUESTION:  I can't understand your position


that a reasonable fee must be determined without regards


to the realities of the special practice.  I just don't


understand that. 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, that, that is simply


not our position.  It is not our position the courts must


be blind to the realities of this practice. 


QUESTION:  Is one of the realities that you can


win only a third of the time? 


MR. SALMONS:  Well, those numbers obviously


vary.  Lawyers in this kind of environment are prevailing


all of the time. 


QUESTION:  Let's assume that that is a given in


the particular community and in the particular practice.

 MR. SALMONS:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think that


one thing that's important to keep in mind is that


Congress struck the balance in this statute between


protecting claims and encouraging lawyers. 


QUESTION:  In the case that I put, can the


judge or cannot the judge take into account the fact that


the attorney is going to win only a third of the time? 


This is his only practice.  This is all he does.  He is a


specialist. 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, if what you mean by


take into account --


QUESTION:  That the hourly rate --


MR. SALMONS:  That the court can increase the


hourly rate in order to provide a subsidy from prevailing


Social Security claimants to losing Social Security


claimants, I think that would be inappropriate under this


statute and under this Court's decisions in Dague, which


although it is a different context, I think the difference


is quite strongly in favor of applying the same rule here.


QUESTION:  It's not a subsidy.  What's a


subsidy?  I mean the obvious, everybody has the same


point.  If you say they can only learn $40 an hour, the


Social Security people won't be represented or they will


pad their hours.  Now, I can't believe Congress wanted


that.  So, so there doesn't seem to be an answer to that,

and Congress used the word may, so may means may.  I mean,


that's the simple argument. 


MR. SALMONS:  That is correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And it sounds to me so far there is


no answer. 


MR. SALMONS:  The point I was making is that it


certainly is available to this Court to set a standard for


courts to apply. 


QUESTION:  If it's available, why wouldn't we


do it? 


MR. SALMONS:  That's what I was trying to


address, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  All right. 


MR. SALMONS:  I think the reason why this Court


should not adopt a rule that would require the shifting of


benefits in effect from successful Social Security --


QUESTION:  That's what I asked.  What do you


mean shifting of benefits?  It's not a -- a subsidy is


where you take some money and you pay for somebody to do


something.  I don't see why you call this a subsidy. 


That's a conclusion.  What they are doing here is they are


charging what it costs them to provide service to Smith,


and it is what it costs because in the absence of this,


Smith won't get the service.  Nor will Jones and Brown,


they are apt to lose.  But particularly Smith won't.

 MR. SALMONS:  But Your Honor, that's not


necessarily true.  I mean, individual cases, the riskiness


of individual cases is going to vary widely. 


QUESTION:  Smith is paying, Smith is paying for


the work done for the two guys who lost. 


MR. SALMONS:  That's correct.  That's exactly


right.  And that's the way this Court --


QUESTION:  One way to word that. 


MR. SALMONS:  That's the way this Court


addressed it. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  Well, why shouldn't we look


at it that way? 


MR. SALMONS:  That same analysis --


QUESTION:  But why should we look at it that


way since Smith is also paying for what it costs to serve


Smith? 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I think that the


reason this Court should view contingency enhancements in


this context as inappropriate is because of the purpose of


the statute primarily designed to protect the benefits of


successful Social Security claims. 


QUESTION:  Well but the statute itself speaks,


sets a kept, a contingent fee of no more than 25 percent. 


I mean the statute itself refers to that as a cap. 


MR. SALMONS:  The statute has -- that's

correct, Your Honor.  And the statute has two provisions. 


One is that it sets an upper bound of a reasonable fee


which is 25 percent but more precisely 


-- 

QUESTION:  That does not suggest that there can


never be a contingency factor, does it? 


MR. SALMONS:  It does not necessarily suggest


that, no.  What we are talking -- what I think the


question as Justice Breyer posed was more an a policy


level, why should this Court adopt a rule that would allow


those kinds of enhancements and I think one of the reasons


why that's inappropriate in this context is because the


purpose here is not just to encourage lawyers to take


these cases, which was the case in the fee-shifting


statutes where this Court said enhancements aren't


necessary.  The purpose here is to protect claimants and


it would be particularly inappropriate --


QUESTION:  Well, is the purpose to give fair


compensation to members of the bar? 


MR. SALMONS:  That is, that is a purpose, but I


would submit, Your Honor, that in regards to the language


we are focusing on of the reasonable fee, that is not the


primary purpose.  There is a separate provision in 406(b)


where Congress addressed the question of the problem of


encouraging lawyers to take these lawsuits.

said I'm going to go into Social Security work.  I, I know


the area very well.  It's going to be my specialty.  I'm


going to win a third of the time.  I'm going to in effect


get $40 an hour.  Would you advice him to go into that


part of the practice? 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, that would probably


depend on what some of his alternatives were.  I don't


mean that in any sort of derogatory way, but it is not the


case that lawyers cannot make a sufficient wage under the


lodestar method.  It's important to remember that there


are at least six circuits who have been applying the


lodestar method. 


QUESTION:  May I ask you in a way what you mean


by the lodestar method.  I know we have talked about it in


a lot of cases, but would it be a satisfactory compliance


with the lodestar method in your view of the case if every


judge said to every lawyer, file your time sheet with me,


I want to know your hours, I want to know your regular


charge, and I want to see the contract you have got, and I


know a lot about the case, I'll fix the fee.  Would that


satisfy your view? 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, that would certainly


be a one way to interpret a statute that I think on the


text of the statute there is nothing that would prohibit


it.  I think there are strong reasons why this Court may

want to provide some guidance. 


QUESTION:  Well, the guidance is --


MR. SALMONS:  For federal rules. 


QUESTION:  You should take into account the


hours, the general charge that he makes and the success in


the case and whatever contract he has made and then you


would know the case, you decide the reasonable fee.  And


we don't want to have a 10-month argument under lodestar


method about what the, you know, one of the things we want


to avoid is protracted litigation in these cases, so we


want to simplify it.  I think you would agree that's


desirable? 


MR. SALMONS:  I do agree that's desirable, but


I think the lodestar method is the best way to could that.


QUESTION:  And I'm just wondering if what I


propose to be a sufficient compliance with the lodestar


method to satisfy the government? 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I think it would


largely be in compliance with lodestar method, although


not under this Court's decision in Dague which has


prohibited the consideration of contingency enhancements. 


QUESTION:  Did that, did that prohibition of


contingency enhancements apply in the context such as this


where it was only legally possible to charge when you win?


MR. SALMONS:  No, Your Honor, that was not the

context of 1988. 


QUESTION:  Might not that make a difference? 


It's one thing to say well, if you don't, if you don't


charge anything for your losing cases, that's your


problem.  You ought to charge.  And we are not going to


allow you to conduct that practice and make, make this


plaintiff pay for the, for the two who you lost.  But when


you are in a different context where the only time you can


get fees by law is where you win, would we have to pay,


would we have to adopt the same rule? 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I think this Court


should adopt the same rule and it's because the reasons


this Court adopted the rule that it did in the context of


fee-shifting statutes was not because there was still some


possibility that lawyers could negotiate fees even that


won on a contingent basis. 


QUESTION:  What's the government's position,


supposing one of the Social Security lawyers has a very


wealthy client who feels he is entitled to Social Security


as a course he is just like everybody else.  He hasn't


been paid it, and says to the lawyer, I'll pay you $300 an


hour if, for all the work you put on this case because I


am determined to get that Social Security.  Do you think


406(b) prohibits that? 


MR. SALMONS:  Um --

 QUESTION:  He doesn't want to get it out of the


judgment at all.  He says I'll bill you for it afterwards.


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, the commissioner does


interpret 406(b) to require only contingent fees, that it


prohibits a lawyer from charging fees when there is no


award of back benefits. 


QUESTION:  A maximum wouldn't make any sense


otherwise.  I mean, the maximum is 25 percent of the back


pay award.  If there is no back pay award, you can charge


as much as you like.  I mean, that's strange. 


MR. SALMONS:  We think that in light of, of the


terms of 406(b), its purpose is in the structure with,


with the provision that would make it in fact a crime to


charge more.  But the best way to read that is to require


that only fees that have been authorized by a court can be


charged. 


QUESTION:  Has the commission ever issued an


opinion to that effect? 


MR. SALMONS:  No, Your Honor.  There is no


regulation that simply addresses that.  To be honest with


you, it is not an issue that has really come up because


lawyers as the record here again reflects, have a


universal practice of entering into fee agreements that


say 25 percent contingency at the statutory maximum and


their contingent fees so it's just not an issue that comes

up. 


QUESTION:  So the statute says all fees are


contingent and the government says there can be no


contingent fees?  That's where we are in this case? 


MR. SALMONS:  No, Your Honor.  The statute says


the relevant language of the statute says the courts will


determine a reasonable fee, and we --


QUESTION:  But all fees are contingent on


success.  In other words, there is some confusion, I


think, of what the term contingent fee means.  Nobody gets


a fee if they lose.  At least the secretaries interpreted


the statute as long as I know to say that the only time


that the lawyer is going to recover is if the plaintiff


guess benefits, is that right? 


MR. SALMONS:  That is correct. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  And then the question is


what's, what this provision requires.  One just reaction


that I had to this picture is well, in tort litigation,


the standard is a third of the recovery.  And why isn't


here, why isn't a quarter of the recovery eminently


reasonable considering as was pointed out that the


recovery comes only out of the past benefits.  No --


nothing out of the future benefits the person is going to


get.  So what is it about the 25 percent of past benefits? 


It doesn't just make a whole lot of sense instead of

engaging in what we know from this very case, we'll take


as much time as the calculation, as the dispute over the


benefits themselves.  The litigation here over the fees


took as long as the litigation over the claimant's right


to benefits. 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, let me if I may


address your last point first.  That is to say that the


commissioner's experience with the lodestar method in the


numerous circuits that apply it is not that it is


difficult to apply, but keep in mind, Your Honors, that in


most of these cases, the lawyers are also seeking EAJA


fees and so the very same court that's going to consider


the 406(b) fee claim has already undertaken a lodestar


analysis to determine a reasonable number of hours and


then the rate is determined by EAJA, but the


commissioner's experience is that the lodestar method is


not difficult to apply and in the vast majority of cases,


certainly in most circuits, the commissioner doesn't


object to most of the fee claims because they are


reasonable.  The courts have determined standards for what


reasonable rates are in the relevant prevailing markets. 


QUESTION:  You mentioned EAJA.  One of the


problems that I have with that analogy is it works out


here that you get EAJA is just about this it.  These three


lawyers got what, what EAJA permitted.  And then

fee-shifting statutes generally you get from the Defendant


what EAJA allows you, but then you can have, you can


recover more from your own client.  Here it works out that


EAJA is it and it seems to me something unfair about that.


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I think the only


thing unfair in that sense is that Congress here has


determined that the market for legal services in the


Social Security context was failing to carry out the


purposes of the Social Security Act, and that lawyers had


unequal bargaining power and were charging inordinately


large contingency fees --


QUESTION:  But those were the days you were


talking about 50 percent contingent fees so Congress cut


it back to 25, so why -- what --


MR. SALMONS:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  What -- you just said well, 25 not


in every case, maybe only work two hours, it would be


unreasonable, but instead of having the judge and the


lawyers go through this whole thing, I mean, EAJA is


available only if the government's position was not


substantially justified, right?  It's not automatic. 


MR. SALMONS:  That's correct.  That's correct. 


It's a standard that course seem to find on a regular


basis in these cases, but that is the standard. 


QUESTION:  Does the government -- I don't know

how it works, but when someone is seeking benefits from


the government, government has prevailed all through the


agency, loses in court, does the government just sort of


concede that the government's position was not


substantially justified? 


MR. SALMONS:  Not necessarily, Your Honor.  I


think the government lawyers in each case would look at


the prevailing circuit law or, of the jurisdiction, would


look at the facts of the case and make the determination. 


In most of these cases, EAJA fees seem to be awarded and


the resolution of those fees doesn't take a lot of time. 


QUESTION:  Well, shouldn't there about, you say


you look at the law of the particular circuit.  I would


think that a concept like was the government's position


substantially justified shouldn't be whatever it means in,


in 12 different appellate courts. 


MR. SALMONS:  My point, Your Honor, is just one


of the things I think that's keeping, is important to keep


in mind in these cases is that they, by their nature, tend


to be very routine and so both in terms of awarding EAJA


fees and in terms of awarding 406(b) fees, it is not very


difficult for courts to develop practices in these cases


that, that result in a very expedited process, and that in


fact, that is, that is the way the lodestar method is


applied and I, and it seems to me, Your Honors, that the

alternative that's being proposed would largely frustrate


the purpose that Justice Stevens was identifying of the


need for some sort of expedited procedures here.  They


point to four additional factors that aren't lodestar


factors that they think courts should take into account. 


Some of the contingency circuits who have


adopted some modified contingency rule have added


additional factors, including requiring courts to ask


whether the claimants had been notified that there were


other options other than the 25 percent contingent fee


which under the facts of this case we were told the


lawyers would never do. 


QUESTION:  Does the government have any


statistics as to how often an award of attorneys fees by a


district judge is appealed to the Court of Appeals? 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, that is, in the


context of 406(b) cases? 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. SALMONS:  There are no -- the agency does


not specifically keep statistics on that, although I did


discuss that with the relevant agency personnel and was


informed that in fact the agency very rarely seeks an


appeal unless the case involves some broader legal


principle that the agency determines is important to


litigation.

 QUESTION:  How about the attorney? 


MR. SALMONS:  I do not have any figures on


that, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Salmons, another question of


statistics.  We have had the statistic that only one out


of three cases is successful.  And I take it you have not


challenged that.  That's one of the arguments that there


is something that is really outrageous practice going on


and there is a need to enhance for that contingency.  What


I want to ask is are there any, is there any evidence,


statistical or otherwise, to explain why the rate is only


one win out of three cases? 


One reason might be that, or one description


might be that virtually all lawyers who take these cases


in fact have the experience of losing two for every one. 


But another explanation might be that lawyers who can tell


the difference between a good case and a bad case win at a


very high rate, and that a lot of young lawyers who don't


have access to many clients are willing to take long shots


and that when you average those two together, you bet the


one win out of three cases. 


Do we know, do we know which possible


description is correct or whether there is some third


description that explains the one in three? 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I'm not aware of any

statistical or other information that's directly on point,


although I could think it is important to keep in mind


that the standards of review among other things have a lot


to do with the outcome of these cases, and that, and that


the general statistics that the courts provide through,


for example, the federal judiciary home page that tracks


different types of cases in different circuits, for


example, shows that there has been dramatic increases in


the number of Title II disability lawsuits that are filed


initially in district courts between the period of 1990 to


2000.  In fact, that they have tripled. 


QUESTION:  Does that have anything to do with


what the rate is because these are all cases that lost at


the administrative level, right? 


MR. SALMONS:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Is there any, any showing that maybe


in the prior period, there were more cases winning at the


administrative level, therefore fewer getting into the


court? 


MR. SALMONS:  Not that I have seen.  In fact,


Your Honor, the numbers that I have seen suggest that the


percentage of cases that win before the agency has been


relatively consistent. 


QUESTION:  I don't understand the point were


you driving at.  So what, so they tripled in 10 years, you

know, and the ice cap melted. 


MR. SALMONS:  I surely don't want to overstate


it. 


QUESTION:  I don't understand what you were


driving at.  What was the point that you were making? 


MR. SALMONS:  The point I was attempting to make,


Your Honor --


QUESTION:  Is this the result of those, of


those jurisdictions that have allowed contingency to be


considered? 


MR. SALMONS:  No.  Not at all.  Your Honor. 


The point I was trying to make is that there aren't any


hard statistics that show how the different legal rules


have having an effect on litigants in this context, but


the general --


QUESTION:  And likewise, I take it there are no


statistics on how the different compensation approaches


are having an effect? 


MR. SALMONS:  That's correct.  And that's,


that's the point I was trying to make, Your Honor.  That


all that we can tell is that one, the commissioner has not


been flooded with complaints in the circuits that applied


the lodestar, which is the dominant method and has been


for over 10 years. 


QUESTION:  Do you have any flooded in the other

jurisdictions? 


MR. SALMONS:  No.  My point is that there are,


there are, there is no reason to think that the rules are


having that dramatic of an effect on the availability of


counsel.


QUESTION:  Then why don't we leave it alone? 


Let the judge do it? 


MR. SALMONS:  That is certainly an option that


is before this Court. 

The government's position is that


if the Court is going to address the issue of what


standards should be applied, that the best way for this


Court to do it is to specify that the lodestar method is


the best method, and that includes --


QUESTION:  But that is a pretty big swing if


you say if the judge can go up to 25 percent if that's


reasonable, here what was the percent, the lodestar


percent, the lodestar yielded what percent of the past two


benefits in these cases? 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I don't have that


figure.  I can tell you that in terms of hourly rates, for


example, I --


QUESTION:  Wasn't it about half of what the


contingency would have been? 


QUESTION:  Even less, I think. 


MR. SALMONS:  It varied in the, in the cases.

 QUESTION:  I think it was under 10 percent. 


MR. SALMONS:  I think one way to sort of try


and track that is that what the claimants lawyers in these


cases did was because they recognized they were in a


lodestar circuit, they had, they kept the same number of


reasonable hours they would use for their EAJA fees which


the government did not contest and then they just divided


that by the 25 percent figure and came up with an hourly


rate.  So the hourly rates they sought in these cases


ranged from around $180 an hour to nearly $300 an hour. 


QUESTION:  But those were chopped down by the


judge. 


MR. SALMONS:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Because they were not supposed to,


at least this Court, the Court here did it.  It took out


following this Court's precedent any override for risk of


nonsuccess. 


MR. SALMONS:  That's right, Your Honor.  The


Ninth Circuit has --


QUESTION:  So I'm not talking about the rates


that the lawyers asked for, I'm talking about the rates


that they got.  My concern is this.  If you just say well


judge, look at the agreement.  Look at the hourly rate. 


You can get swings from one court saying as I think was


true here, 7.8 percent to another judge saying in that

very same case 25 percent.  That's why I think you have to


have a little more control, a little more uniformity. 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, let me make two


points very quickly.  One is that when Congress enacted


this statute, it recognized not only that lawyers were


charging an inordinately large percentage in terms of


their contingency fees, but there was an inherent problem


with contingency fees because in this context they do not


track the value, a reasonable value of legal services. 


They turn unnecessarily on factors such as the number of


dependents and the amount of delay that it takes in order


to get the benefits over which time the benefits continued


to accrue which just has no bearing whatsoever on the


amount, the value of the legal services provider. 


QUESTION:  Are you recommending that we say let


the judge do it, no matter what?  Is that the government's


position?  I thought the government was coming in with a


pretty stiff position that it's the lodestar method


period. 


MR. SALMONS:  That is the government's


position, Your Honor.  We think that the lodestar method. 


Let me just see if I can, and be very clear. 


QUESTION:  Your position is that we do not want


to subsidize bad suits? 


MR. SALMONS:  Yes.  That is exactly right.

 QUESTION:  It is not in the best interests of


anybody, the country or anybody else, to encourage lawyers


to bring bad suits and then get paid for it when they win


a good suit, right? 


QUESTION:  I was wondering if you had spent a


lot of time --


QUESTION:  This is certainly a way to get


lawyers in the good suits. 


MR. SALMONS:  But, Your Honor, there is no,


there is no evidence of that.  And in fact the evidence


that it does exist is to the contrary.  There are six


circuits that have been employing the lodestar method for,


for decades without any evidence that there is a failure


of lawyers who want to take these cases.  The lawyers in


these cases submitted affidavits that said we, we practice


regularly in federal courts in Title II cases and we have


been doing it for years and years and that's in the


context of lodestar statutes. 


QUESTION:  Why not make it run the same way the


veterans' benefits do?  I mean, after all, it's a similar


kind of set up.  You claim that if it's at the agency, you


lose, you come to court, and there it's the agreement is


20 percent, so it's, but that seems to be working fine,


right?  Where the judge gives the 20 percent. 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, that would certainly

be an alternative availability to Congress.  The


difference would be the statutory language would prohibit


this Court from adopting a rule that would look primarily


to the fee contracts.  Congress knows how to write that


kind of statute when it wants to.  It did so in 406(a)(2). 


It has not done so here.  Another point I would like to


make, Your Honor, is that, is that these cases are, as


both sides seem to agree, are somewhat unique in that they


generally require a very low number of hours.  They don't


require the same kinds of risk undertaken by the lawyers


as other contingent fee cases do. 


QUESTION:  Well, if that's so then the judge in


all the circuits that follow the contingent method would


reduce the award.  I mean, in one way you are going to


start with the lodestar enhance.  In the other way you are


going to start with the contingent fee reduce it.  I guess


the simpler is the contingent fee reduce it.  I think


frankly you don't have to go into the hours. 


MR. SALMONS:  I disagree, Your Honor, because


of the court's experience, the lodestar method, I think


that's the most efficient way for courts to determine the


fee. 


QUESTION:  Beyond the record, do you have any


statistics on how often contingent fees are reduced in the


contingency circuits?

 MR. SALMONS:  I do not, Your Honor.  I do not. 


One other thing that I think --


QUESTION:  Do you have any sort of egregious


examples where there was a lot of delay in those circuits


just to build up the recovery?  Has that turned out to be


a problem for the agency anywhere? 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, the agency has not


experienced any particular problem under either of these


standards.  We do think that the lodestar method as this


Court announced it in Dague is the best way to effectuate


Congress' intent under the purposes of this statute.  I


think it's important to keep in mind that Congress has


already provided a mechanism to ensure adequate counsel


here, and that is the payment out of the back benefit


awards directly to the lawyer. 

That's different than in


other contingent fee contexts. 


So that Congress was concerned with the need to


encourage counsel and it provided a provision to do that. 


It struck the balance, and then it requires the courts to


determine the reasonable fee in each case based on a fair


value of the legal services provided and this Court has


long held that there is a strong presumption that when


Congress says courts determine a reasonable fee, Congress


means the lodestar method. 


If the lodestar method --

 QUESTION:  That wasn't even established until


Hensley against -- whatever it is.  The lodestar got


settled around in the circuits in the 1980s.  Social


Security claims have been going on a long time.  Wasn't it


standard before, but it was contingent? 


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, courts used a variety


of standards before as they did under other fee statutes. 


The fact that the lodestar method wasn't fully developed


didn't prevent this Court from adopting it under the Civil


Rights Act of 1964, for example, but prior to the adoption


of the lodestar method, it's not the case the courts were


routinely deferring to the fee contracts. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Salmons.  Mr.


Schnaufer, you have two minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAUFER


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. SCHNAUFER:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  I


believe that the government's position is a bold new


position. 

The government has not previously advanced


except for in its brief that all circuits are wrong, that


even the lodestar jurisdictions are wrong.  That no one


can, no enhancements for contingencies can ever be


permitted and so the agency cannot rely on the experience


in the circuit lodestar to say that this method is the


preferable method.

 Claimants need attorneys.  In these cases the


government conceded that the agency's position, underlying


agency position was not substantially justified without


attorneys whose claimants most likely would never receive


the benefits that they were due.  Justice Stevens, you


asked about possibly about the EAJA of lodestar.  There


are many reasons why the EAJA, Equal Access Justice Act is


not the lodestar amount.  The EAJA has an artificial


hourly rate capped below the prevailing market rate.  The


EAJA also often represents a settlement of the parties for


the risk of litigating the substantial justification


issue.  And so we cannot rely, just because there is an


Equal Access Justice Act award, there is not in the case


already a lodestar amount. 


Then I guess I think it allows this Court to


distinguish easily Dague.  Dague should not be applied


outside of the fee-shifting context because as its


request, a plaintiff should be able to pay his or her own


attorney to take into account the risk of loss.  Justice


O'Connor, I think was asking whether or not contingency


could be taken into account by a district court in


determining the fee.  I believe that if this Court can


direct that the lodestar method be adopted to enhance for


contingency reflecting the necessary contingent nature of


the claim or the court can use a contingent fee method,

there again looking at the contingent nature of the fee,


regardless of which way the court goes, the court allows


more than one method.  I brief that the contingent nature


of Social Security cases should be taken into account. 


The government describes dependence.  The


government objects that attorney fee awards would be


arbitrarily different based upon the number of dependents. 


The government lost that issue in Hopkins vs. Cohen in


1968.  This Court held in Hopkins the number -- thank you,


Mr. Chief Justice. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Schnaufer.  The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
