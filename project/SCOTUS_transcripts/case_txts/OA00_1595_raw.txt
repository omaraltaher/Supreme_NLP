CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 00-1595, Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v.


The National Labor Relations Board.


Mr. McCortney.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF RYAN D. McCORTNEY


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. McCORTNEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The issue in this case is whether the award of


back pay to an undocumented alien who never was legally


present or legally authorized to work in this country


conflicts with this Court's holding in Sure-Tan or with


this country's immigration laws and policies.


In Sure-Tan, this Court held that the


discriminatees in that case must be deemed unavailable for


work and the accrual of back pay therefore tolled during


any period when they were not lawfully entitled to be


present and employed in the United States.


The Sure-Tan Court's back pay limitation is


consistent with INA's dual requirement that to be employed


in this country an alien must be both legally present and


legally authorized to work.  Despite this dual


requirement, the board contends that Castro is entitled to

back pay even though he never was legally present or


legally authorized to work during the back pay period.


The fatal flaw in the board's position lies in


its adherence to its physical availability doctrine.  The


board contends that this Court denied back pay to the


discriminatees in Sure-Tan only because they had left the


country and were physically unavailable for work.  If the


board is right, the Sure-Tan discriminatees could have


illegally reentered the country to establish physical


presence and to commence the accrual of back pay. 


However, such reentry would violate the immigration laws


of this country and be contrary to this Court's holding in


Sure-Tan.


QUESTION:  Have the immigration laws changed at


all in any relevant respects since our decision in Sure-


Tan?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Yes, Your Honor, the passage of


IRCA in 1986.


QUESTION:  And what relevant changes did IRCA


make?


MR. McCORTNEY:  IRCA was an amendment to the INA


that made the employment, the knowing employment of


undocumented aliens unauthorized from the employer's


perspective.


QUESTION:  And is it correct that when Sure-Tan

was argued, IRCA, if that's the way you pronounce it, was


being considered by Congress and the Government in its


argument told us that if IRCA had been passed, back pay


would not be available?


MR. McCORTNEY:  That's correct, Your Honor.


Recognizing, as it must, that this Court in


Sure-Tan conditioned the accrual of back pay on legal


presence, the board contends that the Sure-Tan Court


sought only to deter the discriminatees from illegally


reentering this country to claim back pay.


QUESTION:  Well, when you say conditioned it on


legal presence, I mean, in fact they were not present.  I


mean, the people in that case were still out of the


country, weren't they?


MR. McCORTNEY:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  So you have to acknowledge that it


was dictum.


MR. McCORTNEY:  Well, Your Honor, I would not


call it dicta only because the Court set forth the


conditions upon which the discriminatees might receive


back pay if they were to legally reenter the country.


QUESTION:  That's right, but it only had to say


one condition in order to decide the case.  Namely, you


had to be in the country, and it went on to say, and in


addition you have to be available to work, but that is

really unnecessary to the decision.


MR. McCORTNEY:  Well, the threshold condition


was legal reentry, and that was the starting point of the


analysis.  If they were to reenter, then of course they


would have to establish at the back pay hearing --


QUESTION:  Mr. McCortney --


MR. McCORTNEY:  -- legal authorization to work.


QUESTION:  If that is so, then why did the Court


make the comment on page 901 of the opinion in


footnote 11, talking about the board has said it will make


it an arbitrary number of weeks, and the Court said the


board has never attempted to impose a back pay award that


the employer must pay regardless of the actual evidence as


to such issues as the employee's availability to work? 


All of that would have been unnecessary if it were just


this blanket rule, right?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Well, Your Honor, I think in


footnote 11 what the Court was addressing was the minimum


back pay award of 6 months that the court of appeals had


imposed and the board had adopted, and then the board


tried to defend that award by arguing that it had in other


cases had estimates of back pay, despite the fact that the


discriminatee was unable to establish with any certainty


the probable length of the back pay period.


I think the Court there was simply saying that,

look, you don't even go so far as to provide any showing


of proof as to how long these discriminatees would have


worked before their apprehension by the INS, but we don't


read that to mean that had those discriminatees in Sure-


Tan remained in the country, that they would have been


entitled to back pay, because they wouldn't have been


legally present and legally authorized to work.


QUESTION:  Well, if the opinion in Sure-Tan we


think equivocal, if it's a wash either way, what is your


principal argument for reversal here?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Assuming that Sure-Tan is


equivocal?


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. McCORTNEY:  That the board's award of back


pay conflicts with the immigration laws and policies of


this country as embodied in the INA and IRCA.


QUESTION:  Well, what do you say the argument


that the board makes that even if the dictum in Sure-Tan


were a holding as you say it should be treated, that the


statute has changed the landscape, and that the board's


rule in effect is in aid of the statute, because the board


is saying the illegality on the part of the employer comes


when the employer knowingly employs these people despite


knowledge of their illegal character, so in effect we're


going to say that the obligation to pay back pay stops

when the employer knows that the alien in fact is


illegally there.


Up to that point, however, we're going to follow


a different policy.  We're going to make the employer pay


back pay because otherwise we would make it very easy for


employers.  We would, in fact, create an inducement for


employers to ignore the law by, in effect, winking at


illegality on the part of the workers, so the board is


saying, sure, the statute changed the legal landscape even


on your reading of Sure-Tan, and we've come up with what


seems to be a sensible way of implementing it.  What is


your response to that?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Your Honor, just the mere


prospect of receiving back pay in this case encouraged


Castro to extend his illegal stay by more than 4 years and


to continue using --


QUESTION:  Well, I think you're right, but the


board is saying, yes, there's that inducement on one side,


but there's a very powerful employer inducement if we come


out the other way, and although I don't think the board


put it in these words, I take it the board is saying, we


think the employers are going to make a rational decision


about inducements more clearly or more obviously than


employees, the illegal aliens might do, so we're going to


prefer the inducement or the policy that is going to have

the strongest effect on the employers.  Isn't that a


permissible choice for the board to make?


MR. McCORTNEY:  No, Your Honor.  The board's


authority here is to enforce the provisions of the


National Labor Relations Act to the extent that they do


not conflict with the immigration laws and policies of


this country, and --


QUESTION:  But the board is saying we can't have


it both ways.  No matter which way we go, something we do


would provide an inducement to violate the immigration


laws.  We think probably the best way to get where we want


to go is to concentrate on inducements on the employer.


MR. McCORTNEY:  Your Honor, I don't believe that


those, the deterrence of the employer to -- that knowingly


hires illegal aliens or employs them, that awarding back


pay is necessary in light of the sanctions under IRCA that


now subject employers that do so to civil and criminal


sanctions, and so --


QUESTION:  Wouldn't it also be the case that if


the employer, by reason of this inducement, hired --


supposed inducement -- hired somebody whom he knew at the


time of the hiring to be an unlawful, an illegal alien, 


even applying the board's rule, he wouldn't have to pay


any back pay.


MR. McCORTNEY:  That's correct, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  What is -- here -- I think Justice


Souter is -- we said in our cases just what Justice Souter


said, I take it, INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, quoting what Sure-


Tan says.  An employer can be guilty of an unfair labor


practice in his dealings with an alien, notwithstanding


the alien's illegal presence in this country.  You agree


with that.  Retrospective sanctions against the employer


may accordingly be imposed by the board to further the


public policy against unfair labor practices.


Now, those -- that's what the Court said.  Now,


this is a retrospective policy, a retrospective sanction


of a compromise variety only for the period where the


employer is not committing any labor law, any immigration


law violation in order to further the labor policy.  Why


doesn't this fit within the two sentences that I just


described?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Because --


QUESTION:  And if this doesn't, what would?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Your Honor, what it doesn't


address is the violation of the INA.


QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  What the Court said in


the sentences I read is, retrospective -- I take it,


retrospective sanctions can be assessed by the board.


Now, are we -- now, I want to know, if they


can't do this, what can they do retrospectively, or is the

sentence I just read you by this Court wrong?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Your Honor, I think what the


sentence means, at least my reading of it, is that


retrospective sanctions may be imposed, but not


necessarily, and --


QUESTION:  Fine.


QUESTION:  What other rules are there, is


what -- what other retrospective sanctions are there?


QUESTION:  Yes.  Yes, that's correct.  Thank


you.


QUESTION:  Can the board fine the employer?


MR. McCORTNEY:  No, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  What else can the board do to punish


the employer for the unfair labor practice?


MR. McCORTNEY:  A cease and desist order, as in


this case, with the threat of contempt sanctions.


QUESTION:  That's a prospective --


QUESTION:  I would have called that prospective.


QUESTION:  -- sanction, isn't it?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Yes.


QUESTION:  So you really don't have any


explanation for that language.


MR. McCORTNEY:  All I would say, Your Honor, is


that --


QUESTION:  Which is, I suppose your explanation

is that that's as much dictum as your opponent says Sure-


Tan was.


MR. McCORTNEY:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  So it's a wash, right?


QUESTION:  Well, if that's the explanation, I


take it that Sure-Tan was dealing with a case where the


employer did know in respect to the sanction that the


employee, the alien, was illegal, so Sure-Tan did not


consider the kind of sanction here at issue, which is a


sanction that applies only to the period where the


employer did not know that the employee was an illegal,


hence the employer was not violating the immigration law.


MR. McCORTNEY:  It still doesn't address, Your


Honor, the fact that the illegal presence and the use of


fraudulent documents and working without authorization is


a violation of the INA.


QUESTION:  Is it unlawful?  That's the question


I was going to ask you.  Is -- under the immigration laws,


is it only the employer who is violating the law when he


hires, with knowledge, an illegal alien, or is it also the


case that an illegal alien who deceives an employer by


providing a false green card and who then draws pay when


he's illegally in the country, is that unlawful?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Now, I know --

 QUESTION:  I thought --


QUESTION:  -- the use of the green card is, but


is the working and getting pay unlawful under the


immigration laws?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Yes, it is.


QUESTION:  I thought IRCA itself enacted a


provision making it illegal for aliens to provide false


documentation to get employment.  That wasn't in the law


when Sure-Tan was decided, was it?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Yes, it was, Your Honor.  In


fact, let me just explain that 18 U.S.C. 1546 was already


on the books, that prohibited the use of fraudulent


documents for immigration purposes, and when IRCA came


along it amended the INA but added 1324(c), which also


prohibits the use of fraudulent documents to obtain


employment, so at the time that Sure-Tan was decided, you


had the following laws in this case that were violated by


Mr. Castro, regardless of IRCA:  entering a country


illegally in violation of 8 U.S.C. 1325, failing to


register as an alien within 30 days of his entry, a


violation of 8 U.S.C. 1302, using fraudulent documents to


obtain employment, a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1546,


remaining in this country illegally and working without


authorization, a violation of 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(5), which


was formerly 8 U.S.C. 11 --

 QUESTION:  Now, did IRCA add provisions and


impose obligations on prospective employers to require


them to review the documents and make sure that they


appear to be regular on their face?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And that was a new provision?


MR. McCORTNEY:  That was a new provision.


QUESTION:  And is there any allegation in this


case that the employer failed to comply with that?


MR. McCORTNEY:  No, Your Honor.  It's


undisputed.


QUESTION:  It's --


QUESTION:  May I ask if your position would


apply if this were a violation of the Fair Labor Standards


Act instead of the labor act?  If the employer had


underpaid the employee, would he have a right to back pay?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Your Honor, I -- in the amicus


brief of the States they seem to equate back pay under the


NLRA with back pay under the FLSA when they're two


different things.  Back pay --


QUESTION:  I understand they're two different --


I just want to know what your position is on that.


MR. McCORTNEY:  No, we would not advocate at


all, and we have not, taking wages away from undocumented


aliens that have been earned for work already performed.

 QUESTION:  Even though they -- it was a crime to


do any work?  Why -- if you're sticking with your theory


that everything that this person did on that job, from


presenting the false documentation on, was unlawful, so


why should he be paid anything for unlawful activity? 


You're making a distinction between the Fair Labor


Standards Act and the NLRA, but your theory, I think,


would cover both.


MR. McCORTNEY:  Well, Your Honor, we give


certain rights and benefits to undocumented aliens that


are already in this country, and we do that to level the


playing field between undocumented aliens and American


workers so that unscrupulous employers won't prefer


undocumented aliens over American workers.


QUESTION:  Well, furthermore, just from the


standpoint of equity, I suppose the employer has


benefitted from the services in the case that Justice


Ginsburg puts, and there's --


MR. McCORTNEY:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  -- no benefit here save, arguably,


from the illegal labor practice, but there's no benefit


for work received.


MR. McCORTNEY:  That's absolutely correct, Your


Honor.  In fact --


QUESTION:  Would you clarify one thing for me?

 MR. McCORTNEY:  Sure.


QUESTION:  Do I understand that if the employer


and the employee both know of the illegality, that then


there's no back pay?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  It seems to me that's absolutely


upside down.


MR. McCORTNEY:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  The -- and of course, you don't --


this is the Government's position, you don't have to


defend it, but in other words, as I understand the


Government's -- once the employer knows that there's a


violation and continues it, he's no longer liable for back


pay.  That's a strange calculus.


MR. McCORTNEY:  Well, Your Honor, that's the


problem with the rule, is that it in some ways rewards the


unscrupulous employer in Sure-Tan and penalizes the


innocent employer, as in Hoffman.  If the unscrupulous


employer knowingly hires an illegal alien, then whenever


some kind of union organizing drive comes along and say


gee, we can get rid of them, and we know they're illegal,


and we're going to terminate them, then they can report


them to the INS right from the outset --


QUESTION:  Mr. McCortney --


QUESTION:  Well, the difference is --

 MR. McCORTNEY:  -- get him departed, and cut off


back pay.


QUESTION:  The difference is, of course, that if


the employer knowingly hires this alien, he's subject to a


lot of other penalties under the immigration law.


MR. McCORTNEY:  That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Take an employer who, you know, all


he does, he says, I've checked their cards, I've checked


their cards, the cards say they're here legally, and he


runs some God-awful sweat shop.


Now, your theory, there is no remedy under any


law against that employer but for a prospective remedy,


and so everyone gets one bite at that apple.


QUESTION:  Well, he has to pay for the sweat,


though, doesn't he?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  And it's pretty low cost, because


he's violating every labor law under the sun.


QUESTION:  If, indeed, the worker, under this


scheme you're proposing, there's no doubt that the


document -- undocumented alien works, he's going to get


paid for the work.


MR. McCORTNEY:  Absolutely, Your Honor, no


doubt, and we have never advocated --

there's an OSHA violation.


MR. McCORTNEY:  Could be.  There could be an


OSHA violation, and we're -- as I said in answer to


Judge -- Justice Ginsburg's question, we recognize that


undocumented aliens are given certain rights and benefits


to level the playing field.


QUESTION:  What about title VII?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Under title VII, if it's back


pay exactly like back pay under the National Labor


Relations Act, where it's unearned wages for work not


performed during the back pay period, then that would be a


problem.


QUESTION:  Suppose the allegation is, they kept


me in this entry-level job, although I was qualified for


the next step, because I was a woman and they never


promote women.  That's the charge, and she wants back pay,


she wants to be paid at the rate she should have earned


absent sex discrimination.


MR. McCORTNEY:  In that situation, Your Honor,


if it were discovered that the illegal -- that this person


was an illegal alien --


QUESTION:  Make it just like this case.


MR. McCORTNEY:  Then there are other remedies


available under title VII to effectuate the policies of


the act and to enforce compliance.

 QUESTION:  I'm asking about back pay for title


VII.  You said you would treat FLSA differently, and there


would be back pay.  Here, title VII, which -- would that


go -- be bracketed with FLSA, or would it be bracketed


with the NLRA?


MR. McCORTNEY:  It would be -- if -- in your


situation, you would get back pay, and let me explain the


difference in this case.  The problem with the board's


remedy is that the very nature of the remedy creates a


duty to mitigate, which in turn requires and encourages


the illegal alien to seek interim employment, thereby


committing further and new violations of the immigrations


law.


QUESTION:  So in title VII, if she were laid


off, say, because they laid off all the women before they


laid off any men, so she would also have a duty to


mitigate in those circumstances, would the result be


different?


MR. McCORTNEY:  No.  When there's a duty to


mitigate which requires them to seek interim employment,


that is where the rub is, but under title VII, under,


like, the National Labor Relations Act, there's a whole


array of other remedies available to enforce compliance. 


Punitive damages, you can -- compensatory damages,


emotional distress, that is not dependent on the victims

authorization to work in this country.


QUESTION:  Of course, her complaint, if it were


complaint, should read something like, you know, I


shouldn't have been working at all, and it was illegal for


me to be working at all, and I'm complaining because I


only got $12,000 in illegal wages.  I should have gotten


$14,000 in illegal wages.  I don't find that a very


appealing case anyway.  Do you find that an appealing


case?


MR. McCORTNEY:  No, Your Honor, I don't.  I


don't find that an appealing case.


QUESTION:  But you just told me that you would


bracket title VII with the FLSA.


MR. McCORTNEY:  Yes, because I --


notwithstanding Justice Scalia's very good example that I


don't find that appealing, that there is a way that this


Court can distinguish between the National Labor Relations


Act, which is remedial in nature, and all these other


State and Federal discrimination laws that have punitive


features to it that are not dependent on the undocumented


alien's ability to work in this country.


QUESTION:  Well, I don't have any doubt that


there are other ways for us to distinguish this, and it


may very well be that if this were an original matter with


us we wouldn't have struck the balance where the board

did, but you've got the element here, the added element


here of the board's decision, and I suppose we owe some


kind of respect to it.  Given the confusion of statutes,


the extent to which we owe deference is not, perhaps,


clear, but we've got to give some consideration to it,


haven't we?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  If I could just supplement that, do


we owe any deference to the views of the Attorney General


of the United States, who is responsible for enforcing


these -- both statutes?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Your Honor, I don't believe so. 


Under -- we're looking at a remedial statute under 10(c)


of the NLRA, and the only deference that the board is


entitled to is, if the remedy that they order does not


conflict with the immigration laws and policies of this


country.


QUESTION:  We don't give a deference to


administrative agencies as to what damage are available in


court.  That's not part of their administration of the


laws, is it?  I don't know any case where we've said,


well, what damages -- you know, the agency can tell us


what damages we can award.  That seems quite


extraordinary.


QUESTION:  Were there agency adjudications here?

 MR. McCORTNEY:  In what way, Your Honor?  There


was a back pay hearing, there was a underlying unfair


labor practice proceeding.


QUESTION:  Which -- and the result of which was?


MR. McCORTNEY:  That the employer was found to


have violated the National Labor Relations Act.  The


administrative law judge at the back pay hearing --


QUESTION:  No, I mean, there was an


administrative order to pay, wasn't there?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Yes.


QUESTION:  That's what I thought.


MR. McCORTNEY:  But the administrative law judge


did find -- did not award any back pay to Castro because


it conflicted with -- Sure-Tan had found that it


conflicted with IRCA.


QUESTION:  But the board did.


MR. McCORTNEY:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  I guess you're quite right that if


the board's award violates the immigration law, that's the


end of the case.


MR. McCORTNEY:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  You win.  But suppose that the


immigration law doesn't forbid that award in terms, but


its policy would, in fact, be hindered, while the labor

law, actually the policy is furthered, though it doesn't


insist on this kind of award, wouldn't we defer to the


board when it seeks to reconcile, or the Attorney General


when they seek to reconcile the policies of the two


statutes?


MR. McCORTNEY:  No, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Because --


MR. McCORTNEY:  I respectfully disagree, and


this -- in Sure-Tan this Court said in devising remedies


for unfair labor practices the board is obliged to take


into account another equally important congressional


objective, to wit, the objective of deterring unauthorized


immigration that is embodied in the INA.


QUESTION:  Well, that goes back as far as


Southern Steamship Company, where you're talking about the


mutiny statute, that the board can't just go ahead without


any reference to competing statutes.


MR. McCORTNEY:  Well, Your Honor, I would agree,


if the board's remedy conflicts with the policies of


another statutory scheme, then it's -- they're owed no


deference.


QUESTION:  The board did take that into account,


though.  I don't remember what they did in this case, but


in the case where the board explained that it was, indeed,


taking into account the policy of the immigration laws and

the policy of the NRA -- what was the name of that case? 


It was affirmed on appeal.  The case where the board laid


out its reasoning for taking this position.


MR. McCORTNEY:  The APRA Fuel case?


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. McCORTNEY:  Okay.  Your Honor, the


fundamental problem with this case is that this Court


stated in Sure-Tan that the objective of the INA is to


deter unauthorized immigration, and that a --


QUESTION:  But let's go back to one thing it


also said in Sure-Tan, which is that the court of appeals


here made an estimate without any evidence as to the


period of time these employees might have continued


working before apprehension by the INS, and that sounds --


working before apprehension by the INS, that sounds very


close to what the board did in this case?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Well, Your Honor, also in Sure-


Tan, in the last sentence of the remedial section of the


opinion it states, by directing the board to impose a


minimum back pay award without regard to the employee's


actual economic losses or legal availability to work, the


court of appeals plainly exceeded its limited authority


under the act.  It made it clear that it wasn't just


actual losses that was the problem, it was the fact that


the discriminatees were not either legally present or

legally authorized to work.


QUESTION:  So then, what do you make of the


condition about the period between the violation and when


the employees might have continued working before


apprehension by the INS?


MR. McCORTNEY:  Your Honor, I don't know,


because the discriminatees in that case were -- left the


country the same day their employment terminated.


QUESTION:  I'm not talking about the outcome of


that particular case, where they were in Mexico, but a


case where they were here, and the question was, how much


back pay, and there's a reference to not a flat 6 weeks or


6 months or whatever, but a time period from the unlawful


employment practice until one would expect the INS would


pick up these people.


MR. McCORTNEY:  Your Honor, again I think that


is consistent with the other language in the Sure-Tan


decision which is repeated over and over again about legal


availability to work, and being legally authorized to


work, and why would the Court use that language if it


didn't have to?


So I -- getting back to the policy of this that


underlies the immigration laws of this country, it is to


preserve jobs for American workers.  It is not the act of


illegal entry that takes jobs away from American workers.

It's the act of working in this country without


authorization that takes jobs away from American workers,


and I would submit that the continued presence of an


illegal alien in this country poses a greater threat to


American jobs than an alien who enters this country


repeatedly, because the latter presupposes that the alien


has been physically absent from the job market for a


period of time.


If the -- under the board's scenario, the Sure-


Tan discriminatees could have reentered on a tourist visa


and be legally present and not legally authorized to work,


and under that scenario they're clearly not entitled to


back pay because it violates 1182(a)(5), that sets forth


the terms and conditions on which aliens can work in this


country and those that can't.


The same would be true of aliens who enter the


country on a student visa, or who overstay their visa and


work without authorization, so whether you have an alien


that enters this country illegally and works without


authorization, or who enters this country legally and


works without authorization, both takes jobs away from


American workers, and both violate the INA.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. McCortney.


Mr. Wolfson, we'll hear from you.


MR. McCORTNEY:  Thank you, Your Honor.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. Q, WOLFSON


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


QUESTION:  Mr. Wolfson, before you get to the


substance of the matter, I want to ask a question that


sort of relates to something that Justice Steven asked --


Stevens asked, and that is, can we take it that this -- I


know that the SG's office usually reconciles the views of


various agencies before a case is argued here.  What was


the position of the Immigration and Naturalization


Service --


MR. WOLFSON:  Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  -- in this matter when it was told


that it -- that you're going to argue that courts should


pay illegal aliens money that it was unlawful for them to


earn?  What did the INS say to that?


MR. WOLFSON:  Justice Scalia -- may it please


the Court -- the position in our brief has been developed


in consultation with the Immigration and Naturalization


Service.  This is the position of the United States,


and --


with it?


QUESTION:  I understand that.  Did the INS agree


MR. WOLFSON:  The INS has agreed with it and


accepts it, and I'm here representing --


QUESTION:  They accept it.

 MR. WOLFSON:  Right.


QUESTION:  They have no choice --

QUESTION:  -- but to accept it if the Attorney


General --


MR. WOLFSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- tells them to.  Well, I mean, if


they agreed with it, and just thought --


MR. WOLFSON:  The INS --


QUESTION:  -- well, I have no -- it explains why


we have a massive problem of illegal immigration, if


that's how the INS feels about this.


MR. WOLFSON:  I must disagree with that, Justice


Scalia, and the point is, as the board recognized both in


this decision and in the APRA Fuel decision which preceded


it, the essential problem is that there is, as the board


pointed out, an inseverable connection between illegal


immigration, the availability of jobs, and poor working


conditions for employees for -- that illegal immigrants


are wiling to take in the United States.


Now, Congress enacted IRCA on the premise that


there was very little that it could do about the wage


differential and the difference in levels of employment,


unemployment that was drawing illegal immigrants to the


United States in search of jobs.

existing law, or to limit the powers of labor relations


board to remedy unfair practices committed against


undocumented employees?


MR. WOLFSON:  That is exactly right, so


QUESTION:  What is exactly right, that is what


the legislative history --


MR. WOLFSON:  That is what the legislative


history says, but simultaneously in the --

mean, was this a really powerful portion of legislative


history?

QUESTION:  Of the House or the Senate?


MR. WOLFSON:  Of the House.

 MR. WOLFSON:  But I don't have just legislative


history --


QUESTION:  Two committees in one House.


MR. WOLFSON:  I think it is important also to


note that in IRCA Congress also wrote into law


authorization of increased resources for enforcement of


Federal labor laws by the Department of Labor by the Wage


and Hour Division and the Office of Federal Contract


Compliance.


QUESTION:  Did that include -- did it include


the National Labor Relations Board?


MR. WOLFSON:  It did not refer to the National


Labor Relations Board, but the point is, Congress knew


that the Department of Labor was enforcing and should


enforce Federal labor laws at the behest of and for the


benefit of illegal aliens to obtain back pay for them.


QUESTION:  They wanted to be sure that aliens


who had no right to be here, had no right to be earning


any money --


MR. WOLFSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- should get paid for periods that


they didn't work?  It's not a matter of their having


worked and provided the employer with a benefit, which


you're then reimbursing them for, but they haven't worked.


MR. WOLFSON:  It is -- it's not just periods for

which they have worked, which might arguably distinguish


the Fair Labor Standards Act --


QUESTION:  Right.  Right.


MR. WOLFSON:  -- minimum -- you know, maximum


hours and minimum wage.  It's also the Office of Federal


Contract Compliance, which enforces antidiscrimination


provisions, routinely seeks back pay for aliens and others


who have been terminated in violation of executive orders.


Another --


QUESTION:  Even though it's unlawful for them to


receive that money?


MR. WOLFSON:  Even though -- yes, even though it


is.


QUESTION:  That's extraordinary.  I --


MR. WOLFSON:  It's a very --


QUESTION:  Let me --


MR. WOLFSON:  -- fundamental part of the Fair


Labor Standard Act.  Excuse me.


QUESTION:  In most back pay situations where the


employer has committed an unfair labor practice and


dismisses an employee improperly, the amount he's going to


be stuck with for back pay is limited by the fact that the


person unlawfully fired has to mitigate.  He has to find


another job.  If he could have gotten another job easily


and doesn't do so, the employer doesn't have to pay.  Now,

it?

exactly, Justice Scalia.  Here's -- I wouldn't say that


the undocumented alien has a duty to mitigate.  I have to


emphasize that the board is not --


QUESTION:  He does not have a duty to mitigate?


MR. WOLFSON:  I will agree with that.  I have to


say the board has not examined this issue in detail, but


first of all, of course, anything that he does obtain in


the matter of interim wages will be deducted from his back


pay --


with --


QUESTION:  Oh.  Oh.


MR. WOLFSON:  -- and that is quite consistent


QUESTION:  If he unlawfully obtains another job,


that will be deducted?


MR. WOLFSON:  And -- yes, and that is quite


consistent --

that.


MR. WOLFSON:  Not --

MR. WOLFSON:  Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  I can just sit home and eat


chocolates and get my back pay.


MR. WOLFSON:  I don't agree that the board would


have to accept such a representation.  That is, the board


might permissibly conclude that an undocumented alien


should not be any better off than an authorized worker by


virtue of his undocumented status, so if an employer could


say, well, if a person with the same credentials,


background, education, and so forth, would have made a job


search and would have obtained employment and would have


obtained thus-and-such wages, this undocumented alien


worker would have --


QUESTION:  Should have done so.


MR. WOLFSON:  Should have done -- or should


have --


QUESTION:  Should have violated the law.


MR. WOLFSON:  Or should not benefit from the


fact that he is an undocumented alien and being relieved


of -- and getting more back pay than the similarly


situated authorized worker.


Now, the board was faced with the task here of


reconciling two important Federal statutory schemes, the


Federal labor laws and the immigration laws, consistent --

the Immigration Act in this case.


MR. WOLFSON:  That is correct, Mr. Chief


Justice, but I -- but the board did look to IRCA and the


Court can look to IRCA, which includes these other


provisions in the Department of Labor, to determine what


Congress is attempting to achieve in IRCA, and those are,


I think, reasonable indicators of what Congress'


objectives were and how far it intended to go along with


the legislative history of the --


QUESTION:  Well, when the board makes its


calculus and when the Government made its calculus, did it


give any consideration to the fact that a union ought not


as a matter of policy to use illegal aliens for organizing


activity, or do you think the union can do that?


MR. WOLFSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  Is it consistent with the labor laws


of the United States for the union to say it knowingly


uses an alien for organizing activity?


MR. WOLFSON:  I don't know that the board has


addressed the point of knowingly using illegal aliens.  I

do know that the board has concluded that undocumented


aliens may be included within the bargaining unit, and


indeed, in both Sure-Tan -- in Sure-Tan itself I believe


they were included in the bargaining unit.


QUESTION:  And that doesn't induce illegal


immigration?


MR. WOLFSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  It seems to me that's a far more


direct link than the very tenuous idea that you have that


there's going to be more illegal immigration because they


know they're going to get back pay.  Here, what you're


saying is that a union can, I suppose even knowingly, use


illegal aliens on the workforce to organize the employer,


knowing that by doing that the alien will still be


entitled to back pay.  That seems to me completely missing


from any calculus, from any equitable calculus in your


brief.  I just -- and since it's a more direct link, I'm


quite puzzled by it.


MR. WOLFSON:  Well, I don't know -- I would


suggest that the more powerful inducement towards illegal


migration is the availability of the job, union or no. 


That is, even if the union is willing to include


undocumented workers in its bargaining unit, there still


has to be a job for that worker, and it is the employer


who is fundamentally in control of that matter, and it is

the employer --


QUESTION:  Mr. Wolfson, in these cases we're


only talking about a situation where the employer, and


presumably the union, too, doesn't know, because if the


employer knows, then the employer's obligation is to


dismiss that person, as I assume it would be the union's,


too, but in all these cases the issue comes up only


because the employer didn't know of the illegality, isn't


that so?


MR. WOLFSON:  Well, in this case the employer


did not know.  Now, there are cases, I have to say, where


the employer does know, such as the APRA Fuel Corporation


that was referred to, and in that case what the board has


done is, it has said that the board -- the board has


ordered reinstatement on condition that the undocumented


alien put himself into a situation where he can obtain


reinstatement legally.  That is, under no circumstances


does the board order reinstatement of an employee who


everybody knows is undocumented.


QUESTION:  But not back pay.


MR. WOLFSON:  It does order back pay up to the


point where either the employee is reinstated, or it


terminates at a reasonable -- if the employee fails to put


himself in compliance with the immigration laws and become


qualified, the board cuts off back pay as of the end of a

reasonable period.  That is consistent --


QUESTION:  Even though the employer -- I thought


that the rule was, as soon as the employer knows of the


illegality we're not going to allow any back pay from then


on.


MR. WOLFSON:  Well, that is because in a case


like this, what the board is doing is affording the


employer the benefit of its general, after-acquired


evidence rule.


QUESTION:  If he knows about illegality from the


very beginning, then we will --


MR. WOLFSON:  Well, in a situation --


QUESTION:  We will order back pay?


MR. WOLFSON:  Yes, because in a situation like


that the employee -- the employer is not well-situated to


claim the benefit of the after-acquired evidence rule,


because it cannot claim that it wouldn't have hired the


alien anyway.


To use an example --


QUESTION:  So you have two people violating the


law, instead of one.


MR. WOLFSON:  Well, there are two people


violating the law here, Justice Scalia.  I mean, the


board -- I mean, there aren't two people violating the


immigration laws, but the employer did violate the

National Labor Relations Act, and the board is quite


properly --


QUESTION:  From the time of his initial hiring


up until his violation.  I mean, but what you're saying is


when both the employer and the employee are violating the


law, we're going to -- you're asking the courts to give


their benediction to this stark violation of United States


law by awarding money that hasn't even been worked for. 


I -- it's just something courts don't do.


MR. WOLFSON:  Well, the board is charged with


the responsibility of developing a workable implementation


of the National Labor Relations Act pursuant to its


authority under section 10(c).  In doing so, it of course


must take into consideration the policies of the


immigration law, but there is no --


QUESTION:  What it's doing, though, really is


kind of odd, because the result is that back pay awards to


illegal workers are likely to be greater than to legal


ones under this board's policy, and that's so odd, and it


gives the illegal alien an incentive to try to phony up


more documents and to extend for the longest possible time


the charade that the worker is here lawfully, and that's


surely strongly against the policies of the immigration


act at the very least.


MR. WOLFSON:  The problem, Justice O'Connor, is

that the immigration act, the policies come down on both


sides.


I mean, yes, they obviously discourage illegal


immigration and obtaining of jobs by illegal immigrants,


but they also very strongly operate on the employer, and


the fundamental premise on which Congress enacted IRCA was


that it was the employer's -- the employer had a very


strong and natural economic and competitive incentive to


hire illegal workers, and it is that -- it is -- the


board's concern, in this case I think quite properly, is


that if back pay were removed from the equation the --


QUESTION:  Well, but you --


MR. WOLFSON:  -- Congress's attempt to -- excuse


me.  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  You say it comes down on both sides,


and it makes certain acts by illegal immigrants illegal,


the entry, and it makes certain acts by the employer


illegal.  Here, the worker, the alien was violating the


law.  The employer was not violating the law.  So you say


it comes down on both sides.  If both were violating the


law I could see your point, but the employer was not


violating the law.


MR. WOLFSON:  That is correct, Mr. Chief


Justice, but the board is attempting to fashion -- the


board doesn't know in advance which employer will violate

the law by hiring undocumented aliens knowingly and which


will not, or which employer will, you know --


QUESTION:  So you say this is a prophylactic


rule?


MR. WOLFSON:  I think that the board is


fashioning a rule that is implementing Congress' policy


objective in IRCA across the board.


QUESTION:  But shouldn't remedies be looked at


after the fact, let's find out who violated what and then


fashion the appropriate remedy?


MR. WOLFSON:  Well, the Court has not said that


the board has to only fashion its remedies in a case in


which the precise situation -- you know, in the precise


situation into which it's dedicated.


In a case called NLRB v., I think, 7-Up Bottling


Company the Court explained that the board can make its


back pay calculations for the purpose of across-the-board


rules rather than just the employer to which -- that is


before the board itself, and the point is, even though


this employer, even though there's no evidence that this


employer violated IRCA when it -- nonetheless the board, I


think, could quite reasonably say, well, if -- or if there


is a flat rule that employees will never get back pay when


they are terminated in violation of the National Labor


Relations Act, employers then will pick up on that rule

and they will say, okay, now I can get away with it


because there's not going to be any remedy for any


employee, and this is a very large --


QUESTION:  They won't get away with it.  They're


subject to prosecution for -- if they know that it's an


illegal --


MR. WOLFSON:  It's not just the problem of their


knowing that they're illegal hiring.  There also is the


paperwork obligations, the verification systems, and I


think there is a very real concern that an employer who


knows that there's not really any monetary price to being


lax in hiring, in checking whether illegal aliens are


hired would say, well, on the one hand I just have the


civil violations for violating the paperwork concerns.  On


the other hand, the labor of undocumented aliens is in a


very real sense much --


QUESTION:  But it's just not reasonable --


QUESTION:  Why should the board be responsible


for making sure that the employer documents his material


about illegal aliens?


MR. WOLFSON:  I don't think that -- it's not


that the board is implementing IRCA, Mr. Chief Justice. 


It is that its policy here is consistent with the policies


that I've been discussing.


QUESTION:  Well, here's the thing.  When an

employer reviews documents and concludes that they're


valid and the person is lawfully here, then the employer


isn't going to get some advantage of hiring some illegal


alien because the worker will have to be paid and given


benefits as though the worker were legally here, so


there's no incentive for the employer under those


circumstances to give a bum deal to the employee.


QUESTION:  None at all.


QUESTION:  But there is an incentive, it seems


to me, for the employee to continue to conceal the facts,


the facts that he's here illegally and has no right to


work, and that the documents are false, and the board's


rule fosters both those --


MR. WOLFSON:  But one does have to take into


account I think what would be the consequence of an


opposite rule, that is, no back pay for an undocumented


alien, and there is, I think, a very serious consequence


that a flat rule that said something like, 7 million


undocumented workers just simply get no back pay at all if


they are in this country illegally and not employed.


That is a very large class of people to


basically say, you are just without a remedy under the


National Labor Relations Act, and there may be


implications for other Federal labor laws as well, and --


QUESTION:  But why should they be used to

organize a bargaining unit --


MR. WOLFSON:  Because it --


QUESTION:  -- if they're illegal employees?  I'm


baffled by that.


MR. WOLFSON:  Because it -- well, because the


labor laws benefit everybody, and it's not just -- I mean,


they are -- when I say they're organizing a bargaining


unit, obviously they are -- there may be -- in this case


there were other citizens and authorized aliens who are


interested in organizing for the purpose of vindicating


their rights under section 7 of the labor relations act. 


The Court pointed this out in Sure-Tan, where it said it


is appropriate to include illegal aliens within the


definition of employees, because all the workers are in it


together.


QUESTION:  I would have thought, Mr. Wolfson,


that when you said, you know, there are 7 million illegal


aliens in this country, that what you would follow that


with is not, that's an awful lot of people not to give


back pay to.  I would have thought you would follow it


with, we have to do something to reduce this massive


number of 7 million illegal aliens.


MR. WOLFSON:  And what --


QUESTION:  And what you don't want to do to


reduce it is to give them back pay.

 MR. WOLFSON:  Now, there is no question that


there is a serious problem of illegal immigration, and the


INS and the Attorney General dedicate substantial


resources to attempting to resolve that problem.


On the other hand, Congress without question


recognized when it enacted IRCA that this was a many-


faceted problem, and one aspect of the problem was that


there was a natural magnet in drawing illegal,


undocumented workers here in the wage differential, and


that employers were willing to give jobs, and that it


should not be cheaper for an employer to hire an


undocumented alien than it is to hire --


QUESTION:  Okay, but the argument, Mr.


Wolfson -- every time -- and I understand that argument. 


Every time you make that argument, it seems to me the


answer comes back, there are other ways to go against the


employer.  You can fine the employer, you can bring


criminal actions against the employer, and so on, so that


the answer always is the effort to discourage employers


from hiring illegal aliens doesn't depend upon the back


pay.


I thought the board's position was strongest to


counter that when the board says, there's kind of the gray


area in which it's not clear that we can prosecute.  The


evidence of what the employer knew at the relevant time is

not leaping out at us, and so what we are trying to do is


to fashion a remedy for those cases in which it's not


practical to prosecute, but which we know perfectly well


in the real world employers are winking at the likelihood


that they're employing illegal aliens.  That's the group


that we want to provide the inducement for by forcing back


pay.  Is -- am I giving the board too much credit?


MR. WOLFSON:  I wouldn't say that the board has


limited -- it certainly hasn't limited its remedy to that


situation --


QUESTION:  Well, why then, in the question --


why in the question -- because I have exactly the same


question.  That's exactly what I thought.  In the question


that the Government presented it says, whether an order to


pay back pay to an employee who was discriminatorily laid


off, but only up to the date on which petitioner


discovered that the employee was an undocumented alien,


whether that kind of order is lawful.  That's how you saw


the question presented.


Now are you telling me that what I'm supposed to


decide is a case I really didn't think I had to decide,


which is, what happens if the board awards back pay to


others, such as those whom the employer has always known


were illegal?


MR. WOLFSON:  We are not suggesting that the

Court has to decide that case here.  Indeed, in our brief


in opposition to the cert petition we pointed out that


that was a different set of cases, the set of cases under


the APRA --


QUESTION:  Well, if it's a narrow question, just


what Justice Souter said I had taken to be the precise


rationale for the narrow set of cases we're supposed to


decide.  Now, maybe that's all not so.  That, I think, is


what he was saying, and I'm seconding it.


QUESTION:  Clearly you haven't missed your


opportunity.


(Laughter.)


MR. WOLFSON:  Justice Breyer, my point is that


the board in a case -- the board did rely on its APRA Fuel


decision in this case, but what it held in this case was


that an employer, once an employer learns that an alien is


undocumented and therefore he cannot be hired, and in


addition that the board accepts that that employer would


not have hired that alien and would have discharged the


alien when it found out that he was undocumented, then the


employer should surely get the benefit of the after-


acquired evidence rule that is applied in many, many kinds


of Federal labor laws, including the Age Discrimination


Act, for example.


QUESTION:  Once you adopt that rule, however, it

seems to me that the asserted benefit to the immigration


laws that you're claiming this rule has disappears.  It is


no disincentive to any employer, because the only employer


who would get the benefit of the rule that you don't get


any back pay would be the perfectly innocent employer who


hires someone not knowing that the person is an unlawful


alien.  How are you possibly deterring anybody?


You're trying to deter the employer who hires an


immigrant, apparently with this in the back of his mind: 


I know this guy's an immigrant and I can commit an unfair


labor practice upon him.  I'm rather skeptical whether


that's high in the mind of any employer, but assuming it


is, you still have to assume, if he's going to be


deterred, that he knows that the person is an illegal


immigrant, but this rule only applies to people who don't


know.


MR. WOLFSON:  Well, whether or not -- he may not


know in the face of having clear, irrefutable evidence


before him.  On the other hand, he may be induced to be


somewhat lax in his compliance with the obligations of the


verification system, because --


QUESTION:  Well, get him for that, then.  Get 


him for that, then.


MR. WOLFSON:  Well, that -- of course, that's


not --

 QUESTION:  But your -- isn't another way to


describe the class you're dealing with is, he may not know


in the sense that the Government can prove that he knew,


but there is a class of employees as to whom the evidence


is not clear, and it is that class that we want to provide


the negative inducement for.  Isn't that the answer?


MR. WOLFSON:  I think at a, I would say at a


minimum that is the answer, and the board cannot know in


advance --


QUESTION:  Why should the board take over


responsibility for those provisions that are basically


immigration law provisions?


MR. WOLFSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, the board does


not view itself as enforcing the immigration laws.  I


think the question is, is this particular order


inconsistent with the immigration laws, or is it


consistent, and for some of the reasons that are being


expressed here, all that we are saying is that it does


not -- it is consistent with them.


Surely there is no direct conflict with the


immigration laws.  The board --


QUESTION:  What you just agreed to in your


colloquy with Justice Souter does contradict the


immigration -- I remember when this statute was passed


about what the responsibility of the employer was.  It was

a clear provision of the statute that all the employer has


to do is check the papers.  It isn't the responsibility of


the employer to look behind the papers and see whether


it's forged.


Now you're saying, ah, but there are some


employers that maybe, yeah, you know, they complied with


the provision of the law, they looked at the card, which


is what the -- there was a big fight over that.  How much


is -- investigatory responsibility is going to be placed


on the employer, and the answer was basically none, just


look at the documentation, and now you're saying, but some


employers, we think they should have known better, and


we're going to impose on this class of employers and, as


it turns out, on a lot of others, liability which they


shouldn't have.


MR. WOLFSON:  They don't have any liability


under IRCA.  I mean, nobody is suggesting that the board


can impose a liability under IRCA, but there is a concern,


I think, that if en employer is totally exempted from back


pay, a back pay remedy under another Federal labor law,


that that does -- that does work an inducement on the part


of the employer to hire illegal aliens.


QUESTION:  Do no more than what the statute


requires.  Check the documentation.  If the documentation


is there, and valid on its face, he's entitled to proceed.

That's what the fight was about, and that's how the


immigration law came out.


MR. WOLFSON:  I do want to touch a bit on Sure-


Tan, which I haven't had much of a chance to discuss. 


Our -- we have submitted in our brief that we think that


the facts of the Sure -- of the situation in Sure-Tan


really make it quite distinguishable from this particular


case.  In Sure-Tan, first of all I do want to point out


that the condition that the Court explained and put on a


reinstatement and back pay remedy, those did originate in


the Seventh Circuit, and no party to this Court challenged


that condition, that reinstatement and back pay had to be


conditioned on the employee showing that he was legally


authorized to be present and employed in the United


States.


Now, the Court perceived that what happened in


Sure-Tan was essentially the employer was being forced to


say to the employee, you have a guaranteed job and a


paycheck waiting for you right now, so come back to the


United States right now and pick it up.  I mean, that


obviously is a very powerful lure to an employee to


migrate back to the United States if there is no condition


that the employee show that he is authorized.


We submit that the incentives work quite


differently in a case like this where the employee does

remain in the United States.  Congress did enact IRCA on


the assumption that illegal, undocumented alien employees


in the United States were at the very bottom of the wage


scale, they were likely to remain here as long as they


could get any job that was available, and as against that,


we submit that the inducement to violate the immigration


laws that petitioner suggests by the prospect of waiting


around after years of litigation for the prospect of some


kind of back pay award at the end of the day is quite


minimal, and all the courts that have looked at this under


other Federal law such as title VII and the FLSA have


agreed that it is not the prospect of a back pay award


that induces illegal migration or illegal stay in the


United States, it is the prospect of any job at any wage


that is available, and so the incentives do operate quite


differently here than they did in Sure-Tan.


QUESTION:  Mr. Wolfson, do you think a State


court could enforce a contract for employment by an


illegal alien?


MR. WOLFSON:  I do not think that a State court


could --


QUESTION:  You know, an illegal --


MR. WOLFSON:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- makes a contract with an employer,


then it is -- he sues because the employer doesn't go

ahead with it, and -- could a State court say, well, you


made the contract, you should be liable for damages?


MR. WOLFSON:  I think a State court could award


damages, and State courts have done so.  It could not


order specific performance, because that would order -- it


could not order specific performance in ordering the


employer to employ the person because that would be


employment in violation of IRCA, but there, there would be


a direct conflict with IRCA, but State courts have --


QUESTION:  There's no doctrine that conflicts in


violation of the law are unenforceable?


MR. WOLFSON:  They're not necessarily completely


void.  I mean, not just contracts, but State courts have


awarded tort damages for lost wages.  It is universally


the rule that undocumented aliens are entitled to Worker's


Compensation.  I think only two States have gone the other


way, and all of the State courts that have looked at that


have said, yes, it is true, when the employee is just --


you know, is injured and claims Worker's Compensation he


is claiming a measure of compensation that is related to


the employment he would have had, but nonetheless, the


vast majority of State courts have held that illegal


aliens can proceed under the Worker's Compensation rules,


and the same is true of tort and contract damages as well.


QUESTION:  But all of that is for work done --

 MR. WOLFSON:  No --


QUESTION: 

-- or injury suffered, not to


enforce a contract which has not been executed, which is


what's going on here.


MR. WOLFSON:  Well, there may -- perhaps there


is a difference between tort and contract damages, but it


is not just for work done.  If it is for injury suffered,


it is for injury suffered as measured against that the


work would have been done, or work that would have been


done.  I mean, surely that's the case in tort damages or 


Worker's Compensation, where the employee says, I would


have worked and you owe me this money.


Thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Wolfson.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:16 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
