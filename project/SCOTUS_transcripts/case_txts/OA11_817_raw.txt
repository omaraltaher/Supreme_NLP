and a requirement that dogs be virtually infallible. 

 That -- that --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Garre --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That -- that goes to the 

the -- some showing that the test -- that the training 
program is reputable, some showing that the handler, not 
only the dog, has -- has had training, it seems to me 
those two -- not -- there's nothing improper about that. 

1  converting probable cause, which this Court has referred 
2  to as a substantial chance, or fair probability, of the 
3  detection of contraband or evidence of a crime, into 
4  what amounts to a continuously updated batting average

17  training program, which -- which we think is a training 
18  program in which the dog is going to be tested for 
19  proficiency, including in a setting where some vehicles

 MR. GARRE:  Well, and I think, Your Honor, 
under our view of it, it's okay to inquire into whether

 And Aldo, the dog in this case, clearly was.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why didn't -- then why 

search, the certification had expired 16 months. 

 MR. GARRE:  It was a lapse, Your Honor.  The 

1  weekly training, in which part of that training 
2  consisted of taking him out, walking him by some 
3  vehicles that contained cars, some vehicles that didn't. 
4
 And the testimony of Officer Wheetley was 
that Aldo's performance was really good.  And what he 
5
6  meant by that was that if there were eight cars with 
7  drugs. 
8
9  didn't they get the dog recertified?  By the time of the 
10
11
12  dog subsequently was recertified. 
13
14  doesn't impose an annual certification requirement. 
15
16
 I think, more important in this case was the 
17  fact that the dog was continuously trained, continuously 
18  evaluated in training. 
19
20
21  trained. 
22
23  most important thing is successful completion of 
24  proficiency testing.

 MR. GARRE:  Well, certainly that it was

2  really for the courts to delve into all aspects of the 
3  training, what types of distracters were used, what type 
4  of smell and printing was used and the like.
5
6  that -- you have the show that the program was 
7  reputable. 
8
9  authentic, Your Honor.  And here, the programs were --
were conducted by actual police departments in -- in 
10
11 
Alabama and Florida.  And this Court ordinarily would 
12 
presume regularity in those sorts of training settings.

19  certification.  Certification usually is done by private 
20
21  officers.  But the training itself, it usually and here 
22  was done by police departments themselves.

content of the training process, and what the results 
were and how they were measured, how do you expect a 
judge to decide whether the certification and the 
training are sufficiently adequate. 

 MR. GARRE:  And I think that the central 

inquiry that we would think the judge would undertake is 

 MR. GARRE:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's no national 

1  national standard for certification.  That's correct?

4  standard that defines what's adequate training, correct.
 MR. GARRE:  That's right.  There --
5
6
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So -- let me just finish 
7  my question.  So assuming there's no national standards, 
8  then how do you expect a judge, without asking questions 
9  about the content of the certification process, the 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  to determine whether or not the dog was performing 
17  successfully in proficiency testing. 
18
19  dogs.  And if --
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you still have to 
ask what that training was, and the judge still has to 
determine whether the judge believes it was adequate, 
correct?  That's what the totality of circumstances 
requires.

 I mean -- after all, that's why we train the 

 MR. GARRE:  Well, Your Honor, in our view,

Alderson Reporting Company

brief. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what does a judge do, 

 MR. GARRE:  Not -- you would have to accept 
it, Your Honor, on its face.  I think you -- in a record 

1  we don't think it's -- it's an appropriate role for the 
2  Court to delve into the contours of the training, what 
3  specific methods were used to train or distract or --
4  you know, all the contours that they bring up in their 
5
6
7  just say, the police department says this is adequate, 
8  so I have to accept it's adequate? 
9
10
11  like this -- and I think this record is clearly 
12  sufficient -- and, ultimately, that's what we're asking 
13  this Court to hold -- what you have in the record 
14  is evidence --
15
16 
17 
18
19  understanding what -- how -- the legal rule you're 
asking us to announce.  I think the legal rule, you're 
20
21  saying, if the dog has been tested for proficiency by a 
22  police department's determination of what's adequate for 
23  proficiency, that establishes probable cause.  That's 
24  what I think the rule you want us to -- to do.
25

 I don't know what the role of the judge is 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Garre, I -- I have 

no problem that this record -- with this record.  My 
problem is how do we rule. 

 Because it seems the me that I'm not quite

 MR. GARRE:  Certification is not required. 

 MR. GARRE:  I think it would be close --

whether or not the dog successfully treated -- completed

13  establish reliability a different way, but certification 
14  itself is not required when you have a record of the

 MR. GARRE:  -- I think one area where the

14  officers and --

 So if there is no certification, no

3  third.  You said, or otherwise show proficiency in 
4  locating narcotics.
5
6  training, how would the state establish that the dog was 
7  reliable in detecting drugs? 
8
9  would be the unusual case, and it probably would be 
captured by the other factors; but, what we meant by 
10
11 
including that is that there's no limit on the types of 
evidence that the police could submit to show 
12 
13 
reliability. 
14
15
16  a dog like Aldo successfully performed in weekly 
17  training over the course of the year, and the police 
18  submitted the records, like the records in the Joint 
19  Appendix in this case at pages 106 and 116, that might 
20
21
 But the -- the central way would be showing 
22  that the dog successfully completed training or that the 
23  dog was certified. 
24
25

 If you didn't have certification or a formal 
training program, the fact that there was evidence that 

be another way of establishing reliability. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And I think you'll agree 

that the handler, too, the handler would have to --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Not -- not certification, 

 MR. GARRE:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- to work with drug 

 MR. GARRE:  Well, Your Honor, we don't think 
1
2  there is a Fourth Amendment requirement of certification 
3  for handlers.  Again, this is something that varies 
4  among states.
5
6  but that the handler has been -- has been trained --

 MR. GARRE:  That's correct.  And Officer 
10
11  Wheetley here, of course, had been trained.  He had 
12  gotten a 160-hour course in narcotics detection, and had 
13  done training with Aldo in the Dothan, Alabama police 
14  department, 40 hours there.
 And these dog -- the dog, Aldo, and Officer 
15
16  Wheetley had worked together for about a year before the 
17  time of the search. 
 The handlers themselves are going to be in 
18
19  the best position to know the dogs and evaluate their 
20
21  the dogs are reliable.  That's both because they don't

 How and when and who determines when a dog's 

reliable in predicting the presence --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I'm somewhat 

1  the most dangerous encounters police officers face. 
2  They're not going to want to be working with a dog that 
3  is consistently putting the officer in a position of 
4  searching cars based on an alert when that dog is not 
5
6
7  troubled by all of the studies that have been presented 
8  to the Court, particularly the Australian one where, 
9  under a controlled setting, one dog alerted correctly 
10
11
12  reliability in alerting has reached a critical failure 
13  number?  And what is -- what do you suggest that number 
14  is, and how does a judge determine that that's being 
15
16
17  Fourth Amendment puts a number on it.  This Court has 
18  rejected a numerical conception of probable cause. 
19

23 
24 
25

troubled by a dog that alerts only 12 percent of the 
time.  Whatever -- whether we have a fixed number or an 
unfixed number, that seems like less than probability 
for me.

 But with respect --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I'm deeply 

monitored? 

 MR. GARRE:  We don't think the 

 MR. GARRE:  But, but let me -- let me 

13

 But there is another part of that study 

1  address the, the South Wales study, Your Honor, which I 
2  think is the one that you were referring to and that's 
3  the primary one relied on by the other side.  In that 
4  case they reported that over the course of several years 
the dogs' alerts resulted in discovery of drugs only 26 
5
6  percent of the time. 
7
8  which doesn't come up in the amicus briefs, and that's 
9  that in 60 percent of the other cases the individuals 
admitted to using drugs or being in the proximity of 
10
11 
drugs.  And if you include that in the universe of 
accurate alerts, as you should, then the number becomes 
12 
13 
70 percent of dogs accurately alerting.  That 70 percent 
based on the primary study that they rely upon --

MR. GARRE:  Well, primarily by looking at 
whether the dog has successfully completed training. 
And you're right, dogs do go out of service when they 
reach a certain age.  Dogs, like humans, become old and 
impaired over time.  But -- but looking at weekly 
training records, like are available in this case, dogs 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That doesn't answer what 
happens to the dogs who have -- dogs grow old.  They are 
taken out of service for a reason.  So how -- how is a 
court supposed to monitor whether or not a dog has 
fallen out of --

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 And this is an area where we think that a 

 And, after all, I think the most problematic 

aspect of the challenges to the reliability of these 

predictors of the evidence of contraband, evidence 

1  that successfully perform week in and week out in 
2  training are going to successfully perform in the -- in 
3  the real world. 
4
5
6  dogs is that law enforcement agencies across the country 
7  at the state and Federal level, law enforcement agencies 
8  around the world, and law enforcement agencies that 
9  protect this Court rely on detection dogs as reliable 
10
11  of the presence of explosives or likewise. 
12
13  page of logic and experience is worth a volume -- a page 
14  of experience and history is worth a volume of logic. 
These dogs have been used and are being used in many 
15
16  settings across the country and across the world today. 
17  And the reason they are being used is because the people 
18  who work with them know that they are reliable and --
19  and know by experience that they are reliable.
20
21  have with the argument on the other side, is that 
22  ultimately this Court should distrust the reliability of 
23  the dogs.  And again --

understand your argument?  Because -- suppose in a case 

 And that's one of the central problems we

worth anybody's time at that point. 

 MR. GARRE:  Your Honor, I think that the 

it's, you know, a small universe of cases. 

1  the government comes in, says this dog has been through 
2  training and the handler has been through training.  And 
3  this is a case in which -- this is never going to come 
4  up when the dog actually alerts to narcotics; it's not 
5
6
 It's only going to come up in a case like 
7  this, where a dog alerts to narcotics, there is no --
8  there are no narcotics, but something else is found, and 
9  so the person ends up being criminally prosecuted.  So 
10
11
 So the government comes in and says that the 
12  dog has been trained.  Can -- can the criminal defendant 
13  at that point call the handler, say, how has the dog 
14  been trained, what are the methods that -- that the dog 
15
16  Can the -- can the defendant do that. 
17
18  defendant can call the handler and can ask those sorts 
19  of questions.  I think the court would cut it off if you 
20
21  play-reward or the scent-imprinting method in training. 
22  Well, what specifics -- because I think that delves too 
23  far into the details. 
24
25

has -- was used, and how did the dog do in training? 

got into questions like, well, did they use the 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you can ask questions 

like how did the dog do in training. 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. GARRE:  Yes, and that was done here. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And how about if you really, 

led to a lot of subconscious cueing by the handler. 

because they haven't argued that the dog was cued.  The 
argument is the dog was just sort of inherently 
reliable. 

1
2
3  if there were some articles that said, you know, that 
4  there was a certain kind of method that, for example, 
5
6  Could the -- could the criminal defendant say, did you 
7  use that method that leads to these problematic results? 
8
9  Honor.  First of all, cueing is not part of this case 
10
11 
12 
13
14  terms of any intentionality, but one thing that I 
learned in reading all of this was that one difficulty 
15
16  here is that dogs respond to subconscious cues and that 
17  there are different ways of training that make that less 
18  or more of a problem. 
19
can inquire into cueing during this hearing, that the 
20
21  defendants can -- can argue that the dog was cued, and 
22  in -- in the course of that argument you might be able 
23  to get into those sorts of things.  That's different 
24  than the challenge that was made here.  There wasn't a

 MR. GARRE:  And our position is, is that you

 I would like to just go back to one of the 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, I didn't mean to say 

1
2  premises of your question, which is that the dog in this 
3  case didn't accurately alert.  The dog in this case 
4  accurately alerted to the odor of illegal narcotics.
5
6  that.  I just meant to say that there were -- there were 
7  no drugs found. 
 MR. GARRE:  Right.  And, and I think that's 
8
9  another central problem with the Florida supreme court's

decision, is this notion that alerts to so-called 
residual odors aren't indicative of the dog's 
reliability.  A dog's alert to the lingering odor of 
methamphetamine which was in the car, must have been in 
the car in this case, is just as accurate as a dog's 
alert to the presence of methamphetamine itself in the 
car.

of apartments, a row of houses, and alerts to drugs, 
that that simple alert is probable cause for the police 
to get a search warrant.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that, without any 
18  other information about -- unlike the earlier case or 
19  this one, where the police officer saw the individual 
being nervous, et cetera, et cetera -- that all -- all 
20
21  it takes is a dog alert, despite the fact that there is 
22  no study that says the dogs reliably alert 100 percent 
23  of the time?

 In terms of studies, it is actually well 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So -- so shouldn't we be

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, I -- I understand. 
 MR. PALMORE:  It's a fair probability

11  especially outside a home in particular, should be, 
12  standing by itself, enough? 
13
 MR. PALMORE:  I think what the Court -- of 
14  course reliability is important.  The question is how 
you determine reliability.  This is a somewhat unique 
15
16  setting where the law enforcement tool is actually 
17  tested initially and on an ongoing basis in a controlled 
18  setting to establish its reliability.  Your Honor asked 
19  what the standard for bona fide training is.
 We think the -- the important point is the 
20
21  outcome of the training:  Is the dog proficient?  Can 
22  the dog reliably detect narcotics odor and only 
23  narcotics odor in a controlled setting where false 
24  positives and false negatives can accurately be 
25

measured?  That record is established here. 

20
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 But then, just as important, you have 

court said:  But we don't know what that means. 

 MR. PALMORE:  Well, we -- I think we do know 

 MR. PALMORE:  Well --

handler separately, and then a separate training, formal 
training together.

7  what it means, Your Honor.  There are two different 
8  showings that are made here.  There is a formal training 
9  and formal certification, both for the dog and the 
10
11 
12
13  ongoing, but less formal, proficiency exercises 
14  conducted by the handler in which the dog, in a 
15
16  identified, performed quite strongly, including 2 days 
17  before the arrest here.  So that's JA 113 on June 22nd, 
18  the dog performed perfectly in a controlled setting. 
 And we have -- there are records in this 
19
case going back several months before the arrest and 
20
21  several months after the arrest showing that -- that 
22  this dog passed the test, this dog was reliable.

3  school, he was certified, the judge can say, when was he 
4  last tested, right?  When did he last go through some --
MR. PALMORE:  Yes, I think the judge can ask 
5
6  those kinds of questions. 
7
8  thing really you say they can't ask about is what's --
9  what's his record.
10
11  there are a couple sub-issues here.  The principal vice 
12  of the Florida Supreme Court was in imposing an 
13  unprecedented and inflexible set of evidentiary 
14  obligations that are part of the government's 
15
16  introduce any time it seeks to establish probable cause 
17  based on a dog alert.  We think that's fundamentally 
18  misplaced for a -- for a variety of reasons. 
 The question of what the government -- what 
19
are fair game questions for a defendant to ask once the 
20
21  handler is on the stand is a -- is a different question.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Palmore, you 

criticize the Florida Supreme Court for requiring 

1  permutations.  It's a question of whether or not the 
2  trial judge was -- made a correct determination in 
3  determining that there was or was not sufficient cause 
4  for the police to proceed.  It just happens every day.
 MR. PALMORE:  I think that's right, Your 
5
6  Honor, but I think the -- the critical aspect of 
7  reliability in this context is the dog's performance in 
8  a controlled setting. 
9
10
11  evidence of field performance; and, assuming that that 
12  evidence is not required, if the defendant, in preparing 
13  for the suppression motion, wants what information there 
14  is, would it be proper to seek -- for the defendant --
15
16  seek through discovery whatever field performance 
17  records there are? 
 MR. PALMORE:  We don't think so, certainly 
18
19  not as a routine basis.  The kind of burden that that 
20
21  justified. 
 That's a separate question from whether the 
22
23  defendant can ask the handler, if the handler is on the 
24  stand, about field performance, and then the court can 
25

would it be permissible for the defendant to speak -- to

give that answer whatever weight is appropriate.

 We think, typically, an answer on field 

 The answer to the Florida supreme court's 

 Your -- it's like a -- what the -- Florida 

there was a hit or an out.  So we had a fraction where 
we know the denominator but not the numerator. 

1
2  performance is not going to be material.  It's not going 
3  to be helpful.  Because the problem is in the field, 
4  when a dog alerts, the dog is trained to alert to the 
5
6
7  Supreme Court wanted a batting average, a batting 
8  average that would be calculated when we know the number 
9  of at bats, but we don't know in many cases whether 
10
11 
12
13  question and concern about reliability, again, is to go 
14  back to the controlled setting, where we know what's a 
hit and what's an out, and we can calculate a reliable 
15
16  batting average.  That needs to be where the focus 
17  should be in determining the reliability of a dog. 
18
19  constitutionalize the process or the training 
methodologies that get you to that point.  What matters 
20
21  is, is this dog successful in a setting in which we can 
22  measure success.

establishing these unprecedented and inflexible sets of

 There is a large body of case law in the 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  If you take out the Florida 
Supreme Court and this one trial court in Massachusetts, 

1  evidentiary requirements. 
2
3  lower courts on the reliability of drug detection dogs 
4  going back 30 or 40 years, and there are no other 
courts, no other appellate courts to be sure, that have 
5
6  imposed these kinds of requirements on law enforcement 
7  when it seeks to establish probable cause for a 
8  detection -- for after a detection dog alerts. 
9
10
11  basically you think what courts have been doing is the 
12  right thing? 
13
 MR. PALMORE:  In general.  There is some 
14  diversity across the courts, but I think that if you 
look at Judge Gorsuch's opinion in the Ludwig case from 
15
16  the Tenth Circuit, or the Jones case from the Virginia 
17  supreme court, you see approaches that are basically 
18  sound, where courts have confidence that if law 
19  enforcement comes in and says, this dog is trained and 
20
21  that dog is generally reliable. 
 And I think, as Mr. Garre --
22
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But where at the same time 
23
24  they'll allow a defendant to question the handler about 
that training, about how the dog has performed in that 
25

has demonstrated proficiency in a training setting, that

stakes on the reliability of these dogs. 

 MR. PALMORE:  Yes.  Those questions can be 

1  training; is that right? 
2
3  asked. 
4
pointed out, that the courts not constitutionalize dog 
5
6  training methodologies or hold mini trials with expert 
7  witnesses on what makes for a successful dog training 
8  program.  Because, as Mr. Garre said, the government has 
9  critical interests, life and death interests, that it 
10
11
 So the U.S. Marshals use dogs to protect 
12  Federal judges.  The Federal Protective Services use 
13  dogs to keep bombs out of Federal buildings.  The TSA 
14  uses dogs to keep bombs off of airplanes.  FEMA uses 
15
16
17  now in New York and New Jersey looking for survivors of 
18  Hurricane Sandy. 
19
government has in a sense put its money where its mouth 
20
21  is, and it believes at an institutional level that these 
22  dogs are quite reliable.  And I think the courts --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you -- I'm not 
23
24  sure it's relevant, but do dogs -- are their -- does 
25

their ability -- is it even across the board?  In other 

dogs to find survivors after hurricanes. 

 There are 32 K-9 teams in the field right 

 So, in situation after situation, the

 MR. PALMORE:  No, there -- well, I think any 

kinds of dogs.  But, typically, a drug detection dog 

1  words, if you have a dog that's trained and good at 
2  sniffing out heroin, the same dog is going to be good at 
3  detecting a bomb, or is there some difference? 
4
dog could be trained in either discipline.  And if you 
5
6  look at the Scientific Working Group on Detection Dogs 
7  report that we cite in our brief, the report explains 
8  that the same general methodologies and the same 
9  different -- same general approach is used to train each 
10
11  will not be cross-trained on explosives. 
12
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you don't know 
13  whether -- in other words, are dogs good at sniffing 
14  things, or are they -- can they be good at bombs, but 
15
16
17  specific answer to that.  I think once a dog kind of 
18  chooses a major, that's what they stick with.  But I 
19  think the important point is that --
20
21 
22
23  important point is that these dogs have to meet -- have 
24  to pass proficiency in an initial training program, and

 However, what I think the Florida Supreme 

1  is on the level of detail that can be inquired into by 
2  the trial court on any of these elements. 
3
4  disagreed about what he may do; I thought they disagreed 
about what he must do.  That is, the Florida Supreme 
5
6  Court said you must, da, da, da, da, da, and gave a 
7  whole list.  I thought that's what the case was about. 
8
9  Court did have several passages in its opinion where it 
talked about what the state must produce.  And at first 
10
11 
glance, that looks rather didactic. 
12
13  Court was saying there was that if this -- these records 
14  exist, the state must produce them.  And that is 
15
16  warrantless search.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's a totally different 
18  matter.  Of course, I agree with you that a trial judge 
19  has control of the trial.  He's likely to know what's 
relevant.  In different circumstances, different matters 
20
21  will be, and he has first say on what you're going to go

 MR. GIFFORD:  No, I don't think so, even

7  "must" concerns performance records and training records 
8  that exist.

13
14  doesn't keep -- if the state doesn't keep any

16  performance to show, but that doesn't mean the state 
17  loses; is that what you're saying? 
18
19  The Florida Supreme Court seemed to say field 
20
21
 MR. GIFFORD:  If the state does not keep 
22  field performance records, that is a fact, that is a 
23  lack of evidence that could be held against the state in 
24  the suppression hearing.  And it shifts the focus onto

24  field performance records, was wrong, that they -- it is

dog at a level of proficiency that has previously been

so strong that it substitutes for evidence on another

6
 MR. GIFFORD:  Well, you don't know whether 
7  they're cases of false alerts or not, because the state 
8  will always point to the possibility of residual odor as 
9  a reason.  And we know from the studies that have been 
cited in the briefs that there are other reasons that 
10
11 
dogs alert when that alert cannot be verified.  Handler 
cueing is identified as the chief one.  And simply dogs 
12

make mistakes.  Dogs err.  Dogs get excited and will 
alert to things like tennis balls in trunks or animals,

that sort of thing.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that may all be true, 
17  but then what -- what can one infer from the fact that a

20
21  explanation could be the dog detected an odor, but the

4  likely to be found in a search that follows an alert.
 
5
6
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they are likely to be 
7  found if there is a residual odor of drugs, even though 
8  the drugs are no longer there.  So it's not an 
9  incompetent dog when he alerts because of the residual 
10
11
 MR. GIFFORD:  But if a dog has -- but if a 
12  dog has previously alerted and no drugs have been found 
13  because the dog's hyperacuity causes him to smell drugs 
14  that were there two days or two weeks ago, then the next 
time that dog alerts, it's less likely, the probability 
15
16  declines that drugs will be found. 
17
 It goes to what probable cause measures, 
18  rather than what the dog training and certification 
19  community measure, and that is, the likelihood, the 
20
21  following the search.

 He doesn't actually know whether it's

the difference is that -- that the police officer can 

1  smoked up an hour before.  I don't know how long 
2  marijuana lingers for, but -- I'm not sure why residual 
3  odor affects the reliability of the dog, which was 
4  Justice Scalia's point.  It's no different than an

17  drugs are found means that the dog -- that -- it 
18  detracts from probable cause in that instance.

added that it didn't think that performance in the field
