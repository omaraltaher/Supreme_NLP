CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first this morning in case 16-369, County of Los Angeles 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

v. Mendez. 

 

            

Mr. Rosenkranz. 

 

          

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Your Honor, when a police officer reasonably 

   

 

 

 

 

thinks to himself, as Deputy Conley did here, this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where I'm going to die, he has to be free to make the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

split-second decision to defend himself and those around 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him.  Any legal rule that says that is unreasonable is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

untenable. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You know, I have a -- it 

   

   

  

 

 

 

is a very moving statement, and one that I totally agree 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with, but we're not asking the police officers to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that choice.  When they feel in danger, they are going 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to take the step that's important to them, and I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's absolutely right. 

 

 

            

The issue is who's going to suffer that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loss?  Who's going to take the financial penalty of that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

loss, not that that's the -- the death of the officer.

And so the question to me is not that one.  The question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

is when does the police officer pay the victim who is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suffering for that loss if the victim had nothing to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with causing the loss? 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Understood. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or -- or was justified 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in whatever he or she did to protect themselves. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So let's take the situation, which I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

you concede in your brief, that of the police officer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who, in the dead of night, in -- dressed in casual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clothes, breaks a window in someone's home and walks 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

into their home. 

 

 

            

And we have given them the Second Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to victims, people who own homes, to possess 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

firearms to protect themselves.  And the victim sees a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stranger breaking in who doesn't announce themselves, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't have a uniform, and is standing there breaking 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in.  The victim shoots that police officer, or points a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gun at that police officer, and the police officer takes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a gun and shoots them and injures them or kills them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now who bears the financial loss in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation?  The homeowner, who has a right to defend him 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

or herself and say it's my life or yours, or the police 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer who has taken unreasonable action in breaking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into a home in the middle of the night without 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

announcing him or herself?  That's the question for me. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Understood, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

5 

And the answer to that question is quite likely the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer, but not because of the provocation rule, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rather because the officer has committed a clearly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional act, which is not just entering, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also failing to knock and announce, clear violation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly established law, which then proximately causes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what -- what unfurls next. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, let's -- let's 

  

 

 

 

 

break that down, because I see two scenarios in this for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which a victim could -- could recover. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

One is an unconstitutional violation that 

 

 

 

 

 

proximately causes an injury.  Okay?  That's the theory 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

you come to.  And the second is, if there was an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable use of force by the police officer.  You're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking out of the equation the second way of -- of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recovering? 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor.  The use 

  

  

 

 

 

 

of force by the police officer at that moment was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable.  But the police officer can be held liable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for violating clearly established law, and in particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, failing to inform the homeowner that this is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer entering and what proximately flows from that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The problem with the latter theory, that is,

the provocation theory, as an excessive force matter, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- there are multiple problems. 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

The first is it imposes liability under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plaintiffs' approach for a new breed of constitutional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

tort, which is creating a dangerous situation without 

   

 

 

 

 

 

regard to whether it's a search or a seizure, or, under 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

your scenario, Justice Sotomayor, even the Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's test, there is something very incongruous 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about holding an officer liable for a use of force that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not excessive at the moment at which it is used, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore is reasonable, and therefore, in compliance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the Fourth Amendment, and this goes --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's where I have -- ' 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I --

   

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead. 

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask about the first 

   

  

 

 

 

 

theory, because you said if there was a violation --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excuse me -- of the knock-and-announce rule, and a death 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or an injury proximately caused by that violation, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there could be recovery. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

Is that what you said? 

 

 

 

 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  That is what I said. 

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes. 

  

 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  So let me just -- let me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just amend with one -- I said one additional thing.

Knock-and-announce violation, and that 

 

 

 

violation is a violation of clearly -- clearly --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  -- established law. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And this is qualified 

  

 

 

 

 

immunity context; everything has to be a violation of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly established law, quite right. 

 

 

 

 

            

So I guess the question is, why is this case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any different?  In other words, this case you don't have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the knock-and-announce violation; you have a different 

   

 

 

 

 

constitutional violation, which is an unauthorized 

 

 

 

 

 

entry.  And why would it not be the case that the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the death or injury in such a case is also 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximately caused by that violation? 

 

 

 

 

            

In other words, proximate cause says what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of things are foreseeable, and it says -- it sets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an outer bound, and it says totally flukey, random 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things we're not going to say are proximately caused. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But it doesn't seem to me a flukey or random thing to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say when there is an authorized entry into somebody's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

home, violence may well result.  And so the proximate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause analysis seems to flow in much the same way, maybe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not to quite the same -- like with -- quite the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviousness, but in much the same way as in your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knock-and-announce example.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, so -- let's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

just be clear where we are.  We're not talking about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

starting with the violation; that is, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knock-and-announce violation, or the violation of -- of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

--

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's -- it's a simple 

   

  

 

 

 

question, Mr. Rosenkranz. 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You said something about 

  

 

 

 

 

knock and announce.  I say why isn't the same theory 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable when the constitutional violation is 

 

 

 

 

 

unauthorized entry into somebody's home? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  For a very simple reason, 

   

  

 

 

 

Your Honor.  We've got to start with a clearly 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

established violation.  Here the only one in play is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to call a judge in advance and, for example, get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a telephonic warrant. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That is an unauthorized 

  

 

 

 

 

entry into somebody's home. 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, it is. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So that is the clearly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

established constitutional violation. 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why isn't the proximate 

  

 

 

 

 

cause -- why it -- why wouldn't it be that a death or

injury that results when somebody barges into, goes into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

somebody's home without legal authorization, that one of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the things that foreseeably can result from that is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shooting? 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, the 

  

 

 

 

 

answer is that calling the judge in advance would not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have made a bit of difference in this case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well suppose --

  

 

 

 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  The facts --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose this case, police 

  

 

 

 

 

arrest without a warrant a man who's having dinner with 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

his family and friends, white collar crime.  They did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not get a warrant.  They did have probable cause.  They 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

could have gotten a warrant.  And he sues -- and later 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the charges are dismissed, it was a mistake, but there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was still probable cause.  And he sues for fright and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

humiliation.  Under your theory, you'd say, well, even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if he got a warrant, he'd have the same fright and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

humiliation, so there's -- there's no damage. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  That's correct, Your Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

because the warrant requirement --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then -- then we simply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have no way to enforce the warrant requirement.  So --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so you stand by the proposition that if there is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawful entry, an unlawful arrest because of a lack of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

a warrant, no damage because the arrest would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened with -- with the warrant anyway.

saying --

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I'm not 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You want us -- you want us 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to write that in the law. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  I'm not saying no damage, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

but certainly not the physical injury that occurred 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  But let me play out the reason for the answer, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor. 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yeah, let's stick with 

  

 

 

 

 

this -- with this hypothetical.  Under your view, we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying that you cannot sue for damages and humiliation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if there's an entry without a warrant if there had been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probable cause otherwise.  That's -- that's the rule you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want us to announce. 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  If the search --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if that's -- and if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's so, I'd like the citation for that case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, if the 

  

 

 

 

 

search --

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  For -- for that. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  If the search would have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

happened no matter what, yes, there may be humiliation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure, because, I mean, if -- if the warrant would have

prevented that humiliation, then you could sue for it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, let's assume that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't.  In fact, it would have been even worse 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because a judge would have ordered the arrest. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Then -- then there's 

  

 

 

 

 

definitely no damage.  But let -- let me just link 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your -- your --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can -- can you tell me if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Paula Jones on your theory -- Paula Hughes -- Paula 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hughes, the homeowner, who was -- there was no warrant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and she was placed in a car and treated rather badly, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would she have a 1983 claim? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  She may well have a 1983 

   

  

 

 

 

 

claim, Your Honor, for -- for the poor treatment when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she was not actually a criminal.  But I do need to -- I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do want to get to Justice Kennedy's question and link it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the answer that I never got to, to Justice Kagan. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On the facts presented in this appeal, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge would have granted the warrant no matter what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the deputies had probable cause.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

deputies then would have done exactly what they did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, and the result would have been exactly the same. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Calling the judge would not have changed the outcome. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that's why there's no probable cause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And it's telling that the --

change --

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it might very well 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Proxima --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- proximate -- proximate. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  As proximate cause.  Sorry. 

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It might very well change 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the outcome.  When somebody shows up with a warrant, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

they show it -- they show the warrant, they have legal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority, people act very differently than when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody shows up with no warrant and says, I don't have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority.  I'm coming in anyway.  That's a very 

   

  

  

 

 

 

different set of circumstances that a homeowner has to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

respond to. 

 

            

And what is for -- what foreseeably happens 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where there is a warrant is not the same thing.  When 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody -- when a police officer has legal authority, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

tells the homeowner he has legal authority, the set of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

results that happens is just not the same as when a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police officer just says, "I'm here, I don't have any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal authority, I'm coming in anyway". 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, every fact that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you've recited beyond not having the warrant is a fact 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you've inserted into the scenario that is all about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving notice to the -- to the suspect.  Warrants are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not designed to give notice to anyone.  You could show

up with a telephonic warrant that shows -- that shows 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

the homeowner nothing at all.  This Court said in Grubbs 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is not the perfect -- the premise of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it's -- it's possible. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, I take the point, Mr. Rosenkranz, it's possible 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you have a warrant in your pocket and you don't say 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything about it, although that would seem like very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

silly -- stupid police work.  But the prototypical case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when somebody has a warrant is that they tell a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

homeowner they have a warrant and that they have a right 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be on the premises.  That's what usually happens. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And similarly, what often happens is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when somebody doesn't say that to a homeowner, they are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making it far more likely that violence will ensue.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly the kind of violence that could ensue is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the kind of flukey, random stuff that is filtered out by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a proximate cause inquiry. 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Your Honor, I -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

disagree.  The reason officers announce themselves 

  

 

 

 

 

before executing a warrant is not the fact that they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a warrant, but because there is a separate 

   

   

 

 

 

 

constitutional command of knocking and announcing with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or without a warrant.  That was a separate mistake that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

the officers made here.  That was held to be not a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of clearly established law, and therefore,

cannot be the basis of liability.  And it is telling 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

that every time plaintiffs refer to what caused this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury and every time the Ninth Circuit refers to what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

caused this injury, it is a reference to startling, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unannounced, without warning, without notice, all of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things that you've woven -- woven into your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical. 

            

That is not the violation of clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established law here.  The violation of clearly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

established law here was the failure to get a search 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant in advance.  And search warrants, this Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

held in Grubbs, are not designed to provide a topic of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conversation or to provide notice to the suspect. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Knock-and-announce is designed to provide notice, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that can't be a basis of liability here. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why -- why do you break --

say, look, there was a seizure.  It killed him or 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

wounded him.  It's a seizure.  In fact, the question is, 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

was that seizure -- i.e., shooting him -- was that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seizure unreasonable and clearly unreasonable?  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer to yes is, yeah, look at all the circumstances.

they might be. 

 

 

            

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  If you look at the whole 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation and say, you know what this is like?  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like the classic tort case.  Somebody pushes somebody 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

else into the street where he is run down by a negligent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

driver.  Is the individual -- there's a supervening 

   

  

 

 

 

 

cause, negligent driver.  Of course they're liable, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because that's what happens.  You expect negligent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

drivers, and similarly, you expect people to defend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves. 

            

that? 

            

That's a -- why -- why -- what's wrong with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Well, Your Honor, what's 

  

 

 

 

 

wrong with that is -- is that this Court's methodology 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is to -- especially in cases involving personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability to officers, is you start with a violation of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly established law.  You started, Justice Breyer, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with the seizure.  The seizure was not a violation of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly established law.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Right.  So I -- I see my --

my rebuttal time has started.  Let me answer very --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Save your rebuttal. 

  

 

 

 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  But let me answer very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

briefly, though, that -- that what you've done now with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the excessive force piece is to focus not on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision that the officer makes at that moment, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the critical decision under Graham, but to find that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what he did was unreasonable, even though the court of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals and the district court found it to have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable at that moment.

question, which I think goes to the first question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

presented.  And I think the question was, why can't we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

just say that we can consider the facts of causing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation as part of the reasonableness inquiry? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the answer there is because the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we're answering under Graham is, was the officer's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

force -- use of force reasonable in the circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he faced?  And those -- those depend really on two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sets of facts. 

 

 

            

One:  What was the individual doing?  Was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the person a threat?  Did he have a weapon?  A 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

propensity to use it?  Was a member of the public at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risk?  Was he fleeing, committing a crime, et cetera? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

And two:  How did the officer respond to it? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What were the officer's options?  What did the -- was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the officer's use of force proportional, et cetera? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It doesn't ask whether the police officer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

created the situation.  It takes stepping into the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

shoes, the situation --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, why is it that every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Graham case we look at, all the car chase cases, every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single one of them, we -- when we're talking about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation facing the officer, we look at everything the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer and the victim did that led up to the moment of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confrontation.  Because all of the facts that you point

to as the police officer's knowledge of the victim are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

facts that usually are intertwined with what led up to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the incident. 

 

            

So if you look at a car chase, you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at a person who, over an extended period of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time has driven a car crazily, has put other people at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risk, has swerved and missed other cars, done a series 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of things that the officer is aware of because he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participated in the chase, and at the moment that he is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at what the victim -- what the defendant is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing, he's saying he drove the car and almost hit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another car, he's pointing the car at me, he's going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hit me. 

 

            

And -- but you're looking at both sides of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that equation.  You're not ratcheting it up on one side 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, you're right that 

  

 

 

 

 

you're looking at all of the facts and circumstances, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but those that bear on whether the use of force is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable. 

            

And just to give an example, in Plumhoff, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is one of the car chase cases that the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

addressed, the district court in that case said well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the police officer was chasing him, so the police 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer helped create the dangerous situation, and this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court in footnote 3 of its opinion said:  No.  Police,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why isn't --

  

 

 

 

 

MS. SAHARSKY:  -- from the public. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- how they do their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

job, because they have to know -- they have to know what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable people will do.  I mean, if -- if a 1983 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim is a tort claim, and if they jump in front of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

car, of a total stranger on the street, and the person 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is coming at them, should that person behind the wheel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bear the brunt of an injury because the police officer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says the car was coming towards me, so to save myself, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pulled the gun and shot them, even though this is Joe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Blow who's never been arrested, doesn't own a gun, never 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knew the officer had jumped into the street?  If a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

normal person did that, they'd pay for that victim's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injury.  Why does a police officer get a pass on that? 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, as a general matter, 

   

  

 

 

 

Section 1983 is about courts setting clearly established 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional rules for the police that the police have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to follow.  It's not a question of asking whether the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

police just behaved reasonably in the abstract, but in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms of each thing that the police officer did and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it followed the established rule, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

20 

established rule --

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So is it --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- for a police officer 

   

  

 

 

 

to pull a gun and shoot a driver that has no guilt 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

associated with him or her?  Not an armed felon, just a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

normal person to stumble into the street and say, I'm a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police officer, I'm going to seize that person and stop 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

myself by being injured by shooting that person? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, I think you would ask 

   

  

 

 

 

 

in that question what -- whether there really was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

threat that the officer was responding to, and I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're positing a situation where there really wasn't a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

threat there.  But I think in this circumstance, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

everyone recognized that there was a threat facing these 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

officers who are going about doing their police business 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in good faith, and they see a person pointing what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeared to be a gun at them.  And what the Ninth 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit said is:  We're going to second-guess everything 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

else that you did that day, and even though this use of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

force was reasonable under Graham, we're going to hold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you liable for it. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, it -- it --

question presented, right?  None of this, it seems to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

me, to be involved the provocation rule in the Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit, at least the question about did they get a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant, did they knock, announce.  How do you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand the Ninth Circuit's provocation rule in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction to what we've been talking about in terms of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximate cause and things like that? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Sure.  The provocation rule 

  

  

 

 

 

takes, under the Ninth Circuit's precedence, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable use of force and deems it unreasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the police made an earlier constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistake, and we think that that is just flatly wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You should --

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So as -- as that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

describe -- is the label what's wrong?  I -- I would 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

think of provocation is something fairly immediate, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that causes the pulling of the gun by the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the victim or something like that.  I don't think of it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as provocation that you should have gotten a search 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant earlier in the day but you didn't, and that led 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to this. 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  I mean the thing that's wrong 

    

 

 

 

 

 

is what the Ninth Circuit is doing, which is saying the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police created the situation by doing things that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not constitutional violations, but that the Ninth

Circuit later finds, with the benefit of 20/20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

hindsight, to be reasonable -- unreasonable.  And that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually what we've seen. 

 

 

 

            

We've had this doctrine in the Ninth Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for 20 years now.  It's incredibly ill-defined, does not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put in place clear rules for the police.  And the kinds 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of things that the Ninth Circuit is second-guessing is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe the police should have used a hostage negotiator 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

for longer before going into the house in Alexander. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's the one with the sewage seeping outside of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

house.  They tried to spend a month trying to talk to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that guy.  They went to his house.  Used a hostage 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

negotiator. 

            

Or the situation in Sheehan where there was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a very difficult situation with a mentally ill woman who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was threatening the police, and the Ninth Circuit said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the police should have tried to calm down the situation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for longer.  I mean, these are incredibly difficult 

    

 

 

 

 

 

determinations that are being made.  And under the Ninth 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's rule, the Ninth Circuit's just second-guessing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing exactly what this Court has said shouldn't be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

done. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But isn't --

  

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  So the best --

different than the provocation rule at 25(a) where they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say there was no warrant and therefore there's -- those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

are two different things, right. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Right.  We understand those 

  

  

 

 

 

to be the two alternative holdings from the first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question presented and the second question presented. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So the second question presented isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about whether the use of force is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutionally excessive, clearly established 

 

 

 

violation.  It's talking about, was there a violation 

   

  

 

 

 

 

with the entry and did that proximately cause the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages at issue.  And if I can address that question. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

problem --

 

            

            

            

We just think there's a fundamental 

   

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you --

  

 

 

 

MS. SAHARSKY:  -- with the Ninth's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- before -- can I just --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

do you agree in general, before you address the question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in particular, do you agree in general what that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

framing -- that if there is an independent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional violation and if it does proximately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause the injury, then there's a 1983 action? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  In general, yes.  I mean, 

    

  

 

 

 

1983 imposes liability and damages for clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established constitutional violations, and although this

Court has had very few opportunities to address 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causation in the Section 1983 context, it has said as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general matter it would start with tort law principles, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I think those would include proximate causation and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

superseding-cause principles. 

 

            

But we have a problem in this case in what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Ninth Circuit found was the proximate cause of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injuries in this case was the failure to knock and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

announce.  But the fail -- failure to knock and announce 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was not a violation of clearly established law.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

officers have qualified immunity for that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So that seems fair enough. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

But then the question might become, whether here or on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remand, whether an unauthorized entry, where there was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly established violation, whether one could say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that was the proximate cause of the shooting. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes.  And I think there's two 

   

  

  

 

 

 

answers to that question, one about this case and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second, more generally. 

 

 

            

About this case, the analysis by the Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit was that it was the knock-and-announce and not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the warrant, and if I could just illustrate this.  In 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case, you had officers that did not have a warrant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and did not knock and announce.  But imagine that they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did have a warrant and still didn't knock and announce. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

What the Ninth Circuit said was the problem was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

startling entry.  So with or without the warrant, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have had this problem from the knock-and-announce, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but as we discussed, the knock-and-announce is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immunized. 

            

As a general matter, I think the point that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

Petitioners were making at argument and in their -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the brief is well taken, that the scope of the risks for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a warrant violation as opposed to the scope of the risk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a knock and a -- knock-and-announce violation are 

   

   

 

 

 

 

very different. 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But one of -- a warrant 

   

  

 

 

 

 

violation is just -- it's -- it's just saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unauthorized entry.  And the question is whether it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

within the normal scope of the risk, but an unauthorized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entry produces violence, not that it always or probably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

produces violence, but that it might produce violence in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way we kind of ask when we do proximate cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis. 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Right.  And I don't think 

   

  

  

 

 

that we would say that an unauthorized entry itself 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

normally produces violence when you're talking about --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Doesn't have to, normally. 

  

 

 

 

 

It doesn't have to --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Or -- you know, proximate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

cause is just we filter out the really fluky stuff. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, I -- we understand 

   

  

 

 

 

proximate cause in the scope of the risks as being what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are the natural and probable consequences of your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions, what are the risks that make the conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tortious, what bad things do you think are going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occur if you do this. 

 

 

 

 

            

And in the warrant context, we're talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about police showing up at the door.  And, no, we don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that it is generally a reasonable reaction when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

police show up at the door with or without a warrant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you'd react violently.  And that's what Grubbs said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that when the police come to your door, you submit at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that time, and that you can challenge the warrant in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court later. 

 

            

            

Could I have one more sentence? 

   

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well -- and also if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you could get to Justice Kennedy's hypothetical. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Okay.  Just to finish this, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

but the Court has recognized that you have a problem in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the knock-and-announce context that you don't know that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are the police.  And so in that context there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really is a potential risk of violence.  Once you know 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they're the police, a citizen is expected to stand

Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, if I

MS. SAHARSKY:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And there should have been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS. SAHARSKY:  Right.  I think that the 

    

  

 

 

 

question you would ask in that case is the normal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximate cause question about what kind of damages, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, would there be from a failure to get a warrant in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those circumstances, what's natural and foreseeable.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I'm -- I wouldn't say --

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if the humiliation is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the same either way, no damage? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  I'd -- I'm not saying that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

depends on whether proximate cause and you could have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gotten a warrant.  I'm just saying that you look at what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually happened and determine the -- the natural and

probable consequences from that. 

 

 

 

28 

              

I mean, the Court -- just maybe one more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence. 

            

The Court has not had a lot of opportunities 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the 1983 concept -- context to work out these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probable cause cases.  I think in some of the Court's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other opinions you've said probable cause is a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

flexible concept.  Courts of appeals have a lot of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

experience doing it, this Court less, and that's why we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would say to decide the second question presented very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrowly and not get into all of these questions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask a follow-up 

   

   

  

 

question on that? 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't -- if, in 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice Kennedy's hypothetical that there had been an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application for a warrant, isn't it entirely possible, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

particularly under the facts that he hypothesized, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the judge would say you don't need an arrest warrant in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this situation?  You can ask the defendant's attorney to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring the defendant in and surrender.  I know that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's happened quite a few times. 

   

 

 

 

            

MS. SAHARSKY:  Sure.  That's something that 

  

  

 

 

 

could happen.

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Feldman. 

 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD J. FELDMAN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If the Court reaches the constitutional 

 

 

 

 

 

issue in the case, we believe that the Court should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopt the following standard:  Where a government 

   

  

 

 

 

official takes action that foreseeably creates a need 

   

 

 

 

 

 

for the use of force and results in that use of force, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Graham Scott balancing should be applied to determine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether that action is objectively unreasonable. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And we are not, as Petitioners' counsel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested, suggesting to this Court that it adopt a new 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breed of a constitutional tort.  This Court has always 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

focused on the totality of the circumstances and there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a long line of cases culminating in Kentucky v. King 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that recognizes the constitutional significance of 

 

 

 

 

 

predicate acts. 

 

            

standard? 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you repeat that 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  The standard that we suggest 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that this Court adopt is that where a government 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

official takes action that foreseeably creates a need 

   

 

 

 

 

 

30 

for the use of force and results in that use of force, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Graham Scott balancing should be applied to determine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether that action is objectively unreasonable. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Under Graham and Scott, courts would, of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course, consider the governmental interest at stake, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment interests, and the relative culpability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of those affected by the decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are you defending the 

  

 

 

 

 

Ninth Circuit's statement at page 22A of the Petition 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix?  "Here the District Court held that, because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the officers violated the Fourth Amendment by searching 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the shack without a warrant, which proximately caused 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the plaintiff's injuries, liability was proper." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  That is an appropriate way to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

find liability in this case. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I just don't see the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

proximate cause between failure to get the warrant and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what happened here. 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, there were two proximate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

causes here.  One proximate cause was the unlawful 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

entry.  The entry was unlawful because there was no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant.  The second proximate cause, as the lower 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts recognized, was the failure to announce.  And it

was those circumstances that are the objectively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable behavior of the officers --

 

 

 

 

 

31 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, not the second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

one.  I thought the -- the failure to announce they 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determined -- and I understand you to accept it -- that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was not a violation of clearly established law. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  That's right.  And so what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that means is that the cause of action cannot be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought, but the conduct doesn't disappear.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

proximate cause principles are not based on whether a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal violation proximately caused harm, but whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct caused harm.  And the conduct that caused harm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case was the entry without giving notice.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you take either one of those away, then, of course, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harm doesn't occur.  That's another way of saying they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are both necessary proximate causes as well as but-for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causes. 

            

And when we look at the Kentucky v. King 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line of cases, what we see is that this Court has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized that there are circumstances in which events 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow police officers to take certain actions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  That's -- that was a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

different context.  It had to do with an exception to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the warrant requirement.  But the problem with your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

test, as you articulate it, and as I understand it, is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

that you start out with something that is said to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable, but it is not a violation of the Fourth 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment.  And you impose liability for that decision, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

not for the ultimate decision to use deadly force. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And -- and this has come up in a situation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like Sheehan where there's a dispute about whether it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable for -- you have a -- a mentally disturbed 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

person and let's say the person has a hostage in a house 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or there's an innocent person there and the mentally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disturbed person is acting in a way that seems to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present a serious threat to the -- the innocent person 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the house.  And there's a dispute about whether it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable for the police to enter as opposed to waiting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a -- a psychological expert or -- or they only have 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

negotiations for a short period of time before they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

enter and it's argued that wasn't reasonable, that's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good police practice, they should have waited a longer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

period of time, and you end up imposing liability. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then once they go in, then they're in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- in a life-threatening situation and they use force. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You end up imposing liability for what is arguably a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of best police practices, or something that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recommended by experts in this situation.  That's what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

anomalous about the rule that you've -- that you've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested.

MR. FELDMAN:  I wouldn't agree that it's 

    

 

 

 

 

33 

anomalous, but I also think that, at least in this case, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlike in Sheehan, the Court doesn't have to decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether objectively unreasonable behavior alone is 

 

 

 

 

 

enough because we also happen to have an unlawful entry, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which wasn't present in the Sheehan case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When the officers entered, they were no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different than trespassers.  And some --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, but that's a different 

   

  

 

 

 

way of looking at the situation.  And I agree, that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's a -- you know, that's -- that's the question that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you would think you would address under the Fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment.  You start out with the Fourth Amendment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation, and then you say, did it proximately cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the use of deadly force?  But not the rule that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested where you start out with something that isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a violation of the Fourth Amendment, whether or not it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

represents best police practices or not. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Let me give you a few 

   

  

 

 

 

 

examples, Justice Alito, of why it's important to focus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the predicate conduct.  These are real-world examples 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and decisions that have been -- and circumstances --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that have been addressed by the Department of Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and this Court.

who jump out of unmarked cars wearing plain clothes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brandishing guns.  It's not a constitutional violation. 

   

  

 

 

 

34 

There's no seizure, but it's clearly unreasonable and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leads to the use -- unnecessary use of force. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it may very well be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seizure.  If they -- if they interfere with the liberty 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the person who they approach, then it's a -- then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a seizure, it's a stop. 

   

   

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  It -- it --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And that would be the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

situation in the hypothetical that Justice Sotomayor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned, which was presented in your brief, where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police officer jumps in front of a car and doesn't allow 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the driver enough time to stop.  And then as the driver 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is approaching the police officer, the police officer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shoots.  That's a seizure.  And so you look at the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

entire seizure, the jumping in front of the car, plus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ultimate shooting to determine whether it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable. 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  And there's nothing wrong with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that approach either in the Kentucky v. King argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think Justice Kagan referred to that as the holistic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonableness approach.  If you look at the -- from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the moment of time that the officers interact with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody to the moment that there is a seizure, here

that's the moment that the officers arrived at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mendez's home until the moment that the officers fired 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their weapons into the Mendez's home and injured them, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

which effectuated the seizure. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But the Fourth Amendment 

  

 

 

 

 

doesn't prohibit unreasonable interactions.  What it 

  

 

 

 

 

prohibits is unreasonable searches and seizures.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's entirely appropriate to look at the whole seizure, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but not this chain of interactions that includes a lot 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of things that happened before there ever is conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that implicates the Fourth Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, in the examples that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we've given where the police officer goes into someone's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

home in the middle of the night or stands outside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone's home brandishing weapons or jumps out of a car 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brandishing weapons, that's the beginning of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interaction.  And if we look at the totality of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances, as this Court has repeatedly mandated, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

among those circumstances is the objectively 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable behavior of the officers that foreseeably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and directly leads to the use of force. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So whether we look at it through the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kentucky v. King framework, which is really where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable or unconstitutional conduct prevents an 

 

 

 

 

 

officer from relying on certain circumstances to avoid

what these officers did was unreasonable.

response, I was looking saying look holistically.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

seizure is the shooting and his -- and his injury, okay? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  The question is, would any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable person think that that was unreasonable? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, we break it down.  Not unreasonable to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the shoot in the situation.  That wasn't unreasonable. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Seems, too, they -- they say not unconstitutional or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonably wrong not to knock and announce, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's what the Ninth Circuit found, and the part that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was wrong, not getting a warrant, made no difference. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

So they're saying zero plus zero plus zero, it must 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equal zero.  Okay?  That, I think, is the argument I'm 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

trying to -- to put that I -- that I want to hear the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer to. 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  And I think the flaw 

   

  

  

 

 

 

in the reasoning is that what we have here are two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary proximate causes.  So what that means is, if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you take one away, the harm doesn't occur.  If you take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other away, the harm doesn't occur.  So it really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

isn't zero plus zero plus zero equals zero.  Each of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37 

these actions, the entry, and the entry without notice, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were necessary --

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't see --

    

 

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  -- for harm to occur. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't see you say 

    

 

 

 

 

 

if you take away one that -- if you take away the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to get the -- the search warrant, the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

harm still occurs. 

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  Because what the --

  

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so why do you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at that as the basis for 1983 liability? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Because what they're doing, 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice, is they are changing the legality of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the conduct, but they are not changing the conduct. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When you change the legality of the conduct, but you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't change the conduct, of course this --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then it's 

  

 

 

 

 

not -- it's -- it's -- and this, I think, is the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument on the other side.  Then it's irrelevant.  In 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other words, the search warrant is not going to change 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the conduct.  But the failure to get the search warrant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the only thing that violated the standards under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1983. 

            

So it's not a proximate cause at all of the

changed it in any way. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  The conduct is what we use to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

define proximate cause. 

 

 

            

            

            

            

notice. 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay. 

  

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  The entry --

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  -- or the entry without 

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  That either did or did not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximately cause the harm. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  It has to be illegal. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But -- but then why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are we talking about the failure to get a search 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant?  Why -- why did that make a difference? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  It made a difference in this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

case because it is what makes the conduct of the police 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officers unconstitutional. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That does not 

  

 

 

 

 

proximately cause --

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, the conduct of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

officers proximately caused the injury. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I'm not 

    

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

understanding, Mr. Feldman, why you're quite making this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

distinction.  I mean, it -- it -- why isn't it just, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look, the entry without authority, the entry without a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant, that's a clear but-for cause of the shooting? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

The shooting wouldn't have happened if there hadn't been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the entry; right? 

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now the question is, is it a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but -- is it a proximate cause of the inquiry?  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- and it seems to me that you have to make a case --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and tell me if you agree or don't agree:  You have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make a case that unauthorized entry, that one of the --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one of the things that foreseeably can happen with an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unauthorized entry is that the person whose home it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will react with violence. 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I agree with you completely. 

    

 

 

 

 

And, of course --

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

 

 

   

Well --

 

MR. FELDMAN:  -- the foreseeability issue 

  

 

 

 

 

was the issue that was extensively litigated in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial courts. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

see how you can agree -- I don't think it's -- addresses 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at least my concern, which -- why and in what way did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the failure to get a warrant cause everything that

caused --

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  It was the entry that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It was the entry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

40 

I'm with you there. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Yeah. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand that. 

    

 

 

 

But the failure to get a warrant did not cause the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entry. 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  As I understand courts' 

   

  

 

 

applying proximate cause analysis, we begin with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct and we ask ourselves, did that conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly -- that's the proximate cause issue -- did that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct directly lead to the harm? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  If we answer that question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

yes, we then look at whether that conduct was illegal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Now, there --

  

  

 

 

 

 

and maybe I'm just asking the same thing over and over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again.  And, if so, I apologize.  But how did the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

conduct, the failure to get the warrant, lead to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entry in this case? 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  The -- the entry -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

apologize.  I'm saying the same thing over and over 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I'm asking the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

same thing over and over again. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I say this --

   

  

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  -- same thing --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I guess maybe I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

just -- you -- you -- as I understand your theory, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failure to get a warrant caused -- that's why we call it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a provocation, I guess -- caused the -- the entry which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

caused the -- the confrontation; is that right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I wouldn't say that the 

    

 

 

 

 

failure to get a warrant caused the entry.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

officers' --

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  -- decision to enter is what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

caused the entry. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Exactly.  So I don't 

   

  

  

 

 

know why the failure to get a warrant matters. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, can I suggest why it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

might matter?  I mean, there are two kinds of entry: 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One is -- let's -- for these purposes, one is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized entry and one is an unauthorized entry. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now the question is, what kind of conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does each of those kinds of entries provoke?  If you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an authorized entry, you don't really think that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to provoke violence.  But if you're an

unauthorized entry, you do think it's going to provoke 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violence.  So the --

  

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- proximate cause -- the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the proximate results of each of those two different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds of entry are very different. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, if I could 

   

  

 

 

 

interrupt you to ask a question. 

   

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why is it that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

whether it's authorized or not, you don't think it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to prompt violence?  The fact that you have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

search warrant, you may have a search warrant, say, I've 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got to execute a search warrant to pick up this armed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and dangerous felon; you may still think that's going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prompt violence.  That doesn't have anything to do with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the nature of the entry you're going to have to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later on.  Knock-and-announce does, because if you just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

burst in, the person may reasonably think this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burglar.  But if you knock and announce, it doesn't. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That does affect the -- the -- the nature of -- of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct.  But I think a warrant, whether it's authorized 

   

   

  

 

 

 

or not, doesn't. 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  If the officers don't have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant and they enter, they are trespassers.  The

situations. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me give you two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Situation A:  The officers get a warrant, 

   

  

 

 

 

they go to the residence, they knock on the door.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resident opens the door.  They say:  We have a search 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

warrant.  We're going to search your house. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

All right? 

 

            

Situation B:  They don't get a search 

   

  

 

 

 

warrant.  They think they have exigent circumstances. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

They knock on the door.  And they -- in both cases, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're uniformed police officers.  They say:  We're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

police officers.  We're here; we're going to search your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

house.  We don't have a warrant.  We think we have -- we 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can search your house without a warrant because we have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an exception to the warrant requirement. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, is there more -- is it more likely that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's going to be violence in the second situation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than in the first situation?  I -- I -- I don't see why 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is. 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  I would agree, Your Honor, 

    

 

 

 

 

that in those circumstances, it would not be more likely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there would be violence in one situation or the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, then, then I don't see 

   

  

 

 

 

 

44 

where there's proximate cause. 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, the proximate cause 

  

 

 

 

 

comes from the two things that the officers did that led 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly and foreseeably to the confrontation and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violent confrontation with the homeowners.  One is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they decided to enter, and that was unconstitutional. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the other is that they went in without giving any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice.  And if you look at that through --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're making a 

  

 

 

 

presumption there that I think you have to address, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is, yes, they entered without a warrant.  You're 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

assuming it's unconstitutional.  No one's addressed it, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and I don't think the Court did below, whether that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entry had an exception for unconstitutionality.  Was it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an exigent circumstance or not? 

 

 

 

 

            

You're assuming that they didn't have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal motive for entry.  I'm willing to start with that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumption, but let's assume that a court below could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that the entry was lawful because it was pursuant to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exigent circumstances. 

 

            

            

What would happen to your argument then? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, let me start by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

clarifying that the courts below did, in fact, address 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the full panoply of exceptions to the warrant clause.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So we're assuming that 

  

 

 

 

 

45 

the entry was unlawful.  There were no exceptions to it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case. 

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah.  And in my 

  

  

 

 

 

hypothetical, the -- what I -- I neglected to say but 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

should have said was that there weren't exigent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances.  So the -- the entry was unlawful, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they had a warrant -- they -- they -- but you still have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those two situations.  In one case, they have a warrant. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

The other case, they say:  We think -- and they turn out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be wrong -- that we don't need a warrant. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But I don't -- I asked you whether there's a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

greater risk of violence in one than the other, and I --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'd like to hear your -- your answer.  Why would there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be a greater risk of violence in the situation where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the resident knows that it's -- that they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police officers and they're going to conduct a search, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as opposed to the situation where there's -- where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a warrant?  Any -- any violence that the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

resident directs at the police officer is illegal in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both situations; right? 

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  It's not justified for them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to attack the police.  They -- "Well, I know" --

officers --

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  They know that they're police 

  

 

 

 

 

 

46 

JUSTICE ALITO:  "You know, I know -- I know 

   

   

  

 

 

 

you're a police officer, but I don't think you really 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

have an exception to the warrant requirement, so I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to shoot you." 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

They can't do that, can they? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Feldman, you said there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

are two kinds of entrance; right?  One is a trespasser 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

entrant, and one is a nontrespasser entrant. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  A guest entrant, let's call 

    

 

 

 

 

the person; right? 

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And when a trespasser enters 

   

  

 

 

 

your home, different sets of things foreseeably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen --

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- than when a guest enters 

   

  

 

 

 

 

your home. 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So it's not just an entry. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

The question is, who's entering:  a trespasser or a

guest? 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Correct.  And that is the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

47 

problem with this case, is that when the officers pulled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back the blanket, there was no indication and -- and no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason for them to know that the Mendezes knew that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were police officers. 

 

 

            

So in the trespasser example, if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

homeowner has a Second Amendment right -- obviously, she 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

does -- to point that weapon at the trespasser and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trespasser then shoots the homeowner, that's murder. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But -- but here, wait, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

wait.  Ordinary tort law, let's pick up on this for a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second. 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And don't answer it if it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a red herring.  But, look, everybody is talking about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causation.  Maybe this isn't about causation.  Perhaps 

  

  

 

 

 

 

it's about whether a reasonable person -- namely, a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable policeman -- namely, any reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

policeman -- would know in the circumstances that what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he was doing was unconstitutional.  What was he doing? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Shooting someone. 

 

            

Why would he know it was unconstitutional? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Well, here in ordinary tort law, Case 1, the trespasser 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonably believes, but wrongly believes, that he is an

48 

            

            

            

Case 2:  He knows he's a trespasser.  Okay? 

   

  

  

 

 

 

Does that make a difference to the result? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  It absolutely does make a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

difference to the result. 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because? 

  

 

MR. FELDMAN:  Because the legal principles 

  

 

 

 

 

that apply in those circumstances are different.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

homeowner has a right to use force against an unlawful 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entrant.  If the entrant is known to be a police 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer, not because of the knock-and-announce rule, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because he sees the uniform, then the rules change. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If the trespasser comes in and says, wait a second, I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just your neighbor and I'm looking for some, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need to use your telephone, the rules would change. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What -- just thinking, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

know, we want policemen to protect themselves.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to.  Of course they do.  But there can be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances where, of course, that's true that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a right to protect themselves, but the background 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances are such that there's no justification for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the whole ball of wax. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Correct.  And that --

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's, I think, what your 

   

  

 

 

 

argument is in respect to the warrant, if not the knock 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

and announce, you can't deal with that anymore.  So it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

the whole ball of wax which has less justification, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is clear that the action from A to Z is what caused 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the death.  Now, would -- you haven't really strongly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argued that, so I'm a little hesitant to bring it up. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, in a sense that's the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Petitioners' test, but -- but not quite.  I mean, what 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Petitioners would tell you is that you can at least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give these officers knowledge of what has happened 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beforehand.  And here's the four things those officers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

knew, which I think goes to the holistic reasonableness. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First, they knew they were entering 

 

 

 

 

 

someone's house, not -- not subjectively, objectively. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The reasonable officer on the scene knew that they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going into someone's house.  The objectively reasonable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

officer on the scene knew it was an unlawful entry.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objectively reasonable officer on the scene knew that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this was the Mendezes' house.  And the objectively 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable officer on the scene knew that the Mendezes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had no way of knowing that the officer was a police 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer.  So in that circumstance, it is objectively 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable and it is a Fourth Amendment violation to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

use force. 

 

            

If we look at it holistically, if we look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it through sort of the segmented approach of Kentucky v.

King, then it's the unreasonable actions that got the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 

police officer into that situation that preclude him 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from avoiding liability based on the fact that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Mendez moved a gun. 

   

 

 

            

And I would agree with the comments that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

were made earlier that this isn't about telling police 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officers they can't take actions to protect themselves. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We know that they will.  The question in the end is who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bears the brunt of the officers' unreasonable conduct? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because there's no allegation here that the Mendezes did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything wrong. 

 

            

If somebody comes into your house and you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

move a gun, you have a Second Amendment right to do 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  If you're in the privacy of your own home, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourth Amendment tells you that you can do anything you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want as long as it's not illegal.  And moving a gun 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly isn't illegal. 

 

 

            

So in the end, what happened here was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prompted by the officers, not by the Mendezes.  The only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception to that, of course, is the superseding cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine.  And we believe that this Court can resolve 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this entire case based on the superseding cause doctrine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the fact that the proximate cause doctrine, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

submit, was not properly --

superseding cause document.  Earlier you said to Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alito that if a police officer unlawfully enters your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

51 

home, announces him or herself, shows you a badge, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you pull out a gun and point it at him or her, that that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer would not be liable for shooting you because, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumably, that person, knowing that you're a police 

   

 

 

 

 

 

officer, if they pull a gun on you, they are responsible 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the consequences, correct? 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So what's 

  

  

 

 

 

the difference between that scenario and this one?  Why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aren't -- why isn't Mr. Mendez's -- I don't think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a dispute that he was moving the gun not because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he heard the police officers, but he just wanted to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it out of the way -- that there was no intent on his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part?  What -- why isn't it just like the other person 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who points the gun at someone? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  The difference is culpability. 

  

 

 

 

 

The test that we have proposed for superseding cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allows police officers to avoid liability if they can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show either that the intervening act was unforeseeable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or culpable.  If somebody --

  

 

 

 

            

law, right? 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This is standard tort 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. FELDMAN:  Yes, it is.  It flows directly 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

52 

from the restatement, and this Court has addressed these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues in the Exxon case and the Staub case.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

culpability is significant.  And so if an officer enters 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone's house, whether it's illegal or not, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occupants know that the police officer is a police 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer and yet they point a weapon at the police 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer, our concession, if you can call it that, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be that that was a superseding cause.  And when you look 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the case law, all of the cases, I think, address the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue the same way, including, of course, the Bodine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, why wasn't there --

  

 

 

 

 

 

what was the super -- why wasn't there superseding cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here after the failure to get the warrant? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

cause --

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  There was no superseding 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You -- you -- my 

  

 

 

 

 

 

understanding of your argument is you have not -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you are defending the Ninth Circuit's holding that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the officers violated the Fourth Amendment by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

searching the house without a warrant, that was the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

proximate cause, you're defending that. 

 

 

 

 

            

holding.

difficult position to defend. 

 

 

 

53 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Well, had it not been for the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entry, there would not have been any shooting.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize that's but-for causation, and I don't mean to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rely on but-for causation because then we have to go to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the next step, which is proximate cause. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And that's a question of directness on the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

one hand versus remoteness on the other.  The unlawful 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entry, the entry, that's the action, the entry led 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

directly to this shooting.  And so the proximate cause 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chain is not attenuated.  It is extremely direct. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I think that's 

   

   

  

 

 

the correct way to argue the case, and based on that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then we can have our discussion as to whether or not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- the -- it was indeed proximate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FELDMAN:  Thank you. 

  

 

 

            

If the Court doesn't have any questions, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will conclude simply by saying that this is a case, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite specifically, about how citizens ought to act when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are dealing with known law enforcement officers. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When people know that they are dealing with known law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement officers, nobody goes anywhere near a gun 

   

 

 

 

 

 

for fear of being shot.  But Mr. and Mrs. Mendez never 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had that opportunity because the Petitioners here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided to enter their home without warning, without a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Four minutes, Mr. Rosenkranz. 

 

 

 

        

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

Justice. 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

Let me start with Justice Kagan's question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Does a warrantless opening of a door create a different 

   

   

   

 

 

 

risk from an opening of a door, having called a judge 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and received approval in advance?  The answer is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no, and it goes directly to one of the last things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Feldman was saying.  An officer, in broad daylight, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in full uniform, when he simply opens a door, is not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expecting to be faced with a gun a foot away from him. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wait a minute.  This 

   

  

  

 

wasn't in the middle of the day. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, it was, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

It was 1 p.m. 

   

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  1 p.m. in the afternoon? 

    

 

 

 

 

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  Yes, Your Honor, middle of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the day.  He's drenched in sunlight.  Now, he does not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know that Mr. Mendez will not recognize him as a police 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

officer.  That goes to Mr. Feldman's point about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

culpability.  Culpability has to be viewed from the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

perspective of the officer.  That is what we are doing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 1983 cases and that's what Graham says you have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do.  From his perspective --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  He didn't have the 

  

 

 

 

 

technicality about the knock and announce.  Let's assume 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that this was a separate house, so it -- it required a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knock and announce.  There's nothing about the closure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

or any -- then -- then would you recognize that they had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a good 1983 case? 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  They -- they would have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

much better 1983 case, Your Honor, which --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it much better or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would they -- would they have --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. ROSENKRANZ:  There would still be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

discussion to be had about whether when an officer shows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up in full uniform someone should expect to understand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he is an officer. 

 

 

 

 

            

But -- but let's just go broaden that to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Justice Breyer's question about looking at all of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this holistically.  First, this Court has said you don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at it holistically.  Hudson says you break up the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

warrant requirement from the knock-and-announce 

 

 

 

 

requirement.  That is what this Court did.  And that's

what this Court should certainly do in a liability case, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but let's go holistically. 

 

 

 

            

Put yourselves in the shoes of these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56 

deputies, which is what 1983 says, and this -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Graham says we're supposed to do.  You are not looking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to hurt anyone.  You're doing your job, which is to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apprehend someone you believe to be armed and dangerous. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You look at a shack.  You believe there's no 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

way on God's earth that anyone would live in that shack, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a conclusion that a judge later concludes was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonable but credits that that was a firmly held 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

belief by these deputies. 

 

 

 

            

You move a curtain back, in broad daylight, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

but in the darkness you see the silhouette of a gun 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed at you, and it's only a foot away from your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

face.  You think it's O'Dell, the armed and dangerous 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person who you think -- who you think is hiding in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shack.  You reasonably think this is where I'm going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

die, and you have only a second to decide what to do. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Any rule that says that you can't fire in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance is an untenable rule. 

 

 

 

 

            

Whether you look at it from the perspective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of proximate cause going forward, or you look at it from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the perspective of the provocation doctrine moving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

backwards, when this Court talks about the totality of

the circumstances, yes, an officer should be absorbing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57 

the totality of the circumstances, but only with a view, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you're talking about the seizure, only with a view 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

toward understanding what is the risk I'm facing here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and now.  That's the question he has to answer in that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

split second. 

 

            

And the risk that he is facing here and now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has nothing to do with whether he committed a mistake 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier on.  His life and the lives of the people he is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protecting do not matter any less just because there was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a mistake en route to the confrontation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If there are no further questions, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respectfully request that the Court reverse the Ninth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit's judgment.  Thank you, your Honor.
