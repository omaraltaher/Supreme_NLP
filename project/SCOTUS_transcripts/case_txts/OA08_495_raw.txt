 (10:04 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 
argument first this morning in Nijhawan v. Holder.

 Mr. Moseley.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. MOSELEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MOSELEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 At issue in this case is an aggravated 

felony definition, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), one that 
serves both as a ground of deportation and as an 
integral part of a Federal criminal statute.

 For the Court's convenient reference, 

because I suspect we will return to this and the other 
definitions, I would refer the Court to the statutory 
appendix in the government's brief:  3a gives (M)(i); 6a 
gives the conviction requirement; and 7a to 8a gives the 
underlying criminal statute in which this aggravated 
felony definition forms an integral part.

 Now, Congress has required -- for 

deportation, Congress has required conviction of this 
defined offense, in a definition that says absolutely 
nothing about the word "tether" utilized by the Third 
Circuit below, and the definition begins with a

restrictive clause, "that," to require conviction of 
both the fraud and deceit element and also the loss 
amount as an integral part of this definition.

 Since Congress required conviction, the 

time-honored categorical approach really should be the 
governing standard, and I submit that there's nothing in 
the plain language of the statute, the underlying 
statute enacted by Congress, to oust that time-honored 
approach, which I submit is perhaps on a par as being 
presumptively applicable, similarly to the -- to the 
stay standards that this Court discussed very recently 
in the Nken case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Another --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under the time-honored --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, please.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under the time-honored 
approach, if the jury verdict necessarily -- or not 
necessarily, but did in fact refer to the amount 
involved and it was over $10,000, would that be part of 
the time-honored approach and then the statute would be 
fulfilled?

 MR. MOSELEY:  I -- under those 

circumstances, Justice Kennedy, yes.  But here the jury 
was specifically instructed that they did not have to 
make any finding with respect to loss in this case.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in that connection, 
at some point in the argument -- and you may be a little 
early because you're talking about the statute -- I'd 
like to know either anecdotally from your experience or 
-- or because it's written somewhere, how often do 
juries give special verdicts?  It actually applies in 
the second case we're to hear as well.  And has that 
changed in the light of -- of Apprendi?  In -- in my 
experience, we just didn't know many of the features of 
the crime from -- from the jury verdict, and I just 
would like to know if that's changed in this day and 
age.

 MR. MOSELEY:  Well, I -- I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you may reach that 

after you've talked about the statute.

 MR. MOSELEY:  Yes, but let me -- certainly 

among the State statutes that we cite, the State 
statutes where it's clear that a loss amount is an 
element, the jury is going to be instructed they have to 
return that, and they do.  The -- the special verdict 
opportunity here is in effect, I would submit, a kind of 
lifeline, if you will, that we're giving to the 
government in these -- in these more general fraud 
statutes, where the government has that -- certainly has 
that opportunity or that option to do.  But there

certainly have been -- and I know we cite them in our 
brief -- cases --

JUSTICE ALITO:  And if you -- if you do 
extend that lifeline to the government, aren't you 
conceding that the amount of the loss is not an element 
of the offense, and aren't you conceding that it is not 
necessary for the loss amount to be an element of the 
offense?

 MR. MOSELEY:  No, Justice Alito.  What I am 

saying is that this statute -- and again, (M)(i) was 
enacted as part of a number of criminal statutes --
excuse me -- as a number of provisions that were 
addressed to white collar offenses, of which this is 
just one, and it also encompasses the State -- it also 
encompasses the State statutes where this clearly is --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me give you a 

concrete example.  Let's say it's a Federal mail fraud 
case.  Let's say there are two Federal mail fraud cases, 
and you don't have to prove the amount of loss in order 
to convict under the mail fraud statute.  In the first 
case, after the jury returns a guilty verdict they also 
return -- or together with that they answer a special 
interrogatory and they say the loss exceeded $10,000. 
In the second case, the defendant pleads guilty and 
admits during the plea colloquy that the amount is more

than $10,000.  Would there be a problem in those cases?
 MR. MOSELEY:  In those cases, no.  In those 

cases, that would have satisfied the traditional 
categorical approach.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In this --
JUSTICE ALITO:  And then --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In this case, how many of 
the defendants were alien?  You're -- the jury is given 
a charge that covers all of the defendants.  They're all 
charged with the same crime.  How many of them were 
aliens?

 MR. MOSELEY:  I believe two in addition to 
Mr. Nijhawan, Justice Ginsburg.  I believe two or three 
more were.  This case -- this case involved roughly 15 
defendants.  There are only five who went to trial.  The 
number who -- the number who are aliens, in addition to 
Mr. Nijhawan, I believe were two.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then the judge wouldn't 
distinguish -- it would not be relevant for the -- for 
the defendants who were not aliens because it would have 
no consequences for them.  So why should the judge --
even if the question could be asked, why should the 
judge -- the judge takes a position:  It's not an 
element of the crime.  Therefore, I'm not going to 
charge it, and I'm not going to confuse the jury by

saying as to the defendants who are aliens, you have to 
find the amount.

 MR. MOSELEY:  Well, under -- under those --

under those circumstances, Justice Ginsburg, Mr. 
Nijhawan actually himself had asked for a charge with --
with respect to loss.  I don't think -- I don't think 
there's an issue of jury confusion here, and indeed 
under -- under -- ironically under this Court's -- well, 
this would have been a situation in which a request was 
-- could have been made.  I don't think there would have 
been -- there certainly wouldn't have been jury 
confusion to have requested it here.

 But I think you have to put this in -- in 
the larger picture of a statute of a set of aggravated 
felony definitions that were enacted.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But before you go on to 

that, we're talking about (M)(i).  It's coupled with 
another provision that's an offense that is described in 
section 21 -- 7201 of Title 26 -- that's tax evasion --
in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds 
10,000.  So it's the same "in which" construction, and 
there's no requirement -- to convict someone of tax 
evasion, the jury does not have to find the deficiency.

 MR. MOSELEY:  Well, actually, Justice 

Ginsburg, under this Court's decision in Boulware, a

deficiency is indeed a necessary element of that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  A deficiency, but not the 

amount of the deficiency.

 MR. MOSELEY:  But -- no.  A -- a deficiency 

is a necessary element of that offense.  That's --
that's where, for example, the Babaisakov decision got 
that point flatly wrong.  And this is, I think, the 
classic --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But is the amount --

there's a deficiency.  The jury has to find in order to 
find tax evasion there is a deficiency.  Does it have to 
find that the revenue loss to the government exceeds 
$10,000?

 MR. MOSELEY:  No, it doesn't have to find 

that, but it may.  And this is a classic example of the 
application of the modified categorical approach, where 
this statute sweeps broadly to include both loss amounts 
or, in this case, revenue loss amounts that would exceed 
$10,000 and those that would be less than $10,000.  Most 
of these cases, most of the tax cases, as the 
government's own materials that we cite indicate, are 
resolved by guilty pleas with respect to where those 
amounts are designated.  And I think it's important here 
to realize that by pairing these two statutes, by 
pairing these two provisions, (M)(i) and (M)(ii),

Congress in effect I submit sent the signal with that 
language in (M)(ii) that we're talking about the kind --
we're talking about the application of the modified 
categorical --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the -- What is the 
difference between a defendant's saying during a guilty 
plea colloquy, the loss was -- I admit the loss was more 
than $10,000; and the defendant's agreeing for 
sentencing purposes that the loss was more than $10,000?
 MR. MOSELEY:  Because, Justice Alito, in the 

sentencing context we're truly dealing with a 
post-verdict situation where the government in terms of 
having to prove loss is up against a far lesser amount 
-- a far more liberal standard, a preponderance of the 
evidence standard.  And the defendant under those 
circumstances --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, if he's admitting it, 

what does the standard of the evidence matter?

 MR. MOSELEY:  He's admitting it here, 
Justice Souter, under these circumstances.  He's 
admitting it here only in the context of a resolution of 
the sentencing issue.  If you go back to the --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, he's not saying, I 

admit to a degree of preponderance of the evidence that 
it was over 10,000.  He's saying, period, over 10,000.

The burden of proof, the standard of proof doesn't 
matter.

 MR. MOSELEY:  No, but he's -- but he's doing 

this in the context of resolving, of resolving a 
disputed issue with respect to --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  And he definitively 

resolves it by admission.

 MR. MOSELEY:  But he does so certainly in 

the context of reserving, of reserving his right to 
contest that and to make the arguments that we're making 
here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, I understand the facts 

of this case.  I was commenting on your answer to 
Justice Alito's question, and it would seem to me that 
the answer to the question is there is no difference.

 MR. MOSELEY:  No, I submit -- I submit that 

there -- there really is a -- a profound difference 
under the circumstances of someone being in a situation 
before, before conviction, and then someone being in a 
postconviction situation.  And then I think we should 
come back in terms -- we should come back to the 
underlying, to the underlying requirement that the 
person had been -- the person under the statute be 
convicted of the loss.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right, that really gets

to the question that I was going to ask, and that is, I 
don't see how the modified categorical approach is 
something that you could admit would be sufficient 
because, as I understand your argument -- and it is in 
part an argument based on sort of standard grammatical 
construction -- you're saying that in the definition 
"The term 'aggravated felony' means an offense that" --
and you emphasize the "that," the restrictive nature of 
the "that" clause -- "involves fraud or deceit in which 
the loss exceeds $10,000."

 if I understand your restrictive clause argument, 

the definition of the offense has got to include the 
element of exceeding $10,000 or it does not satisfy 
your, the -- it does not satisfy the standard that you 
were arguing for based on the restrictive clause.  So it 
seems to me that you've got to go the whole hog or you 
get nothing, and the whole hog is that it's got to be an 
element of the offense that the loss exceed $10,000.  Am 
I wrong?

 MR. MOSELEY:  I don't think necessarily. 

Well, under these circumstances, Justice Souter, what I 
would say is that there may be statutes, there may be 
statutes in which, there are statutes, there are State 
statutes, where you have a range of conduct that may 
include $10,000, may not include $10,000, and the

modified categorical approach would apply under those.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay, how about this one. 
You were arguing based on this statute and you make an 
argument based on the restrictive nature of a "that" 
modifying clause, and if you're going to make the 
restrictive clause argument, it seems to me you've got 
to go the whole hog and say the element of the offense 
has got to include the loss in excess of $10,000.

 MR. MOSELEY:  Certainly if it does, then 

under the statutes involved here we would prevail.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, yeah, you would 

prevail, but you would prevail, it seems to me, at the 
expense of this objection, and the government makes it. 
There are very, very few fraud and deceit statutes that 
define the offense by reference to a loss in excess of 
$10,000.  My recollection from the government's brief is 
that they come up with three.

 The fact is also that this provision, the 
$10,000 figure, was placed into the statute at a time 
when Congress was trying to expand the category of 
deportable, removable offenses, and it would be passing 
strange in that context to define the offense by 
reference to a $10,000 figure as an element of the 
offense which would cut it down, which would cut the 
compass of the statute down to three offenses.  What is

your response to that?

 MR. MOSELEY:  Well, I think the government 
vastly understates the statutory provisions that were 
involved here.  Even if you look at the State statutes, 
a majority of the State statutes, as I think we make 
clear in our reply brief, a majority of States have 
statutes, generally the theft by deception statutes and 
others which have loss thresholds that will get you over 
--

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, once you get into the 

State statutes you get into the further problem of an 
utter and I would suppose unjust patchwork of statutory 
reference to which this would apply.  If you -- if you 
steal the $11,000 in State A, you get booted out of the 
country.  If you steal it across the State line in State 
B, you stay home.  I mean, I can't imagine that Congress 
would have enacted that kind of scheme.

 MR. MOSELEY:  But what Congress has done 

here is to provide for a uniform test, in effect.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  A uniform test that 
produces both unjust results and I would suppose 
strangely unsatisfying results to a Congress that wanted 
to expand the concept of deportable offense.

 MR. MOSELEY:  But what -- but what -- if I 
can just go back for a moment, Justice Souter, to the

original premise that it under all circumstances has to 
be an element.  There are certainly statutes, even 
Federal statutes, for example, the theft from Federal --
federally funded programs, which give specific loss 
amounts of 5,000 or more, which would -- which -- excuse 
me.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the problem is that 
there's no pattern to it, The point that Justice Souter 
made.  If we take your position that there are a number 
of statutes that mention amount, some as an element, 
some by this, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to 
when the amount is there and when it isn't, and then you 
have these unequal results within the Federal system and 
in the States, so when you think -- would it make any 
sense for Congress to have drawn the line that way if 
the State happens to make -- to have the "in which" or 
if it just has fraud and deceit with no amount?

 MR. MOSELEY:  What -- Justice Ginsburg, I 
think what Congress did here was to create a uniform 
test, a uniform test in the sense you look to see if --
if someone has been convicted of both these 
requirements, fraud or deceit or the loss.  That 
certainly produces far more uniformity than had --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's treating people 

who do the identical thing differently.

MR. MOSELEY:  But Congress chose under these 
circumstances, Congress chose under these circumstances 
to -- swept broadly to, swept broadly to State statutes 
in addition, in addition, in addition to, in addition to 
encompassing the Federal statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what you're saying is 
you're not denying that people who commit the identical 
theft or deceit or fraud will be treated differently 
depending on whether the statute under which they're 
convicted has this "in which" clause?

 MR. MOSELEY:  What I believe, what I believe 
that I am conceding is that it will determine -- as with 
any of the criminal cases that lead to deportation, it 
will determine -- it will be determined on the basis of 
how the prosecution chooses -- excuse me -- chooses to 
charge.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Moseley --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Moseley, can I get 

your help on a question I really have difficulty with. 
It seems to me as I read the text, it is easy to read it 
in one of two ways:  It involves fraud or deceit in 
which the loss to the victim in fact exceeded $10,000. 
In that case you would lose.  Or it could be read to say 
involves fraud or deceit in which an element of the 
crime is that the victim or victims exceeded a loss of

$10,000.  You would lose under that also because it is 
not an element of the crime.

 So you are relying on a modified approach, 
and under your modified approach what does the statute 
say?

 MR. MOSELEY:  The -- the statute -- the 

statute says that someone has to be convicted of -- of 
both these aspects, both of --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But the statute doesn't 

say anything about conviction.

 MR. MOSELEY:  If, Justice Stevens, if you 

read it in conjunction with the conviction 
requirement -- in other words, to -- to be deportable, 
to be deportable, that's in -- in 6a.  Someone who has 
been convicted of an aggravated felony is deportable; 
and also someone who has been convicted of an aggravated 
felony is subject to, under -- under --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't -- I don't 
understand how you squeeze your -- your modified 
categorical approach, which seems to be a deus ex 
machina which is intended to blunt the government's 
argument that very few statutes would be covered by 
this.  I don't see how you get that out of the word 
"convicted."

more than $10,000 if in a separate interrogatory the 
jury, though it has no obligation in order to find you 
guilty to say how much you stole, in an interrogatory 
the jury says, oh, yes, the amount was more than 
$10,000?  Does that cause you to have been convicted of 
that?  You are convicted of what you are charged with. 
You are convicted of the elements of the offense, not --
not of whatever, whatever the judge chooses to allow the 
jury to be questioned about.

 MR. MOSELEY:  I think under those 

circumstances, though, particularly if you look at the 
statutes which make gradations of sentencing on the 
basis of loss amounts, you clearly would be convicted of 
that.  It is -- because that's a necessary element 
that's going to -- that's a necessary fact that's going 
to have to be found to put you in a particular 
sentencing range.  So you -- so you definitely would be 
-- you would be under those circumstances convicted of 
that amount.

 But I think it's important to -- to 

recognize what -- that Congress -- that Congress in 
enacting the statute and in predicating removal upon 
conviction used language that sharply distinguishes --
that is sharply distinguished from the position that the 
government advocates here that loss should be something

to be determined in separate -- in -- in separate 
removal proceedings.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can we go back to my 
question, which I don't think you've fully answered? 
And that's the tax evasion situation.  For any tax -- a 
person who is charged with tax evasion who goes to trial 
and is convicted, that person would not be deportable, 
as I understand it under your reading, because the jury 
is not asked to determine the amount of the deficiency.
 MR. MOSELEY:  Well, the jury -- under those 

circumstances, it will depend upon how the government 
chooses, Justice Ginsburg, to prosecute the case.  And 
if the government chooses to prosecute the case by 
seeking a determination of the deficiency amount in a 
jury charge, then -- then, yes -- then, yes, indeed, 
they would.  But again, the vast majority of these cases 
are resolved.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I know.  You told me that 

most of them admit it at the plea stage.  But going to 
trial, these are parallel provisions, and it seems to me 
they are meant to operate the same way.

 MR. MOSELEY:  Well, they -- they are -- they 

are meant to operate the same way.  But I think that 
what we have here is a situation where the fact that 
deficiency is a requirement and that deficiency in most

cases will be established by a plea, and that this is a 
statute that sweeps broadly; that this is a statute that 
sweeps -- excuse me -- sweeps broadly to encompass both 
a loss in excess of 10,000 -- a deficiency in excess of 
$10,000 or a deficiency under $10,000.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Did you have any authority 

for the -- the idea that a trial judge in a criminal 
case should ask the jury to answer a special 
interrogatory regarding a question that has no bearing 
on the conviction, but may have a bearing on the future 
immigration status of the defendant, which is what 
you're suggesting should be done in these tax cases?

 MR. MOSELEY:  What -- what I am suggesting 

in the tax case is that it would be perfectly 
appropriate for the government to seek such a special 
interrogatory if they wish to establish the tax loss, 
which is an element of the -- which is a necessary 
component of the offense, if they wanted to establish it 
-- if they wanted to establish it for -- for purposes --
for whatever purpose they wanted to establish it.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I can see that if 

there are multiple defendants in the case, some of the 
defendants might say that this is unnecessary, it's 
inflammatory.

again, that is going to depend on -- that's going to 
depend upon how the government chooses to -- to 
prosecute under these particular --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But all that just 

underscores the fact that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- your earlier -- your 
earlier assertion that it was necessary to -- that --
that it would be necessary to get that -- that amount 
specified for sentencing purposes is simply not true.  I 
mean, we didn't -- we didn't hold that the guidelines 
are mandatory, and you -- that you need a -- a jury 
determination.  We've said they are discretionary.

 MR. MOSELEY:  No, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So if you don't have a jury 

determination, you can still sentence on the basis of 
the amount taken, even though that was not found by the 
jury.

 MR. MOSELEY:  I -- I understand.  But my --

my point, Justice Scalia, on this one is that -- on 
(M)(ii) is that it is -- it is a statute in which -- in 
which loss can or is required to be shown, some 
deficiency is required to be shown, and this may -- and 
this may well be done by the modified -- the modified 
categorical approach, particularly in -- in --
particularly in situations in which, as in most cases,

it's resolved by a plea.

 Now, if -- if -- but -- and also, this 

statute was enacted against the backdrop of -- of the 
categorical approach, and the act was amended -- has 
been amended roughly four times during this period with 
no indication that Congress certainly intended to 
jettison this.  And I think it's also important here to 
note the structure of the act in terms of how Congress 
sharply distinguished between what would happen with 
conviction and -- and what would happen with sentence.

 They did enact specific provisions, 

101(a)(43), subpart (F) at 2a of the statutory appendix 
and (G) at 2a of the statutory appendix, which talk 
about -- which -- which talk about sentencing and make 
that sharp distinction.

 But I think we should not also lose sight of 

the overarching fact here that this provision is an 
integral part of a Federal criminal statute, 1326(b), so 
that any ambiguity in the -- so that an ambiguity in the 
construction and application of this statute should as 
-- similarly to -- to what this Court held in Leocal, 
should be resolved in favor of the -- in favor of the 
alien, because it's the classic multiple or dual use 
statute that has both civil and criminal applications, 
and very severe criminal applications as well.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. GANNON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Petitioner's reading of subparagraph (M)(i) 

implausibly excludes the mainstays of Federal fraud 
prosecutions and applies at best to a tiny handful of 
outlying offenses:  Thefts of major works of art, 
extreme cases of government contract fraud, and some 
frauds obtaining confidential phone records and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, except -- except for 

his modified hangout.  His modified -- his modified 
categorical does -- does expand; doesn't it?

Scalia, that he does offer this -- this variation on a 
so-called modified categorical approach by saying that 
we could use extraneous facts in guilty pleas in order 
to satisfy the categorical approach.  But we think that 
that doesn't work for both practical reasons and for the 
types of reasons that -- that several of the questions 
raised in the first half of the argument --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And also interrogatories to 

the jury.

 MR. GANNON:  He does seem to contemplate 

that interrogatories for the jury might also achieve the 
same purpose.  But as Justice Alito was pointing out, 
there -- there is little reason to believe that a judge 
is going to permit such extraneous questions to be put 
to a jury that are -- that are not necessary for the 
criminal proceeding that is actually being held at that 
point.  It's unlikely that the government wants to make 
the entire -- wants to imply that the conviction needs 
to turn on that.

 And obviously, both with the -- the special 

interrogatories and the guilty pleas, there are 
practical problems, because this could only apply 
prospectively, even though Congress's definition of 
aggravated felonies is intended to apply to convictions 
that predated the enactment of IIRIRA.  It -- I just

mean that it would not be until we knew that this was 
the rule, that we could implement such -- such a rule. 
And it's not clear why any alien who would be contesting 
his removability in the civil removal proceedings would 
concede in the -- in a guilty plea or to a fact that is 
extraneous to that conviction that would ultimately --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this -- but this 

defendant did ask, didn't -- he asked the judge.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, he did not ask the judge 

for a finding of loss.  He -- he asked for an 
instruction -- for a special interrogatory as to "the 
amount of money my client is responsible for."  That's 
on page 14a of his opening brief.  And that's not the 
relevant question for purposes of the loss threshold in 
subparagraph (M)(i), which is actually about the -- the 
loss to the victims from the offense involving fraud or 
deceit, not how much any individual defendant might have 
been responsible for.  And even now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but then you 
just -- you, the government, says -- you know, you'll 
have a little debate about what the special 
interrogatory, how it is phrased, and your objection 
there could be dealt with on -- during that negotiation.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, and at that point he --

he -- we -- we presumably wouldn't want to have to prove

up a loss at that point that's irrelevant for purposes 
of the criminal guilt proceeding, although it may well 
become relevant for the sentencing proceeding, as it did 
become relevant here, and there was a sentencing 
stipulation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and why would you 
be reluctant to do that?  Would you just spell that out 
a little bit?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I -- I think that it 

could confuse the jury.  Even if it were clear that it 
had nothing to do with a determination of guilt, that 
would be a particularly odd sort of bifurcation to 
thrust upon the original criminal proceeding, to require 
the jury to make findings about facts that are truly 
extraneous to the purposes of the criminal proceeding 
that is being held there, and for -- at least for guilt 
purposes, there is no reason for the jury to have to 
find that.

 And as -- as the questions before were 
making clear, the reason this Court has applied the 
modified categorical approach is to determine what is 
necessary for the underlying conviction.  That's why 
it's tied to an investigation into what really were the 
elements of the underlying offense.  And interrogatories 
about facts that were not, in fact, necessary for the

conviction or -- or extraneous facts that are introduced 
into guilty pleas do not change the fact that that 
particular attribute was not necessary for the 
conviction.

 And so, we think that it makes sense, in 

context of the other definitions in paragraph 43 of the 
definition of aggravated felonies, where it is 
indisputable that there are multiple provisions that 
include both an element that needs to be evaluated as an 
element of the offense and some other limiting factor 
that need not be an element of the offense; that it 
makes sense to construe the loss threshold in 
subparagraph (M)(i) as something that need not be an 
element, because the consequences of Petitioner's 
approach would be to read out virtually all Federal 
fraud prosecutions, including such mainstays as mail 
fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the government, 
bank fraud, the offenses that were at issue here.

 And he does offer a patchwork of some State 

offenses that could be satisfied.  But even there, 
there -- there's not any particular consistency to it. 
He invokes the Model Penal Code, which has a gradation 
scheme for theft by deception offenses.  And although 
the BIA has -- has acknowledged that theft by deception 
offenses may in certain circumstances constitute fraud

offenses, the Model Penal Code does not in the next 
chapter dealing with forgery and fraudulent practices 
have a consistent gradation scheme.

 So even in the States that Petitioner cites 

in his reply brief, Delaware doesn't have monetary 
thresholds for insurance fraud, even though it does for 
health care fraud; and New Jersey doesn't have monetary 
thresholds for credit card fraud or payment card fraud, 
and so a million-dollar fraud would not be -- would not 
be treated consistently, depending upon which State it 
was committed in and even which type of fraud it was in 
an individual State, if the State --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I ask you this, does 

this -- which is not exactly on point to the issue here, 
but does the government have a theory about how the loss 
is measured for purposes of this statute?  Under the 
sentencing guidelines, the loss was a very complicated 
calculation, lots of rules about relevant conduct and 
lots of cases and different ways of proving loss, and 
here we just have the statute.

 MR. GANNON:  Yes, we think that it is not 

necessarily the same as the loss determination that 
would be made for sentencing.  And so, the board has 
made it very clear that even though a restitution order, 
for example, can be sufficient evidence of loss to the

victim, that it needs to be assessed with an eye to 
exactly what losses were determined in the underlying 
restitution order and with regard to the burden of proof 
there.  And so --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What if you have somebody 

who participates in a -- in a scheme involving 
$100 million, the total loss is $100 million, but this 
person had no way of reasonably anticipating that this 
would be the -- the total amount of the loss, this was a 
minor participant, and -- where would the -- how would 
that come out?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that the text of 
the statute here in subparagraph (M)(i) talks about an 
offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss 
to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.  And so, we 
think that the loss threshold is tied to the offense 
that involves fraud or deceit, not to the individual 
defendant's role.

 If he's convicted of a $100 million fraud or 

in this case what may well have been a $683 million 
fraud, he is -- that -- that is the offense of which he 
was convicted, and it is an offense in which the loss to 
the victims exceeded $10,000.  And so we think --

say, as to this particular defendant, he was just an 
accountant with the company that was committing the 
fraud, he didn't put anything into his own pocket except 
the salary they paid him, so I'm going to exclude him 
from the restitution order?

 MR. GANNON:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in 

general the -- the judge does have discretion to -- to 
adjust aspects of the restitution order on the basis of 
the facts of the underlying offense.  And that's --
that's one of the reasons why I think the board has been 
sensitive to the idea that the restitution order does 
not necessarily determine what the amount of loss is 
going to be for purposes of --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you wouldn't allow 
that exclusion to have any effect on deportation, would 
you?

 MR. GANNON:  It would depend upon the facts 
of the underlying case.  If the underlying fraud was one 
in which the victims lost nor than $10,000 and we could 
prove that by clear and convincing evidence in the 
removal proceeding, then -- then we think that we would 
not be bound by the judge's discretionary refusal to 
impose a restitution requirement on the particular 
defendant.

hypothetical --

MR. GANNON:  Depending upon the facts of the 
case, yes, Justice Ginsburg, in your hypothetical if we 
can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the 
amount of loss associated with a fraud offense was more 
than $10,000, we think that would satisfy.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even -- even though this 

defendant did not pocket any gain?

 MR. GANNON:  Yes.  Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 

It's not a pecuniary gain threshold.  It's a loss to the 
victim threshold.  And -- and although the judge may 
well take that into account for purposes of restitution, 
it doesn't change the metric that Congress chose to 
determine which types of frauds are serious enough to be 
considered aggravated felonies.

 In 1994, they -- they picked a threshold of 

$200,000.  In 1996, they dropped that to 5 percent of 
that value, to $10,000.  I think Congress's judgment 
here is that if the fraud is so severe that it --
that -- that somebody -- that the victims lost $10,000, 
then -- then that is a qualifying offense for purposes 
of subparagraph (M)(i), even if the original criminal 
sentencing judge, on the basis of all sorts of factors 
associated with the case and under the restitution 
standards, decided that the defendant was not

necessarily liable to pay restitution in that amount.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the 

defendant's argument that at least as far as his 
admission for sentencing purposes, he did that only 
because otherwise the government wouldn't ask for a 
downward departure?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I -- I think that we are 
not taking the position that the -- the stipulation for 
sentencing purposes, which was pursuant to (6)(B)of the 
guidelines and was for stipulation purposes -- we're not 
arguing that that is -- is dispositive in the -- in the 
civil removal proceeding.  We're arguing that it's 
persuasive evidence of the amount of loss here.

 And so, he's -- he is certainly able to say 
before the board or before the immigration judge that --
that for some reason the amount that he admitted to 
isn't really the -- the actual amount of loss associated 
with the case.  That's not what he has done here.  He 
has -- he has consistently tried to establish that --
that this -- these -- this gargantuan loss amount was --
was not one that was found by the jury, not that it was 
not in fact the loss that actually accrued in 
association with the --

in this case had been -- let's say it's a mail fraud 
case, they proved one mailing and one victim lost $30, 
and that's all the trial established, but as a matter of 
fact you could establish this was part of a scheme, just 
like the one we've got here, in which millions of 
dollars were lost, you could prove that independently 
and he would still be required to be deported?

 MR. GANNON:  Not necessarily, Justice 

Stevens.  If the conviction was for the entire scheme, 
then we could bring in the amounts that were relevant to 
the scheme.  But if --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But the scheme -- the 

evidence of the scheme consisted of just two mailings, 
say.  They allege a scheme and say it's a broad -- a 
broad scheme, but they don't describe the amount.  They 
merely prove two mailings that involved $25 apiece.  But 
the scheme itself, because you proved it in other cases, 
you have the facts, actually was a big scheme like we 
have here.  Could they rely on that for -- for 
immigration purposes in a proceeding like this?

 MR. GANNON:  It's possible.  I think it 

would depend upon exactly what we could determine had 
actually been associated with the original --

amount of evidence in this case, we had sentencing 
stipulations and all sorts of determinations at the time 
of the sentencing where the defendant did not even try 
to argue that this wasn't actually the amount of loss 
associated with his offense and conviction, then we 
probably would be able to establish by clear and 
convincing that the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not -- I -- I'm losing 
you.  I would -- I would have thought that you have to 
have convicted him of the larger scheme.

 MR. GANNON:  I -- I thought, Justice Scalia, 
that that was the premise of Justice Stevens' question. 
That that --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, it was.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But it didn't describe the 

dimensions of the scheme.  As far as the record shows, 
it only affected -- it was one scheme that was as large 
as this one, but the evidence to prove the scheme only 
required you to prove two or three mailings involving 
small amounts of money.  But then later on you proved 
before the immigration judge there really was a big 
scheme, and that's the one he was convicted of.  Isn't 
that enough?

this, we had the evidence contemporaneous with 
sentencing, with $100 million stipulations and things 
like that, and that makes it obviously much easier for 
us to prove the extent of the underlying fraud.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I know it's easy; I'm 

wondering if it's necessary.  I -- I think under your 
theory, it would not be necessary.  As long as the 
evidence is out there, you can use it in a de novo 
proceeding before the immigration judge.

 MR. GANNON:  If -- if that were, in fact, 
the scope of the conviction, because it was for -- for 
the entire fraudulent scheme, then that may well be so. 
Obviously, that -- the cases that have applied the --
the tethered approach, to use the word that Petitioners 
invoked here, are cases in which the -- the courts and 
the BIA have recognized that sometimes it is necessary 
to recognize that there's a distinction between what the 
defendant actually pleaded guilty to.  If the defendant 
pleads guilty to only an individual account, that's

involved in the scheme --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, my -- he pleads guilty 

to the mammoth scheme proved, the evidence before the 
court or on the plea colloquy, whatever is described is 
enough to show that he was guilty.
 MR. GANNON:  Well I --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  But then as I understand 

it, you can prove the size of the scheme later on.

 MR. GANNON:  I -- in those circumstances I 

-- I think that we may well be able to prove that in the 
second proceeding.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I would -- I thought 

that was the whole case we had before us, Where you 
haven't proved either as an element or -- or by a 
separate jury finding how much money was involved.  Your 
point is you don't have to.

 MR. GANNON:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You can establish that 

later.

 MR. GANNON:  Yes, that's right, Justice 
Scalia, and as long as it is the scope of the scheme 
that -- that he was convicted --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I suppose your answer, 

it's your first argument, it's the -- it's the offense.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if for Blockburger 

purposes or for double jeopardy purposes, you couldn't 
retry him for those other -- for that additional loss, 
then that's -- I assume your argument is that that's 
included within the offense for which he was convicted.
 MR. GANNON:  As long as the offense were in 
fact the scheme rather than an individual instance of a 
mailing, that's correct; and so I think that that --
that that is consistent with Justice Stevens' 
hypothetical and that we would in those circumstances be 
able to -- attempts to prove by clear and convincing 
evidence in the civil removal proceedings that the loss 
associated with the offense, which was the scheme rather 
than just an individual mailing, then -- then we would 
be able to prove that.  Given --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Your position is that in 

ancillary, subsequent proceedings anything you prove 
that's within the offense convicted -- say, as measured 
by double jeopardy purposes, as protection against 
multiple prosecutions, that you can make that showing?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, with -- here it's --

we're not trying to prove a separate criminal offense. 
We're trying to prove that the offense --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I take it that that's your 

whole argument.

 MR. GANNON:  Yes, that it -- this is the 

offense of conviction.  This is just like the domestic 
relationship prong of the misdemeanor crime of domestic 
violence that the Court decided in its recent decision 
in United States v Hayes, that -- that there is a prior 
conviction, some aspects of which were elements of the 
underlying offense, and in order to establish whether 
the prior conviction needs the statutory definition in 
the subsequent proceeding, the government will need to 
bear the appropriate burden of proof for that 
proceeding.  Whether it's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the appropriate 

burden of proof was beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is 
in the second proceeding, the recidivist, the multiple 
offender proceeding --

MR. GANNON:  Yes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- the relationship, 

domestic relationship had to be proved beyond a 
reasonable doubt, which is not the standard that the BIA 
used.

 MR. GANNON:  I -- I think it was beyond the 

reasonable doubt in the context of the 922(g)(9) 
prosecution --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.
 MR. GANNON:  -- because that was itself a 

criminal proceeding, and that's right, Justice Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, yes.
 MR. GANNON:  We think that if this 

definition were -- were to be applied in the criminal 
context, then we would need to prove this aspect, the 
loss threshold.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's what you're 

talking about, the alien who is convicted of a 
qualifying crime, an aggravating felony, then tries --
then comes back illegally.  The difference between two 
years and 20 years, you admit there you would have to 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt?

 MR. GANNON:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, just to 

be clear it's -- there's already a 10-year statutory 
maximum that applies under 1326(b)(1) for the prior 
conviction for a felony.  I think that's something that 
can easily be established through the categorical 
approach and we would not need to have a "beyond a 
reasonable doubt" determination in the illegal reentry 
proceeding under 1326 to determine it's a felony.

 But in order to determine that it is an 
aggravated felony, as long as we could not satisfy 
through a categorical approach to demonstrate that it

was an element of the offense in the original 
proceeding, then, yes, I agree; we would need to meet 
the relevant burden of proof in the 1326(b)(2) 
proceeding.

 Now, as it happens, this -- the extra 
10-year statutory maximum at issue in 1326(b)(2) 
effectively never gets litigated because the sentencing 
guidelines arrange for aggravated felony enhancements in 
that context for crimes like subparagraph (M)(1), ranges 
from 21 months on the low end with no criminal history 
to 5 months on the high end with criminal history of 6. 
And so this effectively -- the extra 10 years of 
statutory range is never employed by -- by judges for 
these types of crimes.

 In the last three years, according to 
sentencing commission data, there isn't a single 
defendant in the 1326 proceeding who received a sentence 
of more than 10 years and had an increase on the basis 
of an aggravated felony that would include the category 
that we're dealing with here in subparagraph (M)(1).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Gannon, we're 

dealing with the definition of a particular term, 
aggravated felony.  And yet you say the only thing that 
you have to prove under the protections of criminal law 
to prove that this is an aggravated felony is that it

involved fraud or deceit.  Now, the other elements --
the other provisions here talk about firearms offenses, 
child pornography offenses, national security offenses, 
but here it's fraud or deceit.  I mean, it's a felony, 
but there's nothing that strikes -- strikes me that it's 
particularly an aggravated felony.

 MR. GANNON:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And yet that's all 
you have to prove with the protections of the criminal 
law as opposed to the civil.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think we have to prove 
for purposes of the relevant proceeding in which we're 
trying to establish that it is an aggravated felony that 
it also exceeded the $10,000 threshold.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But not subject to 
the protections of criminal law that you have to show.

 MR. GANNON:  No more --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Beyond the 

reasonable doubt, with the jury protections.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, we would need to prove 
that if it were relevant to a criminal proceeding, but 
in the civil removal proceeding those protections aren't 
there.  And so we --

the $10,000, in contrast to the other things, which are 
aggravated by virtue of elements that you have to 
approve -- you have to prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt -- is that it's fraud ir deceit.  And as I said, 
there's nothing about that that -- it's bad, but it 
doesn't strike me as particularly aggravated.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there 
are several other statutes here that have extra limiting 
factors that are necessary to make the crime an 
aggravated one for purposes of the aggravated felony, 
but don't have to be proved as an element of the 
original offense.  Congress has established --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's just --
I think that's kind of begging the question.  You assume 
that those elements, those provisions also don't have to 
be proved as elements.  And what I'm suggesting, I 
guess, is that if the only thing that makes it 
aggravated is -- is something you don't have to prove 
beyond a reasonable doubt, it seems that we ought to 
look, well, is that really aggravated?

 MR. GANNON:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And when you're 

talking about firearm offenses, or child pornography, 
yes, that's aggravated; but fraud and deceit is kind of 
a run of the mine felony.

MR. GANNON:  Well, but for many of the 

offenses it's things that as Petitioner acknowledges, 
would never be proved as elements of the offense.  It's 
the notion that a crime of violence is one in which the 
term of imprisonment is at least one year.  There are 
other ones that depend on the actual sentence that was 
imposed.

 There is a second or subsequent offense 
that's referred to in subparagraph (J); there is an 
exception for purely political offenses from the 
definition of -- of crime of violence.  There are 
affirmative defenses --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess I 

don't understand how that's responsive.  It's -- it's --

MR. GANNON:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- part of violence. 

In other words it seems to me you're already in the 
aggravated area, so it makes sense to say that's what 
you have to prove.

 MR. GANNON:  But not according to Congress. 
It is only in the area, if it is not a purely political 
offense, and if the term of imprisonment is at least one 
year.  And so by definition, it already can't be an 
aggravated felony according to Congress if it doesn't 
meet other factors that we would not have expected the

original jury to determine as an element of the original 
crime of violence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- I guess I don't 

understand the answer, and I'm sorry if it's --

MR. GANNON:  Well, I'm the one that's sorry.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- I'm hard to get 

through.

 (Laughter.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It just -- you're 
saying is that there are exceptions, but I don't see 
that that detracts from the point that "crime of 
violence" -- you think right away, well, that's 
aggravated; national security crimes, that's aggravated; 
firearms offenses, that's aggravated.  They're sort of 
on their own without respect to these other things that 
you say you only have to prove by the civil -- pursuant 
to the civil burden requirements.  Fraud or deceit -- as 
I guess I've already said, that doesn't strike me as 
particularly aggravated.

 MR. GANNON:  Well -- and I think that's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What makes it 

aggravated is something as to which you have a much 
lighter burden.

the civil removal proceeding, need to establish it by 
clear and convincing evidence, and -- and it is, in --
in a subsequent criminal proceeding, there will be all 
the constitutional protections that you're talking 
about, just like the domestic relationship prong of the 
-- of the crime that the Court considered in Hayes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I would have thought 

you would not accept the Chief Justice's premise, that a 
crime of violence is an aggravated felony.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It isn't.
 MR. GANNON:  I tried to explain that it is 

not as long as there isn't a sentence that is imposed of 
at least 1 year according to Congress's way of 
determining what is an aggravated felony, and Congress 
has determined that --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But the -- but the Chief 
Justice points out that the facts that make the fraud 
aggravated are facts that you do not have to prove 
beyond a reasonable doubt, which takes back to your 
opponent's argument.  Therefore, you were not convicted 
by proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the aggravated 
felony that's the basis for the immigration order.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, that's correct, Justice 

Stevens, but in -- in that regard --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  So you were not convicted 

of the aggravated offense that -- the issue in this 
case.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, no, we think that you 

were convicted of the offense, which is an offense that 
involves fraud or deceit, and then there is the further 
limitation that Congress has imposed, not as an element 
--

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But the -- but you hadn't 

been convicted of the aggravated offense until you 
established its aggravation by proof of less -- not 
under a reasonable doubt.  So the word "convicted" 
really is pretty important.

 MR. GANNON:  But it -- it can't have that 

same meaning with regard to all of these other things in 
all of these other offenses in which Congress has 
determined they're not an aggravated felony until those 
other criteria are also satisfied.  I mean -- so we 
think that in a statute that indisputably involves 
individual offenses that have both elements of the 
offense and nonelement limiting factors in order to 
limit the category to those that Congress would have 
deemed to be aggravated, that it makes sense to not have 
to find as an element of the offense those extra factors 
that generally wouldn't be for most of the other

provisions.  And here we know if that reading is imposed 
on this statute, that it reads out all the mainstays of 
Federal fraud prosecutions and brings in a haphazard 
patchwork of --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It depends on how you read 
the language.  I guess -- I guess grammatically it could 
be read either way.  You can read it:  an offense that 
involves fraud or deceit in which -- in which the loss 
to the victim exceeds $10,000.  Or you could read it: 
convicted of an offense that involves fraud or deceit, 
in which the loss to the victim exceeds $10,000.

 I mean, "convicted" doesn't necessarily 

apply to the last -- to the last phrase.

 MR. GANNON:  And we --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and that's basically 

what we're arguing about.

 MR. GANNON:  And we think --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, but the word 
"convicted" -- the question is whether the word 
"convicted" applies to the word "aggravated."  That's 
the point, as I understand the Chief Justice's 
questioning, which goes to the burden of proof.  So you 
would win even under that approach if you said you had a 
proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the other factors.

 But the thing that creates the -- the

missing link is that to convert it from ordinary fraud 
to aggravated fraud, you have to prove X under one view 
by a reasonable -- beyond a reasonable doubt, but, under 
your view, by only clear and convincing evidence.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, for purposes of a civil 

removal proceeding, that's true, and that's no different 
from the limiting factors in several of the other 
provisions, like the sentence that was imposed -- the 
potential sentence -- whether there was an exception for 
a first offense that involved family members, for the 
alien smuggling and document fraud, crimes in (N) and 
(P).

 And the -- this also is a reading that we 

can't impose on subparagraph (M)(ii), where we know that 
there is no loss requirement there, that the government 
have a revenue loss of more than $10,000 for a crime in 
which the loss to the government is $10,000.  The "in 
whiches" here are parallel to the "for whiches" 
elsewhere in --in the statute.

 And although Petitioner invokes the guilty 

plea practice in the context of tax evasion offenses for 
purposes of section 7201, this -- this doesn't help his 
argument for the same reason that he cannot use 
extraneous elements and guilty pleas generally to 
establish that something was necessary for a conviction.

But if you look at the criminal tax manual that he 
invokes, it makes clear by referring to relevant conduct 
and the need for the loss amount there to include all of 
the losses for all of the years in the indictment, even 
if the defendant has pleaded guilty to an individual 
count for a single year of tax evasion, that the loss 
amounts that is typically included in guilty pleas in 
7201 cases is not the loss amount that is relevant here. 
It is in fact directly parallel to the sentencing 
stipulation that -- that the Petitioner entered into 
here.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. MOSELEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MOSELEY:  With respect to the issue of 

deference, the fact that this is part of a Federal 
criminal statute I believe doesn't get us -- cuts off 
the inquiry, and we don't get to Chevron deference here. 
We deal with a dual use statute which has both civil and

criminal applications, so that under these 
circumstances, certainly as this Court held in Leocal 
and in Lopez-Gonzalez, Chevron deference with respect to 
Babaisakov would not -- for example -- would not be 
triggered.

 I think, moreover, it's important to note 

that the Babaisakov got (M)(ii) wrong -- got the -- the 
requirement of a deficiency wrong, and also got wrong 
the fact that there were no statutes involved where 
fraud -- where a loss amount in excess of $10,000 would 
be an element.

 Finally, I think the government's reading of 
this statute might make sense if Congress had said that 
-- convicted of a crime in -- a crime in which fraud or 
deceit is an element, with loss to be found at removal 
proceedings in excess of $10,000.  But that's not the 
language that Congress employed here, and under these 
circumstances, even if the statute is perceived to be 
ambiguous, that ambiguity should be resolved in the 
Petitioner's favor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  To come back to the 

deference point, you say -- is this relevant to the 
criminal conviction?  He's convicted criminally 
regardless of how you read that.  You acknowledge it 
doesn't -- it isn't an element of the crime, and so to

be convicted criminally you acknowledge you don't have 
to show the amount --

MR. MOSELEY:  But --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- right?
 MR. MOSELEY:  But what the government has 

said, if they're going to do a prosecution under 8 
U.S.C. 1326(b), that they would seek to prove this 
amount de novo in the underlying criminal proceeding. 
So it will form -- it would form part of a -- it would 
form part of a criminal prosecution --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, in that later 
criminal proceeding, they would have to prove it 
undoubtedly --

MR. MOSELEY:  Right, and that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But this is not a later 

criminal proceeding; this is an administrative 
proceeding.  And why shouldn't it be up to the BIA 
initially to determine how to interpret this language 
for purposes of the deportation laws?

 MR. MOSELEY:  It shouldn't, Justice Scalia, 
because we deal with a dual use statute, as this Court 
Leocal, which indeed was also a civil removal 
proceeding, or Lopez-Gonzalez, which was a civil removal 
proceedings.  Leocal involved 18 U.S.C. 16 -- 16(b), and

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But there -- was it not 

true that there the interpretation placed upon the 
statute by BIA would also be the interpretation 
necessary to secure the criminal conviction?  And that's 
not the case here.

 MR. MOSELEY:  But it was -- but in 

Lopez-Gonzalez, there was a -- there was a Board of 
Immigration Appeals decision, Matter of Yanez, which was 
directly opposite to what this Court held and ultimately 
rejected in that decision.  There -- this clearly is a 
statute, I submit, that implicates -- that implicates a 
Federal criminal prosecution later.  And indeed if the 
government, as the government's brief, says that they're 
going to prove this amount in some subsequent illegal
