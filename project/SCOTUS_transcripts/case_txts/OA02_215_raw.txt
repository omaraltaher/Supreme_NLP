CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 02-215, Pacific Health Care Systems v.


Jeffrey Book.


Mr. Grauer.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. GRAUER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. GRAUER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


For three reasons, the important Federal policy


favoring arbitration would be seriously undermined if


courts become entangled in speculative litigation over


arbitration remedies.  First, the enforceability of a


limitation on remedies in arbitration ought to be decided 

in the first instance by the arbitrator, since that's not


a gateway issue of arbitrability.


Second, it's unlikely in this case that the


arbitrator would have found that the limitations on


remedies agreed by the parties would have precluded the


award of RICO treble damages, and third, there is simply


no reason why parties found by the district court to be


sophisticated cannot mutually agree to limit remedies.


Turning, then, to --


QUESTION:  Mr. Grauer, on the second point that

you made, you said it's unlikely that the arbitrators


would find that treble damages are inconsistent with


the -- with the contracts.  Would you, supposing this case


were to be before the arbitrator, would you concede that


the contracts in question permit treble damages awards on


a RICO claim?  Would you make that contention?


MR. GRAUER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Thank you.


MR. GRAUER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  On your first point, suppose you have


a contract that is very clear that there can be no triple


damages under RICO, that's right in the contract, is it


your position that that goes to the arbitrator and it's


for the arbitrator to say that this violates public policy


and I'm going to -- well, I mean, what would happen in 

that case?


MR. GRAUER:  Yes, we believe that it's for the


arbitrator to decide.  We believe that there's essentially


a 40-year tradition of allowing arbitrators to make


decisions of that nature and of allowing issues of the


remedies that can arise in arbitration to be decided by


the arbitrator.


QUESTION:  The arbitrator, I take it, on the


face of the contract simply could not award the damages,


or are you saying that he might?

 MR. GRAUER:  Yes.  The arbitrator --


QUESTION:  He'd say, this is against public


policy and I'm giving you triple damages?  I don't care


what the contract says, I go beyond the scope of the


arbitration contract?


MR. GRAUER:  Well, the arbitrator is bound first


and foremost, under both the law and under the arbitration


clauses in this case, to comply with the controlling law. 


This Court has held several times, in Mitsubishi, in


Vimar, in Gilmer, and in other cases that we should not


suppose that the arbitrator will not follow the law.  We


should assume that the arbitrator will follow the law and,


therefore, if the law requires the award of treble


damages, even if the parties have agreed otherwise, the


arbitrator is bound to follow that law.


QUESTION:  What's our best case, or is there


one, for the proposition that if the contract says the


arbitrator may not do X, and X violates public policy,


that the arbitrator goes ahead and does it anyway?  What's


our case that says that?


MR. GRAUER:  I believe that that would be found


in Mitsubishi, in the Vimar y Seguros case at page 541, in


the McMahon case at page --


QUESTION:  Well, but I'm not sure in any of


those cases it was clear that the contract in very

explicit terms said, you cannot do this.  I -- I -- I


recognize that in those cases it does say if there's


important public policy it can't be overturned by the


arbitration.


MR. GRAUER:  I think the -- one example -- there


are several examples, but one that comes to mind is that


in the Vimar case the COGSA prevented the arbitrator


from -- the COGSA prevented any reduction in liability in


a bill of lading, and -- and there was a concern that the


law in Japan which had been selected to conduct the


arbitration had a different set of rules that could have


allowed the stevedores to be -- to have liability laid off


on the stevedores, and yet the Court said, we will not


indulge in the presumption that the arbitrator will not


follow the appropriate law and, therefore, even though 

Japanese law was different, the arbitrator, we assumed,


would follow the controlling law.


Now, in this particular case, it's -- it's not


only true that the -- that the Court has held several


times that we should not assume that an arbitrator will


fail to follow the controlling law, but all of the


arbitration agreements, and I would cite the Court to the


joint appendix, pages 84, 147, 168, and 212, in each of


the arbitration agreements in this case, the arbitrator is


admonished to follow the controlling law.

 QUESTION:  Well, but in one of the arbitration


clauses, I think, it says the arbitrator shall not vary or


ignore the terms of this agreement, shall have no


authority to award extracontractual damages at any time,


including punitive or exemplary damages.


Now, what's the arbitrator to do with a


provision like that?  Is that not the kind of thing that 


courts have looked at and determined whether that's a


valid public policy or not?


MR. GRAUER:  I wouldn't agree with the Court


looking at that, and here's why.  I agree that what you


read, Justice O'Connor, is, in fact, what's in that


agreement, but if you read on in that sentence it says,


and the arbitrator shall follow the controlling law.  At


best, there is a conflict or a tension between those 

terms, and this is what arbitrators do all the time.


There are all these agreements that are -- that


every day are presented to arbitrators that have a number


of provisions that could step on each other, and -- and


the arbitrator has to interpret the contract.  That's what


we bargained for in entering an arbitration agreement,


that if there was some tension, or some confusion or


dispute, that the arbitr --


QUESTION:  Have we ever allowed a prospective


waiver of a statutory right --

 MR. GRAUER:  Prospective --


QUESTION:  -- in these arbitration contexts?


MR. GRAUER:  The prospective waivers -- yes, I


believe that that, for example, in our brief we cited a


number of cases such as Mezzanatto that create a


presumption that a statutory right is waivable unless


Congress has said otherwise.


Now, in the arbitration context, again, to get


back to the Vimar y Seguros case, the party was agreeing


to arbitration even though there was a concern before the


arbitration that the arbitrator might not follow the


correct law.


The guiding principle of -- that -- that has


guided this Court's jurisprudence for -- for years, and


it's been reiterated in Mitsubishi, and McMahon, and --

and Vimar, and Gilmer, is that we should assume that the


arbitrator will apply -- will apply the correct law, but


if --


QUESTION:  Mr. Grauer, on the question of


waiver, you have represented, and I want to make this


clear, that waiver would be academic in this situation,


since you say you will concede that all of these contracts


allow the arbitrator to award treble damages.  Is -- am I


correct in understanding that waiver would be academic


because you're not going to make the argument of waiver,

you're going to make -- you're going to concede that


treble damages are available if a RICO violation is found?


MR. GRAUER:  Absolutely.  I agree with that,


Justice Ginsburg, and as a matter of fact for two reasons,


not only because we've made that concession, but also


because we agreed to arbitrate.  That means we agreed to


submit any issues to the arbitrator and therefore, even if


we had not made that concession, we would believe that the


arbitrator ought to be asked in the first instance to


decide the validity of a waiver.


QUESTION:  But suppose the arbitrator gets it


wrong.  Suppose the arbitrator thinks that the provision,


no punitive damages, excludes treble damages, and that


that prevails.  Could that be corrected by post award


review?


MR. GRAUER:  To the extent -- yes, I think it


could, and here's why.  The one thing that this Court has


said, no fewer than four times, and -- and has emphasized


I think those four times, is that when a statutory claim


is arbitrated, there -- the -- we assume that post


arbitration review is sufficient to ensure the vindication


of statutory interests, and the Court mentioned that not


only in McMahon at page 232, in Gilmer at footnote 4, and


also in Vimar and in Mitsubishi.  In all four of those


cases, this Court has specific -- excuse me -- this Court

has specifically said that -- that, while limited, post


arbitration review is sufficient to ensure that statutory


interests are vindicated.


QUESTION:  In other words, it's quite simple.  I


don't see what's so complicated about this.  I thought


what you were saying, and I thought that's what the law


was, but tell me if I'm not right, please, is,


interpreting the contract is a matter for the arbitrator,


but once we know what the contract means, then whether


that contract, as interpreted, provides sufficient remedy


to be valid as an arbitration contract is for the judge.


MR. GRAUER:  I would -- I would agree with the


first part of that, Justice Breyer, and that is --


QUESTION:  Well, why not the second?  I mean,


after all, if I have a contract which says, Jones and 

Smith agree to arbitrate all damage claims, but no damages


shall ever be awarded, no matter what, okay, that's pretty


clear that the enforcement of that would invalidate that


arbitration agreement because it can't be enforced.  The


person who should say that is the judge, because the judge


says, look, you people don't have an arbitration contract.


Now, why you'd leave that to the arbitrator -- I


guess you could, but I think that is a gateway matter that


I think you'd have to be quadruple clear about that


somebody wanted that point decided by an arbitrator.

 Now, that's how I'm understanding it, so I'd


like you to correct me if I'm wrong.


MR. GRAUER:  I'm not sure I followed the first


part of the hypothetical.


QUESTION:  The first part's very simple.  What


the contract means is for the arbitrator.  The parties


have agreed to that.  But once we know what it means,


whether it is an enforceable arbitration contract or


violates some anti -- some statute that says -- or some


public policy and the -- which means, you two cannot


arbitrate this kind of thing with this kind of agreement,


that question of arbitrability is for the judge, because


it is a gateway matter.


If, in fact, this contract for arbitration is


unlawful, as against pubic policy or whatever, then there 

is no arbitration contract, and that matter is a matter


for the judge, unless the parties clearly indicate that


they want it to be decided by an arbitrator.  And I read


through those cases a little while ago, and that seemed to


me what they said, and so I wrote it into an opinion which


I think every member of this Court but one agreed to.


MR. GRAUER:  Justice Breyer, I agree with the


first part, and that is this, that the gateway issue of


arbitrability involves the determination of, did the


parties make a valid agreement to arbitrate and, if they

did, is the dispute within the scope of that agreement,


but that should end, in our view, the inquiry, because if


you don't end the inquiry at that point, you're -- you're


opening the door to questions about remedies and legal


issues and what are the elements of the cause of action


and what have the parties agreed to, and let me give you


an example.


The parties -- I sell you 10,000 widgets for a


dollar each, as is, and no -- and liquidated damages of $1


and no other liability, and we agree to that, okay.  Now,


the person then sues for RICO because they want to get


around that.  Well, the only issue ought to be, did the


parties make a valid agreement to arbitrate and, if so, is


the dispute in the scope of that agreement, and the fact


that there may be a downstream dispute about the validity 

of the remedies and the validity of the waiver of the


remedies should not, under any circumstances, spill over


into the gateway --


QUESTION:  I didn't say when you would decide


it.  I said, the matter is a matter for the judge.  If we


don't know what the contract means, then I guess we have


to go to the arbitrator to find out before we know, before


we can present the judge.  That's Vimar, or Vimar, isn't


it?


MR. GRAUER:  Vimar y Seguros, and I agree,

Justice Breyer, that post arbitration --


QUESTION:  I thought you probably would end up


agreeing.


(Laughter.)


MR. GRAUER:  Well, post, as long as the


agreement is that it's post arbitration.  The post


arbitration review has been held four times by the Court


to be sufficient to clean up matters at the margin that


could come up.


QUESTION:  But if the contract is completely


cleared at the outset, why not pre-arbitration review?


MR. GRAUER:  If the con --


QUESTION:  Why march up the hill and then march


down again?


MR. GRAUER: 


Well, the courts -- I would 

disagree with approaching it that way, because


unfortunately what's clear to a plaintiff's lawyer is


often not clear to a defense lawyer, and there are many


elements of a cause of action, there are many remedial


limitations --


QUESTION:  So you're saying that nothing is ever


clear to the bar?


(Laughter.)


MR. GRAUER:  My good friend, Mr. Whatley and I


agree on very little in the case, and that's the problem.

 QUESTION:  Well, do you say that this provision


in one of the arbitration clauses that the arbitrator


shall have no authority to award extracontractual damages


of any kind is not clear enough for a judge to determine


whether that's --


MR. GRAUER:  We feel that -- we --


QUESTION:  -- against public policy?


MR. GRAUER:  Yes, I do, and here's why.


QUESTION:  Why?


MR. GRAUER:  Because we believe that we


bargained to have an arbitrator make that decision, and


there are many words in this case that may seem like it's


clear what they mean, but may in some contexts not be so


clear.


The word racketeering is used to describe a case 

where a doctor is seeking to be paid more for treating a


patient.  There are a lot of words in this case, and we


feel that we bargained to have an arbitrator interpret


them, and as I indicated to Justice Ginsburg, it was


conceded some time ago that the term, extracontractual was


not in -- was intended to be noneconomic damages and was


not intended to be primarily remedial RICO treble damages,


but --


QUESTION:  Well, what you're arguing for


basically is that it should go to the arbitrator for a

decision of almost everything except what we have held to


be gateway issues, and that if it doesn't, it's just going


to kind of get bounced back and forth like a ping pong


ball.


MR. GRAUER:  I agree, Mr. Chief Justice.  I -- I 


believe that the importance of the Court's recent


pronouncement in Howsam about gateway arbitrability as we


read that case is that you determine, did the parties


intend to subject themselves to the power of an


arbitrator?  Did they make an arbitration agreement, and


is the dispute within the scope of that agreement, and if


the answers to those questions are yes, the only


additional issue that comes up, and the one that


unfortunately became conflated in the Eleventh Circuit


below, is where there is a statutory claim, there is an 

additional analysis that this Court has traditionally


done, and that is, did Congress, by enacting that statute,


intend to override or preempt the Federal Arbitration Act,


and that's the issue that has come up, and unfortunately


what's happened in the Eleventh and the Ninth Circuits is


that they have taken that concept of simply making a


determination of whether another statute is -- preempts


the Federal Arbitration Act, and they've used it to create


essentially a floating analysis of effective vindication


that's untethered to the statutory conflict analysis.

 QUESTION:  Okay, how -- how clear has it got to


be before there is some kind of a tether?  Let's assume


you had a simpler case than this one in which the


arbitration agreement provided -- this is silly, but for


the sake of a point, that no damages will be awarded by


the arbitrator for the violation of any statutory claim,


as distinct from a tort claim, common law tort claim, or a


contract claim.  Would you say that in that case there


was, in fact, a threshold question of arbitrability


because that provision went so clearly to the validity of


the agreement that it should be treated as a, could be


properly treated as a threshold matter for a court?


MR. GRAUER:  It would depend, Justice Souter.  I


believe that there could be a situation where an


agreement --


QUESTION:  Well, how about my situation?


MR. GRAUER:  In -- in -- in your situation, the


reason I say your situation would depend is that there are


many contracts where that would be a perfectly legitimate


understanding.  For example, I -- I'll sell you 10,000


widgets, $1 each, I haven't checked them over, they may be


no darned good, but you want them for $1 each, and I don't


want to be sued for this, so I want liquidated damages of


$1.  That type of commercial arrangement --


QUESTION:  Yeah, but in that case you're --

well, and again, maybe -- maybe this is where it gets


theoretical.  In -- in that case, in effect, you're --


you're  waiving any statutory claim at the beginning.  In


-- in the case I gave, maybe it's the same point, I just


said you waive damages.  I -- I suppose you wouldn't


waive -- on that theory you wouldn't be waiving equitable


remedies if there were any, so -- so let's just take my


case.  You waive the damages -- you don't waive the claim. 


You waive the damages.  You don't waive the right to


equitable remedy.


Is -- is that -- is the -- is the -- in effect


the -- the waiver of the right to damages in the


arbitration agreement sufficient to raise a serious enough


question about the enforceability of the arbitration


agreement to qualify that question as a gateway question? 

MR. GRAUER:  I believe the answer is no, with


one exception.  In general, anything relating to remedies


should be dealt with by the arbitrator, and we should


assume that -- that if there is something improper about


that remedial limitation, that the arbitrator will -- will


do what he or she is supposed to do, follow the law, get


it right.


QUESTION:  Okay, but you're saying, I think


you're saying, and -- and correct me if I 'm wrong,


that -- that no remedial question can ever rise to the

level of a -- a potential threat to the potential -- to --


to vindication of statutory rights.  Whatever that phrase


may mean, as we have employed it, a mere question of -- of


waiver of remedies will never rise to that level and,


hence, will never get to the threshold question status, is


that correct?


MR. GRAUER:  As a general premise, I believe


that's correct.  I think we could envision situations


where a variety of factors, including that, are linked


together such that the plaintiff might make a motion to


revoke the arbitration agreement itself on the, on


traditional contract grounds should there be a whole


series of things that make a contract unconscionable or


onerous, but that did not occur in this case.


In fact, the court found that it was not 

unconscionable or onerous.  It was negotiated between


sophisticated parties, and so the court declined to do


section 2 revocation of the contract for generally


applicable contract grounds, but there could be a case


where a remedial limitation, combined with other factors,


could rise to that level, not -- certainly not this case. 


The problem --


QUESTION:  And I take it you would say that if


at least the -- the details of the agreement that would


raise the issue to that level are specifically pleaded in

-- in -- in -- in the request, in -- in -- in the action


that takes it into court, that at least the -- the -- the


breadth of the frustration doctrine would not stand in the


way of -- of a court's adjudicating it?


MR. GRAUER:  Well, that's correct.  If I


understood you correctly, I -- I -- I believe in


arbitration cases there's frequently a motion by a


plaintiff to revoke the arbitration agreement on grounds


of unconscionability --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. GRAUER:  -- and judges deal with those from


time to time.  This is certainly not such a case.


QUESTION:  But I think you're simply saying


they've got to be specific in telling us right at the


outset what it is that makes it unconscionable.  They


can't just come up and say, oh well, there's a potential


for frustration here.


MR. GRAUER:  Right, and -- and it's very


important to note an additional distinction, and that is,


the -- the attack on unconscionability cannot be on the


contract as a whole, because if it is, under Prima Paint


that, too, should be decided by the arbitrator.  The only


unconscionability, the only type of attack that could be


made would be on the arbitration clause itself.


QUESTION:  Uh-huh.

 QUESTION:  May I ask --


QUESTION:  Under what law is unconscionability


decided?  Is -- is it State law?


MR. GRAUER:  In this case, because there's a


Federal claim, and the case is in Federal court, the Court


has said a number of times that there is a Federal


substantive law of arbitrability, but the contract itself


was entered between people governed by State law, and so


the revocability question would be a decision about


whether that contract either as a whole, or the


arbitration clause itself, are revocable under the


applicable State law subject to the overlay, so to speak,


that's created by the Federal Arbitration Act in not


allowing States to have unconscionability laws that


would --


QUESTION:  Vitiate --


MR. GRAUER:  -- vitiate an arbitration clause.


QUESTION:  May I ask, I just want to -- I may be


missing what's perfectly obvious, but if you have a


contract in which the only remedy authorized to be


provided is an illegal remedy for some reason that could


not be taken away from the plaintiff, does the


arbitrator -- is that agreement immediately nonarbitrable,


or do you arbitrate the issues and then saying that


there's no remedy?

 MR. GRAUER:  I don't believe either of those


would be the case.  I believe that if -- if the -- you


would arbitrate the issue, and you would expect the


arbitrator to follow the law.


QUESTION:  Even if, on the face of the contract,


a judge could say, the only remedy offered to a successful


complainant is one that may not be submitted to


arbitration?


MR. GRAUER:  There's only -- I -- I don't agree


with that. 


QUESTION:  The waiver of a statutory right of


some kind.


MR. GRAUER:  There would be one way that the


plaintiff's lawyer could raise that issue, which is not


one of the -- what occurred in this case, but I suppose 

you could argue that the entire arbitration agreement is


illusory and unconscionable, but --


QUESTION:  Then if that's true, what if you have


a case in which there are two remedies available, one of


which is clearly impermissible as a matter of Federal law,


the other of which is permissible, but there's no


severability clause in the contract?  What do you do


there?


MR. GRAUER:  I believe in that case, as in the


prior one, you should send the matter to arbitration, you

should assume that the arbitrator will correctly apply the


law, that if there is a provision in the contract that's


unlawful, that the arbitrator will disregard it.


QUESTION:  I guess you'd have to -- the


arbitrator would have to decide whether implicit in the


terms of the contract is a decision by the parties that


would permit him to waive the thing.  I mean, Justice


Stevens' hypothetical will, I think -- I'd like the


answer, anyway.  If we assume in the contract it says, and


the parties agree that this contract is exclusive in


respect to remedy, and the arbitrator does not have the


power to strike out some remedies and put in others, okay,


so now they've done that, now I take it the answer to his


first hypothetical is, you go to the judge, and the


agreement's no good.  Isn't that right?


MR. GRAUER:  No.  I don't agree, if I understood


you correctly, and the reason --


QUESTION:  The -- the contract has only one


remedy.  The remedy is clearly illegal.  There is a


sentence in the contract saying the arbitrator has no


power to add a new remedy or to strike the old one.  Now


we have it absolutely clear that this is an unlawful


arbitration agreement, and the judge would say that


without sending it to arbitration, wouldn't he?  That's


the same question I asked before --

 MR. GRAUER:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- and I thought your answer was, of


MR. GRAUER:  Well --


QUESTION:  Maybe I'm wrong.  That's why I'm


course.


asking.


MR. GRAUER:  If -- if there is a ground under


section 2 to revoke the arbitration clause for generally


applicable grounds, not because it's an arbitration


clause, then a party could make a motion of that nature


and the court, of course, would have to address that


motion, and -- but -- but I didn't want to get away from


the fact that I think is important, is that when you're


dealing with remedies, and when you're dealing with


arbitrators, we really need to assume that the arbitrator 

will follow the law.


And -- and in this particular case, for example,


the arbitration clause does contain a limitation on


remedies, but that limitation on remedies could have been


put elsewhere in the contract, and if it were somewhere


else in the contract, or it might have been -- the parties


might not have agreed to arbitrate.  They might have


agreed that we'll litigate in Florida, but the Court will


not have the power to award punitive damages.  Now, you


would not say that the limitation on punitive damages

prevents the parties from having to go to Florida, and you


need to treat an arbitration clause, we think, the same,


or the parties might have had the remedial limitation in


this case, and no arbitration clause.


Now, what would a court do?  It would -- the


court would evaluate the validity of the remedial


limitation and make a decision.  Well, an arbitrator is


exactly the same.  It's simply selecting a different


forum.


I see my light's on.  Unless there's an


additional question, I would reserve my time for rebuttal.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Grauer.


Mr. Whatley, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOE R. WHATLEY, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. WHATLEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


We start with the principle that arbitrability


is to be determined by the court, as this Court has said


many times, including in AT&T and First Option, and that


there is no -- no presumption, or no liberal policy in


favor of giving that issue of arbitrability to the


arbitrator.  It's exactly the opposite.


You go one step further, since this case


involves an issue of public policy, and in both W. R.

Grace, and later in Misco and in Eastern Associated Coal


Corporation, this Court said that questions of public


policy are for the court, not for the arbitrator.


QUESTION:  We also said that that kind of


question that would affect an arbitration is fairly rare,


didn't we?


MR. WHATLEY:  You did, Your Honor, and in fact I


think this case shows that it -- that it's rare, and I


think the various amicus briefs that have been submitted


shows that an effort to put limits on remedies, which this


Court has attacked many times, is rare.  I mean, other


defendants didn't do that here.  The Well Point didn't --


QUESTION:  You say -- you say this Court has


attacked what many times?


MR. WHATLEY: 


This Court -- within the context 

of arbitration, Justice O'Connor's question, this Court


has never allowed the waiver of statutory remedies in the


context of an arbitration, enforcing an arbitration


provision.  If you go back to Mitsubishi and follow every


case right through Waffle House, this Court over and over


and over again has quoted the portions of Mitsubishi, and


footnote 19 from Mitsubishi, saying that you're only


changing the forum when you're arbitrating.


QUESTION:  Mr. Whatley, Mr. Grauer has conceded


that there is no waiver here, that treble damages are

available, so why are we engaging in this academic


exercise?


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, the concern I have with


that, Your Honor, is if -- if you read the question


presented in his brief, that's not what it says.


QUESTION:  Well, he's made the concession right


now --


MR. WHATLEY:  He has made the --


QUESTION:  -- and he has five arguments for


saying, any good lawyer would, that these words that you


read punitive damages, extracontractual damages, do not


prevent the arbitrator from awarding treble damages, so he


has one interpreting the thing, two, if the interpretation


fails he concedes it, three, there's nothing in the


contract says he can't concede it, and so why don't we 

send this to the arbitrator to find out what the contract


means before we decide that it must mean something that


would bar its enforcement?


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, the problem with that -- the


problem with that is, doing it after the fact has some


pretty severe policy implications.


QUESTION:  But didn't we, the Court hold


precisely, do it after the fact, in Vimar?


MR. WHATLEY:  Well --


QUESTION:  It's precisely the same circumstance.

 MR. WHATLEY:  In that case, Your Honor, you were


dealing with the international context, where you said,


starting in Mitsubishi is a -- is a special situation


concerning, where you've got to be concerned with


international law.  That's number one.


Number two, especially when you use the United


language that Justice O'Connor quoted, you couldn't get


much more clear than United was in its provision, no


extracontractual damages, including --


QUESTION:  This contract doesn't cover a tort


action.


MR. WHATLEY:  It doesn't cover a tort action.


QUESTION:  In other words, what they wanted to


have is an arbitration between doctors and hospitals, and


the single most likely, or a very, very likely kind of 

dispute they call tort disputes, aren't even covered by


the arbitration agreement, and it's impossible for an


arbitrator to come to a different conclusion.


MR. WHATLEY:  That is -- that is -- that is our


position, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  I know that's your position.  It's


just, as I said it with my tone of voice, I'm suggesting


it sounds implausible.


MR. WHATLEY:  Well --


QUESTION:  So what I'd like is an argument for

that position.


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, the argument for that


position is, you start with the language, and you don't


only start with the language that says, no


extracontractual damages and, in fact, the issue you get


in arbitration, and -- and -- and you go to arbitration,


and I know we assume arbitrators are going to follow the


law, absolutely, the Court has said that many times,


although many arbitrators are not lawyers, but I've


handled many arbitrations, and --


QUESTION:  Well, many judges who are lawyers end


up not following the law.


(Laughter.)


MR. WHATLEY:  Your Honor, you can say that, but


I don't think I can.


(Laughter.)


MR. WHATLEY:  And -- and the arbitrators almost


invariably say, you know, this is -- this is what created


me, the contract is my Bible, where I get my directions,


and if the contract says very plainly, no extracontractual


damages, even if later on it says, and follow the law, and


if it says -- says that you can't vary or ignore the terms


of this agreement, which this agreement says, that is a


strong impediment against an arbitrator awarding


appropriate relief where you've got a Federal statute that

creates tort-like damages.


QUESTION:  Every one of these contracts says the


arbitrator will follow the law, the arbitrator has no


power to commit errors of law.  Mr. Grauer, I think, said


that those provisions may be intention, but when they are,


the one that controls is the one that says the arbitrator


must follow the law.


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, that's good, and now that


the issue has been specifically raised, and after the


fact, after it's raised they come in and waive it.  The


concern we have is, what about the times when it's not


specifically raised?  What about the times when you go


forward through arbitration and perhaps --


QUESTION:  That's another case.  We're deciding


this case.


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, it's not -- it's this


language, though, Your Honor.  It's this language.


QUESTION:  But you don't litigate this language. 


You're litigating a particular case before us.


MR. WHATLEY:  But -- but Your Honor, they didn't


come in and waive that position until it got before Judge


Moreno, and Judge Moreno was going to hold it illegal,


going to hold this arbitration agreement unenforceable


because of the overreaching they engaged in by limiting


the remedies that could be awarded.

 It was only then, having been caught, that they


say, okay --


QUESTION:  Mr. Whatley, they were never before


an arbitrator, were they?


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, they were never before an


arbitrator, that's true, Your Honor.  They were never


before an arbitrator, but that's when it was finally


waived, after the issue was specifically presented, and


the judge was not going to enforce it, and that's when


Judge Moreno said no, we're not going to allow this after


the fact waiver.


QUESTION:  After the fact -- when did he think


it should have been waived in order to -- to assist the


petitioner here?


MR. WHATLEY: 


Well, in truth, I think he thought 

it should never -- if they're going to take --


QUESTION:  Well then, if he thought it should


never be, then what does after the fact mean?


MR. WHATLEY:  It means, after the issue was


presented to the trial court.


QUESTION:  Well, but that happens all the time. 


An issue is presented to the trial court, and you say,


well, on second thought I'm not going to do that.


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, but the problem with that


is, Your Honor, it means that that provision is still

there.  It's still addressed.


QUESTION:  Well, that's true if parties settle a


case.


QUESTION:  Yes, absolutely.


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, if parties settle a case,


that's a very different question, because this is a


prospective provision that applies out into the future,


and that's the difference.  The way -- that's the whole


difference about our argument about waiver that's


presented to you.


Of course people waive things in settlements all


the time, but they don't waive things prospectively, and


this Court hasn't allowed the waiver of statutory rights


prospectively.  That's the big difference.


QUESTION: 


The big question for arbitration is, 

was there a violation of RICO, and I think one of the


questions from the bench suggested that the scope of


remedy doesn't rise to the same level as, is there a


violation of the act, and if in this case the arbitrator


should find that if there is no violation of RICO on the


part of care organizations, then there would never be any


issue of remedy.


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, that --


QUESTION:  And, but you want to take that issue,


which the parties did agree to arbitrate, and put that in

the courts, because you say there's something defective in


the remedy provision of the arbitration.


MR. WHATLEY:  That's true, but if -- if -- if a


court or an arbitrator can't grant the remedies that


Congress has authorized for a violation, including for a


criminal violation, if the court can't grant that relief,


then there is a serious public policy problem with putting


the parties into that forum to make that decision.


QUESTION:  And just what is that public policy


problem?


MR. WHATLEY:  The public policy problem is


that -- is that the arbitrator then cannot remedy it.


QUESTION:  Well --


QUESTION:  Well, do you take the position that


the arbitrator in a case like this could not even --

could -- let's assume -- let's assume the arbitrator took


the position that he couldn't award treble damages.  Do


you take the position that under this contract the


arbitrator could not award simple compensatory damages?


MR. WHATLEY:  Under the plain language of the


United contract, yes, Your Honor, because it says no


extracontractual damages.


QUESTION:  And do you take the position that he


couldn't even determine liability?


MR. WHATLEY:  No, Your Honor, I don't take

that --


QUESTION:  Well, who --


QUESTION:  Then why isn't this premature?  I


mean, as Justice Ginsburg says, suppose he finds no


violation?  That's the end of it.


MR. WHATLEY:  It -- it -- it's premature because


it -- it is a -- it is -- it is a wasted process if you


can go through a proceeding --


QUESTION:  You mean it's not premature.


MR. WHATLEY:  To go through the arbitration


process, when you know in advance that -- that the


arbitrator can't fully remedy the violation --


QUESTION:  But maybe the arbitrator will run --


reach a conclusion that is consistent with the contract,


say simple contract damages, and then it is not a waste of 

time.


MR. WHATLEY:  But Your Honor, that's exactly


what Judge Moreno did.


QUESTION:  Why doesn't --


MR. WHATLEY:  Judge Moreno said that the


contract claim goes to the arbitrator.


QUESTION:  Well, so then you're splitting the


thing up.


MR. WHATLEY:  But -- but Your Honor, you split


things up in Byrd.

 QUESTION:  Well --


MR. WHATLEY:  You split things up in Volt.  And


-- and I mean, that is not -- there are many cases where


some cases go to arbitration and some cases --


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. WHATLEY:  And some claims stay in court.


QUESTION:  But what you're saying is, one issue


goes to arbitration, the other one doesn't.


MR. WHATLEY:  And then the parties decide, do


they want to pursue that issue in arbitration.


QUESTION:  That just really complicates the


procedure.


MR. WHATLEY:  Actually, it did not.  In this


instance, it really simplified the situation, because here


what you're dealing with, and what the focus of the claims 

are on, is -- is the automatic adjudication of claims the


way they -- the way they adjudicate claims of doctors


through computerized processes that by computerization


automatically down-code a bundle.


You're dealing with claims that are $5, $10,


$15, that frankly can't be resolved through an arbitration


process or any process on a claim by claim basis, but the


judge said, you've got to go forward in arbitration on the


breach of contract claims and, since those weren't


practical to pursue in any forum, we made the decision,

and the -- and the doctors, the individual doctors made


the decision not to pursue them.  Those are over.  It was


resolved very efficiently in the district court on whether


the claims should be arbitrated or not arbitrated, and


that dispute ended, and -- and so it was done very, very


efficiently in this instance.


QUESTION:  When you wrote that word, or whoever


wrote it, the word extracontractual, no extracontractual


damages, now, I guess it could mean one of two things.  It


could mean what you think it means, which is, you can't


bring any tort cases, all you can bring are contract


cases, you can't bring any statutory cases in arbitration,


or it might mean, if you happen to have a contract case,


if that's the nature of the case, you cannot give damages


for mental suffering or other kinds of punitive damages in 

a contract case.


Now, if you were drafting this, and you wanted


it to mean the first, rather than meaning the second, why


didn't you just write the words, there won't be a tort


case?


MR. WHATLEY:  Well --


QUESTION:  Why didn't you just write the words,


there won't be a statutory case?


MR. WHATLEY:  Well --


QUESTION:  Why did you run all around Robin

Hood's barn in order to -- whatever they -- my -- Rob --


whatever you say.  I mean, why did you get such a


complicated way just to tell people, we don't want tort


cases in -- or this arbitration?


MR. WHATLEY:  Your Honor, first of all, I didn't


write this.


QUESTION:  Of course you didn't.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to suggest


it's your fault.


MR. WHATLEY:  This is -- this is -- this is in


the form contract that United presented to -- to doctors


and medical groups and had them sign under a section that


says, resolution of disputes, that only refers to


arbitration when you get down into the print.  It's not


even -- it's not even entitled arbitration, but -- but --


but I mean, could I have written it differently to say --


of course I could.


But I mean -- I mean, they wrote it, and -- and


-- and it's really our position that they wrote it to


discourage doctors from being able to -- to -- to recover


claims in arbitration, and to limit what doctors could


recover, not only to send them to arbitration, but then


also to place limits on what they could get once they got


there, because they didn't limit, they didn't have a

provision, like they seem to say in their briefs, we


waive, each party waives punitive damages against the


other, and then you would have to consider under State


law, can you do that, depending on where you are. 


Instead, they say --


QUESTION:  That is not an objection, in its --


in itself, that goes to the question presented here, the


fact that you think it's a one-sided contract.  I mean,


there are lots of one-sided contracts that are enforced.


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, that's true, but I think it


has to be taken into the mix.  That -- that's absolutely


right, there -- there are one-sided contracts that are


enforced, and -- and lots of one-sided arbitration


contracts that are enforced, but --


QUESTION: 


I'm not clear on what you lose at the 

end of the day if you let the arbitrator decide whether


there was a RICO violation, and if there is such a


violation, then you reach the remedy issue, and if the


arbitrator were somehow to take the position that treble


damages were not available, I assume that could then be


resolved in court, could it not?  I mean, what do you lose


at the end of the day?


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, here's -- here's the problem


with that, especially if you read the -- the Eleventh


Circuit RICO decisions.  The issue of remedy --

 QUESTION:  Uh-huh.


MR. WHATLEY:  -- and -- and in cases like Sykes,


and I apologize, this is going beyond what's in the


briefs, but I'm trying to answer your question.


QUESTION:  Uh-huh.


MR. WHATLEY:  And -- and in cases like Sykes,


the issue of damages, either to the individual plaintiffs,


or the damages to the class --


QUESTION:  Uh-huh.


MR. WHATLEY:  -- are so wound up in the question


of RICO violation that what you're left with, then, is


trying the case twice if you do it the way you suggest.


Now --


QUESTION:  I don't understand that.  If the


damages initially are compensatory, I mean, the difference 

between punitive damages and these treble damages is, you


get a number that's compensatory, and then you multiply it


by three.  It's not, you send it to the jury and the sky's


the limit, so I don't understand your answer about it


being bound up with anything -- it's -- it's an ordinary


measure of compensatory damages that the judge, the


arbitrator or the judge, whichever forum you're in,


triples.


MR. WHATLEY:  I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg, I


thought I was answering the question of -- of what's the

problem with trying violation first, assuming the


arbitrator couldn't award damages, and then trying damages


later.


QUESTION:  But I thought that you were answering


that question, but you're saying the reason you can't try,


was there a RICO violation first, is that the remedy is


inextricably bound up with --


MR. WHATLEY:  That's right.


QUESTION:  -- the answer to that question.


MR. WHATLEY:  That's right, so if the arbitrator


couldn't award damages in the first place, you would be


trying damages in the first instance.  You would only get


a determination of violation, and then you would go back


somewhere else, presumably, and try the question of


remedy, and you would retry the question of damages. 

QUESTION:  I don't follow that.


QUESTION:  No, but if the arbitrator can award


simple damages --


MR. WHATLEY:  If the arbitrator --


QUESTION:  -- one times one damages, then that


objection doesn't apply.


MR. WHATLEY:  Then that takes away that


objection, but I didn't understand that to be the question


I was asked.


QUESTION:  And that may -- and that may be what

the arbitrator decides.


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, it -- it -- it could be what


the arbitrator decides.  Under our reading of what United


wrote out there, and under our reading of no punitive


damages, after this Court has developed the concept of


punitive damages in Gore, so -- I mean, there's almost a


presumed trebling issue there, that if you get much below


that, beyond that, there become constitutional questions.


With -- with the development of that, then --


then we don't see there -- we see severe problems,


especially as that law developed, and especially as the


tax, your -- your -- based on your tax decisions, saying


treble damages are punitive damages.


QUESTION:  And we've also said that --


QUESTION: 


It seems to me that what you're --

you're -- you're doing is, you're saying that it's


necessary for us to declare the -- the scope of the


arbitration in court before the arbitration proceeds. 


That's what the argument amounts to --


MR. WHATLEY:  No --


QUESTION:  -- and I think that's inconsistent


with the whole idea of the efficiencies to be obtained by


the arbitral process.


MR. WHATLEY:  What -- what I'm saying is much


more limited than that, Your Honor.  What I'm saying is

that in instances where someone like United or Pacificare


decides not only to insist on an arbitration agreement but


also to place limits on what the remedies are that the


arbitrator can award, and that's what they did here, in


those instances, the Court should look at what those


limitations are on remedies and make a public policy


determination if there's a Federal statutory claim out


there.


QUESTION:  Well, then you're opening up --


you're really expanding the gateway concept.  In other


words, you're no longer talking about, did the parties


agree to submit this to arbitration.  You're talking about


remedial terms.


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, Your Honor, remedy is


different than procedure, and -- and -- and -- and as I 

read Howsam -- and obviously, I mean, you know, it's a


fresh opinion.  You all are all much closer to it than I


am, but as I read Howsam, it draws the procedural,


substantive distinction.  Remedies are not procedural


issues, and remedies can have a direct impact on public


policy questions, and so for that limited area --


QUESTION:  Well, but of course, you can say


procedural issues will have an impact on public policy


issues, too.


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, you certainly can, and if

they go far enough, and I think that's what you were


saying in Green Tree, had the record gone far enough in


Green Tree, what the Court -- the court said, there could


be instances where the limitations that are placed on,


procedurally on getting to arbitration go far enough that


they void the arbitration clause --


QUESTION:  We --


MR. WHATLEY:  -- but the record there didn't go


far enough.


QUESTION:  Well, and we didn't -- we did not


express a view as to what the situation would be if the


record had been different.  We simply said, conceivably it


might.


MR. WHATLEY:  That -- that -- that's true, Your


Honor, which I assume, and courts below I think are now, 

there are situations where records are being developed


further to determine, so that the trial courts can make


that determination, has the remedy, has the arbitration


process been so impeded by those procedural issues that


you can't enforce it.


QUESTION:  Could two parties agree in advance


that if a RICO violation comes up they will only have


double damages, nothing about arbitration, just in court?


MR. WHATLEY:  No, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  They cannot?

you -- you cannot do it.


QUESTION:  Can two parties agree in a tort suit


that -- before there's a tort committed, that if there is


a tort, no damages greater than a million dollars in


punitives will be collected?


MR. WHATLEY:  It depends on the State law.


QUESTION:  So why doesn't it --


MR. WHATLEY:  That's a State law question.


QUESTION: 


-- but under Federal law you 

cannot -- it's void against public policy to limit in any


way any possible damages in a future lawsuit?


MR. WHATLEY:  Your Honor, in Mc --


QUESTION:  Is there -- has that been decided? 


I --


MR. WHATLEY:  In McMahon you said that -- that


parties cannot waive securities, future securities


violations even if there was a deal so that you got a


lower -- a lower payment for the transaction.


In Barrentine you said, either parties or unions

can't respectively waive Fair Labor Standards Act


violations in the future.


QUESTION:  The question didn't go to waiving the


violations.


MR. WHATLEY:  I --


QUESTION:  It went only to the remedy.


MR. WHATLEY:  It went to remedy, and what you've


got, Your Honor, I think is, Congress has established what


that remedy is, and I think it would be void as against


public policy.  I mean --


QUESTION:  But you then want us to adopt a


specific gateway rule when any arbitration agreement


limits a statutory remedy, and that statutory violation


would be arbitrable, and as I understand it, your rule is,


any limitation in an arbitration agreement of statutory 

remedy raises a question of public policy, a question of


public policy is a gateway arbitrability question, and it


always goes to the court first.  Is --


MR. WHATLEY:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  Is that a fair statement --


MR. WHATLEY:  Yes, sir.  For that --


QUESTION:  -- your position?


MR. WHATLEY:  For that limited issue of, did the


-- did the limitation, is there a limitation on the remedy


authorized by Congress.

 QUESTION:  And that's, I guess you want to say


for -- leaving arbitration out of it, that sounds very


far-reaching, because I would have thought the matter


might have varied, depending upon the statute.  I mean, I


would have thought Congress could sometimes pass a statute


with remedies, that it would not be against public policy


for two private persons to limit --


MR. WHATLEY:  Your Honor, Congress --


QUESTION:  Was it always -- in your view,


always, no matter what the statute, two people cannot say


in advance, we will, if there should -- should a violation


arise, we will agree that, in advance, that the limitation


will not exceed $10 million -- or the damages won't


exceed -- put in some reasonable amount?


MR. WHATLEY: 


I suppose in theory Congress could 

say, in the act, parties can waive this respectively.


QUESTION:  It's only waiving, putting a


limitation on damages.


MR. WHATLEY:  Congress -- Congress has not done


that, and yes, Your Honor, that is our position.  If


Congress establishes a remedy for a violation, and I think


this is discussed in much more detail in the Public


Citizen amicus brief that's submitted than it was in our


briefs, because we were trying to address the specific --

limitations within arbitration, which is the issue before


this Court.


QUESTION:  Well, but that's -- I think Vimar


cuts the other way, so the COGSA -- COGSA was certainly a


statute enacted by Congress.


MR. WHATLEY:  And -- and the Court said, it's


not clear here whether that's going to be followed or not


followed.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. WHATLEY:  I think you said, it is not clear


to us whether that will be followed or not followed in


this instance, and that's --


QUESTION:  If --


MR. WHATLEY: 


That's why you allowed it to 

proceed.


QUESTION:  If your view was correct, that whole


issue should have gone to a judge beforehand.


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, except that there's no -- I


don't read that.  There are two issues --


QUESTION:  You don't what?


MR. WHATLEY:  I don't read that as saying


specifically that that act would not be followed, number


one, their contract.


Number two, there is the separate consideration

there, as in Mitsubishi, of the concerns about


international, of international relations, where you have


said you've got to be especially hands off, and that issue


is not involved here.


QUESTION:  Well, but what's involved, which is


identical, is the kind of prudential consideration for


courts, don't decide a difficult issue unless you have to. 


Now, in Vimar it just said, look, we may never have to


decide this.  Send it to the arbitrator and see.


Now what you've suggested is to my mind a pretty


tough issue.


MR. WHATLEY:  Well --


QUESTION:  And we may never have to decide it,


or at least not soon.


MR. WHATLEY: 


Well, you might not. 

QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. WHATLEY:  You might not, but it's not just,


it's a tough issue, send it to the arbitrator and let the


arbitrator decide.


QUESTION:  The arbitrator will interpret the


contract to see if it really arises.


MR. WHATLEY:  But Number 2, it's also in an


international setting, where we've got to be, be, you


know, be concerned about that and grant all possible


deference to that situation.

 If there are not other questions --


QUESTION:  I have one question, and it's about


something that the petitioner represented in the


petitioners' brief at note 12, page 23.


The petitioner represented to us that you


represented to this Court that if any issue is sent to


arbitration you simply will give up the claim, that you


will not arbitrate any issue in this case.  Do you still


take that position, that -- is this representation


correct, that you have disclaimed any intention to


arbitrate any claim sent to arbitration?


MR. WHATLEY:  Your Honor, that gets back to the


problem that I was addressing before.  The claims here on


a claim by claim basis are so small that you cannot take


them to arbitration.


QUESTION:  Well, let's take the RICO claim.  If


you lose on where that goes first, if it goes to


arbitration first, are you -- are you saying that you will


not -- that you will abandon the case anyway?


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, it's not abandoning the


case, Your Honor, because there is a separate conspiracy


and aiding and abetting claim that is going forward that


is not up before this Court.


QUESTION:  But I mean the --


MR. WHATLEY:  And the claim here, if we have to

-- have to resolve those, even the RICO claims, even if


you treble $5 to get $15, if we have to try those on a


claim by claim basis, in terms of what the doctors'


damages are, it can't be done, and we will not proceed.


QUESTION:  But why would the trial be different


in court versus arbitration on that?


MR. WHATLEY:  Well, because -- and -- and -- and


I know you're going to address this issue in Basil to some


extent, but the issue in court, the issues have been


certified in the court, so they're proceeding as a class


action, which is the only way that -- that claims of this


magnitude can be handled, and so that's our problem.  If


we could proceed in arbitration on a class-wide basis,


sure we would do it, and -- and doing that in the Federal


system has limits thus far, but -- but proceeding on a 

claim by claim basis, where the damages are $5, $10, $15,


$50 for the bundling down claim --


QUESTION:  Have you gotten a certification of


anything in the district court?  Did you --


MR. WHATLEY:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  You did?


MR. WHATLEY:  Yes.  Yes.  The trial court has


certified the claims that -- that -- that are -- that are


-- that -- that -- that -- that were not referred to


arbitration.  The -- that currently is on appeal, on a

QUESTION:  Mr. Grauer, you have 3 minutes left.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. GRAUER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. GRAUER:  Mr. Whatley's argument about $5


here and $10 there is flatly inconsistent with what the


district judge found, and you can note at page A25 of our


cert petition that the court found that these cases were


negotiated by sophisticated groups of doctors, that the


claims were not small, that in fact the doctors were 

enlarging an ongoing pattern -- that's about midway


through page A25 of our cert petition, that that is an


ongoing pattern of instances.


Mr. Whatley's comment about the -- the


conspiracy claim has been certified and is going forward


is exactly an example of the problem.  Conspiracy is


simply a remedy that's -- that -- a way of creating


liability for an underlying cause of action, and the


arbitration clauses in this case require the doctors to


arbitrate all of their disputes with the managed care


50

companies, and they're trying to circumvent that on a mass


basis both in this appeal and by trying to say that the


conspiracy claims are not part of the arbitration clause,


and we don't think that's appropriate, and we think when


we talk about remedies in our cert petition, that would


include methods of holding someone liable for a claim, and


the Court ought to take a look at that in the record of


the case.


But I would agree fundamentally with a point


that I -- I thought I heard Justice Souter making a moment


ago, and that is that if Mr. Whatley's premise that any


remedial limitation becomes a gateway issue of


arbitrability, we are throwing -- we are overruling Howsam


after only a few weeks, because the whole point of Howsam


was, you look to whether the parties made an agreement to 

arbitrate, and you look to whether the dispute is in the


scope of the agreement.


And here, at page A40 of our petition, the Court


finds this is an exceptionally broad arbitration


agreement.  It includes any and all controversies, and the


Court found that.  That has never been appealed.  Every --


all of the claims are within the scope of it, and it is


complete speculation to suggest that that, that any of


these claims are not within the scope of the arbitration


agreement.


51 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005 

 The -- the -- with re -- a final point with


reference to the intent of the parties.  The parties would


intend an arbitrator to decide remedial limitations, and


the reason why the parties would intend the arbitrator to


decide that is because the parties have agreed to


arbitrate.  They have a dispute in the scope.  They would


never intend to go to court at all.  They would intend to


go to arbitration and comply with their agreement, and the


question of remedies would be the last thing that would


come up in the event, on a speculative basis, that they


prevail, and they ought not to be able to get away from


that basic principle by labels, the label of punitive


damages, the label of RICO, the label of conspiracy. 


Those labels are being used to take away the rights of


managed care companies on a wholesale, nationwide basis to 

have these types of disputes resolved by arbitrators, as


the parties have agreed, and instead they're trying to


turn it into a nationwide class action.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Grauer.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
