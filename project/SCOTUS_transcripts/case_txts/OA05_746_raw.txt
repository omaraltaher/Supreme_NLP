 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument next

Mr. Phillips.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The fundamental question in this case is whether 
the common law doctrine of equivalence between defendant 
negligence and plaintiff negligence applies under the 
FELA.  The doctrine of equivalence is, I think, most 
clearly stated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, 
which is reproduced on page 19 of our blue brief in the 
middle paragraph.  And I think it is worth taking a 
second to read it. 

The rules which determine the causal relation 
between a plaintiff's negligent conduct and the harm 
resulting to him are the same as those determining the 
causal relation between the defendant's negligent conduct 
and resulting harm to others.  That is a principle of law 
that has been in effect long before the Federal Employers 
Liability Act was enacted.  It is obviously a restatement 
of the law in 1965, and it is an absolutely clear

statement of the law as it applies today. 

There is nothing in the Federal Employers 

Liability Act that remotely modifies the doctrine of 
equivalence.  The two provisions, section 51 talks about 
negligence resulting from -- or negligence in whole or in 
part.  And section 53, which describes the contributory 
negligence portion or comparative negligence talks about 
negligence attributable to.  None of that deviates at all 
from any kind of common law doctrines.  Negligence 
inherently calls for an analysis of proximate causation.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Except that the -- what was it, 
the Rogers case, which said that the -- well, you debate 
whether it said that, but let's assume that it said that 
the rule of proximate causality doesn't apply to the 
negligence of the defendant. 

The basis for that holding was that in whole or in 

part language which is used for the negligence of the 
defendant, but not used for the contributory negligence. 
So if you believe that that case was at least decided for 
the right reason, it seems to me there's a good argument 
that it changed it for the one, but not for the other.
 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, even if that were true, we 

would still, of course, be entitled to -- I mean, it 
doesn't change the doctrine of equivalence.  It doesn't 
say that we're not entitled to the same rule with respect

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But nobody does --
MR. PHILLIPS:  The plaintiff would be.  That 

doctrine is unaffected by that holding.  Now, I'd like 
to take issue with the interpretation of Rogers, if you 
want, at this point.  But it seems to me the doctrine of 
equivalence is fundamentally different from the doctrine 
of proximate causation.  And therefore, you can change one 
without affecting the other one whatsoever.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Phillips, the fundamental 
problem, at least for me, in this case is that there was 
no objection at all at trial to the instruction that the 
judge gave on negligence.  There was an instruction 
requested by the defendant on contributory negligence, 
which read, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in 
whole or in part to cause his injury."  That was the 
only instruction objected to, because the refusal to 
give that instruction.  But you seem to be using that as 
a lever to attack the instruction on negligence to which 
no objection was made.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  That's not our attack, Justice 

Ginsburg.  Our objection, which is reproduced in 28A of 
the cert -- of the petition's appendix, that says -- and 
I think the current MAI instruction has a different 
causation standard for comparative fault, meaning that

under Missouri's rules, we must prove that such 
negligence of plaintiff directly contributed to the cause 
-- to cause the injury.  And that misstates the law, 
because of the doctrine of equivalence. 

That's our initial argument, is that no matter how 

you analyze this, whether you do it from a proximate 
cause or a slightest cause standard as the appropriate 
way to evaluate our negligence, that same standard has to 
be applied in evaluating the plaintiff's negligence. 
That's the core doctrine.  That's what we sought 
certiorari on. 

The argument with respect to Rogers was not an 

argument we put into this case, Justice Ginsburg.  It's 
an argument that the Respondent put into this case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I take it you would be satisfied 
-- not wholly satisfied, but substantially satisfied if 
we said, yeah, we accept the doctrine of equivalence, and 
we think the instruction on contributory negligence was 
correct.  Because that would mean in the next case, you 
would get a proximate cause instruction on defendant's 
negligence.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  We would regard that as certainly 
at least half a loaf, maybe more than half a loaf.  But 
at the end of the day, I think the right answer in this 
case is that the Court ought to go ahead and decide

whether or not Rogers really did work a sea change in the 
law.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  If we came out the way I just 

described --

MR. PHILLIPS:  You wouldn't have to address that 

issue.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  We wouldn't have to.
 MR. PHILLIPS:  Absolutely don't have to address 

that issue.  On the other hand, the question is squarely 
presented.  And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I thought you argued the 
Rogers standard was a correct standard in the Missouri 
court?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  We clearly did that, Justice 

Kennedy.  And we didn't raise -- we are not here 
complaining about Rogers as an argument for why we 
shouldn't be liable.  That's not our -- we're not 
criticizing that. 

What we're saying is, in response to the 

Respondent's argument which seeks to undermine the 
doctrine of equivalence based on an overreading, I would 
argue, of Rogers, that that interpretation is incorrect. 
And if we're right that that interpretation is incorrect, 
we would win on the doctrine of equivalence for two 
different reasons.

The first one that Justice Souter described.  And 
the second one would be that to the extent that there's 
any equivalence, there's no problem here because 
proximate cause is required in every case.  And we think 
that that's an issue that the Court doesn't have to 
decide, but certainly could.  I'm sorry, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Phillips, the defendant 

requested a charge on contributory negligence that read, 
"such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in 
part to cause his injuries."  You didn't want the direct 
relationship, you didn't ask for that.  You asked for one 
that said, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in 
whole or in part to his injury."  Now you are saying that 
that was -- what you asked for was an incorrect charge.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  No, what we're saying, Justice 

Ginsburg, is that we were entitled to the same -- if they 
were going to use slight negligence with respect to our 
negligence, then with respect to the plaintiff's 
negligence, we were entitled to slight negligence as 
well. 

That's our fundamental argument.  That's the issue 

we have put on the table.  And candidly, I don't think 
there's an answer to that that's been offered in this 
case, other than a harmless error argument, which I think 
is candidly without substance.

The issue, then, is whether in evaluating the 

doctrine of equivalence, do you want to then entertain 
the plaintiff's or the Respondent's counter argument, 
which is that somehow Rogers requires this fundamental 
change, and indeed overrules the doctrine of equivalence 
as it applies to FELA. 

And I would say, one, Rogers doesn't speak to the 
doctrine of equivalence at all.  And, two, to the extent 
it does speak to it, it was never meant to change the 
fundamental rule with respect to proximate causation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Except we've rejected petitions 
for certiorari on that issue at least a couple of times. 
Eleven circuits are in agreement as to what Rogers 
required.  You --

MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, at least one circuit clearly.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you really expect to get five 
votes for the railroad on this, what would be a massive 
change of what is assumed to be the law for, what, 50 
years?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think the -- well, the 

answer is yes, of course, I expect to get five votes for 
that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you were wise enough not to 

ask for that.

MR. PHILLIPS:  But you know, the basic -- the 

point here is that if you look at the decisions that have 
analyzed this Court's opinion in Rogers, I don't think 
any of them has analyzed it with much care.  And the 
reality is the Third Circuit has analyzed this case with 
care, and reached the opposite conclusion. 

We think there is a split in the circuits.  And at 

some point, if not through this vehicle to address that 
issue, then through another vehicle to address that 
issue.  But, yes, it seems reasonably clear that, first 
of all, there were at least 20 decisions of this Court 
dealing not only with the sufficiency evidence, but also 
with the adequacy of the jury instructions prior to 
Rogers that refer specifically to proximate causation. 

There is nothing in the statute that remotely 
meant to change that.  There is nothing that's been 
identified in that context.  It is at least clear to me, 
and I hope clear to five of you --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Rogers said, in whole or in part. 
Now, I agree with you, that I don't see how that does it. 
But Rogers said that it did it.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  But what Rogers saying in whole or 
in part eliminated was the specific proximate causation 
standard existing in Missouri.  And Missouri's proximate 
cause standard talked about sole causation.  And this

Court said, no, in whole or in part means sole causation 
can not be the right standard for proximate cause. 

The Court was not asked to decide, and I don't 

think it did decide, that proximate causation, as it is 
traditionally understood, was also thrown out the door, 
or more fundamentally, that you can never ask for a jury 
instruction that calls for proximate causation to be 
given to both parties -- I'm sorry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Phillips, I may be 

lost a bit here.  But I mean, which -- I'm looking at the 
instructions that were given.  And it seems to me it is 
hard to take issue with the instruction on the railroad's 
part because it tracks the statutory language.  The 
statute says in whole or in part, and the instruction 
says in whole or in part. 

So if you're pushing the doctrine of equivalence, 

your objection seems to be to the directly contributed 
language with respect to the employee, the plaintiff. 
Now, but doesn't directly contributed, isn't that a 
typical proximate cause instruction?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, that is a typical proximate 
cause instruction, and that meant that our burden was 
heavier than the plaintiff's burden, which is why we're 
saying that under the doctrine of equivalence, we're 
entitled to the equivalent instructions.  Whatever they

are.  If it is slight cause or proximate cause.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  But on the other 

hand, you're also arguing in favor of proximate cause.  You 
are saying Rogers didn't change proximate cause.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  But we are only doing that 
in response to the Respondent's argument.  I'm not -- we 
didn't bring to this Court an affirmative argument that 
said we are entitled to no liability because of proximate 
cause.  That's not the argument we made.  The argument --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How is the blue brief in 

response to Respondent's argument?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Because if you look at the 

opposition to the cert petition, which took us to task 
for not discussing Rogers in our petition, it says on 
page 6, "inexplicably, petitioner does not cite, let 
alone discuss Rogers, an omission that enfeebles its 
entire discussion of FELA's causation standards." 
Against that kind of an attack, we felt it 

incumbent on us to deal with Rogers.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  As we're supposed to decide the 

case, in your view, there was instruction 13. 
Instruction 13 used the word direct.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  You object to 13.  You said it 

should use the word in whole or in part.

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  You then argued to the lower 

courts, 13 should use the word in whole or in part.  And 
then you say you've argued that here.  So what you're 
saying is now we're supposed to decide, should 
instruction 13 use the word in whole or in part. That's 
what it is. 

I have to admit, I didn't quite get that out of 
the blue brief.  I thought you were arguing something 
else about railroad negligence.  But you're not now, you 
say, arguing about railroad negligence.  You're arguing 
about plaintiff negligence.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, we're arguing both.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So if I reread the 
blue brief, what I'll discover on closer examination, 
that your real objection, not responding to the other 
side, has simply been about the standard to use in 
respect to plaintiff's contributory negligence.  And what 
you want this Court to say is, you're right about that, 
we want the more relaxed standard used for contributory 
negligence.  End of case.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, it does say that in the blue 

brief.  Because what we say is that the doctrine 
of equivalence is the principle that should apply.  And 
you know, it is not specifically before the Court whether 
that means slight cause or proximate cause.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I would say it sure is before the 

Court, because what we are considering before the Court 
is your objection to instruction 13.  And you said it 
should use the words in whole or in part.  And I have to 
admit, I don't know why it shouldn't.  But I'll have to 
ask them that.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  That's fair.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  You're going to say yes. 

So all this other stuff is quite extraneous about whether 
-- the railroad standard of negligence, the railroad 
should be in a relaxed standard of negligence, in whole 
or in part.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I don't know that it's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Causation.
 MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't know that it's extraneous. 

It clearly is not something that the Court needs to 
decide.  On the other hand, it is something that the 
Respondents, to my mind at least, put into the case.  And 
then we responded, to be sure, somewhat aggressively in 
urging the Court to rethink whether Rogers was right --

whether Rogers really decided this issue as some courts 
of appeals have.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Perhaps my memory is faulty, 

but as I recall your opening brief, many pages were 
devoted to what instruction should have been given on 
railroad negligence.  You were dealing not simply with 
what seems to be the question presented, that is, was the 
instruction on contributory negligence wrong, because it 
said -- it didn't use the in whole or in part language. 
Instead it said directly caused. 

So that's the limit of what we can deal with, 

whether the in whole or in part should have been in the 
contributory negligence.  But it was your brief that 
spent a lot of time talking about the proper standard for 
the railroad's negligence.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  There is no question about that, 
Justice Ginsburg.  But the point is that we made both 
arguments.  And they are in some ways intertwined, in 
part because so much of the doctrine of equivalence 
itself is based on proximate cause as the standard.  And 
so if you go back and look at all of the common law 
analyses here, which are the predicate --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you didn't object to the 
charge that was given on negligence.  You didn't object 
to the in whole or in part.  So that should be out of the

Official 

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Except to the extent that the 
Respondents are asking you to interpret Rogers as a 
mechanism for getting at the doctrine of equivalence. 
Now, it seems to me you can answer that in one of two 
ways. 

You can say simply, as I said to Justice Scalia, 
Rogers doesn't speak to the doctrine of equivalence, and 
therefore, you don't have to entertain that, you should 
just reaffirm a doctrine that every court except the 
courts in Missouri have recognized for a very long time. 
Or alternatively, you can say, well, look, they say that 
in order to properly analyze the doctrine of equivalence, 
you should examine whether or not Rogers worked a sea 
change in the law. 

And we took them up on that argument, and said, we 

don't think it did.  And that if it didn't work a sea 
change in the law, then there is no basis at all for 
doubting that you would grant equivalent instructions in 
these two cases.  And that's the guidance you would give 
to the lower courts on remand.  Because this case would 
have to go back for a new trial.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You're not taking them up on 

any argument when you spent half your brief arguing about 
what the proper standard was for the railroad's

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I would add to that that we 

don't usually look at a BIO to see the issues that the 
Petitioner is presenting.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  And you know, Justice Kennedy, I 

understand that.  But the reality is we raised the 
doctrine of equivalence as our question presented.  The 
other side raises and uses a substantial amount of its 
pages for the issue of the meaning of Rogers.  We answer 
that in the reply brief.  The Court grants certiorari. 
We decided under those circumstances that the sensible 
way to proceed was to address the Rogers issue. 

Now, to be sure, I suppose we could have said, 
here's -- section one is the doctrine of equivalence. 
That's a 10 page brief.  Maybe the better way to do it is 
just write a 15 page brief, wait for their 47 page brief 
on Rogers, and then 20 pages on Rogers. 

But we anticipated that they were going to do 

precisely what they did, which is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you would have us 
announce a decision on the doctrine of equivalence 
without saying which way it should be made equivalent? 
Raising the railroad's standard or lowering the 
employee's?

have been doing that for years.  There have been a lot --
you know, a lot of them assume that there's a lower 
standard, and they say that the doctrine of equivalence 
requires that if the plaintiff gets to go with slight 
cause, then the defendant gets slight cause.  So that's a 
ruling that's been rendered for years and years. 

Is that the most sensible way?  I don't know.  I 
think it would make sense for this Court to address the 
more fundamental issue of Rogers.  Because I think it is 
an important issue that needs to be decided.  I don't 
think the Court needs to decide it.  I do think it has 
been thoroughly vetted for the Court on both sides, and 
it would certainly provide significant guidance to the 
lower courts.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Phillips, may I ask you this 

question.  Assuming you're right on the doctrine of 
equivalence and you're wrong on proximate cause, for the 
moment.  Now, you said earlier in your argument, it is 
perfectly clear there was no harmless error here.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  It seemed to me that a possible 

interpretation of the record -- and I'd like you to comment 
of the record -- is that the jury either believed the one --
one truck driver or the other.  And that the direct causation 
thing really didn't have an impact on the calculation of

And I was going to ask you to comment on that and 
to tell me whether during the argument of the case before 
the jury, did the plaintiff's lawyer argue, in effect, 
that he had -- the railroad has a much heavier burden of 
proving a causation than we do?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Let me take the first question 

first, and then I'll address the second one.  There were 
three theories that the plaintiff put forward of the 
negligence of the railroad.  Not just that the one driver 
drove the other driver off the side of the road.  There 
was also a claim that the road wasn't constructed 
properly, and there was a claim that he wasn't given 
adequate safety instructions. 

And there's no way, given that this was a general 
verdict, to remotely figure out which of those theories 
was the one the jury thought was correct, and how that 
theory might line up with a causation theory, based on 
the plaintiff's own particular view and the defendant's 
arguments in this particular case. 

So it is not as cut and dried as he said, he said, 

and that's it.  They were more theories in it.  And you 
know, if you accept the idea that jury instructions 
count, and there's clearly a very different burden that's 
imposed on one as opposed to the other, then it seems to

me the answer is there's no way for the Court to make a 
harmless error determination. 

It is also a question of State law.  It ought to 
be decided by the Missouri courts in the first instance 
in any event, I would think, rather than this Court 
trying to sort through the record. 

With respect to the argument at the close of 

the case, I don't remember any specific arguments that 
either side made with respect to the burdens, because the 
jury instructions were what they were.  And I think each 
side was saying, you know, we really didn't do anything 
wrong.  And so that's basically the way that it was 
presented. 

But I think given the way the jury instructions 

played out, that there's no way at this time to 
unscramble that.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I think I'm seeing now, I think 
the structure of your brief is -- perhaps a gloss put on 
it, but saying this:  Look, we objected to the 
contributory negligence instruction on the ground that it 
couldn't be different from the direct instruction -- from 
the railroad instruction.  And we said they should be the 
same and they should both be in whole or in part.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Correct.

the refusal of the court to do that was wrong, because it 
violated the equivalence.  But as soon as you do that, 
you're going to have to think about what the right 
standard should be for a new trial.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And if you stop there, probably, 
they will put the in whole or in part, but that's not the 
right standard.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And if you really think about it, 
you will see that the one we didn't ask for, but the one 
that the court gave, is the right standard and should 
have been given in the other case, too.  Now, we wouldn't 
have to say that.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But you're saying unless you say 
that, you're not going to give proper instruction to what 
happens in the future.  Now --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now let's think back for a minute 

on the merits.

it be wrong to have instructed the jury with the in whole 
or in part language for the railroad, since that's the

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think if we were entitled 

to go back to the trial court, and if the issue was 
what's the proper instruction, we would have asked for 
and we should have properly received a proximate cause 
instruction.  And that's what -- that's the question that 
will be at issue on the remand.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What possible -- you have two 

sides.  One, you write a proximate cause instruction in 
whatever language you like.
 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  The other side submits a proposed 

instruction with in whole or in part.  I'm a trial 
judge.  I've never heard of this case, kind of case 
before.  I just was appointed.  I read the statute.  And 
I say, well, here, theirs says what the statute says, and 
yours doesn't.  I'll play it safe.  I'll go with the 
statute.  All right?  Now, how could that be an error?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it is not a correct statement 

of the law.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.

explain to the jury what decisionmaking it has to go 
through in order to evaluate this case.  I mean, it is 
true, it is not an incorrect statement in the sense that 
there's nothing wrong with it.  But it is not an adequate 
statement because it doesn't deal, it is not sufficient, 
it doesn't deal with the proximate cause issue.  I mean, 
it seems to me --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Phillips, may I interrupt on 

exactly the point that I think you're addressing with 
Justice Breyer?  As I understand your argument, you're 
saying one view of Rogers is that the in whole or in part 
language eliminates the proximate cause instruction.  We 
all agree that that is one view of Rogers.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But it also does something else. 

And I don't think we disagree about that either.  It 
specifically instructs the jury that multiple causation 
may be present.  And if it is, if the defendant is at 
least one, the source of one of those causes under Rogers 
even slightly --

MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- that that will suffice.  The 

problem I have with -- in a way with your response to 
Justice Breyer, and the problem that I have with the 
instruction that your side requested on contributory

negligence is this:  It seems to me that the in whole or 
in part language would be wrong on contributory 
negligence, or at least it would be very misleading, for 
the simple reason that you never get to contributory 
negligence unless you found the defendant was negligent 
in the first place.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And therefore, if the plaintiff 
is also negligent, it will necessarily be in part.  It 
couldn't be wholly or in part.  If it were wholly 
negligent, you would never have found the defendant was 
negligent in the first place.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  So that to the extent the 

instruction addresses multiple causation, it would be 
misleading to the jury, and it would assume a possibility 
that couldn't happen.  Therefore, if you are not going to 
mislead the jury on multiple causation when you instruct 
on contributory negligence, you've got to have some other 
way of addressing the proximate cause language.  Is that 
analysis right or wrong?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think it is wrong on two 

levels.  One is, I don't know why you would need to have 
proximate cause as your fallback, the last comment you 
just made, because it seems to me if you're saying slight

cause, which is what Missouri thinks the in whole or in 
part means, then you can just say slight cause when 
you're describing the contributory negligence.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  But the instruction that your 

side asked for, as I understand it, was not a slight 
cause instruction, it was an in whole or in part 
instruction.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  What we asked for was an 

equivalence.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay, and that -- all right.  But 
if you're asking for the in whole or in part instruction 
on contributory negligence, it seems to me the judge has 
got to have been correct in saying no to that, because to 
the extent that it addresses multiple causation, it would 
be addressing a problem that couldn't even occur in 
contributory negligence which will always be in part.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  That was not the basis on which the 

judge rejected it.  He didn't reject it on the basis --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, maybe that was not the 
basis on which he rejected it, but if -- we've got to 
consider it in deciding whether to reverse it.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the point here that remains 
is we said we are entitled to an equivalent instruction. 
Now, if there's some variant of that, we could certainly 
argue about that.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But that's not what he said.  He 

said equivalence instruction was not on multiple 
causation.  It was the equivalence instruction on either 
proximate cause or not proximate cause.  It was the 
causation issue, it was the proximate causation issue, 
not the multiple causation issue that concerned you, 
right?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, that is the specific issue in 

this case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  They don't have to have 

proximate, we don't have to have proximate.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  That's our argument.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  But because the 

instruction addresses both, in one view, proximate cause 
and multiple cause, it would have been misleading so far 
as the multiple cause issue was concerned, and a request 
for an instruction in whole or in part on contributory 
negligence really should have been denied.  Is that 
correct?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well -- I think -- I think the 

argument would be that that cuts it too fine, candidly. 
I think you can make an argument that what, you know, 
what we were entitled to was some variant.  And that --

MR. PHILLIPS:  The slightest cause.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- proximate cause or no need to 

prove proximate cause.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  That's your basic argument.
 MR. PHILLIPS:  That's our basic argument.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 MR. PHILLIPS:  And we didn't get that.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And I don't think you could have 

gotten where you want to go with the instruction that 
your side requested, which was an in whole or in part 
instruction.  That's my only point.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it may be that the in whole 
part of this may have been slightly misleading, although 
I think you can make an argument that you can end up with 
in whole on both sides as a conceptual matter.  But 
that's not the -- that wasn't the complaint at trial.  It 
wasn't the basis for the trial judge's decision, wasn't 
the basis for the court of appeals decision. 

If the Court wants to send it back and say, is 

there another objection to this instruction, that's fine. 
But it seems to me, this Court ought to address this 
issue in the way it has been presented.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY L. PERRY
 ON BEHALF OF THE Respondent

 MS. PERRY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 

the Court: 

The controlling question raised here is whether 
instruction 13 accurately states Federal law.  That's 
exactly what petitioner said in their reply brief to the 
Missouri Court of Appeals.  They could not have been any 
clearer that their challenge was to instruction 13.  In 
John versus Poulin, this Court said that State courts

have the authority to prescribe the rules of procedure in 
their courts even when Federal issues are at stake. 

The requirements in the Missouri courts were not 
complied with here.  No abstract question was presented. 
The sole question presented and preserved was with 
respect to instruction 13.  And that can again be seen in 
their opening brief in the Missouri Court of Appeals, 
which specifically says the trial court erred in giving 
instruction 13 based on MAI 32.07(b).

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is the question whether 

instruction 13 is flawed viewed in isolation, or whether 
it is flawed when it's viewed together with the 
instruction on employer negligence?

 MS. PERRY:  It is viewed in conjunction with the 
instruction on employer negligence, but a fixed concept 
of what it was, they did not challenge the language of 
instruction 12.  They accepted that.  Holding that 
language constant, what should we do to instruction 13? 

They could have objected to instruction 12 and 13, 
and they could have said, here are a pair of instructions 
both in proximate cause, and here are a pair of 
instructions both in -- resulting in whole or in part, 
and then they could have preserved this issue.  But they 
did not do that.  They accepted instruction 12 as a 
correct statement of the law, and said, now let's look at

Official 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But do you agree that they set out 

different causation standards, 12 and 13?

 MS. PERRY:  Yes, they do.  Rogers concluded that 

50 years ago and the courts in the Federal and State 
system have nearly uniformly interpreted Rogers as 
reaching that decision.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So if the causation standards are 
in fact the same, then instruction 13 is defective; isn't 
that right?

 MS. PERRY:  Yes, if you can reach that decision 

without interpreting instruction 12, or the propriety of 
instruction 12, particularly since instruction 12 
contained the exact language of the statute.  Whatever 
judicial gloss has been put on that language was not told 
to the jury. 

Justice Stevens, the question you asked, whether 

there was any argument about the different standards, the 
answer is no.  There was no argument.  The only way in 
which the jury learned of this difference was in the 
language of the instruction.  And instruction 12 --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me ask you this question, if 

I may.  Perhaps I should have asked Mr. Phillips.  Is 
there such an animal as the doctrine of equivalence?  I 
understand the restatement describes what the plaintiff's

burden is on proving causation, and then it says the same 
rules apply to defendant's contributory negligence. 

But that doesn't sound to me like any overriding 
doctrine of equivalence.  It just says when they wrote 
the restatement, the rules were the same.  Is there such 
a thing as the doctrine of equivalence?

 MS. PERRY:  There wasn't in the early 1900s for 

certain, Your Honor, because at that time, even 
petitioners recognized the doctrine was emerging.  And if 
we look at the language of 53, it talks about the type of 
contributory negligence that used to be a bar.  And that 
certainly was a type of contributory negligence that only 
arose with the traditional proximate cause.  It certainly 
wasn't on the slightest cause standard.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, doesn't there have 

to be a doctrine of equivalence when you're running a 
comparative negligence regime?  Because, you know, you 
talk about the plaintiff's negligence causing the harm to 
a certain degree and the defendant's negligence causing 
it to a certain degree.  And if you're not dealing with 
apples and apples, it seems to me you can't conduct the 
comparison.

 MS. PERRY:  No, Your Honor.  You can conduct the 
comparison, and it happens all the time in cases where 
one party has committed intentional misconduct and

another party has had negligent misconduct.  The 
causation standards are different in that instance. 
There's a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  But we're talking 

about comparative negligence here, where there's 
negligence on both sides.  And I just don't know how you 
say one party's 20 percent -- contributed 20 percent to 
the harm and the other 80 percent, if you're using 
different causation standards.

 MS. PERRY:  Well, the causation standard is used 
to decide what negligence you use in the balance and in 
the comparison.  For example, if a party is negligent, 
but the negligence had no causative effect, that 
negligence falls out of the analysis.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah, but your example of other 

instances including having to compare a defendant who did 
the tort intentionally with negligent -- contributory 
negligence, that's not what we have here.  We have here a 
difference in the causation.  Intentional or 
non-intentional has nothing to do with causation. 

But once you say that there's a difference in the 

causation, it seems to me you cannot compare the two. 
You cannot compare the two sensibly, unless you are using 
the same kind of a standard. 

I mean, let's assume that you find that the

railroad did not directly, but nonetheless caused the 
injury to some extent, but the defendant was directly 
contributory to it.  What do I do?  Do I add another 40 
percent to his culpability because it was -- his 
causation was more direct than the plaintiff's causation?

 MS. PERRY:  No.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why not?
 MS. PERRY:  It just affects which negligence was 

in the balance.  And --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, it doesn't.  It certainly 
bears considerably upon the culpability of the two, it 
seems to me.

 MS. PERRY:  Well, in responding -- going back to 

your question about intentional conduct, the petitioner's 
reply brief, in fact, states that a broader range of 
harms are considered proximately caused by intentional 
torts.  So there is a different conception of proximate 
cause in that context. 

But in any event, their merits brief consistently 

argues for a proximate cause standard.  In fact, it 
closes with that.  And its criticism of instruction 13 in 
this case was precisely that it was a proximate cause 
standard.  So if they are now before this Court asking 
for a proximate cause standard, they conceded that 
instruction 13 was a proximate cause standard, they in

fact complained about it precisely because it was a 
proximate cause standard, that issue really isn't before 
this Court anymore.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't have any 

conceptual difficulty with adding in whole or in part to 
instruction 13, which is the employee's instruction, 
because it's comparative negligence.  It seems to me that 
necessarily implies in whole or in part.  If you can 
reduce his recovery because he's in part negligent, what 
would be wrong with saying in whole or in part in 
instruction 13?

 MS. PERRY:  Well, I think Justice Souter hit the 

nail on the head on that one, in that it does create 
confusion and it can mislead the jury that the railroad 
worker is responsible for other parties' culpability as 
well.  Moreover --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  I thought Justice 

Souter's point was that taking it out of the railroad's 
instruction might cause confusion because of it.  But I 
don't see how adding it to both of them when you're 
dealing with comparative negligence, and it's necessarily 
the case that partial negligence on either of their parts 
can enter into the verdict, I don't see how that can be 
confusing.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can answer it.
 MS. PERRY:  I don't want to interrupt anybody.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Answer the question, Justice 

Souter.  Yes or no.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  The point that I was trying to 

make about it being misleading is that if you use the in 
whole or in part language for a contributory negligence 
instruction, you are misleading the jury into thinking 
that at least there might be whole contributory 
negligence.  There never will be.  You don't get the 
contributory negligence unless you've already found the 
defendant was negligent, at least to some degree. 
Therefore, if the plaintiff is negligent, it can only be 
in part.  That's all I was trying to say.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Under that scenario, then, 

what objection could there be to a recognition that the 
negligence of the plaintiff can contribute in part to the 
accident?

 MS. PERRY:  If petitioner had asked for an 

instruction that said directly contributed in part, the 
inclusion of the phrase in part there might not have any 
impact.  It could still potentially mislead the jury, but 
they were seeking not just to add the words "resulting in 
whole or in part," but remove the word "directly" because 
it connoted proximate cause, and that they felt proximate

cause was not the appropriate standard for contributory 
negligence, even though now that is the standard that 
they solely are seeking.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, two things you might 

comment on.  First, the in whole or in part, you might 
take account of the fact that there are other negligent 
actors, third parties, who have contributed to the injury 
to the employee. 

Secondly, Section 53 does not contain the language 

in whole or in part.

 MS. PERRY:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  It does not. 

In section --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's what Justice 

Souter has identified, right?  That's not because they're 
adopting different standards.

 MS. PERRY:  I disagree, Your Honor.  I think it is 

because they are adopting different standards.  The 
contributory negligence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you just told me, a 

good reason for not putting in whole or in part in 
instruction 13 is because it doesn't make sense, the 
whole part doesn't make sense with contributory 
negligence.  That's a good reason not to put it in 
Section 53 either.

 MR. PERRY:  That's one reason.  But another reason

is that it's a different standard.  In Section 53, 
they're talking about contributory negligence that was a 
bar to liability.  That type of contributory negligence 
was the kind that was more than -- it wasn't caused by 
slight causation.  It required proximate cause.  That was 
a pretty harsh result. 

And it certainly didn't arise in instances where 

the plaintiff had just had the slightest causal 
connection.  And that certainly was the conclusion in 
Rogers.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, no, no.  May I pick you up 
on that?  Because there's a point at which you and I are 
disagreeing about Rogers.  And in all candor, I think 
it's because you are ignoring one part of Rogers, and if 
I'm wrong, I want you to tell me.  You quote the 
slightest bit language from Rogers on both page 26 and 33 
of your brief.  And you take that as being language that 
eliminates the proximate cause requirement. 

What you don't include in your quotation is the 

footnote in Justice Brennan's opinion following that 
slightest cause language.  And the footnote was to a 
citation, the citation was to the Coray case.  The 
opinion in Coray was written by Justice Douglas and --
I'm sorry, Justice Black.  And in the very language that 
Justice Black used, he said expressly that if proximate

cause is shown, there can be recovery. 

Now, given the fact that in Rogers, the very 

citation to the language which you say eliminated the 
proximate cause requirement cited a case in which 
proximate cause was part of the very sentence relied on, 
I don't see how you can read Rogers -- maybe later cases, 
but I don't see how you can read Rogers as eliminating 
the proximate cause requirement. 

And therefore, I think you have to read Rogers as 
addressing the issue of multiple causation, not proximate 
causation.  Now, am I going wrong there somewhere?

 MS. PERRY:  I have two responses, Your Honor. 
First, Justice Brennan wrote Crane twelve years later.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Absolutely right.
 MS. PERRY:  And he, you know, definitely clearly 

said that a railroad worker does not have to prove common 
law proximate causation relying on Rogers.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  He did, but he was also pointing 

out, just to make it simpler, he was pointing out in 
Crane that the liability arose in Crane out of -- I 
forget the full name of it -- the Appliance Act.  And the 
Appliance Act had its own set of standards.  And 
therefore, you cannot, from an Appliance Act case, you 
cannot infer anything one way or the other about the 
general standard in FELA.  And to make it even more

complicated, as I recall, Rogers was an Appliance case, 
too, but he didn't get into that there. 

But my only point is, you are right about the 

two Brennan opinions, Rogers and the -- Crane.  But given 
the fact that it was an Appliance case, I don't think you 
can infer one thing or another about an ultimate FELA 
standard in the absence of an Appliance action. 

What remains is that the citation in Rogers was to 
Coray, and Coray spoke about there still being proximate 
cause.

 MS. PERRY:  Yes.  But if we look at those earlier 

cases, particularly Coray, we can see that Rogers 
articulated what was meant by that proximate cause 
language.  Proximate cause is, in a sense, a label for 
scope of liability or legal cause, as the restatement 
says.  It doesn't have any singular conception.  And in 
Coray, the Court found --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it is understood by 

everybody, isn't it, that at least it has the conception 
which is captured by using the word "direct" as in 
instruction 13, and at least it has that core of meaning 
whenever it is used, doesn't it? 

In other words, it may not have a lot of bells and 

whistles associated with it in the prior law, but at 
least it requires some direct causation as opposed to

 MS. PERRY:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  And that's -- I don't know 
that Justice Brennan's citation to Coray, or Coray's use 
of the language carries you any further than that.  But 
that's as far as Mr. Phillips wants to go.

 MS. PERRY:  We don't accept that, but even if 
that's the case, the Rogers -- the parties to Rogers 
immediately interpreted that decision as affecting 
proximate cause.  Twelve years later, this Court did say 
that in Crane.  The lower courts have uniformly, nearly 
uniformly interpreted Rogers in a certain way.  And at 
this point, stare decisis suggests that this Court should 
not overrule.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  That may be.  That may be.  But 

it seems to me that that's a different argument from 
saying Rogers requires it, because I don't think you can 
get that out of Rogers.

 MS. PERRY:  Well, and I also think, though, that 
by lightening -- by saying the slightest cause possible 
or, you know, a slight cause would create liability, that 
does affect proximate cause.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't have to say 
that.  I mean, you know, when in doubt, we ought to 
follow the words of the statute.  And so whole or in part

makes sense with the railroad, but directly doesn't 
appear in Section 53.  Why don't we just -- why shouldn't 
the instruction just say, "such negligence of the 
plaintiff contributed to cause his injury."  It's not 
going to be a complete bar because we know the 
immediate -- the next instruction talks about reducing 
the award by the amount of the negligence.  Why wouldn't 
that be preferable to introducing extraneous terms?

 MS. PERRY:  Because Section 53 refers to 

contributory negligence that created a bar.  And that was 
the type of negligence that required proximate cause. 
Moreover, the type of instruction you are positing is not 
at all what petitioner requested in this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, no, but he requested 

that the instructions be the same, and the directly is 
what causes the problem, and directly doesn't appear in 
the statute.

 MS. PERRY:  But under Missouri procedures, you 

have to be clear in the nature of your objection, and the 
objection was that we want the same language, we want the 
language resulting in whole or in part. 

And out of respect for the State courts and their 

right to create the rules that govern in those courts, 
that was not satisfactory under Missouri rules.  Missouri 
rules also have specific requirements for what you have

to do in the court of appeals.  There's a "Point Relied 
On" which is the argument heading in the brief, and it's 
required by Rule 84.04.  And it sets forth a very 
specific format, and it's supposed to start with "The 
trial court erred in," and then you give your reasons. 

And it says that negligence -- it erred in 

instructing the jury to find plaintiff negligent only if 
it concluded that his negligence directly contributed to 
cause his injury, rather than cause his injury in whole 
or in part. 

You know, there is no issue that was preserved in 

the Missouri courts other than that challenge.  Cook 
versus Caldwell which we cite in our brief, in Missouri, 
not only do you have to object, but you have to keep 
consistent with the basis of the objection.  You can't 
just object to instruction 13 on one ground, go up to the 
court of appeals, and raise a completely different 
challenge to instruction 13.  You have to stay 
consistent.  And out of respect --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you think they raised 

an objection based on the doctrine of equivalence?

 MS. PERRY:  That was a justification for rewriting 

instruction 13 to include the words "resulting in whole 
or in part."  I do not think they raised an abstract 
argument about equivalency; that in order to do that,

they would have had to object to instruction 12 and 
instruction 13, because equivalency in the abstract would 
require modification of both instructions, and they 
clearly chose to accept the language of instruction 12 
and only object to instruction 13. 

So no, not in the abstract, it hasn't been raised. 

It was a justification for one particular result, and 
that was a result that would have modified instruction 
13.  And in a particular way, too, modified it in a way 
of including the words "resulting in whole or in part."
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I guess they want to make the 

argument now, whether they did or not, that if we look at 
Section 53, which I think is the part dealing with 
contributory negligence.  I don't see anything else.  It 
doesn't speak of causation at all.

 MS. PERRY:  Exactly, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  It just says if there's some 

contributory negligence, the damages will be diminished 
according to the negligence attributable to the employee. 

So I take it their argument was, maybe with 
hindsight, Judge, don't give this direct language, 
because nothing requires it.  And since, other things 
being equal, nothing requires it, you ought to give the 
same language you gave for the other side. 

And they said the judge rejected that argument, so

now they tell us, well, that was wrong, he should have 
accepted it.  And all the rest of what he's saying is 
just in case the Court wants to reach it, or something 
like that.  But what about that one?

 MS. PERRY:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  Could you --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I mean, should we answer 

the question he now -- perhaps in his minimalist 
position -- might want to raise, or maybe did, that 
Section 53 doesn't speak of causation, the judge gave a 
causation instruction.  The judge's causation instruction 
in their view was wrong, and the law requires the judge's 
causation instruction on contributory negligence, if 
there is one, to be the same as it was on direct, the 
defendant's negligence.  And he says that isn't what 
happened, we objected to it, we produced arguments, one 
of them was this equivalence thing.

 So he's saying to us:  Decide it, say that they 

were wrong.  What's your view of that?

 MS. PERRY:  We disagree with petitioner.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not surprised. 
(Laughter.)
 MS. PERRY:  The abstract question of equivalency

JUSTICE BREYER:  It was not, but they say, 

nonetheless, we did object that this instruction was 
wrong.  One reason it was wrong is because it speaks of 
causation differently than when they spoke of causation 
in respect to the railroad.  We thought that was a reason 
why it was wrong then.  We think that's a reason why it 
is wrong now, and we would like the Missouri court, but 
they wouldn't do it, so we want you to say it was wrong 
for that reason.

 MS. PERRY:  Well, I think we're in a difficult 

position right now, because they're asking for proximate 
cause in their blue brief --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, we say, well, we'll abandon 

all that, that's just a series of different arguments 
that we'd like the Court to say.

 MS. PERRY:  Okay.  If we're putting aside the blue 

brief then --

JUSTICE BREYER:  If you read it carefully, you'll 

see it, basically. 
(Laughter.)
 MS. PERRY:  But if the question goes to the fact 

that Section 53 doesn't have an express causation 
standard in it, what you fall back on is traditional 
proximate cause, that Congress departed from the 
traditional proximate cause standard by using the words

"resulting in whole or in part" in Section 51.  It didn't 
create the same departure in Section 53. 

In fact, by referring to the kind of contributory 

negligence that creates a bar, it was pretty much 
pointing right back to proximate cause.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can you have more than one 

proximate cause?

 MS. PERRY:  I believe the treatises that say yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course.  So then how can "in 
whole or in part" possibly eliminate the proximate cause 
requirement, because it could be in part and still be a 
proximate cause.  How can that language possibly be 
interpreted to eliminate the proximate cause requirement?

 MS. PERRY:  Because when a cause that -- when a 

slightest cause can give rise to liability, that has 
effectively reduced or relaxed that causation standard. 
There is still a legal cause requirement, yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But it could be the slightest 

direct cause, which is Justice Scalia's point.

 MS. PERRY:  Well, but if we look at like the first 

--

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Now, it may mislead the jury if 

that's all you say.  But as a matter of analyzing the 
statute or even of analyzing what the Court meant in 
Rogers, you can have a slight but direct cause, and that

would be proximate cause in the traditional analysis; 
isn't that so?

 MS. PERRY:  Well, no.  The Restatement, for 

example, at the time of Rogers talked about substantial 
factors, and talked, in other words --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How can you say no when you 

acknowledge that the prior law when there was 
contributory negligence used to require proximate cause 
for both the negligence of the defendant and for the 
contributory negligence of the defendant?  Such a 
situation could not exist unless proximate cause doesn't 
have to be the sole cause.  It can be just the cause in 
part, right?

 MS. PERRY:  Right.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the mere fact that we had 
contributory negligence statutes that were applying 
proximate cause requirements demonstrates that a 
proximate cause can be a cause in part.

 MS. PERRY:  Yes, Your Honor, but what Rogers and 

the statute recognizes that it can be a very, very slight 
cause.  And what it was understood, for example, in the 
--

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's what Rogers might 

have said, but the statute doesn't say anything about 
slight cause.  It only says in whole or in part.

MS. PERRY:  And neither did the instruction.  It 

just used the words "resulting in whole or in part" also. 
But Rogers did interpret the language "resulting in whole 
or in part" as meaning playing any part, even the 
slightest.  And that has been the law for 50 years.  And 
it would be a massive change in the law, as Justice 
Scalia said earlier, for this Court to depart from that 
at this point in time.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't seem to me that slight 

is the opposite of proximate.  It could be a slight 
proximate cause.

 MS. PERRY:  The Restatement at the time of Rogers 
talked about substantial factors, and in the comment to 
that, it explains that sometimes the other causes can be 
so predominant that one causation is just not 
sufficiently significant or of sufficient quantum to 
constitute a legal cause. 

So there is a component of quantity within the 

concepts of proximate cause.  I believe their reply brief 
talks about substantial factor, and to talk about 
something as being a substantial factor does have a 
quantum component to it, just as slight has a quantum 
component to it.  A slight cause could not be a 
substantial factor, or oftentimes would not be a 
substantial factor.  So the two really do go hand in

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But under the old rule that 

plaintiff's negligence in whatever degree was an absolute 
bar to recovery, wasn't the rule customarily stated that 
plaintiff's negligence, however slight, was a total bar 
to recovery?

 MS. PERRY:  I'm not aware of that, Your Honor.  It 

may be.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I thought it was.  I may be wrong 

about that.

 MS. PERRY:  I am not aware of that.  So that would 

be a pretty harsh remedy if that were the case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  That's what I thought.  Yes, I 

thought it was a pretty harsh rule.

 MS. PERRY:  And clearly, Congress in this statute 

was trying to move away from the common law in many 
respects to protect the railroad worker.  And the 
interpretation of Section 51 as lightening the causation 
standard for the defendant's negligence, but leaving 
intact the traditional proximate cause standard for 
plaintiff's contributory negligence completely comports 
with the purpose of Congress in enacting the statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why isn't "in whole or in 

part" simply the logical corollary of introducing 
comparative negligence?  Why do you have to read that as

departing from proximate cause, instead of simply 
recognizing that under 53, negligence on the part of the 
employee can reduce recovery which -- without barring it?
 MS. PERRY:  I reach that conclusion on the basis 

of Rogers.  And in the petitioner's brief --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Beyond that, if the plaintiff's 
negligence was in whole the cause of the action, then the 
-- there was no reason to get to comparative negligence 
or contributory negligence, because by hypothesis, there 
would have been no negligence by the defendant.

 MS. PERRY:  Yes, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's why you don't have 
"in whole or in part" in 53, not because they wanted to 
depart from proximate cause there, but because, as 
Justice Stevens pointed out, you wouldn't have it in 
whole or in part.

 MS. PERRY:  Even the petitioner's brief describes 

the language "resulting in whole or in part" as an 
elaboration of proximate cause.  They recognize that it 
has bearing on proximate cause.  And so if it has bearing 
on proximate cause in Section 51, it certainly would have 
bearing on proximate cause if it was incorporated into 
the language of the instruction on contributory 
negligence. 

So that may be one reason for not including the

language, but another reason is that it does affect the 
causation standard and Congress did not incorporate it in 
Section 53, whereas it did have it in Section 51.  And 
when it modified the statute in 1939 for assumption of 
the risk, to abolish assumption of the risk, it did not 
equate proximate cause and "resulting in whole or in 
part" necessarily as the same thing because one version 
had proximate cause and it was not adopted.  The phrase 
"resulting in whole or in part" was used in its place. 
So suggesting that Congress may, in fact, have 

seen a difference, just as Rogers concluded, and I think 
rightly so. 

Moreover, as I said, that has been the law for 50 

years, and it's pretty settled in this country and it 
would create a massive change if this Court were to 
depart from that.  Moreover, this is not the right case 
to decide that because the language in instruction 12 
said, "resulting in whole or in part."  And petitioner 
has never --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It is not the kind of change 

anybody would have relied on, is it?  I mean, I find it 
hard to see reliance interest on this interpretation.

 MS. PERRY:  Excuse me, Your Honor?
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I find it hard to see any 

reliance interest on this 50 year old interpretation.

Is there anybody doing something differently because they 
believe that the railroad does not have to be accused of 
proximate causality?  Does anybody act differently 
because of that rule?  I don't think so.

 MS. PERRY:  Well, for Mr. Sorrell in particular, I 

mean, he acted, that he allowed that instruction to be 
used, and now they're attempting to disrupt this 
judgment.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I suppose employees have been 

under the rule for a long time.

 MS. PERRY:  Yes.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I suppose employee associations, 
workman compensation schemes and Congress have all relied 
on it.

 MS. PERRY:  Yes, you're absolutely right, Your 

Honor.  And there is employees' compensation for railroad 
workers, and that may be very well be because of this 
interpretation of Rogers that was adopted 50 years ago.

like to address just sort of two issues.  One is the 
minimalist issue that Justice Breyer asked about.  It 
seems to me that the minimalist way to look at this case 
is we raised the question of whether or not the Missouri 
standard which says that you cannot deviate from our 
designated instructions creates a disparity in the way 
you approach negligence and contributory negligence, that 
disparity is inconsistent with the common law doctrines, 
and nothing in FELA modifies it, and it's wrong.  And 
that by itself warrants the case being set aside and a 
new jury being -- and a new trial.  That's the simplest 
way to resolve the issue. 

If the Court wishes to go forward and deal with 

the issue that Justice Souter addressed, then the 
question is, what does Rogers mean and what do you do 
with this "in whole or in part" language.  And if you go 
back -- you asked the question, Justice Souter, you know, 
what does the common law say.  We cite this on page 38. 
If its negligence contributes proximately to the injury, 
no matter how slightly -- there must be a dozen cases 
that we cite in those briefs that talk about no matter 
how slightly.  And they refer to "in whole or in part" as 
language that still recognizes that you still require 
proximate causation. 

The reality is nothing in Rogers remotely casts

doubt on cases like Brady that say but-for causation is 
not enough, you have to have proximate causation, or 
Earnest, where this Court said that proximate causation 
is the correct jury instruction that has to be given. 
This Court said nothing about that in Rogers.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would you have in your ideal 

instruction the words proximate cause given to the jury, 
that defendant's negligence must be the proximate cause 
of plaintiff's injury?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  No, Justice Ginsburg.  We didn't 

ask for that.  All I'm saying to you --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would you?
 MR. PHILLIPS:  -- is that the guidance of the 
Court on remand, you could, and we would ask you to 
address that issue and to resolve it.  It is fairly in 
front of you.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in your model instruction, 
in your correct instruction, would the jury be told, in 
order to hold the defendant liable, you must find the 
defendant's negligence is the proximate cause of 
plaintiff's injury?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  That would be my preferred 

instruction on remand, yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even though almost universally, 

the term proximate cause has been criticized as totally

Official 

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me ask this one very brief 

question, Mr. Chief Justice. 

In your view, would the doctrine of equivalence be 
satisfied if we simply directed that the word directly be 
omitted from the instruction 13?

 MR. PHILLIPS:  I think that would certainly go a 
long way.  I don't know exactly how strictly you want to 
do it, but sure.  I mean, that's the pivotal problem with 
the way that instruction reads today, Justice Stevens.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Phillips. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 2:01 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
