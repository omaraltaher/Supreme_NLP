          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument

now in No. 02-1080, the General Dynamics Land Systems,

Inc. v. Dennis Cline.

          Mr. Verrilli.

            ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI

                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

          MR. VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

          The very essence of age discrimination is the

disparate treatment of older workers based on the false

assumption that productivity and competence decline with

old age.  The Age Discrimination in Employment Act

protects workers 40 and older from that kind of disparate

treatment.  It should not be stretched to cover claims by

workers 40 and older that they have been treated

disparately on the basis of their comparative youth.

          QUESTION: Well, Mr. Verrilli, it - perhaps you

can say that the language in the statute, because of an

individual age - individual's age - is somehow ambiguous. 

But to what extent do we have to give some deference to

the agency position on the thing?  Because the Government

is here taking a position contrary to yours based on

agency interpretation.

          MR. VERRILLI: They - they are, Justice O'Connor. 

That interpretation deserves no deference for three

reasons, which I'd like to summarize and then first

elaborate on.  The first is that, under Chevron, the

question - the question of deference is not dependent on

whether there's a definitional ambiguity in the - in the

specific operative language, in this case of Section

623(a), but on what the - what that language means as read

in the context of the Act.  And Chevron says, using all of

the traditional tools of statutory construction, and

applying that test we submit, as - as I hope to elaborate

this morning, one cannot come to the conclusion that there

- there - that this statute can be fairly read to

authorize the kinds of youth discrimination claims that

are at issue here.

          The second reason, however, is that even if

there were - even if there were ambiguity in general,

which we submit there is not, under the holding, the

express holding in Mead, the - the EEOC's regulation here

is not entitled to Chevron deference, and the reason for

it is this, and this is at page 227 of the Mead opinion in

533 U.S.  The very sentence that states the holding in

Mead says, a regulation is entitled to Chevron deference

if it is - if it is promulgated in the - if the agency has

been given by Congress the authority to promulgate rules

with the force of law, and we acknowledge that is true

here.

          But the second half of the test - this is in the

statement of the holding in Mead - is that the rule has to

be promulgated in an exercise of that authority, and the

regulation that the EEOC is here defending today was not a

- a rule that was given the force of law by the agency. 

In fact, the agency made - the Department of Labor, when

it initially promulgated this regulation, made a

deliberate decision not to promulgate it as a rule with

the force of law, but instead to promulgate it solely as

guidance to the public about its - about its enforcement

authority and it was -

          QUESTION: How - how do we know that?

          MR. VERRILLI: Because that is what the

Department of Labor said in the Federal Register when it

promulgated this.

          QUESTION: What - what - what did it say

specifically?

          MR. VERRILLI: It said, we are promulgating this

as a matter of enforcement guidelines for the - guidance -

 so the public knows how we intend to enforce the - the -

 the statute.  It did not promulgate a rule of law.  And

then when it was re-promulgated by the EEOC in 1981 - and

again, the cites for this are on page 17 of our reply

brief - when it was re-promulgated by the EEOC in 1981,

the EEOC made a deliberate choice, which it explained in

the Federal Register, not to have this be a substantive

rule with the force of law, and in fact it did not comply

with, and stated it was not going to comply with, the 30-

day notice period that is required for substantive rules

of law so that -

          QUESTION: Well, if we could call this an

enforcement position or an enforcement policy on the part

of the agency, and you're going to probably say we can't -

 shouldn't call it that - but if we could, doesn't the

Government get some deference?  You say it gets no

deference at all?

          MR. VERRILLI: If - well, it would get Skidmore

deference, Justice Kennedy, and I think Christensen

specifically says that, that it gets Skidmore deference if

it's an enforcement guideline and not - and not a - a rule

of law - substantive rule of law.  But here, Skidmore -

applying Skidmore, no deference is due to this regulation

principally because it is a regulation that the - that has

not been enforced in anything like a consistent manner. 

To the contrary -

          QUESTION: That - that's a different issue, but

let's - let's come back to the point of whether it is

promulgated as an interpretive regulation or a substantive

regulation.  You are taking the position that only

substantive regulations are entitled to Chevron deference?

          MR. VERRILLI: The - the holding in Mead, Justice

Scalia -

          QUESTION: Only - only - only substantive

regulations?  Mead does not say that.

          MR. VERRILLI: The - the holding in - the

sentence that's in Mead that says -

          QUESTION: All of the regulations of the SEC, for

example, virtually all of them are interpretive

regulations.

          MR. VERRILLI: The question under Mead is whether

it was a regulation that was promulgated that - that has

the force of law, and they -

          QUESTION: No, but your - your - point is -

          QUESTION: That does not equate with

interpretive.

          MR. VERRILLI: Not necessarily.  But here they

made a deliberate decision that it wasn't going to have

the force of law and they, for example, in 1981 -

          QUESTION: No, they didn't.  They - they

promulgated it, on page 17 of your brief, as an

interpretation rather than a substantive regulation, and

that's what it is.

          MR. VERRILLI: Right, right, Justice Scalia.  But

they did not comply with the 30-day notice period, which

is required -

          QUESTION: You don't have to for - for

interpretive regulations.

          MR. VERRILLI: But for rules with the force of

law you do.

          QUESTION: For substantive regulations you have

to.  You do not have to for interpretive regulations, but

that does not mean that an interpretive regulation does

not - is not entitled to Chevron deference and is not

fully as - as effective as - as laying down the rule of

law as a substantive regulation.  That's never been the -

 the rule. 

          MR. VERRILLI: The question here is whether the

agency intended this to be a rule of law or - or guidance

of its own enforcement authority, and it - and it clearly

intended the latter and it has acted in a manner

consistent with the fact that it's the latter and not the

former, because it routinely refuses to enforce the

principle that the Government is here advocating today. 

Indeed, in every single instance in which this issue has

come before the Department of Labor and the Equal

Opportunity - and the EEOC - since the mid-1970's, in

every single instance the - the Department of Labor or the

EEOC has blessed a - an employment practice that provides

comparatively older workers with a benefit not available

to workers - to all workers 40 and older so -

          QUESTION: Mr. - Mr. Verrilli, I - I will assume

you're - you're right on the - the application of Mead

here, so far as the reg goes.  What about the - I think it

was the 1997 adjudication?

          MR. VERRILLI: The 1997 adjudication, it seems to

me, is not something that can give rise to Chevron

deference, because that - they were just acting pursuant

to their own view of what the - of - of what their - what

the statute -

          QUESTION: Wasn't it binding - wasn't it binding

on the parties before them?

          MR. VERRILLI: It was binding on the parties,

Justice Souter, but, of course, even if - if the Court

were to conclude that under Mead you get Chevron

deference, and I don't think you can for that reason, you

still have the problem, in our view, which is the more

fundamental problem, which I'd like to address, which is

that -

          QUESTION: Before you leave me, can I just read

you two sentences from Mead?  First sentence says, it is

fair to assume generally that Congress - that Congress

contemplates administrative action with the effect of the

law when it provides for a relatively formal

administrative procedure, which you say doesn't exist

here.  Next sentence, that said, and as significant as

notice and comment is in pointing to Chevron authority,

the want of that procedure here does not decide the case

for we have sometimes found reasons for Chevron deference

even when no such administrative formality was required

and none was afforded.  

          So, as I read that last sentence, I certainly

thought that if Congress so intends, we should give

Chevron deference to a rule that has not complied even

with notice and comment.

          MR. VERRILLI: Yes -

          QUESTION: So I couldn't read Mead as saying you

have to have that or you don't get the deference.

          MR. VERRILLI: But I think the fundamental point

for us under Mead, and then I'd like to move back to the

main - the Chevron analysis, if I could, but the

fundamental point for us under Mead, Justice Breyer, is

that the agency made a deliberate decision here not to

have this rule be one that was a binding rule -

          QUESTION: Well, I - I don't know how often an

agency says what this agency said here, that we are

promulgating this as an indication of how we intend to

enforce the law.  And you're saying there is a chasm

between rules that are issued with that kind of a

statement and rules that are issued otherwise.  The agency

says, in one case, this is the law, and in the other case,

this is how we interpret the law.  I - I don't see that

that makes the difference.

          MR. VERRILLI: I don't see how the agency could,

Justice Scalia, think that this had the force of law,

because they didn't follow it themselves in the manifold

in this decision of which the issue -

          QUESTION: Well, that's - that's a different

point.  That's a different point.

          QUESTION: Well, isn't - isn't that your - isn't

that your stronger point that - that combined with the -

the relatively abbreviated procedure, they have, in fact,

in a number of instances not followed it and they have

never affirmatively, as - as a - as an administrative

movement, they have never affirmatively enforced it. 

Isn't - isn't -

          MR. VERRILLI: That's - that's all correct and we

- I think that does summarize our point more strongly.

          QUESTION: Which I think goes to the Chevron

point.

          MR. VERRILLI: Going - I agree with that, Justice

Souter - but going back to the main question of whether

you even get to ambiguity under Chevron, we submit that

the answer to that question is no, because Section 623(a)

is not to be read in isolation.  The fundamental principle

of statutory construction is that it needs to be read in

context, and the relative contextual indicators here, we

submit, foreclose the argument that Congress intended in

the ADEA to authorize the kind of youth discrimination

claims that are at issue here.

          QUESTION: Why, Mr. Verrilli, when we have - what

is it - 623(f)(2)(B) - that makes an express provision for

older worker versus younger worker.  If that were the

general interpretation of the statute, then this specific

provision relating to an older worker vis-a-vis a younger

worker would be unnecessary.

          MR. VERRILLI: I respectfully disagree with that,

Justice Ginsburg, and - and - I'm - I'm looking now at

page 3a of the statutory appendix to the Government's

brief where the - where provision is located.  (B)(i) is

in the statute, as the preamble to the Older Worker

Benefit Protection Act states, to - to provide employers

with an affirmative defense to a charge that they have

discriminated against comparatively older workers by

providing them benefits at a lower level than

comparatively younger workers.

          And what - what (B)(i) says, which I take it is

the provision Your Honor is referring to, is that, in that

situation, even though the comparatively older worker is

being disfavored, the comparatively older worker has an

affirmative defense, if the older worker can - if the

employer can show that the - that it spent as least as

much on the benefit for the older worker as it did for the

younger worker, even if the benefit is less, and so that -

          QUESTION: Well, does that provision cover your

situation, do you think, here?

          MR. VERRILLI: We - we -

          QUESTION: I mean, could you fit yourself, your

client's situation, under that provision?

          MR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice O'Connor.  We can

shoehorn ourselves into that provision.

          QUESTION: And why - is that still pending in the

court below, that argument?

          MR. VERRILLI: It is - it is still pending in the

court below.  That's correct, Your Honor.

          QUESTION: So, no matter what we do, you would

take the position that that provision will cover this

case?

          MR. VERRILLI: We do think so, Your Honor.  Of

course, the respondents won't agree with that, I'm quite

sure, and I - and I don't think that that's going to solve

the many problems that the Sixth Circuit's decision gave

rise to here.  For example -

          QUESTION: Well, that - that's my next point. 

The - the briefs try to tell us that there's going to be 

cataclysmic consequences if we don't rule your way.  This

safe harbor provision gives very substantial protection

against that, does it not, or - or does it?

          MR. VERRILLI: Yeah - let - if I - I think it

gives some protection, not complete protection, but I

think there are a whole range of other negative

consequences, Your Honor, that I'd like to address, if I

could, and then - and I will certainly directly address

the safe harbor provision. 

          First, there are a number of employment

practices out there where the nation's major employers

have engaged in efforts to retain older segments of the

workforce and to bring back elderly citizens back into the

workforce by doing such things as providing for workers

over a certain threshold age, very often 55, the ability

to work part-time rather than full-time, to have flex-

time schedules, to have - to have jobs that don't involve

travel.  They've changed the terms, conditions, and

privileges of employment for people over a certain age to

keep them in the workforce.

          The safe harbor here applies only to benefits,

Justice Kennedy, and therefore, would not protect that

kind of behavior, and although the United States talks

about the safe harbor with respect to benefits, I would

point out the brief of the United States is notably silent

on the question of whether the interpretation being

advocated here would make illegal that kind of conduct. 

And we submit it would because it clearly prefers the

comparatively older to the comparatively younger with

respect to terms, conditions, and privileges of

employment, so -

          QUESTION: Has the EEOC taken an enforcement

position with reference to some of the practices you've

just -

          MR. VERRILLI: Yeah.

          QUESTION: - or - or non-enforcement positions?

          MR. VERRILLI: Yes, yes, they have.  There are

DOL and EEOC letters which approve those practices, but

it's hard to see how one could possibly approve those

practices consistent with an interpretation of Section

623(a) that imposed a rigid rule of equality for everyone

40 and over.

          QUESTION: One of the amicus briefs pointed to a

number of Internal Revenue Code provisions and ERISA

provisions that appear to be implicated if you go with the

Sixth Circuit view here, and perhaps would be in

opposition to the interpretation, given the language -

          MR. VERRILLI: Yes -

          QUESTION: - by the Sixth Circuit.  Now, have you

commented on those various provisions?

          MR. VERRILLI: We have, Justice O'Connor, and

this is actually the second category of adverse effect, it

seems to me, that you have if the - if this decision

stands and if the rule of law is what the - what the

Government advocates.  Many of those provisions, which are

detailed quite effectively in the ERISA Committee brief,

provide for - for things such as employees with - employee

stock option plans, ESOP plans, are allowed, once they

become 55 years old, to diversify their stock holdings. 

Employees, when they retire at 59-1/2 can withdraw money

from their retirement plans without facing the tax

penalty.  There are a host of provisions like that.

          One point to be made is that it seems to me

irreconcilable with the existence of those provisions to

interpret 623(a) this way, but the other point my - my

friends the respondents say, yeah, but you don't have to

worry about that because the rule that the later-enacted

statute governs over the former-enacted statute will take

care of it.  I'm afraid that's not so for the following

reason.  All of the examples I just gave, and many others

in the - in the ERISA Committee brief, were statutes that

Congress enacted before 1990, and I submit that 1990 is

the relevant date for the later-enacted statute, because

it has - has - that's the - the Older Worker Benefit

Protection Act was passed after Betts and it was passed in

1990, and it was that statute that made the ADEA

applicable for the first time to fringe benefits of the

kind that those regulations govern.

          So you have a serious problem, at a very

minimum, with respect to all of those regulations, it

seems to me -

          QUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, what do you do with

Section 623(e), which prohibits any advertising by an

employer indicating any preference, limitation,

specification, or discrimination based on age?  Now, age

there could not possibly mean what you say it means in

623(a), that is, old age, because then it would just

prohibit preferring older people.  So what do you say it

means then?

          MR. VERRILLI: Well, I say -

          QUESTION: It means young -

          MR. VERRILLI: I - I -

          QUESTION: In (a) it means old age and in (e) it

means young age?

          MR. VERRILLI: I have a lot to say about it,

Justice Scalia.  The first thing is this: The critique

that the Government levels at us with respect to that

provision is equally applicable to their interpretation.

What they say is that, you know, if it were lawful under

the statute to grant a preference for old age - it doesn't

make any sense to say that's it not lawful to advertise

for old age - of course, what - if - if age means

chronological age here, then you wouldn't be able to state

a preference for chronological age in an advertisement,

even though it would be perfectly lawful substantively to

have a policy that said you're going to open positions to

only people 40 or older.

          So I don't think they get any mileage out of

that - out of that, because I think they've got the same

kind of linguistic difficulty that we have here with

respect to it.  And I think what that shows, Justice

Scalia, is -

          QUESTION: No, but it - it still has some meaning

and some beneficial effect with their interpretation,

whereas with your interpretation of age, it has no

conceivable beneficial effect.  You have to read it there

as meaning young age and you read it in (a) as meaning old

age.

          MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think you could read it as

meaning old age, but I think the truth of the matter is

that the word age is something of a chameleon.  It's a

word that is very sensitive to context and it's going to

have somewhat different connotations throughout this

statute, and I think it's quite clear that it does.  It's

a different connotation, for example, in Section B of the

statement of findings and purposes, where it's quite clear

that Congress is not talking about chronological age.  It

has a different connotation in the seniority provision,

which you can find at page 3a of the Government's

statutory appendix, which talks about involuntary

retirement, down near the bottom of the page, that an

employer's plan cannot require the involuntary retirement

of any individual specified by subsection 631 of this

title because of the age of such individual.

          Now, in a sense, that means chronological age,

but not in the sense that my friends on the other side say

about 623(a), because what it means really is once you've

become old enough that you've bumped up against the age

limit, and there are other provisions in 623 in which age

functions in exactly that way.  I just don't think - I

think this really is a case like Robinson against Shell

Oil, where the word employee takes on different

connotations in different sections, like - like Scheidler,

where the word enterprise in the various subsections of

RICO takes on different connotations depending on exactly

how it's being used.  I think the word age here takes on

different connotations in different sections in the

statute.

          QUESTION: You must have thought of this and

tried it out.  It doesn't work, but as I was reading it I

thought perhaps individual might refer to older

individual.

          MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think - I -

          QUESTION: If - I mean, but that must not, but

I'm sure - why didn't it work?  Because if you - if you -

 if you have - if you read individual throughout - cite

(1)(a)(i) is older individual.  The only place it has bite

is where you get to the end, because of such older

individuals -

          MR. VERRILLI: I think - we've thought about it

in this sense, Justice Breyer, and I think it dovetails

what I - what I think is our key contextual point, which

is that statute only protects people 40 and older, and if

what Congress was concerned about was a rule that

precluded arbitrary discrimination in favor of the

comparatively old as well as the comparatively young, it's

an exceedingly strange thing to do to draw a line at age

40, because, of course, people under 40 are much more

likely to be subject to discrimination on the ground that

they're comparatively too young than are people over 40.

          QUESTION: I - I thought it was a big deal when

you had your 40th birthday, I mean -

          (Laughter.)

          QUESTION: But is it - 

          MR. VERRILLI: But in any -

          QUESTION: - isn't the - isn't the answer to - to

the - to the argument that you've just made is that as -

as a general proposition, anything that in effect

interrupts or skews employment for somebody over the age

of 40 is very difficult for somebody over the age of 40 to

deal with, regardless of which way the discrimination is

working?  That is not as a general rule true of younger

people, and that's why it would make sense for - for the -

for the interpretation that - that was being suggested, to

draw the line at 40.

          MR. VERRILLI: I - I think - I think that's the -

 the best statement of the argument on the other side and

I think it's the Government's effort to defend the line on

that basis, but I don't think it works, because the reason

that people 40 and over have a problem once they suffer an

adverse employment action - and the Government itself

acknowledges this in its argument - is because they are

then subject to discrimination on the ground that they

perceive - they are perceived as being too old.  That's

the problem, and that's the only problem the Government

has been able to identify that people 40 and over suffer

is that kind of -

          QUESTION: Well, the 41-year-olds are perceived

as being too old in relation to people less than 41, and

it still means that when somebody looks at a 41-year-old,

they - the 41-year-old is just not as attractive an

employee as somebody, you know, a year - a year younger or

two years younger.

          MR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice Souter.  I think

that's true, but - but 623(a) isn't an all-purpose

prohibition of arbitrary employment decisions respecting

people 40 and over, and after all, that same kind of

critique could be made of - if an employee is fired

because they're not fit enough or they have the wrong

color hair or -

          QUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, it does - what Justice

Souter suggested does fit with the comment of Senator

Yarborough that was put out, that said that the 42-year-

old would have a claim if the 52-year-old were preferred,

say, for hiring or promotion.

          MR. VERRILLI: It - it does.  That's the only

thing in the voluminous history of this - of this

enactment and all of its amendments that provides any

support for the Government's view here in response, but it

- and it - but it does provide some support for that, I

agree.  But I really think -

          QUESTION: The - the part of your explanation

about the - the diminished hurt to the 40-year-old was

within the - was within the universe of society as a

whole, but within the context of his own or her own

company, this is hurtful.  These are people at that age

who have younger children being educated and so forth, and

if they find discrimination within their company, it

doesn't help much for you to say, well, society as a whole

doesn't discriminate against.

          MR. VERRILLI: I think - I think, Justice

Kennedy, that it's - it's important to go back to the

source for this statute to understand what Congress was

trying to do, the circumstances of enactment of this

statute.  After all, Congress could have, either in 1964,

when it passed Title VII, or in 1967, when it enacted this

statute, simply have put the word age into Title VII and

had it operate in exactly the same manner Title VII does. 

But it made a deliberate choice not to do that.

          The reason it did, I submit, is because the

recommendations of the Secretary of Labor in response to

the directive of Congress were that the problem of age

discrimination in the workplace is fundamentally different

than the problem of - than the problems that were

addressed by Title VII.  And the critical difference is

this, that the - the kinds of discrimination that Title

VII addressed was discrimination on the basis of

characteristics that are always irrelevant to a decision

about who should be hired, fired, or promoted, or demoted. 

And what the Secretary of Labor said is that age is

different, the age is not always irrelevant, age

distinctions are not always arbitrary, and I submit the

Court - the opinion for the Court in Betts identified

exactly that principle, that this is a different kind of

problem warranting a different kind of solution.

          The problem was that there are stereotypes that

exist that - that - on which employers act that - that

prospective employees are - don't have the competence or

the productivity to handle a job because they are too old,

and that was the problem that this statute tried to

address and it's why it tried to address it in such a

fundamentally different manner than Title VII.  Context

makes all the difference here.  Again, and - and I think

the Court really did recognize that in Betts.  Justice

Kennedy, in Betts, you had the operative language

privileges - terms, conditions, and privileges of

employment, identical in Title VII to - and the ADEA.

          But what the Court concluded in Betts was that

that language had a different meaning.  In Title VII it

included fringe benefits.  In the ADEA it did not include

fringe benefits, and the reason for that was because

reading the provision not in isolation, but in the context

of the rest of the statute, it was quite clear that Title

- that the ADEA was meant to address a different kind of

problem, and that there was age-based decision-making that

was appropriate and not invidious and that ought not to be

prohibited by law.  And I submit that the kind of age-

based decision-making that's at issue in this case is

precisely the kind of age-based decision-making that

Congress did not want to make unlawful.

          And the reason for this is quite - is quite

simply that people at the end of their working lives are

in a different position, especially with respect to

retirement security measure, which is what at issue - is

at issue here, even than a 41-year-old, someone else in

the protected class.  And so when an employer acts, as

General Dynamics did here, with the union, to come up with

a solution that protected them from a harsh outcome and

protected their reliance interests, it's simply not

anything remotely within the contemplation of Congress

when it - when it - in the prohibitory - prohibitory

sections of the ADEA.  If the Court -

          QUESTION: Do we know the numbers, Mr. Verrilli? 

We have, I think, some 200 people in the class that's

suing the 40 to 49-year-old.  How many were grandfathered

in the 50 -

          MR. VERRILLI: I - I believe it's - I believe

it's a comparable number, but I have to confess, Your

Honor, I don't know for sure what the exact number is.  If

the Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve

the balance of my time.

          QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Verrilli.

          Mr. Biggerman, we'll hear from you.

            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK W. BIGGERMAN

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court: 

          The real issue here is whether this Court should

add an additional element to the ADEA's prohibition

language.  And the answer, we submit, is no.  The ADEA

prohibits discrimination against individuals 40 years old

or older because of their age, not because of their older

age.  Petitioner would have this Court change that

language to require that individuals 40 and older also be

relatively older than any other group of employees with

whom they -

          QUESTION: Mr. Biggerman, how do you deal with

the relaxed physical tests for, say, 50 or over?   As Mr.

Verrilli mentioned, the flex-time, the reduced hours for

people who are well over 40 - 55, say, so that the - could

- could the 40 to 55 age group then sue because they have

to meet in full the physical fitness requirements, they

can't have the flex-time, they can't have the reduced

hours?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, those are encompassed

in affirmative defenses.  What we are asserting here is

simply whether the respondents have a cause of action.

          QUESTION: So is your answer yes, that would be

discrimination?  It might be a defense but it would be

prohibited discrimination under this Act to make those

special accommodations to older workers?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: That would be prohibited subject

to an affirmative defense.

          QUESTION: What would the affirmative defense be?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: For example, a bona fide

occupational qualification.

          QUESTION: Why in the world would that be a BFOQ? 

You don't have to be over 55 to do the job, quite the

contrary.  Special accommodations are being made so that

they're able to do the job.  It doesn't fit with any BFOQ

decision that I know.  It's a very extraordinary

applicational definition of BFOQ, bona fide occupation

qualification essential to the job.

          QUESTION: So what happens is that a piece of

legislation that everybody thought was meant to aid older

workers, especially those towards the end of their working

careers, ends up harming them.  You - you - you cannot

make special arrangements to let them do flex-time.  You

can't make these accommodations - a very strange

consequence of this legislation.

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, we - we - we submit

that Congress set forth specific examples as to when there

are exceptions that can be made.

          QUESTION: But do you have - the exceptions are

in the statute.  You gave me the BFOQ, I think it's quite

clear that that wouldn't work in this case.  What else

would be?  We have, as you said, this would be

discrimination.  How could the employer then defend

against it?  What is there in the statute that would give

the employer an affirmative defense?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, what would give the

employer an affirmative defense to have, as you said, a

more - to permit - if you could repeat the example?

          QUESTION: To make special accommodations to

older workers, no physical fitness test, shorter hours,

flex-time, and that's not available to people who are

under 55, say.

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Well, I - I think that - let me

expand a little on my answer.  I think that Congress' goal

here was to make age a neutral factor in employment.  Now,

I don't think that Congress intended to permit any special

considerations for age unless they're set forth in the

statute.

          QUESTION: But what about all the sections in

ERISA and in the Internal Revenue Code that allow various

provisions for benefit plans, for retirement, and for

stock option exercise and so forth that are going to be at

odds with your interpretation.

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor -

          QUESTION: I mean, there are a whole array of

laws that will be directly affected if the Sixth Circuit

view is affirmed.  Now, what do we do about all that?  Do

you think Congress really intended such a result?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: I don't think that the ADEA

conflicts with those provisions because a cause of action,

unlike in this case, 12(b)(6), this case should not have

been dismissed, it should have been allowed to go forward. 

And in the employer - in any situation which those

regulations or those statutory provisions under some other

law - IRS -

          QUESTION: One thing - I see that point - that

one thing that everybody, I think, is saying in one form

or another, is one thing that isn't covered in 2 is hiring

and firing people.  So every time an employer dismisses a

person over the age of 40, he will either be hit with a

lawsuit by the older one, or if he tries to lean over a

little backwards in favor of the older - and I don't want

to be too prejudiced in favor of the older though I am in

that category - the - the point is that every time he then

tries to be at all sympathetic to the older person, the

younger one hits him with a lawsuit.

          And so what the Federal courts become is an

employment court to discover in each instance whether

there was cause, and moreover, no employer could possibly

lean over even a little bit favorable towards an older

person, and that's why I think what we're saying is your -

 I would say it - your interpretation will blow up this

Act, destroy it.  An Act that was intended to help older

people will now suddenly become an Act which turns Federal

courts into labor courts, deciding in each case that

anything happens to a person over the age of 40, whether

the employer was or was not justified.  Now - now that is

- I'm putting it strongly, but I want to hear what I think

they're telling you on the other side, which is what I

thought I was articulating.

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, I would - I would

analogize that to this Court's decision in McDonald v.

Santa Fe, when, prior to that in McDonnell Douglas, this

Court said - set forth the first prima facie requirement

as requiring a minority under Title VI.  Yet in McDonald

can sue like in the Age Act.

          QUESTION: Well, that - that brings me back to

the answer you gave to Justice Ginsburg's question and it

was again reflected in Justice Breyer's.  Am I correct in

inferring from your answer - I don't think you said it

quite this way - that in Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical

regarding flex-time and - and no physical fitness test,

you would say that there is a violation there?  That's

what I carry away from your - from your answer to her, and

that directly relates to Justice Breyer's concern that he

just expressed.

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, I must - I must

humbly confess that I don't have a grasp of the entire

statute in every situation in every regulation.  I wish at

this moment I did.  But I would give you the general

answer, that Congress intended to make age neutral, and if

there were no exception, no exemption in the statute or no

regulation that provided an affirmative defense, then that

would be impermissible if it was based on age.

          QUESTION: Now, I - I have to tell you that -

that as currently advised, that seems to me so fanciful a

version of what Congress intended that I would not

interpret the statute that way.  Now, I will go along with

you if you can tell me that, with respect to this

ambiguous statute, I am bound by Chevron or Mead to - to

accord deference to the agency's interpretation.  Your -

your - the people on the other side say that there's no

such requirement.  Do you think there is a requirement

here?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, I definitely think

that deference is -

          QUESTION: What are you relying on?  The agency

guideline?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: 1625.2 of the interpretive

guideline.  Is that what you're referring to?

          QUESTION: Yes.

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Yes, which was also supported by

the agency adjudication in the 1997 adjudication, which

was confirmed by the entire commission, which is the only

-

          QUESTION: Do - do you agree with the description

of the other side that that was not promulgated by notice

and comment rule-making?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: It was my understanding that the

EEOC promulgated it by notice and comment.

          QUESTION: Yes, but they said that they did it

simply to go along with the Carter administration's

request or requirement that even interpretive rules be

promulgated by notice and comment rule-making even though

the ADA does not require that.  Now, that's what they

actually wrote in their brief, and is that accurate?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: It's - it's my understanding that

that is accurate.

          QUESTION: All right.  If that is accurate, why

would Congress have intended, and the relevant pages of

Mead use the word Congress in one paragraph five times to

try to figure out what Congress wanted in this respect,

why would Congress have wanted the courts to defer to this

kind of interpretive regulation, which if it's taken

seriously would destroy Congress' own ends?  That's a

pretty tough question.

          MR. BIGGERMAN: It is.

          QUESTION: I'm putting it - I'm overstating these

slightly because I want to elicit clear answers from you.

          MR. BIGGERMAN: I - I - it's not my belief that

this goes against Congress' intentions.  I think the

Congress set out to set forth specific exemptions,

including the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, in

which there are instances when older workers can be

favored, and so therefore I don't think it went against

Congress' intention.  I mean, the Older Workers Benefit

Protection Act set forth a whole bunch of additional

exemptions after this regulation was already in place.

          QUESTION: Mr. Biggerman, may I ask you two

questions?  The first question is, when was the statute

enacted?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: The ADEA?

          QUESTION: Yes.  I think the sponsor of the

statute, the Secretary of Labor, was a former law

professor of mine, so I think it goes back quite a ways.

          (Laughter.)

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, I - I think you're

right.

          QUESTION: Well, it's a good many years ago,

wasn't it?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: It was a good many years ago.

          QUESTION: And the second question is, what -

what is your comment on this sentence in the district

court's opinion: Every Federal court to address the issue

has held that a claim of reverse age discrimination is not

cognizable under ADA.  This suggests that there's a long

history of viewing the statute in one - one way and that

perhaps there are substantial reliance interests out there

that would build up over a period of many, many years. 

Would you comment on that aspect of the case?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: I - that statement by the

district court was incorrect.  The decision in the

Mississippi Light - Mississippi Power and Light decision

had been rendered before the district court's decision and

that was at least one decision that -

          QUESTION: When was that case decided?  Just

shortly before the district court's decision?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: No, Your Honor, it was a little

bit before that and I'm looking for the cite.

          QUESTION: Well, isn't it true though, as a

general matter, the courts had generally read the statute

the way the district court read it?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: As - as a - see, Your Honor,

Hamilton came out and then all of the district courts

followed the Seventh Circuit's decision in Hamilton

without really interpreting the ADEA.  They just simply

followed that.  So, yes, there is a body.  The majority of

the body did go in that direction, but simply relied on

the Hamilton -

          QUESTION: But do you think that the - the

business community has - was justified in relying on that

rule for a good many years?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: I don't think so, Your Honor.  I

think in light of the EEOC -

          QUESTION: You think the statute's so clear?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: The statute and the EEOC -

          QUESTION: The EEOC during all this period

continued to say that - that it worked both ways, didn't

it?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Not in its only binding opinion.

In its only binding opinion it followed the language of

1625.  The letters, the opinion letters by the Secretary -

 the Department of Labor - and the EEOC before, those

aren't binding.  The binding -

          QUESTION: Well, the question isn't whether

they're binding.  The question is whether the business

community could rely on them.  I mean, here are your -

your - you have this guideline out there, this regulation,

I would say, and incidentally I don't know why you accept

the proposition that interpretive regulations are somehow

different from substantive regulations insofar as their

authoritativeness is concerned, but you have the

regulation out there, but you have the agency saying to

the business community in an opinion letter, don't worry

about it, we're not going to enforce it that way, and

indeed we're going to amend the regulation.  Now, you

know, what - what - what am I to make about that as far as

Chevron deference is concerned?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, I would - I would ask

that you look at the top at the commission and what they

did in the binding opinion, and I think that is what is

entitled to Chevron deference.

          QUESTION: But the - the regulation itself seems

to have some internal tension, if not inconsistency,

because what you're relying on is what it says in

1625.2(a) and then (b) goes on to say, but the extension

of additional benefits, such as increased severance pay to

older employees within the protected group, may be lawful

when the employer has a reasonable basis to conclude that

those benefits will counteract problems related to age

discrimination.  That seems to be just a recognition that

the older you get, the more problems you have, and so if

you can - if this - this regulation says, yes, you can

give benefits.

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, again I would come

back to the - the statement that in order to fulfill the

requirements set forward in (b), a reasonable basis, you

need facts.  That's an affirmative defense, which we don't

have here.  That goes above and beyond a simple cause of

action.  The employer could use that as an affirmative

defense to defend its action.

          QUESTION: Not unless there's a law allowing it. 

I don't see one.  I mean, there is no provision unless you

shoehorn it under this (B)(i) section, that allows any out

for the employer, is there?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: I - I don't understand.

          QUESTION: For the employ - well, I'm taking up

your time.  You have only a few minutes left.  I just

don't see a provision allowing the affirmative defense.

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Am I to understand you, Justice

O'Connor, that you don't see a provision in the statute

that allows the same affirmative defense as in this

regulation?  That's correct.  This - this is outside, but

again, it's the EEOC interpreting the Act.  As we all

know, a statute doesn't cover every instance.  Does that

answer your question or would you like me to go -

          QUESTION: Go ahead.

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Okay.  I - I would just like to

say that the Age Discrimination Act, the prohibition

language says, because of age, and this Court has before,

in Consolidated Coin, ruled that the fact that one

individual loses out to another individual within the

protected class, it doesn't matter.  It's because - it's

whether the individual loses out because of age.  That -

that's the critical thing here.  The -

          QUESTION: The example that's given in the paper

is the - the 51-year-old and a 42-year-old are both

applying for a job and no matter which one gets it you

can't discriminate on account of age.  How could a

decision to employ the 51-year-old be a discrimination on

account of age?  What - what would be in the employer's

mind if it's an age-based decision?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, are you asking me for

an example as to why someone might want to hire -

          QUESTION: How - how could that - how could that,

within the meaning of the statute, be a discrimination on

account of age if they hired the older person?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Congress found that at age 40 and

over any discrimination on the basis of age injures the

individual.

          QUESTION: But the decision to hire the older

person, how could that be a - would it have to be just the

unique situation where the employer doesn't like 42-year-

olds?

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Well, it - there may be - the

employer may want a situation where they want the prestige

of having someone with gray hair as opposed to less gray

hair for a consultant position or for a television

anchorman. 

          QUESTION: Well, that wouldn't be discrimination

on the basis of age.  You just like gray-haired people. 

Some young people have gray hair.

          QUESTION:   They'd be just in favor of gray-

haired people, yeah.

          (Laughter.)

          MR. BIGGERMAN: But - but if - if they had a

requirement in their policy that it had to be only 51 or

older -

          QUESTION: Well, it's - 

          MR. BIGGERMAN: Right.

that an unfortunate thing to take into account in the law?

person around because it's the decent thing to do -

          MR. BIGGERMAN: But the statute -

          QUESTION: - and then the younger person comes in

and sues.

          MR. BIGGERMAN: The statute prohibits

discrimination on the basis of age.  It just simply sets

the protected class at 40 and over.  That's our argument. 

If there are no further questions.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

          MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

Discrimination in Employment Act prohibits discrimination

on the basis of age against members of the protected class

and is not limited to claims brought by the older members

of the class.

          QUESTION: Mr. Clement, now, Justice Ginsburg

gave some examples of employment practices that favor

older persons, for which I don't think there's an

affirmative defense.  Am I correct that there isn't?

          MR. CLEMENT: There's no affirmative defense in

the statute, Justice Stevens, and let me address those

hypotheticals, because I think these seemingly benevolent

instances of using age may be beguiling, but I think in

reality even those benevolent uses of age implicate the

interests and concerns of the Age Act.  Take, for example,

an employer who's willing to exempt employees over 50 from

a physical fitness test.  Well, the first question I would

ask is, if you're willing to exempt workers over 50 from

the physical fitness test, is the physical fitness test

really a legitimate occupational qualification?  And

should that be used to exclude workers between 40 and 50

from the workplace?

          QUESTION: Let's take the hours because you

certainly couldn't use that claim that that - that maybe

you didn't need this test.  The claim isn't that it

necessarily screens out the older workers, but the

employer doesn't want to put them through the strain of

the test.  But let's - let's move to the flexible hours,

reduced work hours, we're not going to give those benefits

to younger people within the protected class, only 50 and

over.

          MR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, it seems to me

that stereotypes that older workers are going to be more

strained and can't work as hard and need time off are

precisely the stereotypes the Act is designed to prohibit. 

Now, it's different if a worker -

          QUESTION: Well then, how - how in the world

could the agency then adopt 1625.2(b) that allows

increased benefits to older workers if the employer can

show that those older people have more problems?

          MR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, 1625.2(b) is

limited to benefits, and Charles Shaner, who's the general

counsel of the EEOC at the time that the Older Worker

Benefit Protection Act was passed, explained that the

statutory affirmative defense that would be implicated

here on remand, 623(f)(2)(B)(i), is a simplification of

that regulatory defense.  And I think what the Act as a

general matter does is it recognizes that benefits are

more difficult because it's tied up with issues of

retirement age and the like, and so a more flexible

approach is necessary with respect to benefits. 

          But with respect to core employment, hiring,

firing, promotion, and compensation, the Act reflects a

judgement, as stated in the purpose, that they want to

promote the employment of older people on the basis -

          QUESTION: Now, Mr. Clement, just - I want to be

sure I have an answer to my question.  With respect to

employment practices, such as that described, am I correct

in - in agreeing that if an employer uses a stereotype to

- to reach that conclusion, there would be no affirmative

defense for it?

          MR. CLEMENT: I - I think that's right.  Unless

this Court were, I mean, if this Court has a - has a very

flexible view of age in the prohibition, I suppose it

could allow the agency to adopt a flexible affirmative

defense along the lines of Weber.  Let me also -

          QUESTION: Why not?

          MR. CLEMENT: Let me also say that the statute

specifically gives the EEOC, in 29 U.S.C. 628, the

regulatory authority to make exemptions, and I think if

there are specific concerns with particular practices that

seem benevolent and are benevolent, then the EEOC can make

a regulatory exemption.  But with respect to these

seemingly benevolent -

          QUESTION: Where - where is that authority?

          MR. CLEMENT: 29 U.S.C. 628.  It's in the

statutory appendix, I believe at page 4a, and that - and

that is - that is a sweeping authority.  It gives the EEOC

both the authority to make interpretive regulations and

substantive exemptions from the statute.  

          QUESTION: Well - well if - if your submission is

that stereotypes are - are deplored and prohibited by the

Act, how could the EEOC make an exemption to the contrary?

          MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think, as I said, if - I

think that - that the Act is perfectly consistent with the

idea that these stereotypes should play no role.  The

purpose clause of the statute says it wants to promote the

employment of older workers, but how does it say it wants

to promote the employment of older workers?  By having

them judged on their ability rather than age.  And I think

it reflects a judgement that an employer that has age in

mind and not ability when trying to favor an older worker

is not going to be able to reverse the process when

they're working to the detriment of a worker.

          QUESTION: So then in any instance in which the

employer quite honestly is moved by some human feeling

that is related to an older person, that the Act would

rule out?

          MR. CLEMENT: I - I think that's right, Justice

Breyer, but what's -

          QUESTION: All right.  Now, is there any reason

to think that that's what Congress had in mind, any reason

to think that it - that it - that it really wanted in this

respect, because most human beings are moved by these

kinds of emotions, they wanted to prohibit that?

          MR. CLEMENT: Two responses, Justice Breyer. 

First -

          QUESTION: Helps other people.

          MR. CLEMENT: First, I think that the natural

human instinct to favor an older worker would be to cut a

break to a worker who's been with the company many years,

and if that's what an employer wants to do, it's perfectly

free under the Age Act to say, if you've been with us 30

years or 20 years, we're going to cut you a break.  To the

extent that's not the motivation, but it's purely age-

based, then there is an indication in the statutory

history, and that indication is the colloquy between

Senators -

          QUESTION: I thought that was ambiguous, somewhat

ambiguous.

          MR. CLEMENT: Well, the colloquy is not at all

ambiguous.

          QUESTION: Who - who heard that colloquy?  I

mean, were they the only two people on the floor?  I'm

really supposed to get -

          (Laughter.)

          MR. CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, all I can tell you

is that -

          QUESTION: We don't really know, do we?

          MR. CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, I can tell you

this.  The same number of people heard that colloquy as

heard the colloquy that this Court relied on between the

same two Senators in interpreting the Age Act in Betts and

in United Airlines against McMann.  On two occasions this

Court has recognized that those two Senators have

important views on the Age Act because they were the

principal sponsors and the floor managers of the bill, and

as the icing on the cake, the Court relied on Senator

Javits again in the Criswell case.  But -

          QUESTION: How - how much use has the EEOC made

of Section 628 when it can issue exemptions or that sort

of thing?

          MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, I don't know the

exact number of times, but I know there is a pending

exemption right now that's been - that's been promulgated

-

          QUESTION: Are there - are there - are there

other exemptions that have actually been granted?

          MR. CLEMENT: There - there are, Mr. Chief

Justice, and the one that they're working on now is to

give employers greater flexibility to coordinate their

retirement benefits with Medicare benefits in response to

a Third Circuit decision in the Erie County case -

          QUESTION: Well, may I ask -

          MR. CLEMENT: - so that's not just statutory

authority that's never been used.

          QUESTION: May I ask you a similar question?  To

what extent has - how many enforcement proceedings has the

EEOC commenced to - to enforce the reverse discrimination

aspect of this statute?

          MR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, there's one time

where they did enforce it and that was a full committee

proceeding.  The decision was circulated to the full

commission, so that is a binding decision on the

commission.

          QUESTION: So they did - there is one example of

an enforcement action?

          MR. CLEMENT: Right.

          QUESTION: In all these years, only one?

          MR. CLEMENT: Well, but there are only a handful

of examples that go the other way and with - I think it's

important to understand that with respect to the entire

universe of EEOC decisions, as opposed to Department of

Labor decisions, there's this one decision that comes up

in a non-benefits context where they apply the regulation. 

There are three other decisions that come up in a benefits

context -

          QUESTION: In that - in that very context, Mr.

Clement, you didn't mention this Court's decision in

O'Connor against Consolidated Coin, where was it the 52-

year-old had a claim for relief when the 41-year-old was

preferred.  If I understand your argument, you - you are

saying that equally the 41-year-old would have - have a

claim if the 52-year-old were preferred?

          MR. CLEMENT: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 

That's exactly what the Senate colloquy said that - and

that colloquy was picked up in the regulation, which is a

binding regulation with notice and comment rule-making.

          QUESTION: It says in the colloquy -

          QUESTION: Well, leave - leave - no, please go

ahead.

          QUESTION: It says in the colloquy, could not

turn down either.

          MR. CLEMENT: Right.  There would be -

          QUESTION: It doesn't - they were clear, turn

down either -

          MR. CLEMENT: Right.

          QUESTION: - and choose the other.  It could be -

 can't -

          MR. CLEMENT: No.  It said there would be

discrimination whichever way the decision went, and I

don't think that's all that unusual.  I mean, anytime in

the Title VII context that you have an employee who's

fired for sex or race -

          QUESTION: Whichever way it went, if it was - 

          MR. CLEMENT: - somebody will sue.

          QUESTION: - whichever way it went, if it was

based on age, I still don't understand how one could hire

the 51 because he discriminates against 42-year-olds.

          MR. CLEMENT: I - I think, Justice Stevens, you

could have a presumption or a stereotype that older

workers are going to be better.  I suppose it's also true

that you could have a situation where, for some other

benefits reason, an older worker wasn't going to have as

many benefits or would get paid less -

          QUESTION: But the problem with your stereotype

argument that the Government's trying to drive out of

people's minds age, just the way it's trying to drive out

of people's minds race, sex, and the other things against

which you can't discriminate, is that the Government

doesn't try to drive it out of their minds, it only - only

over 40.  Under 40 it's perfectly okay to have these -

these - these thoughts of age.  You just simply cannot

regard this statute as a statute that is directed against

some moral disapproval of - of taking age into account.

          MR. CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, the statute, when

it was originally enacted, had the protected class only

between 40 and 65, so I don't think the fact it's - now

only has a lower bound tells you anything in particular

about the prohibition.

          QUESTION: Mr. -

          MR. CLEMENT: And I thought you said it well for

the Court in the Consolidated Coin case that this is not a

statute about protecting individuals against the burden of

being over 40 or to protect against over-40ism.  It

protects people in the protected class, which is crystal-

clearly defined to be individuals over 40, from

discrimination because of age.  The Act doesn't care if

the worker in the protected class who loses out is the

younger of the two.  The Act is triggered whenever an

individual in the protected class loses out because of his

or her age.  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

          QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Clement.

          Mr. Verrilli, you have 4 minutes remaining.

          MR. VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

We're prepared to submit our case.

          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well.  The Court -

 the case is submitted.

          (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
