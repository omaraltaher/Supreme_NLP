CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 01-7662, Thomas Joe Miller-El v. Janie


Cockrell.


Mr. Waxman. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Hernandez v. New York described a hypothetical


case, a case in which the evidence of racial


discrimination during jury selection was so strong that,


quote, "a finding of no discrimination is simply too


incredible to be accepted."  This is truly that


exceptional case, and therefore the Court should use it as


a model, a model of the weight of evidence sufficient to


render objectively unreasonable a trial judge's rejection


of a Batson challenge.  Indeed, whatever --


QUESTION:  Well, now you -- you -- Mr. -- Mr.


Waxman, you've got two presumptions going against you


here:  the -- the first, the Hernandez presumption that


the trial court has to be deferred to, and then the AEDPA


presumption.  So I -- I hope you'll take those into


account.

 MR. WAXMAN:  I want to embrace them, Mr. Chief


Justice. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. WAXMAN:  I fully recognize, as an officer of


this Court and somebody who has followed this


jurisprudence, that even on direct -- that the deference


that is paid to a trial judge in a Batson hearing is so


strong that even in Hernandez, this case said on direct


review -- and Hernandez made reference to the high


standards of proof in habeas -- even on direct review, we


are going to require proof that a trial court's finding of


fact in a Batson hearing is erroneous by clear and


convincing evidence. 


And to that, AEDPA enacted subsection


2254(d)(2), which says that you -- a writ may not issue


unless the State court adjudication resulted in a decision


that was based on an unreasonable determination of the


facts in light of the evidence presented. 


There are very good reasons to provide these


dual levels of deference to the trial judge.  The trial


judge in the case, of course, is the finder of fact, and


in Hernandez this Court has made clear that the ultimate


finding in this case, the finding of whether or not the


trial prosecutor engaged in intentional discrimination in


making race the tipping factor, a but-for factor with

respect to the strike of any peremptory -- of any juror


under a peremptory challenge -- is a factual


determination.


But (d)(2) and the clear and convincing evidence


standard are there for a reason.  They are there for the


truly exceptional case in which there are reasons to


believe that the trial judge's findings are deluded, and


there are reasons to believe that the evidence suggesting


that the trial judge's finding was unreasonable are


overwhelming.


And I'd like to address the first first and the


second second, because I think it is entirely clear that


given the facts of this case and the way in which the --


the trial judge in this case conducted the hearing, that


whatever this Court decides, this case is going to stand


as a benchmark, either that these facts represent an


extreme that cannot be tolerated or that even these


extreme facts are tolerable under Batson.


Now, let me speak first to the trial judge.


The trial judge was conscientious and he was, of


course, to some extent disabled by the fact that the trial


in this case immediately preceded this Court's decision in


Batson.  That is, this is one of these few cases where the


trial occurred before Batson, but the case was pending on


direct appeal when Batson was decided.

 And so we have in this case a trial judge who


conducted the Batson hearing over 2 years after the jurors


testified and after the trial prosecutors gave their


reasons for all but two of the jurors.  And therefore, the


one hallmark of deference, which is that the trial judge


is a percipient witness of the res gestae, if you will,


did not exist in this case.  The -- the decided cases


under the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reflect


significantly more than a dozen cases decided by this


judge in that 2-year interim period.  He saw thousands of


venire members and undoubtedly heard hundreds, if not


thousands, of Batson explanations. 


And moreover, whereas it is true that the trial


judge observes the demeanor of the witnesses and a


prosecutor can certainly use as a race-neutral reason


questions raised about a juror's fitness or suitability


based on demeanor, the objections in this case, with one


limited exception, the prosecutor said nothing about the


demeanor.  The prosecutor's stated objections to the 10 of


the 11 African Americans who were struck were substantive


reasons there on the record.


In addition, the trial judge in this case did


not --


QUESTION:  Well, but certainly demeanor could


play a part in that even though you don't -- you don't say

it.


MR. WAXMAN:  I --


QUESTION:  You say he's -- he's prejudiced


against the Government and, you know, perhaps the way he


answered questions may give you a reason to think that,


that the transcript doesn't. 


MR. WAXMAN:  I can -- I -- I embrace that, Mr.


Chief Justice.  For many years before I entered this line


of work, I was a trial lawyer and I can remember


exercising peremptory strikes just because of hesitation.


My only limited point here is that unlike many


voir dire hearings -- and I've now reviewed many -- there


was only one single isolated instance in which the


prosecutor, in giving his reasons either at the time or in


the Batson hearing, said he hesitated or his demeanor led


me to question it.  And so in that one respect, I -- again


I think this case is more susceptible to meaningful


appellate review. 


But I have two more points I think it's very


important for the Court to consider about the way this


trial judge conducted this unusual case. 


QUESTION:  At -- at what stage, Mr. Waxman?  You


say this was 2 years after the actual trial?  There was a


-- a State habeas proceeding or something? 


MR. WAXMAN:  Oh, no.  It was direct appeal.  The

case was tried.  There was an immediate appeal taken. 


During the -- right after -- I think a month after the


case was tried, Batson was decided, and 2 years later, the


Texas Court of Criminal Appeals abated -- the Texas Court


of Criminal Appeals said 10 of 11 African Americans were


struck.  That raises an inference of discrimination under


Batson.  Remand it for a Batson hearing.  And it was at


that hearing that the judge made the findings of fact and


conclusions of law that are reflected in the -- in the


joint appendix. 


There was a subsequent habeas proceeding in the


State courts, but the habeas proceeding didn't deal with


the Batson issue because it had been fully exhausted.


The trial judge, in evaluating Batson, did not


look at the very substantial evidence of pattern and


practice evidence with respect to what was going on in


Dallas County at this time, evidence that the magistrate


deemed appalling.  He was told by the State not to look at


it.  He did not consider what the State acknowledges to be


racially disparate -- disparate questioning of the jurors


in venire on the question -- their ability to impose a


minimum sentence --


QUESTION:  How do we know -- how do we know he


didn't look at that? 


MR. WAXMAN:  We -- we don't know to a certainty

that he didn't.  He was told by the State that all of that


evidence was irrelevant.  Indeed, the State took the


position that a -- that comparative evidence between white


jurors and black jurors was irrelevant.  That was the


ground on which they urged this Court to deny the petition


for certiorari on direct appeal.  All I can say is it's


nowhere reflected in the district judge's opinion.  The --


the trial judge's opinion addresses only the six jurors in


question that my predecessor claimed were struck in


violation of Batson.


QUESTION:  But he did say, didn't he, when he


admitted the -- as you pointed out, when he admitted the


-- the newspaper article, that he'd take it for what it


was worth? 


MR. WAXMAN:  He did.  And there's an ambiguity,


and that's why we think, interestingly, that this case is


a (d)(2) case rather than a (d)(1) case.  In this Court,


as opposed to in the State courts, the State of Texas is


here before you saying the judge considered everything. 


The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals considered everything. 


They don't have to discuss everything that they


considered, and therefore, there is no legal error that


was committed.  And our submission to you is I don't know


if that's right or not.  It doesn't appear to be right,


but whether it's right or not, the result that they

reached, the conclusion that they made that there was no


-- that -- that race was not a but for factor with respect


to not one, not two, but six of these people. 


Under the record of this case and in light of


the way they conducted the jury shuffle in this case,


which cannot be justified on non-racial grounds --


QUESTION:  Before you get to the jury shuffle,


how long before the -- the voir dire in this case had the


newspaper article surfaced?  And there were, I guess, two


sitting judges who had once been prosecutors and they


said, well, we had a manual that we work with.  Could


there be an argument that that -- that the last indication


that the manual was being used was 5 years before this


trial?  Or is there evidence that it was being used right


up to the time of the voir dire?  Could you tell me about


that? 


MR. WAXMAN:  I'll address the newspaper articles


first, I guess you were asking about, and also the manual.


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. WAXMAN:  The newspaper articles -- there


were two series of newspaper articles.  There were three


articles that came out in the first or second week of


March which was either just as the 4 or 5 weeks of jury


selection was closing or after it, but it was before the


trial began.  And those articles precipitated the -- what

was called a Swain challenge but it -- what became a


Swain-Batson challenge. 


There were -- there were other articles that


were subsequently issued after the -- after the trial in


the case but before the direct appeal and the Batson


remand that looked at the racial percentages in capital


cases which mirrored the -- in many ways the -- the March


9th article that examined jury selection in 100 felony


cases. 


Now, the manual.  There were two manuals in the


case.  One of them, the earlier, more explicit 1963


manual, was not offered.  It is discussed in the March 9th


Dallas Morning News article which was admitted in evidence


at the Batson hearing. 


The other manual, the John Sparling manual --


Mr. Sparling testified.  There was testimony in the case


by Judge Baraka and one other witness -- and it may have


been Mr. Sparling -- that they were not sure when the


manual ceased to be used.  The Texas Court of Criminal


Appeals in a case called Halliburton concluded that the


manual was in use at least through the early 1980's I


think or in -- by 1980 or something like --


QUESTION:  And this trial was '85? 


MR. WAXMAN:  This trial was '86 I believe. 


But one of the things that's most striking in

the case is -- there's -- there -- it is clear that at


least one of the two prosecutors in this case was trained


by this office at a time when the manual was concededly in


use.  The other one may have been. 


But one of the things that I found striking,


just going through the juror information cards yesterday


actually in preparing for the oral argument, which appear


in the joint lodging at pages 54 to 108 -- these are the


juror cards that people get, the prosecutors and trial


lawyers get, before voir dire begins.  If you look at what


is noted there, the race and the gender and religion and


beards and things like that, there is a remarkable


coincidence with the issues and factors that are


specifically addressed in the Sparling training manual. 


It's not our submission that it's proof they were trained


by it.  It's not our submission that they adhered to it or


they used it.  We're using this pattern and practice


evidence just as a --


QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman, could I just interrupt to


ask one question?  When were those notations put on those


cards, do you know? 


MR. WAXMAN:  The answer must be that they were


put on at different times.  If you look at the notations


that say -- the race and the gender notations, each one


has it.

 QUESTION:  Now, these are --


MR. WAXMAN:  Those had to have been put on


before any questioning occurred because there -- they are


on those cards for jurors that were never reached or were


never questioned.  There are other notations about answers


that appear to be in different handwriting, and I don't


think the record shows it at all, but you can infer that


they were noted at the same time that the prosecution made


notes on the jury questionnaires which are also in the --


in the joint lodging.


But the -- the other point I just want to make


about the trial judge is the -- we know -- there's not a


question about whether the trial judge's findings are


unreasonable in light of the evidence.  Finding number 6,


the trial judge said there was no disparate examination of


any venire member. 


Well, in this Court, the State has totally


disavowed that.  The State acknowledges that when jurors


were questioned about their ability to impose the minimum


punishment for the lesser included offense of murder, they


used two different scripts.  And when they talked about


the means of execution, they used a graphic script that


went on in detail to explain how somebody is executed in


Texas, and a regular script that just said, how do you


feel about the death penalty?  Now, they --

 QUESTION:  If we agree -- if we agree with your


analysis of number 6, does that suffice to vitiate number


2?


MR. WAXMAN:  I --


QUESTION:  That the -- that the court finds that


the explanations given by the prosecutors in each --


prosecutor in each case were completely credible.


MR. WAXMAN:  I think it does.  The one that


we're -- that -- that you have to focus most directly on


is number 10 --


QUESTION:  That's the conclusion. 


MR. WAXMAN:  -- which is the -- the finding,


which is the ultimate finding. 


But my point is that there are a number of


findings that this judge made that are at the very least


suspect and one in which the State has completely walked


away from. 


And I want -- I want to spend, if I can, just a


few minutes talking about the jury shuffle and the


disparate questioning because I've been a trial lawyer for


many years, but never tried a case in this system, and it


was sort of a little bit confusing to me. 


But with respect to the disparate questioning,


each of the prospective jurors was questioned about


whether they could impose the minimum punishment if they

found that the offense was murder and not capital murder,


and the minimum punishment being 5 years.  And they were


also asked about their views about capital punishment.


Now, some of those people who were asked about


their views about capital punishment were first treated to


a graphic description of how that punishment occurs.  And


some of the people who were questioned about minimum


punishment were told in advance the range is 5 years to 99


years.  Could you do either?  And many of them were just


asked, what do you think the minimum penalty is that you


would impose for willful, deliberate, intentional, cold-


blooded murder where there was no robbery?


And our submission in our principal brief and


below was that the State used those disparities in a


racially discriminatory manner and that bears tremendously


on the intent of the prosecutor in executing the


peremptory strikes.  And their --


QUESTION:  Are you saying -- are you saying that


the prosecutor on voir dire must ask, when he gets to the


question of, you know, how do you feel about -- must ask


the same questions to every juror?


MR. WAXMAN:  Not at all.  They don't have to ask


the same questions.  They don't have to ask them in the


same way.  All that we're saying is that when they do ask


the same questions and they ask them in a way which is

acknowledged to be different and they acknowledge that


they --


QUESTION:  Well now, wait a minute.  You say


when they do ask the same questions and they ask them in a


way that's acknowledged to be different, that seems like a


contradiction just starting out. 


MR. WAXMAN:  I think I -- I managed to confuse


even myself. 


QUESTION:  Good. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. WAXMAN:  The prosecution -- I believe that


Ms. Bunn will confirm.  The prosecution said we had two


different ways of questioning about these two subjects,


and we used them deliberately at -- with different jurors


and we did it in order to remove jurors that we thought


were weak on the death penalty.  That is the reason that


they give and that's the reason against which their


justification must be judged, and it is --


QUESTION:  You would concede that would be


legitimate, that that --


MR. WAXMAN:  Sure, if you -- I -- if you --


somebody says, look, I -- there's no way I can impose the


death penalty, and -- as a -- as a prosecutor I don't want


-- I don't know if I can use a for cause strike, I don't


want to use a peremptory, let me see if I can't get them

to say something that will allow the judge to knock them


out for cause, that's entirely legitimate. 


The question is why did they do it.  Because it


would be illegitimate if they were doing it deliberately


disproportionately against black jurors because they were


black and it would be legitimate if they were saying,


okay, you know, people who expressed hesitation about the


death penalty -- we're going to do everything we can to


try and get rid of these people for cause. 


And let's just look at the State's own


statistics.  This is their statistics from their brief at


pages 17 and 18 and notes 38 and 39. 


With respect to minimum punishment, seven of the


eight African American jurors who were questioned about


minimum punishment were not told in advance that the


minimum punishment was 5 years.  And when they were asked


what they thought minimum punishment was, they said 20


years, life.  One person said that he thought the death


penalty was the minimum -- minimum -- punishment.


For the whites, 36 white jurors were questioned. 


Two -- only two were not told that it was 5 years in


advance.  Now, they say that's not fair because you only


need to compare those jurors who had expressed hesitation


about the death penalty because that was our factor.  And


they identify in their brief 10 white jurors and 10 black

jurors who expressed hesitation. 


Well, two things.  Okay, we'll use your numbers. 


That means that of the 10 black jurors who expressed


hesitation, 7 were given this trick questioning and 2 --


QUESTION:  What was the -- what was the purpose


of the prosecution in asking about what they thought the


minimum penalty --


MR. WAXMAN:  Under Texas -- Mr. Chief Justice,


under Texas law, that is grounds for disqualification for


cause and the prosecution did seek --


QUESTION:  What is -- what is --


MR. WAXMAN:  The inability to impose the minimum


punishment -- to consider the minimum punishment that the


law allows.  And they did try and strike two black jurors


for inability to impose minimum punishment, however odd


that seems given the role of the prosecution in a case.


They say there were 10 of each and even taking


-- 10 hesitant jurors, and even taking their numbers at --


at their word, that means, nonetheless, that a black


hesitant juror was three-and-a-half times more likely than


a white to be struck.  And it doesn't account for the fact


that their 10 white jurors wildly understates the number


of white jurors who expressed hesitation about the death


penalty.  It doesn't even include a white juror that they


struck for cause for inability to impose the death

penalty, Mr. Sohner.  And there are at least 8 or 9 other


jurors that we identify in our papers that are not in


their list of 10.  So even if you take their universe at


its will, blacks were three-and-a-half times more likely


to be tricked by this minimum punishment ploy than whites.


Now, on the graphic script about the death


penalty, they said, you bet, there were some people that


we went through all the gory details of how execution


occurs because we were trying to get those people off the


jury because they were hesitant about the death penalty,


but we did it with hesitant white jurors and we did it


with hesitant black jurors. 


Let's look at their numbers.  Eight of the 15


African American jurors were given the graphic script, 53


percent.  Three of the 49 white jurors were given the


graphic script. 


QUESTION:  But might it not be a justification


there that more black jurors showed hesitancy about the


death penalty than the white jurors? 


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, it might -- it might be, but


if couldn't be on this record because there were only 15


black jurors.  So out of the whole -- I'm using the entire


universe of everyone who was questioned. 


Let's then go to their explanation.  They say it


only applied to jurors who expressed hesitation about the

death penalty.  Let's just look at that universe.  There


was 10 of -- there were 10 of each.  Okay.  That means


that 7 of the 10 black jurors that they say expressed


hesitation were given this graphic script, and of the 10


white jurors that say expressed hesitation, 2 were given


this.  And that to us is evidence of conduct that occurred


during voir dire that admits of only a racial explanation


just as their conduct of the jury shuffle, which is a


ubiquitous and unique Texas practice that exists only in


the State of Texas. 


And we go through in our brief -- perhaps in as


not as much detail as -- as would be appropriate but,


nonetheless, given the page limits -- and show that the


State on at least three occasions used the -- its


prerogative to shuffle the jury for the obvious purpose of


moving African American jurors who were in the front of


the venire where they would be questioned to the back of


the venire each week where they would not. 


And here it's important to understand something


about the procedure in this case.  There was a different


venire called every week.  Jury selection extended over 5


weeks.  Each week either 40 or 50 new venire members were


brought into the courtroom, and they were seated in order. 


And as soon as they sat down, the record reflects, the


judge asked the State first and then the defense whether

they wanted to, quote, shuffle the jury.


QUESTION:  What does that mean?


QUESTION:  What does it mean?


QUESTION:  Would you tell us? 


MR. WAXMAN:  I will try to tell you and I would


respectfully refer you, in case I fail, to the Texas Bar


Journal article that we cited in our reply brief by a


professor at, I think, the University of Houston which


explains this practice. 


But in Texas, jurors of course are -- venires


are required to be chosen randomly, but there has always


been a practice -- and it's now codified by statute --


that allows the -- the lawyers in the case -- this is in


civil and criminal cases -- to look at the venire as it's


arrayed in order and based on what Judge Holcomb explained


for the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, based on, quote,


visual preference, because they haven't questioned these


jurors at all, the State and then the defense can say we


want to reshuffle the order.  We don't like the order. 


And it is well understood in Texas that the principal


reason for doing that is race and gender. 


QUESTION:  What are the consequences of, quote,


reshuffling the order? 


MR. WAXMAN:  What happens is you take the -- the


juror cards and it's either done in the central jury room

or in the courtroom, and they are shuffled either by the


clerk shuffling the way you would shuffle a deck or, in


this case, they were apparently, according to the record,


put into a metal basket and the lawyer would sort of run


his hands around and they'd pick them out, and they would


then be in a new order.  And after the State exercised its


shuffle or declined to exercise its shuffle, the defense


could choose whether to shuffle or not.


QUESTION:  Are the jurors actually then reseated


or are they just called in --


MR. WAXMAN:  No.  They are reseated so that --


QUESTION:  Everybody gets up and moves and the


back people get in the front, the front people get in the


back.


MR. WAXMAN:  Indeed.  Indeed, and it can be done


not once, but twice.  And it's particularly critical here


because what the judge --


QUESTION:  What's the consequence?  I --


MR. WAXMAN:  Here's the -- here's the


consequence.  The way the jury was picked here, they


questioned -- they questioned between 15 and -- generally


between 15 and 20.  One week they got to 30 jurors because


they were doing individual voir dire.  And so if you were


not in the first 15 out of the 50 or certainly in the


first 30 out of the 50, you weren't going to be questioned

at all.  In fact, the judge told them at the outset, that


if they were -- when the order was finally set, if they


were in the last two rows, they could just go home that


day and never come back. 


And so the consequence of shuffling in this case


wasn't the consequence you'd have if you had 50 jurors


picked -- this is a capital case.  We're going to ask all


of you -- all of you -- questions, and it's just not that


consequential what order you're in.  But here the order


meant everything.  If you could get -- if the -- if the


prosecution could get the black jurors out of the first 15


or 20 and into the back, they wouldn't have to worry about


the disparate questioning or exercising peremptory


challenges.  And the -- the record in this case I think --


it doesn't involve an admission but it is very, very


strong evidence. 


I -- I just want to say, before sitting down for


rebuttal, a point that may be obvious, but it is


surpassingly important for this Court to decide the merits


of the Batson challenge.  There are many areas in the law


in which -- in which this Court delineates the contours of


constitutional doctrine by demonstrating what result a


given set of facts yields.  And so too Batson's abstract


rules, its doctrines about the burden of proof and the


quantum of proof, can also only be demonstrated and

meaningfully elucidated by a model.  This is the kind of


area like voluntariness, ineffective assistance of


counsel, First Amendment actual malice in which this Court


can and, I submit, under (d)(2) must model a case for the


State courts and the lower Federal courts to show what


quantum of evidence is sufficient to require a conclusion


that a trial court's acceptance of a prosecutor as


Batson's avowed reasons are objectively unreasonable.


And I'll please reserve the balance of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Waxman. 


Ms. Bunn, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENA A. BUNN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. BUNN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


Prosecutors in this case exercised their


peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors whom


they believed were biased against the State, a belief


based not on stereotypical assumptions but on the views


actually expressed by these jurors during voir dire.


The trial judge, who observed firsthand the


entire voir dire process, credited the prosecutors' race-


neutral, case-related reasons for the strikes.  The


judge's findings of no purposeful discrimination are fully


supported by the record and they are entitled to deference

in this Court.


QUESTION:  Suppose you have a case in which 10


jurors are excused because of their expressed views on the


death penalty, excused by the State.  Five of those jurors


are white and five of those jurors are black.  But with


the five black jurors, the questioning was qualitatively


and quantitatively different.  It went on much longer with


much more searching, a different script.  What result


then?


MS. BUNN:  Well, Your Honor, I would say that is


circumstantial evidence of some kind of disparate


treatment.  If those are the facts, if these jurors had --


had expressed very similar or equivalent views on the


death penalty in their juror questionnaires and then were


treated differently by the prosecutors, that would be


circumstantial evidence of disparate treatment.  It is


evidence that is not in existence in this case, however.


First, petitioner's attempts to make comparisons


with white jurors are not supported by the record.  They


do not have equivalent views, and in any event, to the


extent that disparate questioning happened, it was


certainly based on the -- the -- either in the case of the


graphic script questioning based on the jurors' responses


to questions on the questionnaires or in the case of the


minimum punishment question -- questioning on a

combination of the responses in the questionnaires and the


responses to questioning in the voir dire.  So that would


be circumstantial evidence, but it is not present in this


case. 


QUESTION:  But may I ask on that -- that


question that if the different script was based on concern


about the person's attitude toward the death penalty,


would it not be true, because the script is -- comes very


early in the examination, that the doubt about the death


penalty must either have been shown in the written


response questionnaire or something said right before that


script took -- took place? 


MS. BUNN:  Yes, Your Honor, that's true and


that's supported by the record in this case. 


QUESTION:  You think it is, yes.


MS. BUNN:  Yes, Your Honor.  Every prospective


juror who was questioned -- with -- with the exception of


one white juror, every juror questioned in -- with the


graphic script at the outset of the questioning had


expressed some level of opposition to the death penalty in


their juror questionnaire. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Bunn, how do you define --


QUESTION:  Now, the one -- may I just follow


with one question?  Now, the one juror who said there were


four categories of death penalty and he said he was

somewhere between one and two, would that have been


sufficient to justify that kind of script?


MS. BUNN:  Well, perhaps following up with it. 


Now, that particular juror -- I believe you're referring


to Edwin Rand -- had no -- there was no indication on his


questionnaire of opposition to the death penalty.  That's


why the prosecutor did not lead off with the graphic


script for Mr. Rand.  However, after responses like that


and then the response of Mr. Rand that he didn't know if


he could -- maybe today he could impose the death penalty,


but tomorrow maybe he couldn't, after that kind of


questioning, then the prosecutor did lead up further along


in the examination with a semi-graphic script, but


certainly not at the outset. 


QUESTION:  Thank you. 


QUESTION:  There is -- I think on your numbers


there were 10 white venire members and 10 black who


expressed, on the questionnaire, hesitancy about the death


penalty.  But of those, there were only two of the white


jurors who got the graphic script and there were I think


eight of the blacks.


MS. BUNN:  Well, Your Honor, first off, that's


not -- that's not precisely true according to the record. 


We did list in a footnote 10 white jurors who had, at some


point, expressed hesitancy about the death penalty.

However, unfortunately, we do not in a sense have a


complete record because the juror questionnaires of the


white jurors are not in the record in this case.  Defense


counsel at trial only presented -- offered into the record


the juror questionnaires of the African American jurors.


QUESTION:  But you did say that there were that


number 10 --


MS. BUNN:  Who at some point --


QUESTION:  -- of the whites who expressed


hesitancy.


MS. BUNN:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  Who at some


point in their examination expressed hesitancy about the


death penalty.  But we don't know of those jurors who had


expressed hesitation about the death penalty in their


initial questionnaire.  By example --


QUESTION:  Well, which is something you could


have put in I presume, the State could have put in, if --


if it had thought it had relevant evidence at that point,


and it didn't.  So don't we have to, in effect, make our


judgment based on the figures that Justice Ginsburg has


just mentioned? 


MS. BUNN:  Well, Your Honor, the -- for one


thing, defense counsel never raised a disparate


questioning argument before the trial judge, and that's


where the State would have put that -- that evidence in.

And if -- if defense counsel felt like there were a


disparate questioning argument, it would have been defense


counsel, given that he had the burden --


QUESTION:  The graphic script and the minimum


punishment.  That never came up before the trial judge?


MS. BUNN:  The defense counsel did not argue at


all the issue of -- of disparate questioning.  The State


-- the prosecution brought it up as a factor to consider


and -- and argued, as we have argued here, that the State


certainly did use different lines of questioning from


different jurors based on their views but not on race.


QUESTION:  But if the -- if the prosecution


brought it up, it's -- I assume it's there for us to get


into it, and we've got to get into it on the record that


was made.  And if the prosecution didn't make a further


record on that, it's -- it's, it seems to me, appropriate


for us to -- to look into the issue on the record that we


have.  And if we do, we come back to Justice Ginsburg's


numbers. 


MS. BUNN:  Well, again, Your Honor, the -- the


record in this case doesn't support those numbers also


because we can look to an -- as analogy to the African


American jurors, several of whom did not express


hesitation about the death penalty in their initial juror


questionnaire but who came back later on in their

examinations and did make comments --


QUESTION:  All right.  But those --


QUESTION:  I'm getting confused.  I thought the


numbers we were talking about were your numbers, 10 of


each.


MS. BUNN:  They were -- they were numbers that


we set forth in talking about -- in discussing the


disparate questioning, jurors -- white jurors who had at


some point expressed hesitancy about the death penalty. 


However, to infer from those numbers that it was that


universe of jurors who the -- who the prosecutors had to


consider their juror questionnaires in determining whether


at the outset to -- to use the graphic script, that is not


-- that is not how we intended the footnote.


QUESTION:  I see.  You mean some of that


reservation of the death penalty may come later in the --


in the questioning. 


MS. BUNN:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Well, why couldn't the prosecutor


have then used the graphic script, or it would have been


too late?


MS. BUNN:  Well, in some instances the


prosecutor did both with African American and white


jurors, jurors who initially in their juror questionnaires


did not indicate any opposition to the death penalty, but

into their question -- into their voir dire examination


did, and there are instances where the prosecutor did go


into the graphic script later on in the examination.  But


that is not what the petitioner is relying on here.  He --


QUESTION:  Why --


QUESTION:  Isn't the fact that we are having


this colloquy with you about the significance of the


numbers a pretty good argument for the proposition that at


least reasonable jurists might disagree about the


significance of it, and therefore there should have been a


-- a certificate of appeal issued here? 


MS. BUNN:  Well, Your Honor, given the level of


deference that the trial judge's findings were entitled to


in this case, we do not think that it -- it presents that


kind of case regardless of the --


QUESTION:  Well, it seems to me your argument on


-- I'm not talking now about the -- the ultimate


resolution of it which Mr. Waxman addressed.  I'm just


addressing the -- kind of the threshold question of


whether there should have been a COA here.  And it sounds


to me as though your argument is saying that unless the


defense has got just a slam dunk Batson argument at the


end of the day, there shouldn't be a COA, which -- which


perhaps reflects what the -- the court below was doing


when it seemed to -- to say that there wasn't going to be

a COA because at the end of the day, the -- the Batson


claim was not meritorious.


MS. BUNN:  Well, Your Honor, it is our position


that the court -- the court below correctly determined


that no COA should issue in this case given the multiple


levels of deference that the trial judge's findings were


entitled to, not only the Hernandez standard --


QUESTION:  But isn't -- isn't the degree of


deference and the significance of that degree of deference


with respect to specific claims something that is worthy


of being determined in the appellate process rather than


something that ought to be determined at the threshold


before the appellate argument has even been made?


MS. BUNN:  Petitioner has -- has never argued


that he was not able to make any level of detailed


argument in this case in the court below.


QUESTION:  Well, regardless of what the


petitioner may have said, what's the answer to my


question?  I mean, aren't you -- aren't we making out a


pretty good case again by our colloquy here for the fact


that there was something for the court of appeals to


consider here on the -- on the -- the reasonable


disagreement among jurists standard?


MS. BUNN:  If the issue were looked at de novo,


the issue alone of Batson, then yes, it presents

compelling evidence both ways.  However, in -- viewed to


the scheme of 2254(d), it is, as you referred to, a slam


dunk case.  And petitioner did not meet the COA burden,


and that is -- our position is that the court -- court


below correctly denied COA given the deference entitled --


that -- that the trial judge's findings were entitled to


in this case.


And getting back to the trial judge's findings,


just a few things that we disagree with the petitioner


about in characterizing the trial judge's handling of this


case. 


First, the fact that technically the Batson


hearing was conducted 2 years after the trial, that is


true.  However, when you look at the record of voir dire


in this case, though it was pre-Batson, when defense


counsel raised an objection to the strike of an African


American juror, the prosecution came forward with his


race-neutral reasons immediately, contemporaneous --


QUESTION:  But that's not true in every case.


MS. BUNN:  Every case where defense counsel


objected to the strike of that particular juror.  And that


is true with every juror challenged here with the


exception of Mr. Joe Warren. 


QUESTION:  Well, for example, the -- Joe


Warren's case was most interesting to me because the

prosecutor just exercised the peremptory without any


explanation whatsoever.  And then the judge made quite a


speech to the juror about how he had been a very fine


juror, and that was sort of the end of it.  And then later


on, we find out that he was -- he was not a very fine


juror.


MS. BUNN:  Again, Your Honor, the -- the trial


judge -- the trial judge's comments to the juror don't --


certainly don't vitiate the prosecutor's reasons for


striking him.  But nonetheless, defense counsel --


QUESTION:  The prosecutor did not give a reason


for striking that juror.


MS. BUNN:  Defense counsel didn't object to the


striking -- the prosecutor's striking of that juror. 


Certainly there was nothing even --


QUESTION:  Well, as I understand it, the defense


counsel had a kind of a running objection and made clear


in each record when a black juror was stricken.  The


record -- he made it -- that be made part of the record. 


But he didn't object on a juror-by-juror basis.  He didn't


have any standing to do that. 


MS. BUNN:  He objected --


QUESTION:  Because this was a Swain hearing


rather than a Batson hearing at the time. 


MS. BUNN:  That is true.  But he did in this

case -- defense counsel did in this case object to the


striking of every single African American juror with the


exception of Joe Warren and Paul Bailey.  So he was not


using a running objection kind of conduct.  He -- he


specifically objected to 8 of the 10 African American


jurors struck.  And for whatever reason, he did not object


to the prosecutor striking Joe Warren.  While this doesn't


give rise to a procedural default, it could, in fact, be


an indication that defense counsel thought there were


legitimate reasons for the prosecutor's strike of Joe


Warren. 


QUESTION:  You were -- you were on the -- the


theme of saying that the hearing was conducted properly 2


years later, and I don't want to get you off of -- of


that.  But at -- at some point just answer this question,


and maybe it's consistent with the two -- the hearing


you're about to describe. 


Mr. Waxman told us -- and -- and he's fair about


these things -- that -- that you've walked away from


number 6, that there was no disparate prosecutorial


examination.  But you started your argument by -- by


indicating that the answers were -- were sufficient to --


to support that.  Are you saying that there was disparate


examination but that it was justified? 


MS. BUNN:  Yes, Your Honor, that's what we're

saying, and that is --


QUESTION:  Because of the answers that they gave


on the questionnaire and -- and answers that they gave


just before the script was used.


MS. BUNN:  Yes, Your Honor.  It's the State's


position now --


QUESTION:  So you would say then that you


haven't walked away from finding number 6?


MS. BUNN:  No, Your Honor, we have not.  It --


it's the State's position now.  It was the State's


position at the time of the Batson hearing that any


disparate questioning was a legitimate means to deal with


jurors who had expressed different views on different


issues but was not based on race.  And that is consistent


with the trial judge's finding.


QUESTION:  So you think that the trial judge,


therefore, considered the issue of disparate questioning. 


MS. BUNN:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, then the question


is, if they considered it, did he reach a reasonable


conclusion? 


What about Justice Ginsburg's mentioning there


were at least eight white jurors who also expressed


reservations who were not given this graphic description


of what the death penalty involves, but instead were just

asked could you find against a person if that meant the


death penalty?  What about those eight people? 


MS. BUNN:  Well, again, disparate questioning,


like many other pieces of evidence that petitioner is


relying on in this case, are circumstantial evidence of --


of discriminatory motive or can be in a given case. 


Assuming that there -- that there was some level of -- of


disparateness, even within those jurors who had expressed


views about the death penalty --


QUESTION:  No.  The particular thing is what she


asked and you say right now, I think correctly, that the


trial judge did consider disparate questioning.  You also


agree that I guess it was -- the number was approximately


8 of the 11 black jurors who expressed doubts about the


death penalty were asked this very graphic question, could


you find a person guilty and give him the death penalty


where that meant taking him in the gurney, et cetera. 


Only two white jurors were asked that question.  Yet, I


take it that you concede that there were at least eight


other white jurors who also expressed doubts about the


death penalty who were not asked that question. 


MS. BUNN:  Well, I do not concede that to the


extent that it is identifying those jurors as being jurors


who expressed doubts about the death penalty in their


juror questionnaires, and that is the information that the

prosecutor had to go by. 


QUESTION:  All right.  So you say there weren't


eight such people.  Fine. 


MS. BUNN:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  That's your answer. 


MS. BUNN:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And I have another question which I


think is to me more important, which is that these


ambiguous answers, a difficult question about what the


motive was of the prosecutor in peremptorily striking when


he has a legitimate reason, to decide whether it's


legitimate or not, I would have thought history, in terms


of how the county has behaved in general, would be highly


relevant to characterize and decide a difficult question


like that. 


But on page 911 of this record, the magistrate


makes pretty clear that he thought history was not


relevant in reviewing that third part of Batson, reviewing


what the State did. 


And the State court judge himself said on page


844 I guess whether or not I will give it -- I mean such


evidence -- any weight is another question, and never


referred to it again.


So in respect to that, what is your view?


MS. BUNN:  The State's view is that while the

Federal magistrate -- first I'll address the Federal


magistrate's handling of the issue.  It is the State's


position that the Federal magistrate did err in its


elucidation of the standard of -- its holding basically


that historical evidence is irrelevant at Batson's third


step.  However, certainly an error by a Federal magistrate


does not entitle a petitioner to habeas corpus relief. 


And -- and any error as well was cured when the Fifth


Circuit considered independently all of the evidence that


petitioner had presented in his petition. 


Moving on to the trial judge, however, there is


nothing in the record --


QUESTION:  Well, but -- but why -- why isn't


this -- you're candid to say that you may have erred on


this one regard, but why -- why isn't this a -- a very


significant fact to which we must give great weight,


especially you indicated the evidence was circumstantial. 


A little bit odd for a prosecutor to -- to say that


circumstantial evidence isn't important.  This is all we


have in -- in these cases when we're trying to infer


motive, and best evidence is often circumstantial.  And


why isn't the historical evidence here overwhelming


circumstantial evidence and good evidence? 


MS. BUNN:  Justice Kennedy, it is evidence.  It


is circumstantial evidence.  But the trial judge's inquiry

and certainly an appellate court's inquiry must begin,


must key in on the reasons that the prosecutors struck


these jurors and the record in this case.  And in this


case, prosecutors struck prospective jurors for


legitimate, case-related, race-neutral reasons.  That's


where the trial judge's analysis began and ended, and it


overruled the State's objections to the pattern and


practice evidence on relevancy grounds.


QUESTION:  Ms. Bunn, if -- if it begins and ends


with the prosecutor's neutral reasons, then you would


never have a successful Batson challenge because the


prosecutor could always give a neutral reason.  And the


question that is troubling me is what in the end did the


court consider and look -- and the -- and the State trial


court said, well, he would take that so-called Swain


evidence for what it was worth.  He never told us.  He


never said how he resolved the question.  And the -- the


fact finding seemed to be going at these jurors, the black


jurors, against whom peremptories were exercised, one by


one and saying as to each one, there was a neutral reason


given and that's it.  We don't know how anything else


figured in this package.  We don't know whether the judge


said, well, I'll take it -- take the Swain evidence for


what it's worth -- did he say he thought it was worthless? 


He doesn't tell us.  We don't -- we just can't tell from

this record what went on at that stage three.


MS. BUNN:  Well, respectfully I disagree.  The


trial judge found the prosecutor's reasons to be credible,


and in making that credibility determination and having


overruled the State's objections to this pattern and


practice evidence and stating candidly that he didn't know


what weight he was going to give it, given that while it


is circumstantial evidence, he's got a -- he's got a


record here where the prosecutor's reasons are supported.


QUESTION:  He --


QUESTION:  Well, but the credibility finding,


which is number 2, doesn't prevent us and -- and really


shouldn't prevent a court from determining whether that


credibility finding has a foundation.  And if you have


this very persuasive historical evidence, the different


script, that all bears on whether the credibility finding


can -- can withstand scrutiny.  You can't just say, well,


he concluded credibility and that's always for the trial


judge and then walk away or, as Justice Ginsburg said,


you'll never have a Batson challenge. 


MS. BUNN:  We are not --


QUESTION:  Absent a finding that the -- the


prosecutor is dissembling based on demeanor.


MS. BUNN:  We are certainly not arguing that a


-- a Batson finding from a trial judge is completely

insulated from appellate review.  However, in a case such


as this where the reasons credited by the trial judge are


supported by the record, there -- there is no basis to


overrule the trial judge's credibility determination.


QUESTION:  Well, but that's not true as to


finding 6, because he didn't find there was no -- there


was justification for disparate questioning.  He found


there was no disparate questioning.  And the record is


perfectly clear that there was disparate questioning. 


MS. BUNN:  However, in the context of the Batson


hearing that he was resolving, that finding is reasonably


understood as a finding that there was no disparate


questioning based on race. 


QUESTION:  But if read literally, it's -- if


read literally, it's clearly incorrect. 


And of course, as to the findings on


credibility, there's no finding as to any particular


juror.  He just made a -- a gross finding that everybody


-- I believe everything the prosecutor said.  Basically


that's what he found. 


MS. BUNN:  The finding regarding disparate


questioning I believe is phrased as disparate questioning


of the challenged jurors.  So given that, I would say


that, yes, that supports the interpretation certainly that


it was made within the context of the Batson challenge and

that the finding was limited to based on race.  There was


no disparate questioning based on race. 


QUESTION:  May -- may I ask one question about


the procedure?  Were the juror information cards that have


the notations about sex and -- and race noted on it --


when do you think those notations were made? 


MS. BUNN:  I would --


QUESTION:  Because I find it significant there


are no notations or very few as to attitude toward the


death penalty, which is your -- your key to everything. 


There doesn't seem to be any card on which the prosecutor


said soft on death or hard on death or anything like that.


MS. BUNN:  I believe that those sorts of


notations were made on the juror questionnaires rather


than the juror information cards.  And I -- I would agree


with Mr. Waxman that the record does indicate that those


notations were made toward the beginning of the process,


prior to any individual questioning. 


QUESTION:  So that it would be fair to infer


that the prosecutor on each juror noted race and sex, but


did not note attitude toward death penalty.


MS. BUNN:  Not on the juror -- the juror


information cards.  That sort of --


QUESTION:  Which -- which were cards prepared


before the voir dire examination began.

 MS. BUNN:  That -- that was all they had to go


on during the preliminary phases.  When they received the


-- after the -- the panel was finally seated, when the


jurors were given the questionnaires, then that's what the


parties worked from in making more notes in determining


which to challenge for cause and which to strike. 


So, again, what can be inferred from that I -- I


think is -- really, it's -- it's -- there's just not a


whole lot --


QUESTION:  Well, if --


QUESTION:  Well, one thing that's clear is they


did note the race of every juror before they questioned


them.  That much is clear.


MS. BUNN:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  All right.  So we have -- in essence,


we still have a group of three busy judges who are


reviewing a magistrate reviewing a record.  The record is


controversial at best.  The magistrate uses the wrong


standard concededly.  And they don't even issue a


certificate of appealability.  Well, shouldn't they at


least have done that? 


MS. BUNN:  Well, Your Honor, again it is our


position that on this record a certificate of


appealability was not warranted.  Again, given the


multiple levels of deference, the trial judge's clear

findings in this case, and the fact that they are


supported by the record.  And again --


QUESTION:  But there's some absences in the


finding, and let me go back to the -- the judge saying,


I'll reserve the question whether to give that pattern and


practice evidence any weight.  And then we haven't got a


clue how he resolved that question. 


MS. BUNN:  Well, again --


QUESTION:  Or if he ever even came back to it.


MS. BUNN:  Yes, Your Honor.  However, it was


clearly before the trial judge.  The -- there's nothing in


the record to indicate that the trial judge did not


consider the evidence, nothing besides the mere absence --


QUESTION:  But he -- he said he was going to


decide whether he was going to give it any weight.  Maybe


he made a decision that he shouldn't give it any weight,


and maybe that was wrong or right.  But we just don't


know.


MS. BUNN:  Perhaps he did, but as the fact


finder, that was his prerogative, and the -- the record in


this case -- again, there's nothing to indicate that he


didn't consider the evidence.  It was before him and his


findings, however, properly do focus on the record in this


case, the reasons that the prosecutor came forward with,


and were credited by the trial judge.  And again, the --

the record in this case clearly supports those -- those


findings. 


And these jurors were jurors who the State --


both -- both white jurors and African American jurors who


the State struck were jurors who had expressed views that


the State was uncomfortable with. 


And again, to get a feel for what the


prosecutor's job was in this case, they -- they looked at


ultimately 108 jurors, individually questioned 65 jurors,


and the prosecutor had to view that -- to view those


jurors as not even just looking at do you believe in the


death penalty, yes or no, but where does this particular


juror fall in the spectrum.  How likely are they to be


able to consider the full range of punishment in a capital


murder case?  That was what the prosecutor was charged


with in this case. 


And if you look at the record in this case, it


supports the trial -- the prosecutor's reasons for the


legitimate strikes in this case.  They were supported by


the record.  They were case-related.  And they were simply


not based on race.  There is ample support for the trial


judge's findings and simply no basis to -- to overrule


those findings.


Unless there are any more questions. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Bunn.

 Mr. Waxman, you have 2 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. WAXMAN:  Thank you.  I just have six short


rebuttal points to correct the record. 


The -- while the graphic script was given at the


beginning of the voir dire and therefore based only on the


questionnaires, the minimum punishment ploy -- that is,


trying to trick jurors about minimum punishment -- was


done at the very end, after they had all of the evidence. 


And therefore, the relevant universe of whites who


expressed hesitation is not 10, as the State says, but 19. 


And in any event, even with 10, they are three-and-a-half


times as likely. 


With -- also, we did -- the trial -- the defense


lawyers in this case objected over and over and over again


to trying to trick these black jurors by asking them what


minimum punishment they would give without expressing the


number.  The voir dire is replete with this. 


With respect to the graphic script, which did


come at the beginning, well, the State now says, well, we


don't have the questionnaires for all the people, so we


don't really know how many there were.  We know that we


used the graphic script with three of them.  Okay.  The


three that they used that they identified are jurors 27,


47 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

59, and 68.  Two were excused by agreement, and one,


number 68, was seated. 


But we do know what the juror questionnaires


were -- I'm just doing a -- sort of a quick list on the


back of my note card here -- for Mr. Vickery, Ms. Mazza,


Mr. Gutierrez, Mr. Hearn, and Mr. Duke.  Mazza, who is --


who features prominently here and who is not included in


their 10, said in her questionnaire, it depends on the


crime. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. --


MR. WAXMAN:  It is that --


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Waxman.


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
