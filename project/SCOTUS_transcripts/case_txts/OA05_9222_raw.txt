 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next in Burton versus Stewart.

 Mr. Fisher.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FISHER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 In Sharp versus Pain, the Ninth Circuit 

opinion that first decided the question that's before 
you today, the Ninth Circuit said, and I'm quoting: 
"The rule of Blakely that the statutory maximum is the 
maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the 
basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict, was 
not clear until the Blakely decision itself."  The Ninth 
Circuit is simply wrong.  In this Court's Apprendi 
decision it laid down precisely that rule.  At page 483 
of that decision this Court described the statutory 
maximum concept as, quote, "the maximum a defendant 
would receive if punished according to the facts 
reflected in the jury verdict alone" -- virtually the 
identical language.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Fisher, you know, 
assuming we read it the way you read it, I've got a

basic problem that doesn't really surface until you get 
to the end of the briefs and I wonder if you would 
comment on it at the beginning of the argument.  That is 
-- or I'll put it in the form of a question.

 Is the decision which the judge makes here 
to sentence consecutively rather than concurrently, a 
decision that requires the finding of any fact about the 
commission of the crimes themselves or the circumstances 
of those crimes or about the defendant's character?
 Does the judge have to make or does the 

fact -- some fact finder have to make a finding on any 
of those subjects -- crimes, circumstances, character of 
the defendant?

 MR. FISHER:  Yes, he does, Justice Souter.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  What is that fact?
 MR. FISHER:  It's precisely the same kind of 

fact that the judge had to find in Blakely itself. 
Under the Washington, Revised Code of Washington, the 
statute, the statute for running sentences consecutively 
in the fashion that Mr. Burton's were run consecutively, 
refers the judge back to the very same provision that 
was at issue in Blakely itself, which is the aggravating 
factors provision of Washington, which was formerly 
codified at section 390 and is now codified at section 
400.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I thought the only fact 

that had to be found was that, given the classification 
sentencing scheme Washington had, there would be, in 
effect, a free crime, no incremental punishment, unless 
there were consecutive sentencing.  That's not a fact 
that falls within any of those categories of crime, 
character, or circumstances.

 MR. FISHER:  That would be a fact, Justice 

Souter, but that is not the way the Washington law 
works.  It is colloquially known as the free crime 
aggravator.  But in the Washington Supreme Court 
decision in Hughes which is cited at the end of our 
reply brief the Washington Supreme Court made clear that 
to invoke that aggravator a court has to find that 
there was extraordinarily serious culpability or 
extraordinarily serious harm that accompanies the 
multiple offenses.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  So it's a misnomer to say 
it's a mere free crime criterion?  It's free crime plus 
some further fact?

 MR. FISHER:  That's right.  And this Court's 

decision -- I'm sorry.  The Washington Supreme Court 
decision in Hughes clearly lays that out.  If you have 
any doubt about the way the consecutive sentences work 
in Washington, I want to give you one other citation, to

a new Washington Court of Appeals decision that 
considers a consecutive sentences imposed exactly the same 
way that Mr. Burton's was.  That is to say, they are run 
consecutively based on the clearly too lenient factor. 
That case is called State versus Washington and it was 
just reported at 143 P.3d 606, 143 P.3d 606.  The 
Washington Court of Appeals in that case, considering a 
sentence just like Mr. Burton's, says that it does 
trigger and violate Blakely.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  So the extra fact then is a 

lot like the sort of heinous, atrocious and cruel 
aggravator?  I mean, it's comparable to it?

 MR. FISHER:  Exactly, it's part of the same 
list.  And as this Court said in Apprendi itself, that 
extra culpability, which is one of the ways this 
aggravator can be met, is the quintessential type of 
element that needs to be proven beyond a reasonable 
doubt .

 JUSTICE BREYER:  When you say extra 

culpability, do you mean the nature of the crime? 
Suppose there are three crimes all committed at the same 
time -- murder, rape, and kidnapping.

 They're all very serious crimes.  And if you 
sentence them consecutively, you will take into account 
that there were three.  If you sentence them

concurrently, it doesn't matter.  The Washington court 
says, we're not just looking to the fact that murder or 
rape or kidnapping are serious; we're looking to 
sentence consecutively if do you more than that.  You 
have to look to see that the kidnapping was a special 
kind of kidnapping.

 MR. FISHER:  That's right, Justice Breyer. 

the current section is section 589 of 

In section --
the Washington Code and it says that sentences shall run 
concurrently unless the judge makes an extra finding of 
exactly the same type the judge is required to find in 
Blakely.  And if you look at Blakely itself, remember 
Blakely involved concurrent sentences.  And so what Washington 
is doing is saying all sentences should run concurrently 
unless there's an extra fact, something about the 
additional crimes that would otherwise be running 
concurrently, that simply requires the judge to go above 
and beyond the ordinary concurrent sentences and punish 
those crimes separately.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But could the nature of the 

additional crimes themselves satisfy it?  In other 
words, could the judge say, well, all three -- it might 
be one thing if one were serious and the other two were 
trivial, but all of these three are very serious.  Now, 
that's in effect a value judgment, not a finding of

discrete fact.  Could that value judgment satisfy the 
extraordinary criterion that Washington says there must 
be in addition to free crime.

 MR. FISHER:  No, it couldn't, and the 

Washington decision that I've cited to you will help you 
with this, because it makes it clear that to trigger an 
aggravator to run sentences concurrently, just as under 
Blakely itself, there has to be something above and 
beyond the elements of the crime or the crimes 
themselves.  It can't simply be -- I'm sorry.  It can't 
simply be that there were three crimes committed 
and all three of them are very serious. 
It has to be something about the crime, the additional 
crimes, that takes it above and beyond the ordinary 
commission of that crime.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But, Mr. Fisher, even if 
it's true that there are other examples out there that 
might qualify for that example, it's not true of this 
case?

 MR. FISHER:  I'm not sure I follow, Justice 

Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  In this particular case, 

there was -- it was necessary to make an additional 
finding of fact, even though there may be cases out 
there in which you could get consecutive sentences

without an additional finding of fact?

 MR. FISHER:  You're certainly right that in 
this case you needed to have an extra finding of fact. 
There are some situations under the Washington Code and 
I believe in the majority of other States where it is up 
to the judge's discretion whether to run sentences 
concurrently, and he could do it for the reason that 
Justice Souter described.  So what Washington does in 
its respondent's brief is it cites these other State 
decisions, from other States that simply have different 
sentencing systems than we have in Washington.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not sure I 

understand that.  I mean, we have not held, for example, 
that the fact of a prior conviction is something that 
has to be submitted to a jury under Blakely.  Why, if 
you're determining that sentences run consecutively, 
isn't that just the same as looking at a simultaneous 
conviction and saying they're going to run 
consecutively?

 MR. FISHER:  Under some State systems that 

might be the case, Mr. Chief Justice.  However, in 
Washington the way that the code works is that judges 
are directed that for multiple crimes the sentences 
shall run consecutively.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you'd have --

MR. FISHER:  Unless they make the exact kind 
of extra finding, and it refers them to the precise same 
statute that was at issue in Blakely itself.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you're saying 
that that extra finding can't simply be that this is a 
conviction for a particular serious crime that's going 
to go unpunished otherwise?

 MR. FISHER:  That's right.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So under this system 
if you had a regime where if you're convicted of murder 
and you've been convicted of rape before that, you get 
an enhanced sentence beyond the normal murder sentence, 
that would not contravene Blakely.  But if you're 
convicted at the same time for rape and murder and those 
two sentences run consecutively, you say that that does 
violate Blakely.

 MR. FISHER:  If the judge needs to make an 

extra finding beyond the elements of either of those two 
crimes to run them consecutively, then it would violate 
Blakely.

 THE COURT:  But we've never held that? 

We've never held that consecutive -- that the treatment 
of sentences as concurrent or consecutive is covered by 
Blakely?

Apprendi-Blakely line of cases dealing with consecutive 
sentences.  But what you've done is laid down a rule 
from the very State that we're dealing with here that 
says that if the judge needs to make an extra finding 
beyond the elements of the crimes of conviction and 
beyond the facts encompassed in the jury's finding of 
guilt for those crimes, then those findings need to be 
proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  That's why 
in this case that line, that rule, is triggered.

 The Ninth Circuit of course didn't talk 
about any of this.  What it said, as I mentioned, is 
that it simply took Apprendi to be a purely formalistic 
rule that had nothing to do with the facts according to 
the jury verdict, but it just had to do with whatever 
the State happened to label as the statutory maximum. 
In Apprendi this Court said, not once but three times, 
that the statutory maximum concept was triggered 
according to the facts encompassed in the jury verdict. 
And like the Washington courts, the Ninth Circuit simply 
ignored that language in this Court's opinion.

 Lest there be any doubt about the way that 

concept mapped onto this case, this Court said in Apprendi 
itself that the relevant inquiry was not one of form but 
one of effect:  Does the required finding take a 
defendant to a higher sentence level than would

otherwise be permissible based on the facts encompassed 
in the jury verdict?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Fisher, there's 

another potential impediment in this case and I would 
like you to comment on it.  That is the petition from 
the sentence, it was second in time.  There was a prior 
petition that challenged just the conviction, and under 
the governing statute, to have a second petition, you've 
got to get permission from the court of appeals and it 
has to meet stringent criteria.

 How do you get past that?  You went out 

concentrating on the petition addressed to the sentence 
which is a second petition.

 MR. FISHER:  This is the very first petition 
that Mr. Burton has filed against the 1998 judgment.  He 
did file earlier a petition against the original 
judgment of 1994.  In the joint appendix at page 34, 
that is where that petition is reprinted.  He says quite 
clearly that he is challenging the 1994 judgment in that 
petition, whereas here this is his first petition 
against the 1998 judgment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So did -- then you are 
bifurcating the judgment in a criminal case, which is 
not the sentence.  You are saying there's an earlier 
judgment, and looking at it as we would as if it were a

civil case, if you have a determination of liability, 
that doesn't give you a final judgment.  The judgment 
will come at the end of the case when damages are 
determined.

 MR. FISHER:  That's right, Justice Ginsburg. 
And if what the State is saying is correct, which is to 
say that we don't have any judgment at all until the 
sentence is final, then all you get from that is that 
Mr. Burton's first petition should have been dismissed 
and the court could have gotten it dismissed.  But we 
submit what you can't do from that is retroactively 
change the first petition that he explicitly told the 
court was against the 1994 judgment, and that he told 
the court in that same filing on JA 35 and JA 40, that 
his sentence was still on direct review.  You can't 
retroactively change that challenge to the 1994 judgment 
into one against the 1998 judgment, for two reasons.
 One is that if the State is right, the 

district court wouldn't have had jurisdiction under that 
1998 -- challenge against the 1998 judgment either, 
because as Mr. Burton forthrightly told the court, that 
sentence was still on direct review.  But even if you 
get past that, we submit that this Court's Castro 
decision simply doesn't allow a court, especially 
retroactively, to recharacterize a habeas petition that

the petitioner himself said was against one judgment as 
against another.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you think there can 

always be two petitions, one -- of sentences on review?

 MR. FISHER:  No, there can't, Justice 

Kennedy.  And so what should have happened according to 
the state's theory, is that the first petition should, 
should simply have been dismissed.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Bit is that also your 

theory?

 MR. FISHER:  I think that's -- this Court 

hasn't laid down a solid decision.  But I think that's a 
better reading.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But are you -- are you 

asking us to say that while the sentence is still under 
review, there can be no habeas petition filing?

 MR. FISHER:  Am I asking --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why isn't that up to the 

option of the petitioner?  He can take his chances or he 
can wait.

 MR. FISHER:  I think that is a fair 

characterization, Justice Kennedy.  But what Mr. Burton 
did is he want to the district court saying I'm 
challenging the 1994 judgment.  And as I was saying, 
under Castro before that gets recharacterized --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm asking if it is your 

position whether or not he properly can do that?

 MR. FISHER:  I don't think so.  But I'm just 

recognizing that that's a jurisdictional question that 
this Court would decide for itself.  But assuming that 
he can't do that, what the district court would have had 
to say is, Mr. Burton, you're not allowed to challenge 
the 1994 judgment.  And let's assume for the moment he 
could have challenged the 1998 judgment.  The district 
judge would have said, "Now Mr. Burton, you're only 
challenging your conviction for the 1994 judgment.  You 
need to wait until you're ready to challenge your 
sentence, and then you can challenge the 1998 judgment." 
Presumably -- and this is I think a fair inference 
especially from the petition itself as it is reprinted, 
since he told the district court that he was challenging 
his sentence, if he was told he couldn't bring it at 
that time he would have said okay, I will withdraw it 
and wait until I can challenge my sentence.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But if the first proceeding 
was not in fact jurisdictionally barred, then you would 
lose under the second and successive objection in this 
case, right?

 MR. FISHER:  I don't know that we would, 

Justice Souter.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why not?
 MR. FISHER:  Because it is a common rule 

that -- this Court hasn't had a case exactly like this, 
but the lower courts do all the time; and the Fourth 
Circuit case in Taylor which I've cited in the reply 
brief is one of them.  Where, it is a common practice 
for a petitioner to bring one petition against a 
judgment and then be partially successful, and then 
bring a new petition against something in the new 
judgment.  And that's essentially what happened here. 
And it may --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Aren't those cases in which 

the first judgment is complete, he simply does not 
attack everything that was a predicate for the first 
judgment; and then if there is, in fact, a new trial, 
and a new judgment, of course, the habeas possibility 
arises again, whereas in this case, the first judgment 
was not complete.

 MR. FISHER:  No, you put your finger on it 
exactly.  And so, but we still think that, that, either 
the court had jurisdiction or it didn't.  And if it had 
jurisdiction, then it must be -- fall in somehow into 
the category that you're talking about.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But that's not necessarily 

true.  Isn't it also possible if, at the time of the

first judgment the judge could have said, well you really 
haven't exhausted your remedies because it is not final 
until the whole thing is over.  But nevertheless, 
because exhaustion is not a jurisdictional matter, I'm 
going to go ahead and decide it.

 MR. FISHER:  Could a district judge have 

done that?

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.
 MR. FISHER:  I think what would have needed 
to have happened here, since Mr. Burton at pages 35 and 
40 of the joint appendix, told the district judge, I'm 
still challenging my sentence on direct appeal, under 
AEDPA and customary comity principles, the judge would 
have needed to say, you need either to renounce that 
appeal from the State court or renounce this one.  You 
couldn't do both at the same time.

 Mr. Burton, if he had wanted to, I think it 
is fair to say, could have gone into district court and 
said, I now have a new judgment and I'm going to 
challenge my conviction and sentence because I have no 
intention of challenging my sentence through State court 
proceedings.  And perhaps he could have done that.  But 
that would be a very different situation than what we 
have here.

question, another angle at this is not simply to look at 
the text of this Court's opinion in Apprendi which we 
submit told a State court in this situation all it would 
have needed to know, but also perhaps it is helpful to 
look behind that and look at the statutes that were in 
play in New Jersey and in Washington.  And even if you 
did that it becomes, we submit, very clear that a 
district judge, any reasonable trial judge, that is, 
would have known that Apprendi applied here.

 What you had in New Jersey was essentially 

two statutes.  One that said an ordinary commission of a 
crime is punishable up to 10 years.  And a second 
statute that said if you commit that crime with some 
kind of extra -- extra bad circumstance, there a hate 
crime, then you get -- you can get a higher sentence.

 Exactly the same thing was true in 

Washington.  We had one statute that said this is what 
the, this is what the punishment is for the ordinary 
commission of this crime.  And we had an extra statute 
that said, but if you commit that crime with extra bad 
circumstances -- and here the only difference was, there 
was a list of circumstances, not just a single one --
but if you commit the crime with extra circumstances, 
then you can get extra punishment.

 And the analogy that the respondents want to

draw between the Washington sentencing system and the 
Federal guidelines just simply doesn't hold up.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think Blakely 

was not a new rule but Booker was?

 MR. FISHER:  I think that's fair to say, 

Mr. Chief Justice.  Because in Blakely all you needed to 
do was apply Apprendi which said that if you have two 
different statutory thresholds, the pertinent threshold 
for Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment purposes is 
the one that cabins the judge's discretion based on the 
facts in the jury verdict.  To decide Booker this Court 
had to take the term statutory maximum and apply that to 
a different type of threshold, which was as this Court 
put it a court rule or a quasi legislative enactment.

 So under -- under the system that this Court 
reviewed in Booker, you had only a single true statutory 
maximum.  And then you had to decide whether the 
Apprendi principle ought to be in play for the Federal 
sentencing guidelines.  And if there is any confusion on 
that, a trial judge could have looked at Apprendi itself 
where this Court and Justice Thomas's concurrence made 
clear that there was unique status of the Federal 
sentencing guidelines that made it a more difficult 
question.

 However, here where you didn't have anything

like that, we had just a simple situation where there 
were two statutes, one maximum for the ordinary crime, 
and then an additional maximum for the crime being 
committed with aggravating circumstances.  And so it was 
a very clear map line.  And that's what this Court said 
in Blakely, of course.  It said, it didn't break any new 
ground in the decision in Blakely.  It simply said that, 
took the state's argument and rejected it by saying our 
precedents on this point are clear.  And it just simply 
quoted the Apprendi language, that the statutory maximum 
for Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment purposes is the 
maximum that a defendant may receive based on the facts 
and the jury verdict alone.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There were decisions 

going the other way.

 MR. FISHER:  There were lower court 

decisions?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.
 MR. FISHER:  Yes, there were.  And I think, 
if we want to talk about these, it is important first to 
be clear about what we are talking about.  There were, 
there was a Supreme Court of Kansas that had looked to 
the relevant language in Apprendi and decided that its 
sentencing guidelines system could not stand.  And then 
you had, on the other side the Supreme Court of

Washington, and the Supreme Court of Oregon, and a 
couple of other State intermediate courts, I think some 
in unpublished decisions, that had gone the other way.

 But I think it is very telling, Justice 

Ginsburg, if you want to look at those State supreme --
I'm sorry, those State supreme court and lower court 
decisions, because none of them -- not a single one --
quotes Apprendi or even acknowledges the passages in 
Apprendi that said the test is not one of form but of 
effect.  And there's several passages in Apprendi that 
said that the statutory maximum was the maximum allowed 
based on the facts in the jury verdict.  So once you 
take those into account, we submit, as the Kansas 
Supreme Court realized, there is only one conclusion 
that you can reach.  The only way those lower courts 
were able to come to a contrary decision was simply to 
pluck out -- pluck out other sentences of Apprendi and 
not acknowledge the rest of the opinion.  And of course, 
the rest of the opinion where this Court has these 
passages, pages 483, 482, are the absolute guts, the 
building blocks of the opinion itself.  It is where the 
Court canvasses the historical rule that was 
incorporated into our constitutional system.  And so it 
is not as though that is some sort of dicta that or 
loose language that this Court had in its opinion.  It

was the very guts of the holding of Apprendi.

 And we submit that, in a Teague analysis 

where you are indeed supposed to look to whether a 
reasonable jurist would have found something, not just 
the fact that they exist, but whether a reasonable 
jurist would have reached a given conclusion, once you 
take the whole of Apprendi into account, there was only 
one conclusion that a reasonable jurist could have come 
to.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I suppose that doesn't 

make the dissenters in Blakely feel very good.

 MR. FISHER:  Well, Justice Kennedy, I think, 

as I understand the dissents in, in Blakely, the 
dissents in Blakely primarily were saying that Apprendi 
itself was a bad idea.  And that Apprendi really wasn't 
dictated by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.  I see 
almost nothing, in fact really nothing in the dissents 
of Blakely itself that says taking Apprendi as the law, 
we can distinguish it from the facts in this case. 
There was nothing of that in the dissents.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of course you have to show 

that the result was dictated by the prior precedent. 
That's a strong phrase.  We said it in Stringer --
Stringer versus Black.  But if it has a new application, 
that's -- that's new.  Even though the principle is the

same.

Official 

 MR. FISHER:  I think the Stringer test is 
helpful because there, of course, this Court said that 
one of its prior decisions was not a new rule, because 
even though there was a different State sentencing 
system that slightly different before the Court in the 
subsequent case, the principle from the prior case 
dictated only one result.  And I think once you go back 
to the dissents in Blakely and compare them let's say, 
with the dissents in Booker, on the merits that is, in 
Booker, I think again it is telling, because the 
dissenters in Blakely had nothing to say in terms of a 
possible way to distinguish one case from the other; 
whereas in Booker, the dissents did point out we don't 
have to extend it this far.  We can limit to it to true 
statutes and not go this far.  So there is a difference.

 Really what this case, I think one way to 

phrase it in terms of what it comes down to, is whether 
when this Court lays a decision down like Apprendi, that 
has a clear rule and lots of historical, robust 
reasoning behind it, saying why we are adopting a 
certain rule, whether it is up to the lower courts, in 
this case the State courts, to second-guess this Court 
and say I don't know if the Court really means what it 
says, as Justice Breyer later put it in the Blakely

 We think that, we submit what this Court 
should say is that when we say something is the law, 
that lower courts ought to assume that's the law, at 
least until we tell them somehow that the law is 
different.

 If there are no more questions on the new 
rule, I will quickly address the watershed argument. 
Because if for some reason this Court adopted the 
state's view that really all Apprendi was was a highly 
formalistic rule about what is a statutory maximum, and 
that -- and that just simply labeling, courts could have 
evaded it, we think that Blakely itself then has to be 
considered a watershed exception -- a watershed rule. 
And the reason why is because, is because of an error 
that runs throughout the state's brief.

 And the state's position is basically that 

this can't be watershed because Apprendi and Blakely 
deal with circumstances where a defendant has already 
been convicted of a crime and all we're considering is 
what sentence ought to be imposed.  But, of course, that 
-- that contravenes the very holding of Apprendi and 
Blakely which is to remedy the fact that the defendant 
is being sentenced for a greater crime than the jury 
actually found him guilty of.  And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This argument, this 
argument assumes that we rule against you on whether or 
not it is a new rule.

 MR. FISHER:  I think that's right, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Don't you have --
don't you have to address AEDPA before we get to that 
question?

 MR. FISHER:  In the watershed realm?
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In other words, it 

doesn't matter it it's a watershed, I guess it is a 
point of argument, but it is not clear that it matters 
whether it is a watershed rule if you read AEDPA 
2254(d)(1) by its terms.

 MR. FISHER:  If this Court concluded in the 
Whorton case that watershed did not survive AEDPA, then 
of course you're right, watershed doesn't -- can't get 
us home here.  But as this case comes to the Court, as I 
understand it, this Court is considering this case in a 
posture that it really dealt with in Horn versus Banks 
where it said that even post AEDPA, what a court is 
supposed to do is conduct what this Court termed a 
threshold Teague inquiry as to whether Teague is 
satisfied.  And of course in Horn, this Court mentioned 
the watershed exception itself.

really do is address that threshold question to the 
extent it needs to holistically.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. COLLINS

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. COLLINS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I would like to begin where Justice Ginsburg 

began, with the issue of successive petitions.  We 
believe that the petition before this Court is a 
successive petition barred under AEDPA.  Now my brother, 
Mr. Fisher says that it's not a successive petition 
because the first petition challenged the 1994 judgment. 
But that is simply not correct as a matter of the facts 
of this case.

 A new judgment was entered in March of 1998. 

That judgment was entered as a result of Mr. Burton's 
conviction being affirmed and his sentence being 
reversed.  So when he was in custody, when he filed his 
first petition, he was in custody pursuant to that

Official 

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  So that is the only 

judgment that could be attacked on habeas?

 MR. COLLINS:  Exactly, Your Honor.  So he 

has an amended judgment filed in March of 1998.  He 
files his first petition challenging his conviction 
under that petition.  Later, in 2002, he files a second 
petition challenging his sentence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It doesn't matter --
I'm looking at joint appendix page 34, date of judgment 
of conviction, he puts in December 16, 1994.

 MR. COLLINS:  He does put that in, Your 

Honor, but I don't think that's determinative.  If you 
take a look at page 35, on question 8, they say, did you 
appeal from the judgment of conviction?  Answer, yes. 
If you did appeal, answer the following.  And it lays 
out the facts that he appealed, that his conviction was 
affirmed, that his sentence was reversed, and then a new 
judgment is entered in March of 1998.

 He is not in custody pursuant to the 1994 

judgment.  He is in custody --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where does it say a 

new judgment was issued in March of '98?

 MR. COLLINS:  Your Honor, that's in the 

joint appendix at page 3, which shows that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, I thought you 

meant it was in his petition.

 MR. COLLINS:  No, no, it wasn't in his 

petition, Your Honor, but it doesn't seem -- the fact 
that he was looking back at his conviction, original 
conviction being 1994, and that's what he wrote down, 
doesn't mean that that was the conviction and that was 
the judgment under which he was in custody, because it 
simply wasn't.  The original 1994 judgment no longer 
existed because a new judgment had been entered.  So 
because -- and I don't think -- I think what we disagree 
about in this is which judgment, if the first petition 
went to the first -- to the 1994 judgment, and the 
second petition went to the 1998 judgment, then we would 
agree with Mr. Fisher that it is not successive.

 On the other hand, I believe I heard him say 

that if you agree with us, that the only judgment in 
existence at the time he filed his petition was the 1998 
judgment.  Then he's filed a successive petition with 
regard to that judgment, one in December of 1998 dealing 
with the conviction; a second in 2002, dealing with the 
sentence.

 So since it's a successive petition and 

Mr. Burton did not go through the gatekeeping function 
that AEDPA requires, there is no -- the district court

had no jurisdiction and subsequently, we believe that 
this Court does not have jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The fact is, we're looking 

at page 34, 34 of the joint appendix, and that is the 
first petition that was filed; is that right?

 MR. COLLINS:  That's correct, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So you look at it and it 

says, filed December 28, and maybe this is what you 
said.  Then it says date of judgment of conviction, 
December 16, 1994.  So looking at that, you'd think that 
is what he was attacking.  Where does it say he's 
attacking anything else?

 MR. COLLINS:  Well, Your Honor, it doesn't 
say he's attacking anything else, but the problem with 
that is that when he filed this petition, he was not 
being confined --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but I imagine there 

are tens of thousands off petitions filed in the Federal 
system.  And I would think that judges when they're 
trying to look at those petitions, or the magistrate 
looks at them and says what judgment are you attacking, 
he has to figure that out often for statute of 
limitations purposes, or some other purpose.  He'd look 
over there, go down and read that line two, and he'd 
think yeah, that's the judgment that's being attacked,

unless of course there's some indication that it's 
something else.

 I've never heard of this before.  Is there 

any precedent on that where even though the petition 
refers to date A, and there's nothing in to suggest 
anything other than date A, because it turns out that 
there's a different judgment that in fact, he's being 
held, which is date B, that the court says oh, you're 
attacking date B.

 Is there any precedent that says that's how 

it's read?

 MR. COLLINS:  I'm not aware of any 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  So this might be the 
first time.  I don't see a reason why you wouldn't read 
the petition that's filed in an ordinary way and say the 
judgment that's being attacked is the judgment that it 
refers to.

have to say the judgment that's being attacked is the 
judgment by which he's being confined.  I mean, he --

court which have date A, and somebody is going to go 
back and say no, it is really date B or something.  I'm 
a little nervous about it.  If you're not nervous, 
you're the ones in charge.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, Mr. Collins, isn't it 
your position that, number one, the only judgment that he 
can attack on habeas is the judgment that is extant at the 
time of the habeas proceeding, and that is the '92 
judgment that follows the resentencing?  But he may in 
attacking that judgment attack the premise of conviction 
which occurred earlier?

 MR. COLLINS:  Exactly, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And if he chooses to attack 
only the earlier conviction which is the premise of the 
later judgment, he has simply in effect waived any other 
issue.  And when he comes in later and tries to raise 
the issue that he could have attacked under the '92 
judgment, he's in effect trying to split up his habeas, 
it's second and successive, and that's why he can't do 
it.

 MR. COLLINS:  That's exactly right, Your 

Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And further, I 

thought you told me that the petition goes on to

 MR. COLLINS:  Yes, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Which in other 

words, he details in the petition the subsequent history 
that would have resulted in a new judgment.

 MR. COLLINS:  That's right, Your Honor.
 Next I would like to go briefly to the 

question that Justice Souter asked about --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I just be sure I 

understand one thing about that?  So you're saying at 
the time he filed the petition on December 28, 1998, he 
had already had, the second judgment had already been 
entered by the Washington Supreme Court?

 MR. COLLINS:  It had been entered by the 

trial court, Your Honor, so he --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Pursuant to the reversal 

of the --

MR. COLLINS:  Exactly, Your Honor.  That 
sentence is on page -- if you look at page 3 of the 
joint appendix, that is the second amended judgment 
filed in the superior court in Washington on March 16, 
1998, and he was confined under the authority of this 
judgment.

MR. COLLINS:  Of the second judgment.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why does it make any less 

sense to allow separate habeas challenges to, first, the 
conviction, and then the sentence, than it does to allow 
separate appeals to this Court from each of those?  And 
once again under the statute, we entertain appeals only 
from final judgment, but you can bring here on 
certiorari the judgment of conviction, even though 
proceedings for the sentence are still in progress.
 MR. COLLINS:  Well, Your Honor, I think 

we're talking about the habeas corpus statute and there 
the Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  A fortiori, we have a lot 
more control over habeas corpus, which is an equitable 
remedy, than we do over, what is it, 1257, our 
jurisdictional statute under certiorari.

 Why does it make any more sense for habeas 

purposes to insist that he await the final sentence 
before he gets review of the premise for that sentence, 
namely the conviction?

 MR. COLLINS:  Your Honor, I'm sorry.
 I think that a couple things are being 

confused here.

this a successive -- is this a successive petition, and 
we would say it is, because he filed the first one and 
then the second one.

 Now the question of whether he can get 

relief under the first -- under his first habeas 
petition does not depend on the entry of a final 
judgment.  In fact, under the facts of this case, the 
judgment was entered in March of 1998.  In December of 
1998, he filed his first petition.  And in fact, the 
first petition was denied in April of 2000 on the 
merits, because it had been exhausted, he didn't have to 
wait for that, because those claims were exhausted and 
because they were ripe, because they -- the factual 
predicates had occurred in the trial court, then that 
was all that was required for him to bring those claims. 
He didn't have to wait for a final judgment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you're saying he can't 

later bring any claim about the sentence?

 MR. COLLINS:  That's because Congress in 
AEDPA has declared that you have to bring all of your 
claims in your -- at one time, and if you don't, then 
your petition should be dismissed as successive, unless 
you go through the gatekeeping solution.

second and successive requirement comparable to the 
AEDPA requirement, the case that Justice Scalia put 
would be exactly like this case?

 MR. COLLINS:  I believe so, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 MR. COLLINS:  So I just briefly want to go, 

Justice Souter, to where you started about the 
consecutive sentence issue.

 We believe that consecutive sentence is 

quite different than, from what exists in Blakely and 
that, in fact, there aren't really additional findings 
of fact.  I think you referred to about the crime, about 
the circumstances, about the character.  In fact, in 
this case, the finding of fact entered by the trial 
court in order to justify the exceptional sentence --
this is on page 27 of the joint appendix, finding of 
fact 18 -- if the court were to sentence the defendant 
to a standard range sentence on each count run 
concurrently, he would receive the same punishment as if 
he had committed only the rape in the first degree. 
This would effectively result in the free crimes 
of robbery in the first degree and burglary in the first

this.  I'm sorry.  Is that sufficient, as you understand 
it, under the Washington case that your brother cited to 
me?

 MR. COLLINS:  I believe it is, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought the law was 
that the sentence shall be concurrent unless, and the 
unless is that the judge makes an additional finding, 
the very same kind of finding that he would make in 
determining aggravating factor.

 MR. COLLINS:  Your Honor, the sentence could 

have been run consecutively because of an aggravating 
factor.  In fact, in this case the trial court judge, in 
fact, had three independent and separate reasons for 
running the sentence consecutively.  Two of those would 
be, I think we would say aggravating factors that the 
Blakely reasoning would apply to.  But the court of 
appeals when it considered this case only looked at the 
free crimes element to make that decision.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Maybe you can give me just 
a little more help on this.  The finding number 18 that 
you referred to says in substance, if by just sentencing 
him on the basis of the jury verdict he won't get --
he'll get a free pass.  But it doesn't say the judge 
can -- could therefore increase the sentence.  It seems

to me there had to be additional findings that justify a 
result that he thought would have been a miscarriage of 
justice.

 MR. COLLINS:  No, Your Honor.  I don't think 

that's right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  You think that just having 

pointed out that he would get a pass would have been 
sufficient to justify consecutive sentences?

 MR. COLLINS:  I think it would, and the 

State supreme court affirmed this decision.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yeah, but he did make 

additional findings.  It goes on.  In fact, 19 and 20 
are additional findings.

 MR. COLLINS:  Your Honor, I think -- I mean, 

I agree with you that he did make additional findings. 
But --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  It nowhere says they're 

unnecessary either.

 MR. COLLINS:  That's true, Your Honor.  But 
if you take a look at the court of appeals opinion which 
is at page 52 and 53 of the joint appendix, when the 
court of appeals looks at the sentence, what the court 
of appeals says is, "nonetheless, the sentencing court 
concluded that the multiple offender policy alone 
justified the exceptional sentence.  The fact that the

defendant offender score for rape in the first degree is 
16, thus invoking the multiple offense policy of the 
Sentencing Reform Act standing alone, is a substantial 
and compelling reason and justification for imposing the 
exceptional sentence here."

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  That is to say that that 

would have been sufficient.

 MR. COLLINS:  Exactly.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But in fact that is not 

what the trial court premised its decision on, because, 
as Justice Stevens points out, it went on in findings 
19, 20, and 21 about deliberate cruelty, sophistication 
and planning, and so on.  Having been through those 
findings, the court says, from the foregoing facts the 
court now makes the following conclusions of law.

 It seems to me as though the trial court was 
basing its decision on those foregoing facts as well as 
upon finding 18, which was the free crime finding.
 MR. COLLINS:  Well, I think that the --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  I guess what I'm saying is 
the fact that he might have -- I'm assuming for the sake 
of argument that the trial court might on the basis 
simply of the free crime conclusion have sentenced 
consecutively, is simply not the case that we've got, 
because he sentenced consecutively on that basis and on

cruelty, sophistication, and so on.

 MR. COLLINS:  Well, Your Honor, I believe 
that the court of appeals felt that that consecutive 
sentence on the free crimes was -- standing alone would 
have been sufficient.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't want to take you 
up.  Let me just have one on the merits, one.  I mean, 
the reason I want you to get to the merits, and I put in 
my dissent.  I was trying as hard as I could to show why 
I thought this case was wrong.  I start the dissent by 
saying that -- what it says, and then I quote the two 
sentences that any fact, et cetera, any fact that 
increases beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must 
be submitted to a jury and prescribed statutory maximum, 
again quote, means "solely on the basis of the facts 
reflected in the jury verdict."  Okay.

 Then at the end of the opinion I say: 

"Until now I would have thought the Court might have 
limited Apprendi so its underlying principle wouldn't 
cause so much harm."  Now, the next sentence of course I 
explain how they might have limited Apprendi, but 
somehow that disappeared from the opinion because I 
guess I couldn't think of it.

 So you're going to tell me now -- I mean, I 

didn't say how they might have limited Apprendi and I

couldn't think of how they might have limited Apprendi, 
and they read Apprendi to mean what it said.  Now, you 
tell me the phrase I might have put in but couldn't 
think of that would have limited Apprendi?

 MR. COLLINS:  Well, Your Honor, I think that 

you could have said that the definition of "statutory 
maximum" is the traditional statutory maximum that was 
at issue in Apprendi.  And in fact in the Apprendi 
decision the Court specifically, I think in response to 
Justice O'Connor's dissent, explained that Walton versus 
Arizona was still good law.  And as you know, in Walton 
the jury would find somebody guilty of aggravated first 
degree murder, but they could not receive the death 
penalty unless the judge made additional findings in a 
hearing.

 And it seemed to say that the statutory 

maximum was death and that in fact the judge's findings 
would not take you above that statutory maximum.  I 
think that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wasn't that overturned in 

Ring?

 MR. COLLINS:  It was overturned in Ring, 
Your Honor.  But when you had lower court appellate 
judges looking at your decision in Apprendi and seeing 
the fact that Walton and Apprendi were consistent, it

was logical for them to conclude, as virtually every 
single court did except for Kansas, that the definition 
of "statutory maximum" was the traditional statutory 
maximum that was in Apprendi.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Was it logical for them to 

conclude it or were they -- were they expressing the 
hope that the Court would draw a distinction which it 
had not drawn in the formulation that it gave in 
Apprendi?  It's one thing to say that if you draw no 
further distinctions, Apprendi requires a certain 
result.  It's another thing to say but maybe they will 
draw a distinction and we're going to predict that they 
will, and hence not apply Apprendi.

 Weren't the other appellate courts to which 
you refer engaged in the latter exercise, which I call 
the exercise of hope?

 MR. COLLINS:  I'm not sure that I would 

agree with that, Justice Souter, only because as I think 
Justice O'Connor explained in her dissent, there are two 
ways to read Apprendi, and one of those ways would 
result in upholding guideline systems which are now 
invalid because of Blakely and Booker, but really quite 
different from Apprendi because those systems involve 
what you would call guided discretion.  That is, in 
Apprendi if you wanted the aggravating factor if the

judge found it by a preponderance then the sentence was 
enhanced.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay, but doesn't that 
require drawing a distinction that Apprendi did not 
speak to?  And isn't it still the case that, I think 
Mr. Fisher points out that three times we repeated in 
Apprendi the formula about fact, beyond fact found by a 
jury on the basis of which, et cetera, the range 
increases.

 Isn't the distinction which -- and I trust 
your recollection here -- that Justice O'Connor had in 
mind and that they had in mind a distinction which 
simply was not addressed in Apprendi and would have been 
something new as opposed to merely an application of 
what was implicit in Apprendi?

have been something new, Your Honor.

Official 

 If I could begin by addressing the issues 

that you were just talking about, there was a 
distinction that the Court could have drawn between 
Apprendi and Blakely and that reasonable jurists could 
have drawn and did draw.  One was the formal distinction 
that you were discussing before with the State, which 
was supported by Justice O'Connor's proposing that as an 
interpretation in her dissent and the majority not 
responding to that, that that distinction was contrary 
to the rule but implausible, but in fact accepting 
the -- accepting that it was a plausible distinction and 
saying that it still wouldn't have made a difference, 
that the Apprendi rule still was important.

 The second -- and in addition to that, that 

distinction that Justice O'Connor drew there was 
consistent with the Apprendi Court's distinction of 
Walton.  And you have to look at what reasonable jurists 
could have interpreted looking at that decision at the 
time with those distinctions and what the Court said in 
Apprendi.

 But in addition to that, there was more than 
a formal distinction that could have been drawn between 
the system in Apprendi and the Washington guidelines 
system.  That's the distinction that we proposed in our

amicus brief in Blakely and it rested on the fact that 
sentencing guideline systems like Washington try to 
channel but not to eliminate the discretion that 
sentencing judges have to sentence within the otherwise 
applicable limits.  And in the Washington system the 
sentencing judge retained a significant degree of 
discretion that reasonable jurists could have analogized 
to traditional sentencing systems that aren't 
constrained by Apprendi.

 The facts, the facts on which the judge 

could rely to go above the guidelines, were not 
specified as in Apprendi and as in Ring by the 
legislature, but it was a wide open set that enabled the 
judge himself or herself to determine what facts the 
judge thought could justify a higher sentence; and in 
addition, the facts alone didn't trigger the higher 
sentence.  The judge had to look at those facts and make 
the additional determination that those facts rose to 
the level of substantial and compelling reasons that 
justified the higher sentence.

 In that respect, the judge had a degree of 
sentencing discretion to decide what facts justified it 
and whether it was in fact justified.

 Now, of course, this Court rejected those 

distinctions in Blakely.  But the question is whether a

reasonable jurist could have accepted those distinctions 
and drawn a difference, and we submit that they could 
have.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Roberts, do you 
have a position on whether we have a successive petition 
problem here?

 MR. ROBERTS:  We don't have a position on 

that precise, on that particular issue here, because it 
can't arise for Federal prisoners.  But let me explain 
why it can't arise for Federal prisoners because perhaps 
that will give the Court some guidance in resolving the 
issue.  In the Federal system, it's well established 
that the conviction and the sentence are part of a 
unitary judgment and that that unitary judgment doesn't 
become final until the conviction and the sentence have 
both been fully adjudicated.

 That understanding is reflected in the 

language of 28 U.S.C. 2255, which is the statute that 
authorizes collateral attacks by Federal prisoners. 
That statute authorizes attacks -- what it authorizes is 
motions to vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence.  So 
it's clear from that that it's not authorizing 
collateral attacks on a conviction independent of the 
attendant sentence.  And I think that could shed some 
guidance here, because 2255 was intended to be a

parallel and substitute remedy to traditional habeas for 
Federal prisoners.

 I would also make a point on the other sort 
of preliminary issues that were being discussed on the 
consecutive sentence issue, that it's not only the fact 
that the judge said that the multiple offense policy 
standing alone could justify the consecutive sentence 
here and that the court of appeals relied on that in 
upholding that.

 But the court of appeals went further, 

because petitioner had made a separate challenge to --
and this is on page 52 and 53 of the joint appendix. 
Petitioner made a separate challenge to the other two 
aggravating factors.  Petitioner argued that the 
district court wasn't allowed to rely on -- excuse me, 
the trial court couldn't rely on those two other 
aggravating factors because he had not relied on them in 
the original sentencing and this was a resentencing.

 The court of appeals rejected that challenge 

and it rejected that challenge because it said the 
sentencing court concluded that the multiple offense 
policy alone justified the exceptional sentence, and 
then on page 53 it said:  "The sentencing court did not 
rely on the additional aggravating factors for imposing 
an exceptional sentence."  So I think these --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is that true in fact?
 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, that is how --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  I'm mean, I'm sure you're 
reading correctly, but is that in fact true?  Because, 
having talked, as I just read out a moment ago, having 
spoken about free crimes, aggravating factors, it says, 
on the basis of the foregoing facts I now draw the 
following conclusions of law.

 MR. ROBERTS:  The trial court said each of 
the three standing alone was sufficient.  But what the 
court of appeals said is these other two have been 
challenged, but these other two are -- we're not going 
to deal with this challenge to these other two 
factors because they're out of the case.  So I think 
that this Court has to take the case as coming from --
coming from the Washington courts as if what the courts 
essentially said is those other two are not in the case 
any more.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  So we can treat it in 

effect -- and this may be the way to do it -- we can 
treat it as the ultimate sentencer was the Washington 
appellate court and that's what they said?

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, what the Washington 

appellate court essentially, they could have said 
petitioner is right, those other two aggravating factors

couldn't be relied on, and so we're relying on this the 
standing alone.  What they chose to do is, we're going 
to interpret what the trial court did as relying only on 
the one.  And that was the basis for responding to that 
claim of error, and I do think that the Court has to 
take this case as coming on that basis.

 If I could turn to the issue of Blakely 
retroactivity for a few minutes.  In addition to the 
points that I made before about why Blakely was a new 
rule, I would also submit that Blakely is not a 
watershed rule because it's not a bedrock rule that's 
essential to a fair trial, and rules are only bedrock if 
they approach the fundamental and sweeping importance of 
Gideon, and Blakely doesn't have that kind of importance 
for three reasons.  First, the right to counsel 
pervasively affects every aspect of the trial, but 
Blakely affects only the procedure for determining the 
punishment of defendants who have already been found 
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of all the elements of a 
crime.

 Second, a felony trial in which the 

defendant is denied counsel is inherently unfair, but 
it's not inherently unfair to use the preponderance 
standard to find facts that determine the extent of 
punishment, and in fact the Constitution permits the use

of a preponderance standard to find many facts that have 
as much or more impact on punishment as facts covered by 
Blakely.  Those include facts that trigger mandatory 
minimums, facts on which a judge relies to sentence 
within a broad statutory range, and even facts on which 
a judge relies to sentence above the standard range in 
advisory guideline systems.

 Third, counsel is so essential to a fair 

trial that deprivation of the right can never be 
discounted as harmless error.  But this Court held in 
Recuenco that Blakely errors can be harmless, and in 
reaching that holding the Court expressly concluded that 
Blakely errors do not necessarily render a criminal 
trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for 
determining guilt or innocence.

 That conclusion seems to strongly suggest 
that Blakely is not a bedrock rule essential to a fair 
trial.

 If the Court has no further questions --

merits.  On jurisdiction, I think Mr. Roberts is right 
that this rarely happens in the Federal system.  It 
rarely happens in the State system.  We can't find any 
other case where a petitioner has gone in naming, as the 
State would say, in effect the wrong judgment and 
saying:  "I'm challenging this judgment."

 But what happened here was just that. 

Mr. Burton went in and said he was challenging the 1994 
judgment.  And under this Court's Castro decision, when 
a pro se petitioner comes in and says I'm doing one 
thing, in that case making a motion for a new trial, it 
can't be converted into something else which is a first 
habeas petition without advising the petitioner.  And 
here, not only was he not advised by the trial court but 
the State in its own answer, which we attached to our 
reply brief, agreed that he could challenge the 1994 
conviction, and said that conviction is final, and he 
can challenge that judgment, the 1994 judgment.

 So it's way too late in the day for the 

State to stand up to you now and say this pro se 
petitioner should bear the burden of bringing an 
improper petition.

 On the merits, I don't want to elaborate 

beyond simply just telling this Court that if you look 
at the Hughes decision and you look at the Washington

decision from the Washington state courts, it is clear 
that an extra finding was necessary here, even if the 
only aggravator in play is the free crimes are clearly 
too lenient factor.  Hughes makes it crystal clear that 
a judge needs to find, and I'm quoting, "extraordinarily 
serious harm or culpability arising from the multiple 
offenses."  And to the extent that the State stands 
before you now and quotes from parts of Mr. Burton's 
case where the trial judge did not explicitly make that 
finding, that only reinforces the strength of his habeas 
petition now, that under Washington state law, the judge 
needed to make that kind of an extra finding and the 
judge didn't do so.

 Let me finally turn to a discussion about 
whether this Court's treatment of Walton and Apprendi 
could have given a State judge a reasonable basis to 
distinguish the system at issue in Blakely.  We don't 
think it could because this Court didn't simply say in 
Apprendi that Walton stands.  It explicitly said the 
reason why the Arizona capital system as we understand 
it is okay is because it's nothing more than a system 
that is permissible under Williams against New York.

 It's one where on the basis of the jury's 
finding of guilt that the death penalty is permissible 
without anything else.  And so the only disagreement

between the majority and Justice O'Connor's dissent was 
as to the way Arizona's system worked, but any judge that 
would have looked at Apprendi would have seen, the 
majority is telling us that a system is okay so long as 
the jury verdict itself allows the ultimate sentence.

 That is exactly the kind of system that was 
not in place in Washington, so a judge should have full 
well realized.

 And of course as Justice Ginsburg pointed 
out, once it became clear to this Court the way that 
Arizona's capital sentencing system functioned, this 
Court had little difficulty simply applying the Apprendi rule 
and agreeing that that system had to be invalid too. 
And just like the Blakely decision itself, not even the 
dissenters suggested that Apprendi dictated otherwise.

 If this Court has no further questions, I'll 

submit the case.
