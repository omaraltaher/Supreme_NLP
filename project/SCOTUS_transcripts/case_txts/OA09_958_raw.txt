            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 09-958,

Douglas v. Independent Living Center of Southern

California, and the consolidated cases.

            Ms. Schwartz.

           ORAL ARGUMENT OF KARIN S. SCHWARTZ

              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

            There are many reasons why this Court should

not recognize a private cause of action to enforce

30(A), and I'd like to focus on three.  First is

separation of powers.  Congress controls who can enforce

Federal law, and it has not provided for -- for private

enforcement of 30(A).  Instead, it has provided for

administrative enforcement.

            Second is the Spending Clause context in

which the case arises.  The very legitimacy of Spending

Clause legislation depends on the States' voluntary and

knowing acceptance of its obligations.  For this reason,

if Congress wants to provide for private party

litigation, it must do so clear and unambiguously, and

it has not done so in this case.

            And third is the language of 30(A) itself,

which is broad and undefined and which includes

competing policy interests.  These are suited to

administrative enforcement, with all the expertise and

judgment and discretion and administrative know-how that

can be brought to bear.

            These three principles all focus -- all

point to one conclusion -- that section 30(A) is not

enforceable.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Schwartz, the

government doesn't have the injunctive power -- as far

as California's rates are concerned, California puts

them into effect.  The government can't stop that from

happening, even if the government thinks that they are

in violation of the Medicaid Act; is that right?

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  No, Your Honor, it -- it is

not.  I mean, in the sense that it can't go out

immediately and get an injunction, Your Honor is

correct.  However, the government has the power to deny

a State --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but that's a very

drastic remedy, and it's going to hurt the people that

Medicaid was meant to benefit.  Does the government have

any injunctive power, or is its only -- only remedy a

fund cutoff?

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  Well, its only remedy

provided by statute is to terminate funds.  However, it

is not a drastic remedy; it -- and it is the remedy

that's provided --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How often has it

happened?

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  How often does it happen?

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How -- how often has in

the Medicaid context --

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  Very rarely, and the reason

for that is because the way that most State plan

amendments operate is that these issues are resolved on

a consensual basis, generally within the 90 days

provided by regulation.  This case is the exception that

proves the rule.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Ms. Schwartz, isn't it

the exception because in fact you end-run -- end-ran the

administrative process, that you put your regulations,

your new rate schedules, into effect even before you

submitted them to HHS, and continued them in effect

while HHS was considering them, and continued them in

effect to the extent that you were allowed to do so by

injunction, even after HHS disapproved them?

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  There is no end run here

because HHS's own regulations provide that our time for

submitting a State -- State plan amendment is within the

90 days that the amendment will take effect, and HHS

will confirm that -- this is the position of the Federal

Government that the State may implement its rate

reductions while the State plan amendment is pending.

It does so at the risk that, if a State plan amendment

is disapproved, that it may have to pay additional

funds.  But we did not do an end run around anything.

We are entirely consistent with the administrative

process.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could a State in its own

courts provide for procedures whereby adversely affected

parties could test the regulation?

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  I don't believe so.  And

that's because in --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me you have to

say that.  Otherwise the next question would be under

Gonzaga, you wouldn't say that a State can entertain a

monetary cause of action.  So, I think that's consistent

with your position.

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  Well, and I think what's very

important to focus on here is that this is not just any

Federal statute that's being enforced, but it is a

Spending Clause provision that is vague and ambiguous in

its terms.  It cries -- it has all these policy elements

to it, and it cries out for administrative review.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, when you say -- that

brings me to a slightly different point.  You -- you

introduce the fact or the consideration of what's

administratively workable.  The brief by the former HHS

officials says quite to the contrary.  It -- it says

that there are almost $400 billion of HHS expenditures

that are supervised by 50 people.  That works out to 800

million each; and they say, we don't have time for this.

And it's much more efficient and it's much more

consistent with the application of -- proper application

of Federal law to allow this action to be brought in the

-- in the courts.

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  I have two answers, Your

Honor.  One is that I don't think it is more efficient

to have 700 district court judges interpreting a statute

that does not have any objective standard but that is

susceptible to many different interpretations.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Ms. Schwartz, the

agency --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I mean, that's "the

sky is falling" -- 700 judges.  It would be just each

district if it were in every district.  And it -- it --

and certainly to the extent we are involving a State,

there would be only one State involved.  So -- so, there

is just the State of California, and there are only four

districts there, and the suit could only be brought in

one.  So, I -- I think that's an -- you know, I don't

think that the "sky is falling" argument really works.

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  But California is now subject

to standards that don't apply anywhere else in the

country, and I believe the Court acknowledged exactly

this problem just last term in Astra v. Santa Clara when

it declined to allow private parties to use a contract

provision to do an end run around Gonzaga,

Sandoval versus -- Sandoval v. Alexander; I think I have

that reversed -- and the other cases that, based on

separation of powers of principles, based on Spending

Clause principles, limit the -- the circumstances in

which private parties can sue.

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you asking us to adopt a

rule that is good for this one case only?

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  A --

            JUSTICE ALITO:  You gave -- or is there --

could you state the rule in broader terms or more

neutral terms?

            And you gave three reasons why we should

reverse.  One, Congress hasn't created a cause of action

here.  Well, Congress has never created causes of

action, never creates a cause of action in any case in

the Ex parte Young line or cases like that.

            The Supremacy Clause, because this is a

Spending Clause -- this was an act under the Spending

Clause.  But you're not asking us to hold that Spending

Clause legislation can never pre-empt State legislation,

I take it.

            And then the language of 30(A), where you --

are you arguing that 30 -- that the Medicaid Act

affirmatively precludes any action like this?  I don't

understand that -- is -- is any of those arguments

sufficient by itself, or do you have to take them all

together, and you're asking for a rule that only applies

here?

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  No, all of the -- all of

those arguments are sufficient, as is the fact that, as

we briefed, the Supremacy Cause itself doesn't supply a

cause of action.  But let me focus on those three

points.

            These are points -- the rule that we are

seeking is that a Federal statute is not enforceable

unless Congress intends for it to be enforceable and

that that principle has special force with respect to

Spending Clause provisions where Congress has to clearly

and unambiguously provide for that enforcement, because

the State has to be on fair notice, due to the nature of

the Spending Clause, of the obligations to which it is

agreeing.  That is Pennhurst.  And that is applied with

even greater force with respect to 30(A) because of the

type of standards that it incorporates.

            If it's not suitable for -- if the

determination applying Gonzaga is that you're -- if

you're finding under 1983 the administrative nature and

flexible nature of those standards is not appropriate

for private enforcement, that shouldn't matter what

vehicle you are using to bring the case.

            And I want to just -- to put this into real

clear context.  In the 3 years that this case has been

pending, California has submitted 68 State plan

amendments outside of the rate context.  Thirty-six of

them were approved.  The rest were withdrawn

voluntarily.  These cases -- and they were all approved,

almost all of them, within the 90-day period.  So,

the --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me.  Were

those --

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  -- administrative process

works.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Were those amendments

submitted before they took effect or after they had

taken affect, like here?

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  I don't know the answer to

that question.  These are non-rate -- rate-related

amendments, State plan amendments.  But the point is the

administrative process is working.  We obtained -- and

it resolves, in the usual case, in a consensual

resolution that is consistent with the cooperative

nature of the joint venture between --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm --

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  -- the States and the Federal

Government.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's where I'm a

little bit confused.  The injunction here only stopped

you from implementing the rate changes until you got

approval from HHS in its administrative process that it

was going to approve the amendment, correct?

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  No, I don't believe the

injunctions were that limited.  And so, if we obtained

State plan approval, we then would have to go back to

the courts and argue over what the impact is of -- of

the State plan.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a separate

question about whether the courts are required to give

deference to an HHS finding.  But the injunction here

wasn't one that said you could never do this.  It just

said go finish the process, right?

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  No, the injunctions were not

so conditional.  And the -- and the point I want to make

is the injunctions have disrupted the administrative

process as it is intended to work by drawing out the

process, by politicizing the process, by prejudicing our

ability to get State plan approval because now there's

the concern about what about retroactive relief if we

approve your State plan --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the courts, I take

it, have the prerogative, perhaps even the obligation,

under the primary jurisdiction rationale to simply

withhold adjudication until the agency acts.

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  And we requested that in some

of these cases, and the courts ignored that argument.

And so, the upshot is that we are now --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's an abuse of

discretion, not an absence of power.  You're arguing an

absence of power.

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  Well, there is no cause of

action.  That's correct, Your Honor.  Our position is

that there is no cause of action here.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, can I go back to the

question that Justice Alito asked you about why there's

no cause of action?  You are asking us to treat the

Supremacy Clause differently from every other

constitutional provision.  Why should we?

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  Well, for several reasons,

Your Honor.  First, when -- what you're doing here, what

the Court is doing here, is enforcing a Federal statute.

You look through the Supremacy Clause to the

obligations that --

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  The Supremacy Clause is part

of the Constitution.

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  It is.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  And the Petitioners here --

excuse me.  The -- the plaintiffs here essentially said

that the Supremacy Clause as part of the Constitution

had been violated and sought, not damages, but only a

prospective injunction.  And the question is, why the

court shouldn't do what the court has done many, many,

many times before, tens and tens and tens of times

before, and say, yes, that's our prerogative and we'll

proceed to the merits?

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  Two points, Your Honor.

First, they did seek damages, and they obtained damages

in Independent Living.  And second is the obligations

that are imposed, the study requirement, the data

requirement, all these obligations are imposed by 30(A).

You look through the Supremacy Clause to the statute to

see the obligations.  And so, the question is, does

Congress get to control who enforces those obligations

or not?

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  In a -- in a cause of -- in

a suit that's brought under a statute directly, a person

could be claiming damages.  Here that is not the case.

A person is only claiming injunctive relief.  And that

should -- there should be a difference between those two

in terms of when the cause of action is available.

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  First, just one point:  In

Independent Living, they did claim damages, and they

obtained damages.  But setting that issue aside, no,

Your Honor, this Court has -- has the obligation and the

right with respect to constitutional provisions to

determine how they will be enforced, subject potentially

to congressional action, but there is far more latitude

for the Court.  With respect to statutes, of course, as

this Court is explained in Davis v. Passman, deference

to congressional intent is appropriate.  And here --

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose the plaintiffs

here were facing an imminent State enforcement action.

Would your argument be different?

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  Well, if -- if the plaintiffs

fell within -- yes.  And if the plaintiffs fell within

the bill in equity to restrain enforcement proceedings

that was at issue in Ex parte Young and that Justice

Kennedy has discussed in terms of the immunity to

invalid regulation, then the result would be different.

But there are several reasons why --

            JUSTICE ALITO:  But how does that square

with the argument that you made that -- relying on

separation of powers, the Spending Clause, and the

language of 30(A)?  All of those are still in play --

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  For a couple --

            JUSTICE ALITO:  -- in that situation.

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  Well, for a couple of

different reasons.  First of all, a defense, which is

what you're asserting in such a case, is not a cause of

action.  And so, it doesn't implicate the separation of

powers concerns to the same degree as a stand-alone

cause of action to compel the State to comply with an

obligation owed to another entity.

            Also, in those cases, there -- in the equity

cases -- equity doesn't provide a remedy just for an

injury.  You have to have an invasion of what in old

times was called a primary right.  But what that means

is a right to property or a right in the person.  And

there were other kinds of primary rights, but --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what about the

providers who say, but under -- under the State law, if

we charge more than the hospitals -- if we charge more

than the State ceiling, we are subject to sanctions, so

this does fit into the category of anticipatory

defenses?

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  No, it does not, because we

have not threatened to enforce that statute.  They are

not arguing that statute is -- is pre-empted.  They --

the -- the statute that they are --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But wouldn't they be --

the rates go into effect.  Someone charges more on the

theory that the rates are impermissible under the

Supremacy Clause.  That person would be subject to

sanction under State law.

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  And that would be a different

case, and it would be a closer case, although even in

that context, because of the Spending Clause context in

which the case arises, I don't believe that they would

be able to challenge that as -- under the Supremacy

Clause.

            But that is not this case.  That case at

least presents the fact -- and the reason why it's a

closer case is because in that case there is regulation

and we are potentially infringing on their property.

However, what's the law that they are trying to assert

defensively there?  It is -- as a Spending Clause

provision that has administrative standards, that's been

entrusted to Congress.  So, shouldn't Congress be able

to enforce it?  Fundamentally, this Court --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  You spoke of

that, Justice Ginsburg's question, as though it was a

hypothetical.  But that could happen, couldn't it?  What

if one of these Respondents charged more than the State

law permits?  Wouldn't -- wouldn't the State move

against them?

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  Of course, we would, and they

would have a decision about whether to stay in the

Medicaid program or not.  But the question is, does this

Court exercise its equitable powers to create a cause of

action -- that Congress itself has not?  That's really

the question for this Court.

            In the Spending Clause context with respect

to this kind of standard that is suited for

administrative standards, we submit you should not.

            Unless there are any further questions, Your

Honor, I'd like to reserve our remaining time for

rebuttal.

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

            Medicaid is a cooperative program between

the Federal Government and the States.  Congress has not

created a cause of action under that Act for private

parties to enforce particular provisions of it.

            Nor does paragraph 30(A) confer private

rights that are enforceable under 1983.  Rather,

paragraph 30(A) is written in general terms that

describe the general undertaking by the State in its

bilateral relationship with the Federal Government.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Kneedler, is

your argument in this case limited to Spending Clause

legislation?

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  And what --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And if it's not, could

you please -- you said yes, it is.

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But give me the

theoretical foundation.  If the Supremacy Clause

doesn't -- I'm assuming you agree with your -- with

Petitioner that it doesn't provide for a cause of

action.

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that your position?

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then what gets all of

the cases that we've had since 1824 into this Court that

have granted injunctive relief on supremacy arguments?

            MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I think that the great

majority of those cases are ones in which the plaintiff

in the suit in equity is bringing an action anticipating

an action at law.  And there --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but we -- we have

plenty that don't:  King, Townsend, Carlson.  We've had

many others that are not dissimilar --

            MR. KNEEDLER:  They --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- from this case.

            MR. KNEEDLER:  I think that they -- though

that they do not reflect a general assumption that there

is a cause of action directly under the Supremacy

Clause, because as this Court said, the Supremacy Clause

is not itself a source of rights --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, go back and explain

to me how all of those cases --

            MR. KNEEDLER:  I think there is -- I think

one has to look to an equitable cause of action, which I

think is the way Ex parte Young describes what was going

on in that -- in that way, as anticipating -- it was a

defense anticipating an action at law.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, go to your --

Petitioner's response to one of my colleagues, to

Justice Scalia, when she said yes, if these providers

decide to charge the old rate to their patients, the

State will go after them.  How is that any different

than the cases where we're talking about railroads

charging -- not charging customers more than a State

commands because the penalty's too high, or --

            MR. KNEEDLER:  I --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- or those types of

cases that fall into this pre-emptive category that

you're talking about?

            MR. KNEEDLER:  That has not been plaintiffs'

theory of this case.  They have not said that we're

going to resort to self-help and charge more than the

State allows.  What they -- what they want to do is they

brought this suit to challenge the rates in the first

instance.  They are not claiming that they're going to

violate State law and charge more; they are simply

wanting to challenge the rates that the State has

charged.  If I could return to the --

could explain why --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, all they have to do, as

far as the Government is concerned, is amend their

complaint to say:  We intend to charge higher rates than

the State law allows.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And then you -- you'd agree

that the suit would lie.

            MR. KNEEDLER:  I'm -- I'm not sure.  There

would be further questions that would arise in that

context.  For example, it's -- I don't know whether --

whether a -- whether in a prosecution under the statute

for charging -- that prohibits charging more than State

rates allow, whether you can raise as a defense in that

prosecution a challenge to the validity of the rates.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, gee, we're not

deciding a whole lot here, then.  Just -- it's just a

matter of pleading that we're deciding, right?

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, that's why I'm saying

there might be a further question in -- in what you're

describing as to whether that would be a valid defense

in the State prosecution, because I can certainly

we would want them tested in affirmative --

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Kneedler, why should

this even matter so much whether there's a defense

available in a regulation that's brought against a

person or not?  In your brief, you admit that there are

numerous cases that don't fit within that category,

where the -- but where the -- where the State has acted

in some sense to change the behavior of the person, to

regulate the person, even if that person doesn't have a

proceeding in which to mount a defense.  And we -- this

Court has treated those cases in exactly the same way,

haven't they?

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, but unexamined.  And let

me say, we are not challenging those cases.  And the

Court, we think, doesn't need to look more broadly to a

theory.  We are -- to -- to an all-encompassing theory.

We are focusing on Spending Clause legislation in a

particular cooperative Federal/State program --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, you think --

            MR. KNEEDLER:  -- under the Spending Clause.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, you think there

may well be implied rights of action outside the

Spending Clause context.

to explain them is equitable cause of action drawing on

the courts' traditional equitable jurisdiction.  You

could call that an implied cause of action under the

Supremacy Clause, but I think, historically, it's been

described as an --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So --

            MR. KNEEDLER:  -- exercise of the courts'

equitable authority.  The court has equitable

discretion, and we think, because of the Spending Clause

nature of this legislation, it should not create a cause

of action --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, your -- your

answer to my earlier question was that you're not

arguing about that in this case.

focusing on --

challenging the existence of a cause of action at

equity.  I'm -- I'm just -- I think we would view it as

a cause of action in equity rather than implied under

the Supremacy Clause, but I think you may -- you might

get to the same place, but I think it is judicial

creation of a cause of action.  But if I could before my

time expires --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you do not even

exclude all Spending Clause cases.  You only exclude

those Spending Clause cases where -- where the plaintiff

does not say we are -- you know, we're going to violate

the State law, and they're going to come after us.  So,

you haven't made an exception for the Spending Clause.

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it -- I don't think

there's any categorical rule because, for example, under

Spending Clause cases, you can have rights enforceable

under 1983.  Our basic point is the Spending Clause is a

contractual relationship between the Federal Government

and the State, and the Respondents here are in the

position of the people asserting rights as third-party

beneficiaries to the bilateral relationship between the

United States and the -- and the States.  Under standard

contract law principles --

only if the parties intended him to be.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Kneedler, this is what

you said in your cert stage brief:  You said, "Those

programs in which the drastic measure of withholding all

or a major portion of the Federal funding is the only

available remedy" -- and you are talking here about

Spending Clause programs, obviously -- "would be

generally less effective than a system that also permits

awards of injunctive relief in private actions."

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, and the circumstances in

which the Court has made that point and that we agree

with are often in situations where you have Title 6,

Title 9 instances of individual discrimination that are

arising under Federal programs, or where you have a

right under 1983 where -- where there is an enforceable

right that a party has and is going into court and is

supplementing the agency's oversight.

            Here, under -- under paragraph 30(A), you

have only general standards that are really suitable for

administrative review, with balancing general --

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, can that really be the

difference?  I mean, do you think if 30(A) were

written -- were drafted as a formula, a rate schedule

formula, that there would be a cause of action, but

because 30(A) is more general in nature, that there is

no cause of action?  I mean, surely that's a question

for the merits of whether there is pre-emption or not.

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I -- I don't think it's

just a merits question.  I think it also goes to the

question whether the parties to the contract intended

third-party beneficiary-type rights to be able to sue

under -- under a -- what is really analogous to a

contract.

            I would also point out that this Court's

decision in Maine v. Thiboutot, which first recognized a

1983 cause of action, pointed to prior cases enforcing

Social Security programs, on the assumption that 1983

could have been the only source of the cause of action.

If there was an implied judge-made cause of action in

those circumstances, that assumption would have been

unwarranted.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Kneedler, before you

sit down, could you please enlighten us on two fact

points?  One is, what is the status of the 30(A)

rulemaking?  Because I take it once the rule is made, it

would get Chevron deference.  You said that there would

been planned amendments that have been submitted

covering some of these same rates.

            Justice Ginsburg, I also wanted to respond

to one of your questions.  I do believe the United

States would have an injunctive action in certain

circumstances.  For example, if the United States

disapproved a plan and a State continued to -- a plan

amendment, and a State continued to follow the terms of

the disapproved plan amendment, I think the United

States would have a cause of action to enforce --

            MR. KNEEDLER:  -- as the party to the

contract.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under a pre-emption --

Clause grounds in the State courts, that that would be

            First of all, I would like to focus on the

has never been a recognition of a cause of action in any

Ex parte Young case.  And that's a hundred percent true,

and I didn't hear response to the other side that

suggests anything to the contrary.

            And the reason for that is, obviously, what

this Court said in the Verizon case and what it said in

Shaw is that you look to the Supremacy Clause as the

basis for arising-under jurisdiction, and then if you

have jurisdiction, then you look to the traditional

equitable standards to determine whether they've been

satisfied in a particular case.

            And under this Court's decision in Ex parte

Young, what the Court said was "an injunction which

restrains the state officer from taking any steps

towards the enforcement of an unconstitutional

enactment, to the injury of the complainant" is the

basis for relief.  And that's exactly the circumstance

that we have in this case, and thus --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why isn't -- why

doesn't your position constitute a complete end run

around all of our implied right of action jurisprudence?

We've wasted a lot of time trying to figure out whether

there's an implied right of action under a particular

statute if there has always been one under the Supremacy

Clause?

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Mr. Chief Justice, there is a

very fundamental difference between an implied right of

action or an action under section 1983 and -- and a very

simple and straightforward Ex parte Young remedy that's

otherwise available.  Under 1983, at private rights of

action, the district courts, the Federal courts, State

courts for that matter in enforcing them, have authority

to grant damages, they have much broader injunctive

relief, and under section 1983, there's --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How can they have

much broader -- broader -- first of all, all of those

cases -- I don't know if all of them did, but certainly

a lot of them did include -- included claims for

injunctive relief.  And I would have thought the court's

authority under your equitable action under the

Constitution would be at least as broad as it would be

under the statute.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, Ex parte Young has been

pretty consistently evaluated as saying simply you

cannot do what the Constitution immediately prohibits

you from doing.  And so -- and, frankly, the Ex parte

Young remedy has been a negative --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But your position --

that the Constitution prohibits you from doing anything

where the State law is pre-empted by the Federal law.

That doesn't sound very narrow to me.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, but -- but if you go

back and look at the cases in which 1983 relief has been

involved, a case like Blessing -- in Blessing, the

complaint there sought essentially to take over the

entire State law function of providing support for

children.  And that was the injunctive relief that was

requested.  And if the Court had adopted the notion that

1983 carried with it a private right of action, that

would have been available relief; there would have been

a claim for damages in that circumstance; and there

would have been access to attorneys' fees.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if the --

            MR. PHILLIPS:  None of those things is

available here.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if the law that

Congress is -- Congress passes sets forth certain

Federal standards -- it's a cooperative Federal-State

law like this one -- and it says:  And there's no

private right of action for any individual to enforce

this.  That's limited to the Federal Government.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  In that -- in that situation,

there's obviously no authority to bring a private right

of action under the statute.  That still doesn't answer

the question whether or not there is a right to invoke

the Supremacy Clause --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, Congress can

say --

            MR. PHILLIPS:  -- when there's a conflict

between Federal and State law.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Congress can say in

the same statute that confers the allegedly pre-emptive

Federal standards that we do not want individuals

bringing actions in court to enforce this.  We want to

leave that up to HHS.  And you're saying, even though

Congress said that, individuals can nonetheless bring a

suit under the Supremacy Clause, the theory of which is

we are making sure that Federal law controls.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The same Federal law

that says you can't bring a cause of action.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  No, I understand that,

Mr. Chief Justice, but you still have the problem that

even under those circumstances, a regime can arise in

which there is a square and, in this case, you know, I

think undeniable, conflict between Federal and State

law, and the question is -- and that that conflict

imposes not only injury in fact to an individual but

also imposes irreparable harm.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you're saying then,

if Congress loud and clear says, we want HHS to be the

sole enforcer of this law, you're saying--

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Of the Federal statute.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Of this, yes.  You're

saying that that would be ineffective because there

could still be a Supremacy Clause claim.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  Whether or not you

would in fact get relief under the Supremacy Clause

seems to me a very --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's on the merits --

            MR. PHILLIPS:  -- tough question.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- but Congress says, we

don't want anybody coming into the court.  We want --

            MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't think Congress has

the authority to essentially say there are some

conflicts between Federal and State law that we will

simply ignore even though they cause irreparable injury.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that necessary to your

position, Mr. Phillips?

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because you could take the

view, right, that if Congress speaks to cut off a claim,

that's one thing, and a very different thing, than if

Congress has not spoken at all.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  And it seems to me

here is a situation where you would expect Congress to

have spoken explicitly --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then it's a question of

what will be the default rule.  Congress is silent.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Of course.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is the default rule that

there is a Supremacy Clause action or that Congress must

expressly allow it?

            MR. PHILLIPS:  And the reason why the

default rule would almost certainly be that in fact you

can bring the Ex parte Young cause of action is because

the effect -- the Spending Clause has been subject to

the -- to pre-emption claims since 1968.  This whole

notion that they contracted against this background of

what obligations did they assume -- the obligation that

they clearly would have assumed is that if in fact there

is a violation of Federal law based on a failure to

satisfy one of the conditions of spending under these

circumstances, you would -- they would be susceptible to

an Ex parte Young --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?

            MR. PHILLIPS:  -- injunctive action.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm -- I'm not certain of

this.  I find this a difficult case.  It seems to me the

Government is prepared to concede that if an individual

has a Federal right that he'd like to enforce and

someone is trying to block it by asserting a State law

that he thinks is pre-empted, he can go ahead.  If it

looks as if the State is going to take something from

him that a Federal law guarantees and he has a defense

that he'd like to make to that under Federal law, the

State law that seems to allow it is pre-empted, he can

make it.

            Our problem arises where neither of those

things is true.  So, we say, what is true here?  What

kind of Federal claim does he have?  And the word is

that rates have to be -- that the rate that the State

has to pay back to the doctor has to be "sufficient."

Okay, "sufficient."  That's basically the word.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So, I see three

possibilities.  One is you say, sure, let all the

doctors go and sue.  There are only 50,000 kinds of

reimbursement.  Maybe there are a million.  I don't know

how many.  And they only take place in, what, say,

400,000 counties.  And we will have Federal judges

reaching different views about what is sufficient in

each of those different places.  And sometimes they will

agree.  Did Congress want that?  Well, hmm, a problem.

                The second way of going about it is cure

that and say:  You win, but you have to use primary

jurisdiction, and you have to get the government's view

on it, Judge; and before you decide, you have to pay

attention.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Can I --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  There's a long line of

cases.  I have one more thing --

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Can I --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  -- then you'll get all

three.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  But can I deal with that one

immediately?

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Because I think it's

important in the context of this case to recognize.

We're talking about the issuance of a preliminary

injunction that was designed to hold everything until

matters could be avoided.  We realize that we're talking

about a situation where the State, solely for budgetary

reasons, without regard to Federal law whatsoever,

simply made a slash in the reimbursements.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  If I want your view, I want

your view on whether the right approach -- you're saying

what's the status quo pending.  And I want your view on

these three possibilities.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  I --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  One is the possibility the

judges just do it in all the different places, try to

figure out what's sufficient.  The second is the

possibility that we try primary jurisdiction, and that's

the -- then the curlicue on that is what do you do

pending?  And, you know, that's your injunction.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  And that's what I just want

to be clear on.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes.  And the third

possibility is you say:  I'm just sorry that the -- this

is just too vague, the "sufficient" et cetera.  It has

to be centralized.  There's no way to work this out with

all these different judges and different kinds of rates

and different kinds of provisions.  And so, this is an

instance where you cannot bring your claim that

something violates the Supremacy Clause because you

don't have a Federal right to a thing, and they're not

trying to take away a thing that the Federal right gives

            All right.  Do you see those three

possibilities?

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And what I wanted you to do

is to address them.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  The -- the third possibility,

it seems to me, Justice Breyer, is not much different

from a lot of the other cases that this Court has

already decided --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  -- like Crosby and like

Engine Manufacturers, where there's the vague standard

out there, and the -- and it doesn't -- and they're not

asserting a right to be -- not to have an enforcement

action brought against them.  And this Court has

routinely held in that circumstance that there is in

fact a Supremacy Clause action available.  So, I don't

think the third option is really an option.  And it also

ultimately goes to the merits of the pre-emption claim.

            If it turns out that all of this is just too

squishy to evaluate, then it would seem to me that on

the merits, then you would say there's not a clear

enough statement of Federal law to justify saying

there's a conflict that would -- and, therefore, you

would lose on the merits.  But that wouldn't prevent you

from going into court and trying to make the kind of

showing that we made here.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  You think primary

jurisdiction is the way to do it.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  You see, I see a practical

problem, and I'm -- the practical problem is millions of

rates all judged by the term "sufficient," and instead

of the agency in charge deciding what's sufficient, we

do have a lot of judges.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  But, Justice Breyer, the

agency always has the ultimate authority here to step in

and take action.  And I think the real question is, is

it reasonable to think that Congress meant to place this

in an agency, in circumstances where the agency isn't

going to receive notice of the implementation of the

change before it gets implemented, where the State is

permitted to take no -- to make no response to a request

for information and allow the unlawful rates to go into

effect for years on end?

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Fighting -- why are you

fighting Justice Breyer so much?

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, it sounds like

you are, and that's why I am having some difficulty.

            There are two points, following up on his

and then my second question.  Engage the Solicitor

General's suggestion that this isn't a cause of action

under the Supremacy Clause, but that it is a cause of

action under some implied equitable --

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Doctrine.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- doctrine, okay?

Which may square.  And I'm now coming back to Justice

Breyer's question.  I agree with all you were trying to

say about what the State did or didn't do here, but if

it's a primary jurisdiction question, what's wrong with

just saying that the court's power is limited under

equity to issuing an injunction that gives the matter

over to the administrative agency that puts in the

status quo -- assuming there's some sort of violation of

Federal law or seeming violation of Federal law -- a

preventive injunction that just stops the State from

acting until the administrative process concludes?

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Justice Sotomayor --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's wrong with that?

            MR. PHILLIPS:  There's nothing wrong with

that.  Candidly, we -- we would be perfectly comfortable

with that, but I don't understand the other side to be

complaining about the scope of the injunctive relief.

It is not that they are saying --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no.  They're saying

you can't have any.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  And so --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But -- but Justice

Breyer's question, I think, was slightly different,

which is, what's the limit on --

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the court's power?

And how do you --

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, we did have an

alternative argument that the injunction should --

should stay into effect at least until HHS acts, and the

-- the district court granted a broader preliminary

injunction and didn't consider the alternative argument

that was -- that was there.

            But, again, it seems to me that, you know,

the court ought to recognize that you're in the context

of preliminary injunctive relief in this situation, and

-- and there will be plenty of time to kind of work

through the nature of the injunctive relief if in fact

the court's allowed to go forward and take up the Ex

parte Young issue under the circumstance.

question that -- the approach the Solicitor General has

been making, which is don't find a cause of action under

the Supremacy Clause; find it in the court's -- an

implied cause of action?

            MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm not perfectly comfortable

with that rationale.  I think the answer is it's sort of

a combination of the Supremacy Clause and the -- and

broad equitable relief, rather than -- I mean, clearly

one or the other.  They seem to go pretty much

hand-in-glove in the ex parte line of cases.  And so, I

don't have any particular problem with that.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I might, if you

continue in your earlier position that a Supremacy

Clause cause of action would stop Congress from having a

-- a voice in enforcement in cutting it off clearly, if

Congress were to write a law that says no one can

enforce this, either in damages or in injunctive relief.

Your earlier answer seemed to suggest Congress didn't

have the power under the Supremacy Clause to do that.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I -- suppose there

were --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If this were in

equity --

some gap between the full extent of Congress's power in

this area and -- and the protections of the Supremacy

Clause, if for no other reason -- and because the

executive branch also has the authority and, certainly

acting within its own exclusive authority, could --

could pre-empt State law or could create a situation

where State law would be pre-empted.  And I don't think

Congress would have the authority to -- to take away the

Ex parte Young remedy under -- under those particular

circumstances.

            JUSTICE ALITO:  What is your response to the

argument that the equitable power exercised in Ex parte

Young and similar cases is limited to certain specific

situations such as where there is an imminent threat of

the State enforcement action, and a few others where

there's a trespass, where there's a clearly defined

Federal right?  I mean, it doesn't encompass every

situation in which the plaintiff simply has Article III

standing and wants to obtain an injunction that a

particular State law is pre-empted by Federal law.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  The -- I mean, to be sure,

the Court in Ex parte Young was dealing with a specific

situation of trying to prevent enforcement.  But the --

the Supreme Court -- this Court in all of its decisions

post-Ex parte Young has never said that that's the only

circumstance and has certainly never said that in

exercising the judicial power under Article III that

extends to all cases in equity, that it means only the

equity that existed in -- in the 18th century at that

point in time.

            So, it seems to me the right answer at this

stage is for this Court to look at the situation and

say:  Is this a context in which equitable relief would

be appropriate?  And if you just use the preliminary

injunction standards, it clearly would be appropriate

under -- under these particular circumstances, where we

have a likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable

harm, and the balance of harms favor the -- favor the

plaintiff.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, what is the best

authority in our cases, other than Ex parte Young, or in

distinction ought to be blurred?

parte Young, what do I cite for that?

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, any of the cases in

to get -- in order to get injunctive relief, you have to

demonstrate that there's -- that there's no adequate

remedy at law.  So, I mean, the distinction has always

been there, even after the merging of law and equity --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That -- that's not --

            MR. PHILLIPS:  -- in the early part of the

last century.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not the theory on

which we've said you can't get damages under Ex parte

Young.  The theory that prevents damages is the theory

of sovereign immunity.  The -- the fiction that

you're -- that you're moving against the individual and

not against the State simply cannot be maintained when

you're taking money out of the State treasury.  That's

I understand the Eleventh Amendment dynamic, which --

points out, was the whole driving force of -- of Ex

parte Young.  Is there -- is there any other basis for

us to say that there has to be a law/equity distinction?

You say, well, that's because there is no adequate

remedy at law.  But that's circular; that assumes

because there's no cause of action -- so, that doesn't

work.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  No, but I -- I mean, all of

the cases that come out of the Ex parte Young line of

authority seem to base -- you know, they all tee off,

obviously, the problem that exists in this context,

which is -- which is the one that Justice Scalia

identified.

what you can do under Ex parte Young, I can go in my

office and I look at the statute books and they are just

filled with statutes, and I -- Federal; and if I had all

the State statute books, it would be 15 offices or 20 or

100.  And I know perfectly well that a lot of those

statutes in the Federal books have to do with agencies,

and they give jobs to agencies, and it's perfectly

apparent that the ones who run those statutes in many

instances are the agencies, and really judges are out of

it.

            Now, if I adopt your line, it seems to me I

am saying that any time that a person has an individual

of saying that a State law is contrary to one of those

statutes, he can run right into court.  And I can see

we've done that where he has some kind of right that

he's protecting that's threatened in some way or that he

wants to assert.  I can see that we could do that in the

foreign policy case like Burma; I can see that we could

do that where Federal voting rights are at stake, which

are very important.

            But a principle that says you can do that

any time you want seems to me a little -- it's -- it

law, or States -- it's a mess, in other words.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Justice Breyer, can I -- two

points here:  First of all, we are not talking about a

situation of somebody seeking a roving commission to go

find out all Federal -- all situations where State law

violates Federal law.  We're -- the beneficiaries in

this case --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  Your people have

your problem.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  But those are life-and-death

problems.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  But some other people have

another problem.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  But my people have a

life-and-death problem, Justice Breyer.  So, if there

were ever a situation where you would say let's look to

see whether or not there is relief available, this would

be the situation where -- where I would hope --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  The doctors want to be paid

more money or at least not paid as much as they were; I

understand that.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  But the beneficiaries --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  So, is there a medical

exception?

            MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm sorry.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there a medical

exception?  Is it that you can have this generalized

claim if you're a doctor, but not others?

            MR. PHILLIPS:  No, to be sure, Justice

Breyer.  The exception is that we have to satisfy the

requirements of Article III.  We have to have injury and

redressability, and in order to get equitable relief, we

ultimately are going to have to demonstrate that the

injury is irreparable, that there is no adequate remedy

at law.  Those are high burdens --

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Phillips --

            MR. PHILLIPS:  -- and in a circumstance

where you cannot get damages and you cannot get

attorneys' fees.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Phillips, could I ask

you a little bit more about how this interacts with the

agency process?  Now, suppose that California had done

what, the way I read the statute, it was supposed to do,

which is to go to the agency and say:  We want to change

our rates.  We can't afford these rates anymore, and we

think these lower rates would do just as well.  All

right?

            And then the agency and California sit down

and discuss the matter.  Would this suit have ever come

into being?

            MR. PHILLIPS:  If they had just discussed

the matter?

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know, they did not

impose them unilaterally.  They go to the -- to HHS and

they wait for HHS to approve what they want to do.  If

HHS approves --

            MR. PHILLIPS:  We wouldn't be here.  I can

guarantee you we wouldn't be here.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, if -- if HHS approved,

maybe somebody does sue.  And then there's great

deference to the agency --

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- isn't that right?

authoritative way that there is not a violation under

a statute no implied right of action, that that doesn't

control.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, but that doesn't --

that controls to the extent of trying to enforce

directly the Federal statute; it doesn't control with

respect to trying to enforce the Supremacy Clause.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The Supremacy Clause says

that judges in every State shall be bound thereby, but

if you want to amend it so that judges in every State

and all administrators should be bound thereby, then you

have a Supremacy Clause action against every Federal

agency.  That doesn't make sense.

Supremacy Clause says is that Federal law will be

supreme in all circumstances, notwithstanding State

law --

Scalia's question was related to a Federal agency.  The

Federal agency does something that's inconsistent with

the statute, arguably, and you say there's a Supremacy

Clause violation?  That's novel.

            MR. PHILLIPS:  No, not -- not that -- not

what the agency has done violates the Supremacy Clause;

it's the State acting pursuant to what the agency has

approved, that if you still thought it violated Federal

law, would be a basis for seeking a Supremacy Clause

action.  But, no, Justice Scalia is right.  The obvious

-- the obvious solution to the immediate problem is to

seek review of the decision by HHS and to -- and to

follow it under those circumstances.

            The -- the second point that I wanted to

focus a little bit about, because it does seem to me --

again, it goes to what are -- what should be the

background principles that operate here.  And a couple

of Justices specifically raised the question of, you

know, would this case be different if we were seeking to

balance-bill -- that is, to bill the extent to which we

were allowed to bill prior to the time that the State of

California reduced by 10 percent, if we brought that

lawsuit, would that be perfectly permissible?

            And I understand California, I think, has

suggested that it would be, and I heard Mr. Kneedler

suggest that, well, there might be some additional

issues there.  But the reality is, is it seems to me

that shows you just how unrealistic the -- the

distinction is in this particular case, because we're

talking about individuals -- you know, the question is

not, you know, how are you going to implement this down

the road?  The question is, what do you do with someone

who is suffering a lack of access to vital medical care

in a way that is irreparable?  And is it realistic to

think that Congress meant under those circumstances to

deprive the individual plaintiff of any kind of rights?

            And the answer is no.  And that's -- that's

as far as the Court needs to go.  It doesn't need to

figure out exactly how far Congress could deal with the

Supremacy Clause.  I realize that there is some

skepticism on that score.  But on the core question

here, did Congress intend to deprive these plaintiffs of

their rights under Ex parte Young, the answer is no --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The answer is yes,

they intended to deprive them of the right to sue under

the statute.  I understand that you're not challenging

the proposition that this statute, when Congress was

specifically focused on the question of how to enforce

this provision, they did not provide a right of action.

And under our implied right of action jurisprudence,

            So, why when they're confronted with the

precise question did they say no, we don't want these

people to sue, but you say, well, they knew under the

Constitution they were going to be able to anyway?

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Because -- because there is a

difference between providing a private right of action

and all the bells and whistles that go with that, as

opposed to recognizing that Ex parte Young is the

background principle that has been in place for well

over a century and that says that when the -- when the

standards for equitable relief are satisfied, the courts

have the power, and they can prevent the violation of

the Supremacy Clause.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said you would be

satisfied with a limitation that the Court can issue an

injunction pending the administrative procedure without

going on to then the substance of the question, was

there compliance with 30(A) by California?

            MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I

would have been perfectly comfortable with that.  I

mean, that was one of the alternative grounds for relief

that we sought.  The district judge didn't happen to go

down that particular path.

important element is to maintain the status quo ante

until a resolution of the legality of California's

statute can be made, either by the agency or by the

courts.  But the -- but the one thing you shouldn't be

allowed to do is simply to -- to permit this to drift

without any remedy and without any ability to get access

to medical care that's clearly inconsistent with what

Congress intended and where a remedy is available under

the Ex parte Young formulation.

Young, in all of the cases that are its progeny.

            Now, there's another -- I want to address

Justice Alito's point about, do we apply the rights

language -- the rights requirement in Ex parte Young

causes of action?  Yes, you do.  Alexander v. Sandoval,

California v. Sierra Club, Blessing v. Freestone.

            Look at Alexander v. Sandoval.  The State

passes a constitutional amendment that says English

only.  The -- the State adopts a policy, English-only

drivers tests.  This is challenged as conflicting with

Federal law and specifically a Federal regulation.  The

Court said no -- no, Cort v. Ash was satisfied.

Congress drafts statutes; it controls who gets to

enforce them.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry --

            MS. SCHWARTZ:  No cause of action.

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- Ms. Schwartz.  Are you

saying -- this is the way I understood you, and tell me

if I'm right:  Are you saying that the test for

determining whether there's a 1983 suit is the same as

the test for determining whether there is an Ex parte

Young action?  Because you talked about, you know,

whether somebody has a right, which is usually the

language we use in the 1983 context.

whether there is an Ex parte -- and there's different

meanings of Ex parte Young, but none of them apply here.

You can see Ex parte Young as construing a cause of

action under the Due Process Clause.  This not a cause

of action under the Due Process Clause.

            You could see Ex parte Young as involving a

specific kind of bill in equity which is a defense of

regulation of your conduct where that regulation

infringes a personal or property right.  That is not

this case.  There's no regulation of Respondents'

conduct, and there's no infringement of a personal or

property right in this case.  The only entity that's

being regulated by the State -- by the State statute

that purportedly is being -- well, that is being

challenged as pre-empted is the State of California

itself because we are the entity that sets rates, and so

the -- the statute tells the agency this is how you will

set rates.

            So, however you look at ex parte Young,

plaintiffs cannot satisfy the elements of an Ex parte

Young cause of action.

            What I'm saying with respect to

Alexander v. Sandoval and these other cases is injury is

not enough.  You have to have a -- a right.  Under

equity, injury has never been enough, and it's not

enough under this Court's separation of powers decisions

and its Spending Clause cases.

            And I wanted to just segue very quickly to

this idea that there's a default rule that a Supremacy

Clause cause of action exists by default.  That is

absolutely not true, and it is not true in this context,

and I'd like to identify two reasons.

            First, the Suter fix.  The -- Congress

acted, when this Court in Suter said that there was no

cause of action.  And it said just because something is

in a -- in a State plan doesn't render it unenforceable.

But we want to preserve the holding in Suter.

            Well, it -- that suggests that other things

are unenforceable, that Congress is not legislating

against a backdrop of an assumption that there's an

injunctive relief claim, or it wouldn't have required

the Suter fix.  In Maine v. Thiboutot, another case that

assumes -- that recognizes that with respect to Spending

Clause actions, the sole means -- the Spending Clause

statutes, the means, the vehicle for enforcing is 1983.

            And, finally, in the Spending Clause

context, we have the clear statement rule, which is

incompatible with just an assumption that a cause of

action always exists.  Because the State has to have
