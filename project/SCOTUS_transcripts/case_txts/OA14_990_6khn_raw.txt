CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  14­990,  Shapiro  v.  McManus. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Kimberly. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MICHAEL  B.  KIMBERLY 

 

 

 

 

 

              

 

 

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Section  2284(a)  states  in  plain  terms  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  of  three  judges  shall  be  convened  when  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  is  filed  challenging  the  constitutionality  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apportionment  of  congressional  districts. 

 

 

 

Section  2284(b)  lays  out  the  procedure  for  calling  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  court  when  the  circumstances  identified  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2284  are  satisfied. 

 

 

            

It  ­­ it  reads,  quote,  "Upon  the  filing  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

request  for  three  judges,  the  judge  to  whom  the  request 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  presented  shall,  unless  he  determines  that  three 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges  are  not  required,  immediately  notify  the  chief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  of  the  circuit,  who  shall  designate  two  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges." 

            

Now,  although  that  language  did  not  appear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  statute  until  the  1976  amendments,  it  was  no  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  a  congressional  recognition  and  codification  of

what  was  then  by  settled  ­­ what  was  by  then  settled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice,  that  a  complaint  covered  by  2284(a)  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

have,  initially,  to  be  referred  to  a  single  judge,  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  litigants  then  would  have  to  file  a  request  for  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  district  court,  and  in  turn  that  the  single 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  would  have  to  determine  whether  three  judges  were, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fact,  required. 

 

 

            

Now,  at  the  time  that  Congress  enacted  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

long­standing  practice  in  the  1976  amendments  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Act,  this  Court's  precedents  had  made  clear  that  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  upon  which  three  judges  are,  quote,  "not  required" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  when  the  claim  is  constitutionally  insubstantial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress  is  presumed  to  have  been  aware 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ­­ of  this  Court's  precedents  so  holding,  and  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absence  of  a  contrary  indication  ­­ and  here  there  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

none  ­­ to  have  intended  that  interpretation  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words  "not  required"  to  be  incorporated  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  if  it's  perfectly  clear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  plaintiffs  are  entitled  to  judgment?  Let's  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  legislature  goes  back  to  its  pre  Reynolds  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sims  method  of  constituting  the  State  legislature.  Does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  have  to  be  referred  to  a  three­judge  court? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  If  it  is  ­­ if  the  claim  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  foreclosed  by  this  Court's  precedents,  then

no,  it  doesn't.  The  ­­ the  upshot  of  this  Court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insubstantiality  doctrine  is  that  when  a  claim  is  so 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  foreclosed  it  doesn't  present  a  bona  fide 

   

 

 

 

 

 

controversy  within  the  meaning  of  Article  III  and, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  isn't  the  kind  of  case  that  has  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referred  to  a  three­judge  court. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Well,  what  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  How  do  you  square  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Go  ahead. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Okay. 

  

 

            

How  do  you  square  that  with  the  statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language? 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  Well,  we  think  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

embodied  in  the  words  "not  required."  In  ­­ in  the  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  three  years  before  Congress  inserted  the  key 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language  in  Section  2284(b),  this  Court  had  said  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Goosby  that  three  ­­ that  a  three­judge  district  court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  quote,  "not  required"  when  the  claim  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insubstantial. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Maybe  Goosby  was  wrong. 

  

 

 

 

 

You  don't  think  Goosby  was  wrong? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  Well,  I  ­­ Goosby  represents 

   

  

 

 

 

what  had  been,  by  then,  nearly  50  years  of  practice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beginning  with  this  Court's  decision  in  Poresky. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

For  what  it's  worth,  I  will  say  I  ­­ I  think

if  Goosby  is  wrong,  we  still  end  up  winning  because  ­­

Well  ­­ I'm  sorry,  why  don't  you  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  Well,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  would  just 

   

   

   

  

 

 

say,  I  think  the  path  of  least  resistance  here  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reversing  the  Fourth  Circuit  is  not  to  overturn  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent.  But  we  certainly  would  be  happy  if  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  inclined  to  do  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  do  you  do  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  argument  in  ­­ in  a  case  that  might  go  before  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  court  is  that  the  Court's  precedents  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  overruled?  It's  clearly  foreclosed  by  the  Court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedents,  but  maybe  there's  a  very  good  argument  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ those  precedents  are  ­­ haven't  withstood  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  of  time  or  whatever. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

What  happens  then? 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  This  Court's  precedents? 

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Yes,  yes. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  KIMBERLY:  This  Court's  precedents.

circumstance,  at  least  according  to  the  Goosby  rule,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  case  would  proper  ­­ properly  be  dismissed

And  ­­ and  if  ­­ if,  then,  this  Court  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  have  ­­ I  have  some 

    

   

 

 

 

problems  with  that.  Suppose  the  ­­ the  case  has  been  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  books  from  this  Court  for  15,  20  years,  has  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorts  of  academic  commentary;  certain  circuits  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questioned  whether  the  reasoning  is  still  valid. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

A  single­judge  court  can  dismiss  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

case? 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  Well,  I  ­­ I  think  according 

   

   

  

 

 

to  the  substantiality  rule,  yes.  Again,  if  the  Court

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  I'm  surprised  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  they  do  need  to  take  that  position? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  No.  And  again,  I  don't  think 

   

  

  

 

 

 

we  do.  And  if  the  Court  were  inclined  to  narrow  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules  that  it  didn't  apply  in  that  circumstance,  again  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  we'd  still  win.

Court  has  to  recognize  for  the  purposes  of  this  case  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  insubstantiality  rule  is  not  one  and  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  the  12(b)(6)  standard. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  ­­ I  take  it  Goosby  is 

    

   

 

 

 

 

not  parallel  to  Rule  11.  Rule  11  is  a  class  of  cases 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  are  more  frivolous  even  than  what  Goosby  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  ­­

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  No.  I  think  Goosby  is  even 

    

  

 

 

 

 

more  frivolous  than  Rule  11.  What  the  Goosby  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Oh,  really? 

  

 

 

MR.  KIMBERLY:  ­­ standard  provides  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  claim  must  be  obviously  frivolous.  And  what  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said  in  Goosby  is  ­­ obviously  is  doing  work  in  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  that  formulation.  It  can't  just  be  that  a  judge 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately  concludes  that  the  claim  is  frivolous.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

got  to  be  that  there  couldn't  possibly  be  any  debate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  whether  it  is,  in  fact,  foreclosed  by  this  Court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Am  I  right  that  Goosby 

   

  

 

 

 

thought  of  that  as  part  of  the  jurisdictional  question? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  That's  correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  In  other  words,  it's  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

application  of  Bell  v.  Hood  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  That's  correct.

MR.  KIMBERLY:  That  is  not  a  bona  fide  case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  controversy  within  the  meaning  of  Article  III. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  exactly  right. 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  it's  a  very 

   

  

 

 

 

difficult  line  you're  drawing,  and  ­­ and  I  understand 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bell  v.  Hood.  But  you're  saying  he  can't  do  it.  He 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  determine  that  the  three­judge  court  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  just  because  the  plaintiffs  are  wrong,  but  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  make  that  determination  if  they  are  really  wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  ­­ and  your  brief  in  the  analysis  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  this,  it  ­­ it  is  always  ­­ it's  ­­ it's  like  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thesaurus.  It's  just  a  collection  of  adjectives  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

all  mean  "frivolous,"  "insubstantial,"  you  know.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  not  sure  it  gives  a  great  deal  of  guidance  to  ­­ to

two  things  about  that. 

 

 

 

            

The  first  ­­ I  mean,  that  ­­ that  catalog  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjectives  appears  in  Goosby.  This  is  a  rule  that  has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  on  the  books  since  Poresky  in  the  1920s.  It  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't,  in  our  view,  a  rule  that  has  been  causing  a  whole 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot  of  trouble  since  1976  amendments.  But  again,  if  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  Court  is  dissatisfied  with  the  ruling,  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inclined  to  hold  that  it  is  not  a  basis  for  finding

three  judges  not  required.  We  still  ­­ I  think  it  still 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  require  a  reversal  of  the  Fourth  Circuit's  rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  of  the  district  court's  judgment  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  you  call  it  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  guess  my  concern  ­­ you  call  it  a  rule,  but  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  not  much  of  a  rule.  It's  just  kind  of  a  ­­ I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  know,  a  sense  that  something  is  ­­ is  really  bad, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  I  guess  I  said  earlier,  as  opposed  to  just  bad.  And 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  that's  an  awfully  fuzzy  line  to  ­­ to  draw,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fuzzy  in  ­­ in  when  you're  talking  about  jurisdiction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  you  like  to  have  very  precise  and  clear  rules. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  I  ­­ I  agree  entirely,  and 

    

   

 

 

 

I  ­­ and  I  guess  what  I  ­­ what  I  would  say  on  top  of 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  that  if  ­­ if  the  Court  is  concerned  to  avoid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fuzzy  and  difficult  rules,  that  certainly  is  a  reason 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  to  adopt  Respondents'  position. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Could  the  Respondents 

  

 

 

 

argue  that,  in  the  light  of  Iqbal  and  Twombly,  Goosby 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  reconsidered,  and  the  Federal  court  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  some  ­­ district  court,  single  judge  should  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  more  authority?  Or  does  that  work  the  other  way, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  you  think? 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  I  ­­ I  think  it  works  the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

other  way.  I  would  be  surprised  to  see  Respondents  make 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  argument,  because  again  we're  dealing  here  with  a

statute,  with  statutory  language  that  says  when  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  is  filed  challenging  the  constitutionality  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

congressional  districts,  that  a  three­judge  court  shall 

   

 

 

 

 

be  convened. 

 

            

And  then  in  (b),  using  the  word  "required," 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  ­­ essentially  Respondents'  view  is  that  the  words 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"shall  appearing"  in  2284(a),  actually  means  "may,"  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  rule  "required  appearing"  in  2284(b)  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means  "permitted,"  and  that  a  single  district  judge,  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  view,  can  elect  whether  or  not  to  convene  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  court  if  he  or  she  would,  in  his  or  her 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion,  prefer  to  keep  the  case  for  him  or  herself.

frivolous  in  the  Goosby  language  as  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional? 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  I  think  if  the  Court  were  to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue  that  line  of  cases  here  and  to  hold  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  basis  for  declining  the  convening  of  a  three­judge 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

court,  yes.  It  depends  on  it  being  a  jurisdictional 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

question. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  what  happens  under  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

current  statute  that  calls  for  a  three­judge  court  on

court.  Would  ­­ could  the  single  judge  proceed  with  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case? 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  Well,  our  ­­ our  view,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

light  of  this  Court's  precedence,  is  no,  that  it  isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waivable  and  it's  ­­ it's  a  jurisdictional  statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  the  ­­ the  judge  would  be  without  ­­ that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single  judge  would  be  without  power  to  consider  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits  in  the  case  covered  by  the  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  should  say  that  that  also  isn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily  a  question  that's  presented  here  because, 

   

 

 

 

 

even  if  it's  just  a  claims­processing  rule,  it's  still  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory  claims­processing  rule.  And  nothing  in  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Respondents  had  said  indicates  that  when  a  request 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  filed,  the  district  judge  would  be  empowered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nevertheless  to  disregard  the  request  and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nevertheless  keep  the  case  for  himself. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You  ­­ you  ­­ you  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  ­­ and  let's  assume  that  ­­ that  Goosby  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional. 

            

Does  that  mean  that  we  must  let  the  single 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  determine  it? 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  Well,  I  ­­

   

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Why  is  it  that  the  single

can't  that  be  left  to  the  three­judge  court  just  as

everything  else  is? 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  To  be  clear,  I  don't  think  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

single  judge  does  have  to  decide  the  jurisdictional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  I  think  ­­ again,  the  key  point  is  that  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits  have  to  go  to  a  three­judge  district  court.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  the  Court  has  to  say  anything  more  about  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  than  that  in  this  case  because,  on  the  face  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  what  the  district  court  here  did  was  enter  judgment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Rule  12(b)(6). 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Perhaps  the  jurisdiction 

  

 

 

 

has  to  go  to  that  court  as  well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  I  ­­ I  think  that's  right, 

    

   

 

 

 

yes.  Perhaps,  yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Does  ­­ does  the  waiver 

  

 

 

 

 

 

argument,  the  argument  that  this  can  be  waived  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent  of  all  parties,  does  that  rest  on  decisions  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court? 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  Not  so  far  as  I'm  aware.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  nothing  in  this  Court's  precedents  indicate  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  is  jurisdictional.  And  in  fact  ­­ excuse 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me,  that  it's  waivable.  And  in  fact,  the  Court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  in  Idlewild,  and  before  that  in  Stratton,  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precisely  the  opposite.  They  say  that  it's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  statute  and,  moreover,  when  the  ­­ the

that  a  single  judge  loses  jurisdiction  over  the  merits

adopted  by  some  of  the  circuits? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  Not  ­­ in  fact,  no.  It  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  been  rejected  by  every  court  that's  considered  it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Second  and  D.C.  circuits. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  why  do  you  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  there  was  a  ­­ there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

was  a  change  in  '76,  and  that's  when  they  put  in  "upon 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  filing  of  a  request."  And  that  language  suggests 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  isn't  a  jurisdictional  question,  because  if  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

party  has  to  request  it,  it  normally  follows  if  a  party 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  request  it,  it's  waived. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  Well,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  wouldn't 

   

   

   

  

 

disagree  that  that  is  one  possible  way  to  read  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  I  ­­ I  think  it's  inconsistent  with  what  this 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  precedents  said  beforehand.  And  our  view  again 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  really  that  language  is  best  understood  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress's  codification  of  what  was  by  then  well­settled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice,  that  when  any  complaint  is  filed  in  a  district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court,  it  necessarily  first  goes  to  a  single­district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

judge.  That  single­district  judge  then  has  to  make  a

the  jurisdictional  nature  of  the  statute  weren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied,  and  that  certainly  is  something  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigants  could  choose. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  don't  know  why  it's 

    

 

 

 

 

contrary  to  a  jurisdictional  status  that  it  has  to  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requested.  I  mean,  can't  a  request  be  one  of  the 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

conditions  to  confer  jurisdiction  just  as  a  plaintiff  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  the  conditions  to  satisfy  Article  III  and  thereby 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confer  jurisdiction? 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  That's  exactly  right.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

our  example  is,  for  instance,  filing  a  notice  of  appeal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  court  of  appeals.  The  Court  doesn't  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  without  a  request  for  the  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Let  me  get  back  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  Justice  Kagan  asked.  It  was  certainly  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  when  the  law  was  enacted  that  the  three­judge  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  viewed  as  an  anti­plaintiff  provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  idea  was  that  single  judges  were  too 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quickly  issuing  injunctions,  you  know,  blocking  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  enactments,  and  they  thought  that  would  be  less 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely  if  you  had  three  judges.  I'm  not  sure  if  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  true  today,  but  it  certainly  was  when  the  law  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passed. 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  It  was  true  in  1910  when  the

history  of  the  Voting  Rights  Act,  which  is  one  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  statutes  that  provides  ­­ statutes  that  provides 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  three­judge­court  review  beyond  2284. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  legislative  history  in  that  ­­ in  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  that  statute,  was  clear,  that  indeed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  district  courts  were  more  likely  to  grant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief  to  plaintiffs  than  were  single  judges,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  part  what  explained  why  Congress,  in  that  Act, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided  for  three­judge­court  review. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  plaintiffs  liked  it 

  

 

 

 

 

because  you  could  skip  over  the  court  of  appeals  and  go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  to  this  Court,  and  on  appeal  rather  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certiorari. 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  That's  right.  And  so  I  think 

   

  

  

 

 

 

in  that  respect,  Respondents  reading  the  statute  is  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite  inconsistent  with  the  well­understood  purposes  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute.  Among  them,  key  among  them,  to  ensure  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits  judgments  and  cases  covered  by  the  Act,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  the  1976  amendments  are  quite  narrow  and  cover 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  particularly  politically  sensitive  and  important 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  receive  as  quick  a  final  decision  before  this

Court  as  possible. 

 

 

            

On  Respondent's  reading  of  the  statute,  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

single  judge  can  keep  the  merits  for  him  or  herself  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpose  the  court  of  appeals  in  the  process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What's  more,  their  reading  of  the  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  creates  really  difficult  jurisdictional  problems  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate  review. 

 

            

If  ­­ if  a  single­judge  district  court  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

grant  a  motion  to  dismiss  under  12(b)(6)  and  it  goes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  the  court  of  appeals  and  the  court  of  appeals 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reverses,  the  upshot  is  that,  well,  three  judges  were  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  required  after  all. 

 

 

 

            

The  case  then  has  to  get  referred  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  district  court.  But  it's  not  clear,  then, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  three­judge  district  court  would  be  bound  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  of  the  case  on  the  12(b)(6)  question  by  the  decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  court  of  appeals. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

If  ­­ if  it  is  bound,  that's  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Sure  it  is.  Come  on.

MR.  KIMBERLY:  I  actually  don't  think  it's 

    

 

 

 

 

questionable.  I  think  it's  quite  inconsistent  with  what 

    

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  says  in  (b)(3),  though,  and  it's  an

indication  why  Respondent's  reading  of  the  statute  can't

question  then  goes  to  the  court  of  appeals  precisely  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  circumstances  when  Congress  has  meant  ­­ Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant  only  the  single­judge  district  courts  decide  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  How  do  you  think  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Goosby  Rule  applies  to  political  gerrymandering  claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  general?  This  Court  has  never  seen  one  that  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  was  justiciable. 

 

 

            

 

 

 

 

Do  you  think  there  are  any  that  ­­ but 

 

 

 

 

assuming  that  the  possibility  that  there  might  be  one  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough  to  take  the  case  to  the  three­judge  court?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  that's  so,  are  there  any  that  would  not  go  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  court? 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  I  ­­ I  think  there  are  some 

    

   

 

 

 

 

that  wouldn't  go.  A  political  gerrymandering  claim  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

was  predicated  exclusively  on  a  purported  rights 

   

 

 

 

 

proportional  representation  in  Congress  would  be  wholly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreclosed  by  Bandemer  itself. 

 

 

 

            

            

But  the  fact  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  so  long  as  it  favors 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  ­­ the  party  that  controlled  the  legislature  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  plan  was  drawn  up,  which  is  almost  always  the  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  a  political  gerrymandering  claim  be  made  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that's  why  it  was  done?

MR.  KIMBERLY:  I  ­­ I  think  that's  right, 

    

   

 

 

 

and  I  think  that's  why  we  see  most  of  these  claims 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rightly  being  sent  to  three­judge  district  courts,  just

JUSTICE  BREYER:  We  might  get  to  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question,  but  at  some  point  somebody  is  going  to  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  whether  you  do  have  a  substantial  claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  That's  right.  And  our  view, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

against  the  backdrop  of  this  Court's  precedence,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  a  sufficiently  easy  question  that  ­­

MR.  KIMBERLY:  There  is  no  ­­ no  decision  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  ­­ binding  decision  of  this  Court  holding

opinion  in  Vieth.  There's  a  plurality  opinion.  The

Vieth  that  provides  the  basis  for  the  complaint  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

It  would  be  quite  strange  to  say  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  that  is  embodied  in  the  controlling  opinion  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  from  less  than  a  decade  ago  is  wholly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreclosed  by  this  Court's  precedence.  That's  why  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  a  sufficiently  easy  question  for  this  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  remand  with  instruction  simply  to  convene  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  court,  but  if  the  Court  were  not  inclined  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  that  far,  we're  perfectly  comfortable  briefing  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  before  the  single  judge. 

 

 

 

 

            

reserve  ­­

 

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions,  I'll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  didn't  understand.  If 

    

  

 

 

you're  not  going  to  go  that  far,  you  want  to  brief  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  before  the  district? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  Well,  I  think  ­­ I  think  the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

single  judge  below  Judge  Breyer  would  have  to  address 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  question  whether  three  judges  are  required  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper  standards.  In  this  case  he  said  three  judges  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  required  because  I  dismiss  under  Rule  (12)(6).  I  ­­

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

I  don't  think  it  necessarily  follows  ­­

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  STEVEN  M.  SULLIVAN

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

In  1976,  Congress  considerably  narrowed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  that  would  call  for  the  procedural  device 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  three­judge  court.  And  as  part  of  that  pairing 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

down  of  the  three­judge  statute,  Congress,  for  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time,  authorized  a  single­district  judge  to,  quote, 

   

 

 

 

 

"determine  that  three  judges  are  not  required." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

For  three  reasons,  this  Court  should  affirm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  authorization  permits  the  single  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  to  dismiss  a  complaint  that,  on  its  face,  fails  to

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  May  I  go  back  to 

   

  

 

 

 

something  you  just  said?  Because  I  thought  that  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

word  "required"  was  in  the  statute.  It  wasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

introduced  in  '76;  it  was  there  before. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Required  to  be  heard  by  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  court. 

 

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  But  it  wasn't  for  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

authorization  for  a  single  judge.  In  the  prior  statute, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

upon  the  filing  of  the  request  for  injunctive  relief, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  three­judge  court  was  required  to  be  convened,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  the  express  language  of  the  statute  did  not  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  for  the  single  judge  to  make  that  call. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  On  what  basis  are  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sounds  to  me  that  you're  giving  a  meaning  to  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  that  was  different  to  the  meaning  we  gave  to  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pre­1976.  Am  I  correct? 

   

  

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  I  ­­ I  don't  think  that's 

    

   

 

 

 

necessarily  the  case.  I  think  not  required  meant  that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  didn't  have  a  set  meaning  as  plaintiffs  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  ­­ he  took  out  the

"Insubstantial,"  "wholly  insubstantial,"  "frivolous,"

"obviously  or  essentially  frivolous."  I  mean  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  But  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ that's  very  different 

  

 

 

 

 

than  a  12(b)(3)  motion. 

   

 

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Yes,  Justice  Sotomayor, 

  

 

 

 

that  ­­ those  words  appear,  but  in  the  prior  case  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  1976,  this  Court  had,  in  two  important  cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permitted  a  district  judge  to  adjudicate  the  entire  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding  the  presence  of  a  substantial  claim 

   

 

 

 

 

raised  by  the  plaintiff.  And  those  cases  are  Bailey  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Hagans  v  Lavine  case  cited  by  Petitioners. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

There,  Hagans  v.  Lavine,  there  was  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  there  was  a  substantial  equal  protection  claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

The  district  judge  perceived  that  there's  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption  claim,  and  I  think  I  can  get  rid  of  the  case 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  ruling  on  the  preemption  claim,  which  is  exactly  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  district  judge  did. 

 

 

 

            

And  this  Court  affirmed  that  that  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct  procedure;  that  there  was  no  reason  to  trouble 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  three­judge  court  if  there  was  a  statutory  claim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  could  be  resolved  and  rendered  unnecessary  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address  the  equal  protection  clause. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  idea  that  there  was  this  set 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding  that  any  time  there's  a  substantial  claim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

it's  off  limits  to  a  single  district  judge  is  simply  not

heading  under  uncertainties  in  the  prior  law,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  item  is  A,  whether  or  not  a  three­judge  court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  convened  was  the  first  of  the  several 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uncertainties  that  the  Senate  noted  in  its  report. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  idea  that  Petitioners  want  to  say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  by  saying  "not  required"  in  the  statute,  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended  to  adopt  a  certain  subset  of  this  Court's  prior 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisprudence  is  not  borne  out  by  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  they  ­­ they  want  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

raise  about  as  important  a  question  as  you  can  imagine. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  want  to  say,  reading  Vieth,  that  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislators  are  forbidden  to  draw  district  boundaries 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  way  that  has  been  done  here.  I  take  it  that's  their 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic  claim.  And  if  they  are  right,  that  would  affect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

congressional  districts  and  legislative  districts 

 

 

 

 

throughout  the  nation. 

 

 

            

So  what  reason  could  Congress  have  had  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  although  we  want  three­judge  courts  to  decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  kind  of  cases  generally,  where  the  single­most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  issue  that  could  possibly  be  raised  ­­ I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exaggerate  only  slightly  ­­ is  raised,  that  kind  of

issue  is  for  a  single  judge? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Well,  Congress,  if  it  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

looked  back  at  this  Court's  case  law,  would  have  seen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  Court  regularly  denied  three­judge  courts  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  there  was  an  important  issue  such  as  when  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption  was  the  issue.  Preemption  cases  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Do  you  want  to  give  me  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

list  of  those  cases  with  ­­ I'm  going  to  continue  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Company  ­­

 

            

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Yes.  Swift  ­­ Swift  and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Answer  Justice  Breyer. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  So  the  ­­ the  Court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

concern,  it  was  always  a  narrow  interpretation  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  for  very  important  reasons.  And  that  is  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimize  the  dislocation  of  the  lower  Federal  courts' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functioning  and  structure,  which  always  happens  when  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  bring  in  two  extra  judges.  And  secondly,  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

control  this  Court's  mandatory  appellate  docket. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  those  are  always  at  work  when  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  reading  the  statute.  And  Congress  knew  this.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  page  5,  the  Senate  report  acknowledges  this  narrow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading  without  disavowing  it  or  instructing  this  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  otherwise. 

 

 

            

So  the  statute  always  was  read  not  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most  embracing  terms,  as  it  said  in  Swift  &  Company  v.

Wickham  at  page  126,  not  in  the  most  embracing  terms, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  in  restrictive  ­­ in  a  restrictive  way  because  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  important  concerns  of  judicial  administration  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  at  stake,  but  also  to  best  serve  the  historical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose,  which  is  to  protect  States  from  the  improvident 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injunction  by  a  single  judge. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well,  haven't  they 

  

 

 

 

strayed  from  that  ­­ or  Congress  has,  because  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  you  also  get  a  three­judge  court  if  you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

attacking  a  Federal  statute,  right?  It  started  out  with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  concern  about  enjoining  State  statutes.  But  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  trying  to  enjoin  a  Federal  statute,  you  could  also 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get  a  three­judge  court,  right?  And  there  was  no 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

State­protective  interest  involved  in  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  That  was  probably  to  protect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

an  analogous  Federal  interest  in  having  its  ­­ its  laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  improvidently  enjoined.  That  statute  is  no  longer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there,  as  you  know.  But  that  obviously  wouldn't  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  the  same  State  sovereignty  concerns,  but  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  impetus  for  that  adoption  from  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Government  because  they  saw  the  benefits  that  the  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reached  from  having  the  procedure  adopted. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Can  I  make  sure  I  understand 

   

   

  

 

 

what  you're  saying,  because  what  you're  saying  now  is

in  ­­ I  think  it's  1976;  is  that  right? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  now  you're  suggesting 

  

 

 

 

 

that  you're  not  relying  on  that,  that  you're  saying  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  that,  we  ­­ we  viewed  as  acceptable  a  ­­ a

you're  saying,  historic  practice  favors  you  as  opposed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  ­­ the  1976  amendments  favor  you? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  I  think  the  important  thing 

    

 

 

 

 

is  the  amendments  that  we  pointed  out  in  our  brief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  ­­ were  significant  changes  in  ­­ in  the  structure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  meaning  of  the  statute.  But  I  was  responding  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners'  argument  that  this  Court  can  simply  look  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  words  "not  required"  and  know  immediately  what  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean  from  reading  the  prior  case  law.  And  I  don't  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  will  be  an  effective  process  for  this  Court  if  it

MR.  SULLIVAN:  I  hope  so,  Your  Honor.  And  I

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Well,  you  know,  I'm  trying  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide  value  now  in  addition  to  what  we  had  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief. 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  For  my  edification,  what 

  

 

 

 

 

are  the  cases  ­­ I  know  Bailey  is  one.  What  are  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  ones  you're  relying  on? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Well,  in  Swift  v.  Wickham  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  best  exposition  of  what  this  narrow  construction  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictive  construction  is  about.  The  words  clearly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  in  the  prior  statute,  "On  grounds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutionality." 

            

And  this  Court  read  that  phrase  not  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  a  very  important  clause  of  the  Constitution,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

supremacy  clause,  because  it  was  important  to  keep  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrow  and  not  to  open  the  floodgates  to  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preemption  challenge  that  would  come  down,  even  though 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  challenges  are  very  important  and  often  much  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

devastating  to  the  State  than  a  constitutional  claim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

could  be.  That's  an  example. 

  

 

 

 

            

In  Gonzalez,  this  Court  read  the  phrase  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28  U.S.  1253,  which  is  the  direct  appeal  provision  ­­

read  to  not  include  any  denial  of  an  injunction  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  been  a  sound  basis  for  not  convening  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  court  in  the  first  place. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

And  the  Court  phrased  it  that  broadly  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  whatever  basis  there  might  be  to  not  convene  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  court.  That  means  you  don't  get  the  direct 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal,  which  is  a  very  important  part  of  this  whole 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  scheme. 

 

            

It  became  more  important  with  the  rise  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reapportionment  cases,  which,  by  the  way,  the  reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  don't  see  any  old  reapportionment  cases  in  the  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  is  they  would  have  been  foreclosed  by  this  Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent  until  Baker  v.  Carr. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  with  the  rise  of  those,  the  part  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structure  ­­ not  the  three­judge  so  much,  but  it  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct  appeal  that  became  more  important  to  the  States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  protect  them,  as  ­­ as  was  spoken  to  by  the  assistant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S.  attorney  general  Robert  Dickson  who  testified.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  quote  his  testimony  at  page  30,  talking  about,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  that  direct  appeal  and  the  ability  to  get  an

have  had  to  be  conducted  under  plans  that  were  adopted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  district  courts,  contrary  to  what  the  legislature  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided,  and  it  was  very  important  to  have  access  to

election  disrupted  by  that  order. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  idea  that  Petitioner  insists  on  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insubstantiality  rule  is  not  a  merits­based  test  is  just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

obviously  can't  be  true,  because  you  have  got  to  know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  merits  are  before  you  know  it's  insubstantial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  know  this  Court's  precedent  has  treated  it  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  matter.  But  I  would  submit  that  it  ­­ it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  doesn't  meet  the  set  of  tests  that  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg  laid  out  for  the  Court  in  Arbaugh  of  what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  and  what  is  not. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  idea  that  there's  a  clear  division 

   

 

 

 

 

 

between  insubstantially  and  failure  to  state  a  claim  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  borne  out.  And  in  one  of  the  cases  cited  by  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  in  their  brief  at  page  23,  Kalson  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Paterson,  the  2008  Second  Circuit  case  illustrates  that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  there  a  single­district  judge  is  deemed  able  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide  it  because  it's  insubstantial,  even  though  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  acknowledges  that  the  theory  is  not  foreclosed  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent. 

            

It  just  comes  around  to  saying,  yes,  it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insubstantial.  And  it  rules,  it  affirms  the  grant  of  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motion  on  the  pleadings  under  Rule  12(c),  which  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Second  Circuit,  as  in  most  other  circuits,  is  analyzed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly  like  a  Rule  12(b)(6)  failure  to  state  a  claim 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

motion.

The  claim  there  was  that  the  State  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  used  voting  age  population,  which,  interesting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough,  is  the  issue  that  this  Court  has  noted  probable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  on  in  Evenwell.  And  there  a  three­judge 

   

  

 

 

 

 

court  in  Evenwell  dismissed  under  12(b)(6). 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  you  have  a  court  in  the  Second  Circuit 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that's  insubstantial.  Whether  or  not  they  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  or  they  analyzed  it  right  under  Goosby,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reached  that  conclusion.  And  they  ­­ they  did  it  on  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis  that  it's  hard  for  me  to  distinguish  from  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12(b)(6)  analysis.  And  then  the  three­judge  court  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Evenwell,  which  this  Court  will  be  visiting,  did  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole  matter  under  a  12(b)(6)  analysis,  which  is  maybe  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  more  detailed  than  the  Second  Circuit  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insubstantially  analysis,  but  really  hard  to  tell  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference.  How  did  you  reach  that  conclusion? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Sullivan,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

guess  I'm  ­­ I'm  not  so  inclined  to  think  that.  We

sound  kind  of  merits­y.  But  ­­ but  we've  cabined  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  know,  we've  basically  said  that's  only  when  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely  ridiculous.  And  so  there's  no  case  at  all. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  just  a  laughing  stock  of  a  case,  given  our 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

precedents.  And  that's  a  very  different  kind  of  inquiry

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Well,  it's  easy  when  it's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  green  men  and  the  extraterrestrials,  but  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  the  cases  that  have  arisen  and  been  addressed  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court.  Goosby  v.  Osser,  the  court  of  appeals  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  case  ruled  that  it  was  insubstantial,  the  claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  that  prisoners  had  to  have  access  to  absentee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ballots,  because  this  Court  had  a  prior  case,  McDonald, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  had  said  the  prison  system  there  and  the  election 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system  was  ­­ it  was  fine  not  to  allow  the  prisoners  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  absentee  ballots. 

 

 

            

And  when  it  came  to  this  Court,  Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Brennan  for  the  Court  said,  you've  misread  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

president;  McDonald  doesn't  foreclose  this  case.  So  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  extraterrestrials  and  no  little  green  men.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  panel  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  don't  know  what  you  mean 

    

 

 

 

 

 

by  "extraterrestrials."  What  are  these  ­­

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Aliens  ­­ aliens.  Some  of

something  that  on  its  face  you  could  say  that  could

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Okay.  And  that  ­­ that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

what  you  mean  by  "extraterrestrial"?

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Bailey  is  ­­ I  mean,  Bailey 

   

  

 

 

 

 

was  the  mirror­image  case.  I  mean,  it  was  a  case  where 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  African­American  plaintiffs  were  saying  they  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  right  to  travel  without  discrimination  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interstate  commerce,  as  I  read  it.  And  they  convened  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  court  because  they  wanted  to  set  aside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mississippi  law  to  the  contrary,  in  1961.  And  the  court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  but  it's  absolutely  clear  that  a  statute  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires  segregation  is  unconstitutional.  So  this 

  

 

 

 

 

shouldn't  have  even  been  heard  by  a  three­judge  court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  there  has  to  be  some  kind  of  an  issue.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words  it  uses  are  it  doesn't  require  a  three­judge  court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  claim  that  a  statute  is  unconstitutional  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholly  insubstantial. 

 

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  But  there's  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  He's  speaking  nonexistent.

the  Federal  law  was.  I  mean,  that  was  the  nature. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

So  ­­ so  I  don't  see  how  that  helps  you. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Well,  I  don't  know  if  it

that  that's  a  significant  expansion,  if  not  a  complete 

   

   

 

 

 

 

departure  from  Bell  v.  Hood,  which  addressed  when  a

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That's  true,  but  I  mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

they  put  down  a  standard  as  to  whether  or  not  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  court  is  necessary.  And  they  say  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  court  is  not  necessary  when  the  reason  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving  the  three­judge  court  ­­ you  know,  if  it's  ­­ if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  insubstantial.  In  that  case  you  have  to  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  court,  I  guess,  when  there's  some 

   

 

 

 

 

constitutional  issue.  They  said  there  is  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  issue,  not  because  it  was  frivolous  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  Mars,  but  for  the  opposite  reason:  The  law  was

I  guess  you're  going  to  think  certainly,  he's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  right,  and  the  question  is,  is  he  clearly  wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  But  I  would  submit  that, 

   

  

 

 

 

under  this  ­­ the  Court's  prevailing  rule,  the  Court  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  adopts  the  Federal  rules,  and  all  ­­ all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  judges  are  bound  for  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  a  district  judge  is  entitled  to  grant 

   

 

 

 

 

 

relief,  as  under  the  Bailey  case,  it  seems  reasonable  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allow  that  judge  to  determine  that  a  complaint  on  its 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

face  is  legally  sufficient,  as  the  court  would  in  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  case. 

 

            

These  ­­ these  rules  are  binding,  unless  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  find  in  the  statute  a  reason  that  compels  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  judge  not  to  comply  with  the  civil  ­­ the  rules 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  civil  procedure,  then  the  district  judge  is  in  his  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her  rights? 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  So  you  say  "required  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute"  means  "states  a  claim"? 

   

 

 

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Well,  I  think  that  it 

   

  

 

 

 

could  ­­ it  incorporates  that  understanding  as  much  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  incorporate  the  insubstantiality,  because  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  presumptions  that  courts  rely  on.  A  case  is  not 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  proceed,  pass  a  motion  to  dismiss,  certainly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  under  Iqbal  and  Twombly,  unless  it  satisfies  Rule  8. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  just  a  basic  understanding  of  every  district

court  in  the  land.  And  it  seems  strange  that,  if  ­­ if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  cases  are  that  important  and  they're  going  to

courthouse  is  going  to  get  an  automatic  direct  appeal  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  So  let  ­­ let's  assume  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  district  judge  who  says  it  fails  to  state  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim.  And  ­­ what  does  the  plaintiff  do?  Where  does 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  appeal  go? 

 

 

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  To  the  court  of  appeals,  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  every  other  case. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  So  it  goes  all  the  way  up, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  if  ­­ if  he  loses  in  the  court  of  appeals,  he  tries 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  come  up  here,  right?  And  we  finally  decide  it  did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state  a  claim.  Then  what  happens?  It  goes  back  down 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  you  begin  all  over  again  with  a  three­judge  court, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Wow.  Wow,  that's  ­­ I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

mean,  that's  my  comment.

departure  from  the  norm,  as  the  three­judge  statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creates,  you're  going  to  have  some  situations  that  may

had  in  a  normal  functioning  of  the  content.  But  that's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  mean,  the  other 

    

 

 

 

 

alternative  is  it's  a  three­judge  district  court,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

then  we  have  to  take  it  on  the  merits.  I  mean,  that's  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious  problem  because  there  are  a  lot  of  cases  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  up  in  three­judge  district  courts  that  would  be  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  case  ­­ I  speak  for  myself,  anyway  ­­ that  we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  deny  cert  in,  to  let  the  issue  percolate.  And  now 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  three­judge  district  court,  no,  we  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide  it  on  the  merits. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Well,  you  had  seven  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

direct  appeals  from  Maryland,  as  we  cite  in  our  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  brief,  that  ­­ the  cases  we've  had  in  recent  years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  were  dismissed  by  a  single  judge,  they  would  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  come  here.  And  we're  one  State  times  50  ­­ 400  more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct  appeals,  perhaps?  I  don't  know  how  frequently 

    

 

 

 

 

 

these  cases  are  filed  in  other  States.

always  lurking  in  all  the  cases  prior  that  this  Court

First,  a  comment  about  Swift  v.  Wickham.

the  meaning  of  the  statute.  There's  nothing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent  about  that  holding  with  our  position  before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court. 

 

            

            

Second,  with  respect  to  the  ­­

holding  in  that  case  was  that  a  preemption  claim, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

although  it  involves  a  question  under  the  supremacy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

clause,  is  ultimately  really  a  statutory  claim.  And  so 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  just  isn't  of  the  sort  that  Congress  meant  to  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  before  a  three­judge  court,  as  a  matter  of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  the  statute. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  it  doesn't  matter 

  

 

 

 

 

whether  that's  frivolous  or  not? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  That's  right.  Yes.  It  ­­

  

  

  

 

 

 

it's  a  completely  different  holding.  It  has  nothing 

   

  

 

 

 

 

whatever  to  do  with  the  question  whether  a  substantial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  has  to  go  before  the  three­judge  court.

a  single  judge  will  say  there  are  three  issues  here;  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  definitely  involve  a  three­judge  court,  but  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

previous  are  ones  that  I  can  reach,  and  so  I  will  reach 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  first. 

 

            

            

Does  that  happen  very  often? 

 

 

 

 

MR.  KIMBERLY:  Not  so  far  we're  aware  of. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  ­­ we  are  aware  that  it  has  happened.  It  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem  to  be  a  frequent  occurrence. 

   

 

 

 

            

The  Third  Circuit  in  Page  indicated  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  that  happens,  because  the  statute  applies  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action,  that  the  entire  action  must  go. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  I  could  say  something  briefly  about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

purpose.  My  friend  on  the  other  side  of  the  podium 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested  that  the  sole  purpose  here  for  the  statute  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  protect  States  from  improvident  grants  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

injunctions.  If  that  were  the  case,  you  would  expect, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Section  2253,  to  see  ­­ which  is  the  ­­ the  provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  provides  for  appellate  review  over  judgments  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  district  courts  ­­ you'd  expect  to  see 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory  and  direct  review  before  this  Court  only  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

final  judgments  of  courts  granting  injunctions.  But  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  what  2253  says  in  express  terms  is  that  there's  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  of  immediate  appeal  before  this  Court  from  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grants  and  denials  of  relief  in  cases  heard  by  the  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  courts.

otherwise,  we  ­­ we  would  have  to  say  that  you  get  ­­

MR.  SULLIVAN:  Well,  I  think  ­­

State  wins.  No  appeal  for  the  plaintiffs. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  Well,  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  think 

   

   

   

  

 

Respondents'  position  is  if  relief  can  be  denied,  it  may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  granted.  That  ­­ an  order  of  that  sort  may  be

review  before  a  court  of  appeals. 

   

 

 

 

            

Our  ­­ our  ­­ our  point  is  only  that,  if  the

grants  of  injunctions,  you  would  see  ­­ and  that  single 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judges  in  turn  could  decide  everything  else,  you  would

understand  it,  his  strongest  argument  on  the  other  side 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  roughly  go  ­­ he  didn't  put  it  this  way  ­­ like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this: 

            

On  your  side  is  the  fact,  well,  why  wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  three­judge  court  decide  a  very  important  question  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  in  this  area? 

 

 

 

            

On  the  other  side  of  it  is  that,  well,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  have  left,  in  three­judge  courts  primarily,  almost 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusively,  reapportionment  issues,  which  are  specially 

 

 

 

 

 

political. 

            

And  to  put  these  all,  you  know,  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  ­­ because  of  the  opinions  you  point  out  in  Vieth, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  huge  variation  of  all  kinds  of  different  legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  that  might  be  made.  And  if  there  is  a  set  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  where  this  Court  should  be  careful  as  to  when  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  and  which  it  enters  in  which  order,  i.e., 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion,  if  we  accept  your  view,  that  set  of  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  we  should  be  particularly  careful  as  to  how  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceed  will  be  the  set  of  cases  where  we  have  no  choice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  we  have  to  take  immediately  whatever  variations  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  theme  of  disproportionate  gerrymandering,  da  da  da, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  order  they  happen  to  arise  and  whenever  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happen  to  arise,  because  we  have  no  choice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  So  I  have  two  responses  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that.  The  first  is  it's  reflected  in  the  congressional

record  and  the  testimony  before  Congress  that,  indeed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  was  quite  concerned  with  the  political 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sensitivity  of  these  cases. 

 

 

 

            

The  way  that  Congress  decided  to  deal  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  political  sensitivity  was  to  ensure  that,  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  instance,  these  cases  are  decided  by  a  panel  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three  judges,  as  ­­ as  Judge  Henry  Friendly,  in  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony  before  the  92nd  Congress,  indicated  there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  concern  was  to  ensure  that  adherents  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  than  one  political  party  were  deciding  these  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because,  not  only  to  ensure  greater  deliberation  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accuracy  and  decision  making,  but  also  because  it  might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  unseemly  to  allow  a  single  judge  to  decide  such  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

politically­sensitive  case  where  it  might  appear  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  or  not  it  actually  is  true  ­­ where  it  might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appear  to  the  public  that  his  or  her  own  political 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ideologies  and  predilections  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  now  you  have  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

now  you  have  cases  quite  often,  particularly  in  the  most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sensitive  ones,  decided  by  a  vote  of  two  to  one.  So  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  know  how  that  ­­ how  that  particular  answer  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  responsive  to  the  concern  that  Justice  Breyer  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed  out,  which  ­­ which  is  one  I  share.

majority  of  these  cases  that  make  it  before  this  Court

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  to  go  back  to  your  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Just  to  follow  up: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

In  ­­ in  recent  years,  is  it  true  that  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reapportionment  cases,  the  majority  of  the  way  we've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

handled  direct  appeals  has  been  summarily? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  With  all  due  respect,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you'd  probably  be  in  a  better  position  to  answer  that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  No,  no.  I'm  just 

  

  

 

 

 

 

talking  statistically. 

 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  I  mean,  certainly  the  Court 

    

 

 

 

 

has  been  taking  a  large  number  of  these  cases  recently. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  been  two  or  three  each  term.  I  ­­

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  KIMBERLY:  Right.  And  I'm  sorry.  What 

  

  

  

 

 

 

I  mean  is  noting  probable  jurisdiction  and  taking  full 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefing  and  arguments  in  two  or  three  such  cases  each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term. 

            

But  that,  at  least  as  I  understand  how  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  operates,  is  ­­ is  a  question  of  ­­ of  discretion, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it  notes  probable  jurisdiction  and  takes  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional  step. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  On  the  issue  of  political 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sensitivity,  if  it  goes  to  a  single  judge,  you  will  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  decision  by  a  judge  who  has  presumably  been  selected 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  spin  of  the  wheel,  or  by  ­­ at  random,  and  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you'll  have  an  appeal  to  a  court  of  appeals  panel  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  presumably  chosen  at  random.  Whereas  if  it  goes  to  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  court,  there  will  be  a  decision,  and  it  may 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involve  some  very  sensitive  findings  of  fact  by  a  panel 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  hand­picked  by  the  chief  judge,  who  is  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  to  appoint  himself  or  herself  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three­judge  court  and  select  a  third  district  judge  who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  chief  judge  believes  is  likely  to  agree  with  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defer  to  the  chief  judge. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  don't  see  how  that  ­­ how  that  creates 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  insulation  against  the  appearance  of  political 

 

 

 

 

 

 

favoritism.

MR.  KIMBERLY:  Well,  I  ­­ it  may  be  so  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  those  cases,  if  ­­ if  a  litigant  or  a  member  of  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  dug  down  behind  how  the  panel  is  appointed,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  might  be  a  basis  for  raising  a  concern.  But  it's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  reflected  in  the  congressional  record  that  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  Congress's  judgment  that  the  best  protection  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  concern  ­­ and  ­­ and  indeed,  this  goes  back  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

original  version  of  the  Act  back  in  1910,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress's  concern  was  that  the  public  could  rest  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

easy  when  decisions  of  such  political  importance  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sensitivity  are  decided  by  three  judges  rather  than  one. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions. 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The  case  is  submitted.
