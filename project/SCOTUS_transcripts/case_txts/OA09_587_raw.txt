 Mr. Colombo. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY J. COLOMBO 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. COLOMBO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

 The California Supreme Court's denial of 

Respondent's ineffective counsel claim was entitled to 

the deferential review for reasonableness prescribed by 

28 U.S.C. section 2254(d).  By its plain terms, nothing 

in 2254(d) requires a State court to render a reasoned 

or explained decision, nor is there anything in section 

2254(d) that would treat Strickland claims differently 

from any other Federal constitutional claim. 

 Here, the Ninth Circuit failed to give the 

State court decision the proper deference -- indeed, 

double deference -- it was owed.  Rather than applying 

this Court's proper -- excuse me -- clearly established 

Strickland standard, the court of appeals employed its 

own eccentric rule that essentially requires counsel to 

always consult with and present expert testimony in

every case in which the prosecution -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do -- how do we know 

that the -- the California court even reached that 

question?  Because there was -- wasn't there a motion to 

deny review as -- as -- wasn't there a time bar question 

6 

raised? 

7

10

11 

12 

13

 MR. COLOMBO:  There was a procedural bar 

that was argued in the informal opposition to the 

petition for writ of habeas corpus that had been 

requested by the California Supreme Court.  It did not 

invoke that bar as a basis for denying relief.  Under 

well-established -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of course, it said -- it 

14 

just said denied on -- on the merits.  And it's still 

15

not clear to me how to -- pardon me.  It just said 

16 

"denied"? 

17

18

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's still not clear to me 

19 

how to distinguish that, between denied, deny -- do we 

20

21 

22 

23

say, when there's a one-line order, as in this case, 

where it says simply "deny," it is presumptively on the 

merits?  I mean, how -- how do we interpret that? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes.  In fact, that is a 

24 

well-settled and long-established practice, local 

25

practice.  It's well-understood by not only the 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

litigants, but the State and Federal courts of the Ninth 

Circuit, dating back to the Ninth Circuit's 1974 

decision in Harris v. Superior Court. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then it is presumptively 

on the merits? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  They don't -- I mean, is 

that the way it's stated?  Don't let me use my 

formulation.  What's -- what's the State's formulation?

 MR. COLOMBO:  The State's formulation is 

that the silent or so-called summary denial is on the 

merits, unless the State court indicates otherwise in -­

each of the States in the Ninth Circuit, no? 

 I mean, some State could -- could have a 

different rule, I assume.  You're -- you're telling us, 

however, that California has that rule? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes.  And that rule, again, 

has been well-established -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But did -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if I'm on the 

California court and I have two choices -- one is to say 

denied, no explanation, as this case; the other is to 

say denied on the merits -- if I have those two options, 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company

then why are they both on the merits? 

2

3 

4 

5

 MR. COLOMBO:  Again, because it has 

certainly been well-understood for at least three and a 

half decades that when the California Supreme Court 

renders a so-called silent denial, that it is on the 

6 

merits unless the court ordered -­

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And what is the leading

California authority on that proposition?

in which -­

12 

Okay. 

 MR. COLOMBO:  That would be In re Robbins,

 MR. COLOMBO:  -- which is discussed in our 

14 

brief, as well as in the reply brief.

15

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  Thank you. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I don't know 

17 

that you answered Justice Kennedy's question. 

18

19

20

21

 MR. COLOMBO:  I'm sorry. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know you 

answered his question. 

 His question was:  If you can deny or deny 

22 

on the merits, what's the difference between the two? 

23

 MR. COLOMBO:  There really is no 

24 

substantive -­

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There's two choices, so 

6

they have to have different meanings in some way. 

2

3 

4 

5

6

 MR. COLOMBO:  I would submit that there is 

no substantive distinction between an order that simply 

reflects denied versus one that reflects denied on the 

merits. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They showed us the 

7 

docket for that day -­

8

10

11 

12 

13

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- of the denial here, 

and there were different ones.  If it's the same court 

taking action, why would they choose one over the other 

for particular cases? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  Well, I submit that there 

14 

could be any number of reasons, and not the least of 

15

which this Court addressed itself in Carey v. Saffold, 

16 

just a couple of terms ago. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 As the Court recognized, that sometimes the 

State court may choose to include the phrase "on the 

merits" to give a reviewing court an alternative basis 

for understanding why relief was denied, or to let, for 

example, a pro se petitioner, who are typically the ones 

that present petitions for writs of habeas corpus in the 

California Supreme Court, know that their case wasn't 

denied because of some mere procedural technicality, but 

because the claim itself was substantively meritless.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's what -­

that's feeding into your adversary's argument, that when 

the court does a summary denial, you don't know whether 

it's procedural or merits.

 That's his argument.  You're adopting his 

6 

argument?

 MR. COLOMBO:  No.  No.  Our argument is that 

it's a long-settled, established question of local 

practice that when the California Supreme Court renders 

a -- a silent denial, simply says "petition for writ of 

habeas corpus denied," it is understood by the court's 

litigants, has been well-established for over three and 

a half decades:  That is a merits decision. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what would the 

California Supreme Court do if they all agree that this 

application should be denied, but two of them think it's 

for a procedural bar -- timeliness -- and then others 

think it has no merit, and they say just "denied," but 

there's no majority for either one?

 MR. COLOMBO:  In -- in that instance, then 

the claim would be presumed -- assuming that the court's 

order simply reflected "petition denied," again, it's 

well understood that that would be a denial on the 

merits.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even though, in fact, it

wasn't?

 MR. COLOMBO:  Well, we can't know that.  In 

fact, it would be purely speculative to suggest that 

that's what the courts have done.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So we -- so there is that 

possibility -- even though there is that possibility, we 

should assume it was on the merits. 

 What about -- I mean, you said this is three 

9 

decades, but we are told that the California Supreme

Court has this pattern of saying merits when it's on the 

merits; giving a citation, if it's a procedural bar to 

the -- a procedural fault; and when it says simply 

"denied," that's most likely that they couldn't all 

agree on a reason.

 MR. COLOMBO:  Well, I would respectfully 

disagree with that suggestion, that because it simply 

says "denied" without including the phrase "on the 

merits," it's not a merits determination. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's what they 

would say if, in fact, they were divided, right? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  I'm sorry.  What? 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If, in fact, the court 

was divided, all agree that the petition should be 

denied, but there's no majority for any particular 

reason, merits or procedure, they -- they would say 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1 

"petition denied," right? 

Official 

2

3 

4 

5

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes, if it's -- if it's a 

straight silent denial, and the -- the court doesn't 

invoke either a procedural bar to deny relief or forgo 

the procedural bar and find that the claims are 

6 

substantively meritless in any event.

12

18

20

 What I submit that the silent denial simply 

means is the court didn't agree that there was a basis 

for invoking a procedural bar; the claims were 

meritless, and it simply orders the petition denied, 

which is, again, well-understood.  It's a 

well-established practice in the -- in the State and 

Federal courts in California that those silent denials 

are merits determinations, which are entitled, then, to 

AEDPA deference under the statute. 

 Even the Ninth Circuit, in the en banc 

decision in this case, recognized that the California 

Supreme Court's silent denial was a merits determination 

which it then had to review.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do -- does the court 

21 

sometimes deny explicitly on procedural grounds? 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes.  And when the court does 

that, it will reflect such in its orders.  That's 

discussed in footnote 34 in the Robbins case, which we 

discuss in our brief in this Court. 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 The court says when it's going to invoke as 

a basis for denying relief on a Federal claim, it will 

indicate that in its order.  If it's relying on a 

separate State procedural default, for example, if it's 

a successive petition of the claimant's previously

raised on direct appeal or -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you're saying that if 

it's on both grounds, if they agree with both the 

procedural and the merits ground, they may well just -­

just deny without any explanation?  But if they deny 

only on the procedural ground, they will -- they will 

say it? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If you looked back at a 

sample of the cases in which they have simply said 

"denied," would we find cases in which no procedural bar 

was raised by the State? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  I don't know the answer to 

that question, because I haven't researched to find out 

whether or not in any of those cases, like in this case, 

the California Supreme Court directed the Attorney 

General to file an informal opposition or some other 

pleading that would have addressed that question. 

Without knowing whether or not there was briefing on 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

this -- those particular cases, and there's no 

suggestion in Respondent's brief that that was done, I 

couldn't -- I couldn't guess on that. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Was there a procedural 

issue in this case before the California Supreme Court? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What was that? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  A timeliness bar, among 

1

4

others.

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What was the basis of 

11 

that?

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

21 

22 

23

 MR. COLOMBO:  That the claim of ineffective 

assistance could and should have been discovered at an 

earlier time than when it was presented to the 

California Supreme Court under California's timeliness 

rule, which would require that counsel present the claim 

of, in this case, ineffective assistance upon learning 

of the factual basis to support such a claim. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it took 14 months for 

this petition to be filed to the State court.  Do you 

have cases that show whether those 14 months are 

presumptively unreasonable under California law? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes.  And that's basically the 

24 

Clark case that's also discussed in our brief.

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So there is great

validity, you think, to your timeliness -- so this 

timeliness claim.  And despite that, you believe the 

silent denial was an adjudication on the merits. 

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes, because I would submit 

that when the State argued that the claim was 

procedurally barred by reason of untimeliness and the 

State court did not invoke that as a bar to relief, it 

necessarily concluded that the claims were 

unmeritorious, because they otherwise could have been 

barred by a procedural bar, but they -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought you just told me 

that if they -- if they agreed both with the procedural 

ground and the merits ground, they could issue just -­

just a denial without explanation.

 MR. COLOMBO:  That's -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now you're telling me 

17 

that -- the opposite. 

18

 MR. COLOMBO:  If I said that, then I 

19 

misspoke or perhaps I misunderstood the Court's 

20

21

22 

23 

24

25

question. 

 What I'm suggesting is if the court invokes 

as a basis for denying a Federal claim a State 

procedural bar, it will reflect that in its order. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That will always be in the 

order. 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But if, in this case, they 

did reject it on a procedural ground, and it was a 

reasonable ground that they applied consistently, then 

the Ninth Circuit or the Federal courts couldn't 

1

2

consider the claim at all; is that right? 

7

 MR. COLOMBO:  That's correct, assuming that

the Federal courts agreed that the State bar wasn't -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If, in fact, the -- they 

are right, if in fact that the State was correct that 

this is procedurally barred -- they should have raised 

it earlier; they didn't -- and if that was correct and 

reasonable and proper under both Federal and State law, 

then you shouldn't be in this subject at all; is that 

right or not? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes.  That's correct.  Yes. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So, normally, to decide a 

matter on a substantive -- to have a presumption that 

they were deciding it substantively rather than 

procedurally will help a defendant, though not in this 

21 

case. 

22

23

 MR. COLOMBO:  That's correct. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But you didn't raise -- you 

24 

haven't argued that it's procedurally barred.

On the other hand, your opponent has, as I gather, until 

they got here, never argued that it was based on 

anything other than the merits.  So they might have 

waived that.

 MR. COLOMBO:  Well, I'm not sure that -- we 

never invoked a procedural bar in the Federal court 

insofar as the presentation of these particular claims. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  One thing that's not 

14 

waived is the second question, or the first, which is 

15

16

17

the merits of the Strickland claim. 

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes.

 MR. COLOMBO:  I would -- I would be pleased 

to discuss that with the Court. 

 We have argued in our brief, and I think 

it's crystal clear:  First of all, the Ninth Circuit's 

grossly overbroad explication of a so-called Strickland 

standard that would require counsel in every case in 

which the prosecution presents forensic -­

 MR. COLOMBO:  No.  They didn't say that. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or did they say, in the 

circumstances of this case, given the nature of the 

issues, that consultation would have been effective? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  That is -- that certainly is 

one reading of the Ninth Circuit's opinion.  I submit 

that the more correct reading, so to speak, would be if 

the Court looks at the language that the Ninth Circuit 

uses in -- in discussing this standard, they essentially 

say, since counsel should have reasonably expected the 

prosecution was going to present this forensic evidence, 

he should have not only investigated it, he should have 

consulted with experts.  He should have presented them. 

And I think -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We could take issue with 

-- with the timing of that consultation, but let's 

assume that it turns out afterwards that if he had 

consulted an expert, that that expert would have told 

him that one of those blood spots absolutely had to be 

Klein's near the bedroom.  You would have no quarrel 

with saying it would have been ineffective for that

the expert were to give that kind -- an expert would 

have given that kind of exculpatory information, that 

that would not have been ineffective? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  Let me start by saying this: 

First of all, we can't know and no one can ever know 

that Klein's, or Johnson's blood, for that matter, was 

in this blood pool that the Ninth Circuit -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not talking -­

 MR. COLOMBO: -- focused its attention on.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I gave you a 

hypothetical different from the facts of this case.  I 

take the Ninth Circuit to be saying, if you're in an 

area, and you are a lawyer, where you have no expertise 

and your case depends on a technical issue, it behooves 

you to at least talk to an expert to find out if you are 

on the right track.  And if you fail to and you get 

something that's completely exculpatory, you're 

ineffective. 

 So I posed the hypothetical:  If an expert 

would have looked at all of these test results and said,

that has to be Klein's blood there, it can't be 

Johnson's for this reason, you are positing that even 

under that circumstance there would not have been 

ineffectiveness for the failure to consult with an 

expert?  Is that what you are telling us? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes.  And the reason why I say 

that is because it's important to remember that the 

critical forensic evidence in this case, that the jury 

was -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You keep wanting to 

return to this case, and I respect why you want to, but 

I am positing a hypothetical that underlies, I think, 

the Ninth Circuit's point. 

 MR. COLOMBO:  In response -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It may well be in this 

case that the consultation would have resulted in no 

prejudice.  That's different from whether it was 

effective to ignore a consultation.  Those are two 

different questions.

 MR. COLOMBO:  I suppose, accepting the 

Court's hypothetical as stated, that counsel was aware 

of and failed to consult with an expert knowing that 

that testimony would be presented, could be deemed 

deficient performance under -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- do you think it 

18

makes a difference whether the expert would have -­

would have helped or not?  I mean, counsel has to make 

that decision of whether to call an expert ex ante, not 

ex post.  I mean, you -- we shouldn't evaluate his 

decision on the basis of whether, even if it's a 

1,000-to-1 long shot, it turns out that that testimony 

would have been very successful. 

 Don't we have to examine it ex ante before 

9 

he knows what the result will be?

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes, and I think it's 

important to look at -- as this Court has described in 

the Strickland case itself, we have to view from 

counsel's perspective at that time.  What did he know? 

What could he have reasonably expected the prosecution's 

evidence to be?  How is he going to meet that evidence? 

16 

What tactical or strategic choices -­

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, Justice Sotomayor's 

hypothetical would include the situation where he 

doesn't know that the prosecution is going to introduce 

any expert testimony.  He knows that there is blood 

there.  He should -- he should get his own expert, 

whether or not the prosecution uses one.  Right? 

 I mean, can it never be ineffective 

24 

assistance not to call an expert where -- so long as the 

25

prosecution doesn't have one on the other side? 

19

 MR. COLOMBO:  No, I would submit that it 

certainly could be deficient performance if counsel 

fails to investigate readily available evidence that 

could lead to exculpatory evidence in support of his 

client's defense.  That's the hypothetical, I believe, 

6 

that Her Honor asked a moment ago.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, could?  Really?  Is 

that your test?  It could -- there's some remote 

possibility?

 MR. COLOMBO:  Again, I think it would be -­

it's going to be fact-specific depending upon the kind 

of case.  It may well be in a given case that forensic 

testimony would not be controverted, would not be 

disputed.  It wouldn't be relevant, necessarily, to the 

defense. 

 Let's say, for example, that there was no 

dispute that the person who committed the offense left 

DNA evidence at the crime scene, and it's clear that the 

DNA evidence suggests that the perpetrator was the 

defendant.  Then the court -- then the defense attorney 

isn't going to profit by consulting an expert to dispute 

an indisputable issue. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But isn't it the reality 

24 

that sometimes the defense doesn't want to have an 

25

expert, because the expert may turn up findings that are

adverse for him, and it's better for the defense counsel 

to just leave things murky and argue to the jury that 

the State didn't produce the evidence, either?  That's a 

perfectly legitimate strategy, isn't it?

 MR. COLOMBO:  It is.  And I think that in 

many instances that would -- that would inform a defense 

attorney's strategic choices as to how to present the 

defense in a given case. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Colombo -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Unless the -- sorry. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Colombo, you -- you 

say in any event, leaving aside the question of whether 

there was ineffective assistance of counsel, even 

assuming there was, there would -- there would be no 

prejudice in this case. 

 MR. COLOMBO:  That's correct.  Yes. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And could you just 

18 

summarize why you say there would be no prejudice? 

19

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. COLOMBO:  Well, first of all, I think 

it's important to recognize that the expert declarations 

that were proffered by Respondent in support of his 

habeas petition really don't challenge the testimony 

that was presented in the State trial by the State's 

experts, specifically the question of whether or not the 

murder victim could have been moved from, supposedly, 

21
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

the area outside the bedroom door onto the couch. 

2

3 

4 

5

 The testimony at trial suggested that that 

distance was somewhere between about 20 and 25 feet. 

There was no evidence at the crime scene that suggested 

the victim had moved from the point where he was shot 

6 

with a fatal gunshot wound. 

7

8 

9 

10

11

12 

13 

14 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the -- the 

pool of blood?  There was one expert affidavit that said 

something about -- that Johnson, standing up, could not 

have produced that amount of blood. 

 MR. COLOMBO:  I think the actual expert 

declaration suggested that the prosecution's theory, as 

the expert described it, could be eliminated, because 

Johnson could not have bled into the blood pool 

sufficient to have formed it by merely standing and 

16 

waiting for the police to arrive. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 I think it's important to realize the 

distinction between the prosecutor's theory which he 

propounded in his closing argument versus the evidence 

that the jury actually heard at trial from the State's 

own blood-spatter expert that suggested in order for -­

for Klein to have been moved from the point where the 

blood pool had formed onto the couch where his body was 

discovered by the police, there would have been some 

trail or some indicia, some evidence that would have 

22
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

suggested that he had to have been moved from that 

point. 

 And the more important question, I suppose, 

4 

would be, as the dissenting opinion pointed out in this 

5

6 

7 

8

case:  Why would the victim have been moved if he had 

been shot at that location?  Why would he have been 

moved onto the couch? 

 It certainly makes no sense for another 

9 

victim, who's already shot, who's intoxicated, who's 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

wounded and moving around in the house -- why would he 

have wanted to have moved the victim of the gunshot 

wound to the head from point A to point B?  It just 

doesn't make any sense.  And there has never been 

anything in any of Respondent's experts' declarations 

that suggests a rational explanation for how or why that 

16 

could have happened.  Without -­

21

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  On the -- on the no 

prejudice issue, are you relying just on what 

happened -- what was found at the scene of the crime?  I 

mean, you said it's implausible that Klein would have 

been moved with no trail of blood at all.  So, you say, 

therefore no prejudice. 

 Any -- anything else that goes into your no 

24 

prejudice argument?

25

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes.  I think for all of the

24 

25

reasons that are discussed in the dissenting opinion at 

pages 193a to 194a of the petition for writ of 

certiorari -- excuse me -- of the appendix. 

 As the dissenting opinion points out, it 

certainly was -- there's no evidence in the various 

experts' declarations that suggests, first of all, why 

the jury would have believed Respondent's trial 

testimony that after having essentially partied with the 

two victims for several hours the night before, they 

suddenly leave, go back to their place of employment, 

come back two hours later to return property and a 

firearm to another occupant of the house that they had 

no reason to believe was actually there; then they are 

suddenly surprised by these two victims; that there is a 

spontaneous gunfight that ensues involving a firearm 

that's never found, that's never attributed to either of 

the two victims in the house, that could have only been 

attributable to the Respondent himself. 

 So the jury had all of that evidence to 

consider, and we balance that against these -- as I, 

again, described them -- inconclusive and speculative 

expert opinions that are proffered in support of 

Respondent's habeas petition.  The jury could not have 

been persuaded to find the defendant not guilty, even 

had that evidence been introduced. 

24

 So, necessarily, Petitioner could -­

Respondent could not have been prejudiced by the failure 

to introduce that evidence, assuming that that evidence 

was, in fact, available and could have been presented in 

this case at the time of Respondent's trial. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Was there additional 

7 

physical evidence found not at the scene? 

8

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes.  In fact, the -- the 

9 

other thing that really tied the Respondent into this 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

crime was that there was an expended casing at the crime 

scene that matched perfectly with a loaded firearm 

magazine with the exact same kind of bullets and a box 

full of the same exact bullets in the Respondent's house 

when the officer served a search warrant, along with the 

stolen gun safe and some evidence that there was 

marijuana there, which the victim -- the surviving 

victim was -- admitted to be a marijuana dealer. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I ask you a question 

19 

about California procedure?

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

 Is what happened here unusual?  Is there -­

doesn't -- does the prosecution have an obligation to 

provide notice before trial of its intention to call 

expert witnesses? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes.  Under California 

discovery rules, the prosecution would have to disclose 

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

3

5

to the defense any evidence it intends to introduce, 

either by way of lay testimony or expert testimony, 

before the trial commences.

requests that, does -- what's the defendant's reciprocal 

6 

obligation, if any? 

7

8 

9 

10

11

 MR. COLOMBO:  The defendant would have to 

disclose any witnesses that he or she intends to 

introduce at trial, including expert testimony and any 

reports supporting such experts. 

 Unless the Court has any further questions,

I'd like to reserve my remaining time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD GARDNER 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 MR. GARDNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

 The Court has invited briefing in the 

additional question presented on the application of 

AEDPA in this case, and in light of the Court's many 

questions this morning, I want to address that.  But I 

did want to clear up one piece of information that seems 

26
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

to be confusing in the record, and if I can start with 

that. 

 This was in response, I think, to a question 

4 

you asked, Justice Ginsburg, regarding the -- the 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

prejudice prong of the Strickland claim.  And the 

question was:  Why is it -- why is it not -- why is it 

harmless?  And counsel suggested that there was an 

absence of blood between the blood pool and the couch. 

Detective Bell testified to that.

 And I just want to clear up, because I know 

this -- this bit was confusing in the briefs, too:  That 

is not what Detective Bell testified to.  If you look at 

pages 181 and 195 in the reporter's transcript in 

Exhibit R5, you will see that Detective Bell says, yes, 

there were drops leading away from the couch; yes, there 

16 

were drops leading away from the blood pool. 

17

 And in fact, Exhibit R5 is a picture of the 

18 

couch, and you can indeed see -­

19

20

21 

22 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that the point 

was that there was no trail from the bed.  I mean, the 

theory was that Klein was removed from the bed to the 

couch. 

 And I thought that the point that the -­

24 

that counsel for the State emphasized was, did the -- if 

25

someone were moved from the bed, taken to the living 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

room couch, you would have expected to see a trail of 

blood from the bed.  And there wasn't that. 

 MR. GARDNER:  Indeed.  But the State's 

4 

theory -- the defense theory was that the body had been 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13 

14

17 

18

moved from the blood pool -- not the bed -- the blood 

pool to the couch.  And the State's response, in its 

briefing and today at oral argument, was that there was 

no blood trail between the blood pool and the couch. 

And, indeed, that's not what Detective Bell testified 

to.  He said there were drops outside the blood pool, 

drops outside the couch, and when asked if there was 

blood in the carpeting in between, he said he did not 

remember how much blood there was in between. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so the idea is 

that Johnson drags Klein.  This is your theory, right? 

Because you are not suggesting he could have lifted 

Klein and walked him over, are you? 

 MR. GARDNER:  Yes, I think he could have 

19 

lifted him, Your Honor.

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Really?  Did you 

21 

have an expert testify to that? 

22

23

 MR. GARDNER:  No. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Did you get expert 

24 

testimony about that or an expert report about that?

25

 MR. GARDNER:  No.  There was no -- there was 

28
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

no expert testimony about the ability of someone to -­

to lift a weight. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you think you 

4 

can assume that he could lift the weight.  How much did 

5

6

Klein weigh? 

 MR. GARDNER:  I think he weighed between 150 

7 

and 160 pounds.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And Johnson? 

 MR. GARDNER:  I think about the same, Your 

Honor. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  And you say 

that he could have dragged him from the pool to the 

couch because there were drops along the way. 

 MR. GARDNER:  I'm saying that -- that the 

testimony and -- and the suggestion that there was no 

trail of blood between the blood pool and the couch is 

not consistent with what Detective Bell testified to. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And what is your theory 

about why he -- why Johnson would have a motive to go 

through this exertion?  He's -- he's wounded.  And let's 

say there really was a gun -- a gun fight, and Klein 

fell someplace else.  Johnson wants to make it seem like 

Klein was -- that there wasn't any gun fight.

 Why -- why is it so valuable to him to move 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

Klein's body from the location where you think he fell 

to the couch? 

 MR. GARDNER:  Well, if he's -- if he falls 

4 

in the bedroom doorway, Your Honor, and he falls in a 

5

6 

7 

8 

9

10

11 

12 

13

crossfire, then Johnson is in some ways culpable.  Now, 

we don't know what the extent of his culpability is, but 

if he's involved in firing the first shot, he is 

culpable. 

 Putting Klein on the couch and having as 

State's theory that Klein is shot in cold blood on the 

couch eliminates his culpability, or at least eliminates 

the risk of it. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But he could have -- if he's 

14 

going to make up a story, he could have made up the 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

story that Klein jumped up and he was shot without 

having engaged in any firing himself, and he fell 

wherever he fell.  Putting him on the couch doesn't seem 

to -- unless I'm missing something and I wish you'd 

explain it -- doesn't seem to aid this purportedly false 

story very much. 

 And if you weigh whatever benefit there is 

from that against the exertion of moving this guy, it 

doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense.  But 

maybe there's something there that's not apparent.

 MR. GARDNER:  Well, I can only say that if

house.  He has scales.  He has all sorts of drug -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why wouldn't he wipe up the 

blood?  I mean, what -- what good is it to simply put 

him on the couch when you leave a pool of blood showing 

that that's where he was shot? 

 MR. GARDNER:  Yes, I don't doubt that in 

9 

retrospect he could have come up with a better plan, 

10

11

12

13 

14 

15

16

17

18 

19 

20

Your Honor. 

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. GARDNER:  But I do think it's important 

to realize that this plan, at least on its face and 

initially, in terms of his adrenaline response, is going 

to get him out of a crossfire scenario. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What other -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, there's a lot 

of talk about the importance of this pool of blood, but 

as I read Detective Bell's testimony, he never posited 

-- or talks about how that pool was formed.  Only your 

21 

expert does that. 

22

23 

24 

25

 What Bell does talk about, however, is that 

there's a high-velocity blood splatter in front of the 

couch and that the pooling of blood on Klein's face 

shows that he was shot there. 

31
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 Your experts do nothing to refute that 

testimony, which was really the basis of -- of Bell's 

testimony.  He had nothing to say about the pool of 

blood.  He talked about why Klein was shot where he was 

shot.  And there's no expert testimony to refute that. 

 So how do you get past there being a 

reasonable probability of a different verdict when there 

is nothing to refute the critical testimony at issue, 

that Klein was shot where he was shot because there's 

10

high-velocity blood splatter in front of him and because 

11 

the pooling on his face shows that? 

12

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. GARDNER:  Let's take both the 

high-velocity blood spatter and the pooling, Your Honor, 

but let me start with the predicate.  And you are right, 

Detective Bell did not testify at all about the 

formation of the blood pool, and that's why this case 

isn't about anticipating a State's expert about the 

blood pool, but about getting your own for your own 

case.

 But turning to the specifics of your 

question, the high-velocity blood spatter.  It actually 

wasn't in front of the couch, Your Honor.  It was to the 

side and below the arm.  And let's remember Detective 

Bell's testimony about how the homicide occurred, 

because the State's theory was not that Pat Klein was 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

shot while he was lying on the couch, but that he was 

sitting on the couch. 

 And so what's -- what's most interesting 

4 

about the high-velocity blood spatter, since he's shot 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

11

14 

15

22 

23

in the head, is that there is none on the wall 

immediately behind the couch.  This was a matter of some 

confusion in the briefs as well, but I think it's been 

cleared up.  There's no high-velocity blood spatter 

behind, on the pristine white wall.

 So the question is:  If he's shot while 

sitting up, the high-velocity blood spatter that Bell 

testifies to travels, oh, about 4 feet over the couch, 

and then two drops sink down.  Now, in terms of the jury 

evaluating that testimony, it's important to note that 

Detective Bell gave a description of what high-velocity 

blood spatter is, and he said it's a fan-like pattern of 

atomized blood.  And when you look at these two drops, 

these two drops alone that travel 4 feet and then drop 

straight down to fall on a plastic bag, you see, as 

defense counsel pointed out in his closing argument, 

that they are the same size as blood drops found in the 

kitchen on Exhibits R18 to R22. 

 And Detective Bell's entire theory for why 

24 

these were high-velocity was their size.  There was 

25

never any dispute that there was no shooting in the 

33

kitchen.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, what other 

expert evidence should Richter's counsel have pursued 

before deciding upon his course of action in this case?

 Put aside the blood-spatter expert.  What 

6 

other experts did he need to consult? 

7

8 

9 

 MR. GARDNER:  Putting aside the 

blood-spatter issue -- and these were raised in the 

lower court but not addressed -- there were -- he 

10

promised the jury ballistics testimony as well, which he 

11 

didn't produce. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  We have got a 

13 

blood-spatter expert, a ballistics expert.  Go on.

 I thought, in their habeas proceeding, you 

said he should have consulted a serologist and a 

pathologist.  Okay, that's four.  Why wouldn't he have 

wanted to talk to an expert on the effects of alcohol 

and drugs on people's different perceptions of the 

events?

 MR. GARDNER:  Well, I think the chief reason 

is, is that that wasn't part of his theory.  If you 

look -- and really, the guide to this, Your Honor, is 

defense counsel's own theory, because defense counsel 

stands up in opening statement and he promises the jury 

a theory.  And the theory isn't you're going to hear two

 His theory, as he explained to the jury, was 

the physical evidence will show you Pat Klein was not 

shot on the couch.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, he had not received 

notice from the State that they were going to call any 

experts, so why wasn't it reasonable for him to assume 

they're not going to call any experts, they're not going 

to be able to pull experts out of their pocket in the 

midst of the trial, and the judge isn't going to allow 

them to do that without providing a -- without granting 

a recess?  What seems to have happened here seems pretty 

unusual. 

 MR. GARDNER:  Well, if this case were about 

anticipating the State's decision to call an expert, I 

would agree, but it's not.  And the reason it's not is 

because we have an insight into what defense counsel's 

theory of the case was before the State ever started its 

case, Your Honor.  I mean -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought the Ninth 

Circuit said that part of the ineffective assistance was 

failing to consult an expert in planning his defense and 

in preparing his defense, not simply responding to the 

State's expert in the middle of trial.

 MR. GARDNER:  I agree, Your Honor, and if I 

35
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

said something that sounded like I didn't, then I 

misspoke.  My point is that that's exactly the theory. 

Once defense counsel decides on his defense -- in this 

case, I think he picked the right defense.  He told the 

jury the physical evidence would prove Pat Klein wasn't 

6 

on the couch, and he could have done that. 

7

 But despite promising the jury that the 

physical evidence would prove this, he never consulted 

with someone.  And once -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you explain the 

blood pooling in the face for me?  You talked about the 

high-velocity, but -­

 MR. GARDNER:  Yes, I did.  I didn't get back

to that.  Thank you, Your Honor.

 The testimony was, of course, about the 

blood pattern flow on the face.  And when you read 

Detective Bell's testimony carefully, that testimony has 

nothing to do with where Pat Klein is shot.  It has to 

do with the angle of his face after he's shot.  So if 

he's shot on the bedroom -- in the bedroom doorway and 

falls and that's the angle, the blood flow would be the 

same.  So it really -- the blood flow pattern really has 

little to do with where he was shot, but just the angle 

of his face.

 And getting back to the blood spatter

itself, the blood pool itself, what's interesting in 

this case now is that, even after all these years, the 

State has never disputed the fact that the absence of 

satellite drops means the State's theory is false.

 Gunner Johnson could not have deposited that 

blood, because there's no satellite drops, which means 

it had to come from another source.  The only other 

source is Pat Klein. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Did I understand you 

-- I just want to step back to the prior answer. 

 You think what counsel did here would have 

been effective assistance but for exactly what he said 

in the opening statement? 

 MR. GARDNER:  If -- I'm sorry.  If the 

question is, but for the opening statement, would we 

still have this argument, yes, although it would be much 

more difficult to establish what his theory was.  The 

opening statement doesn't change the Strickland 

analysis.  It simply gives us an insight, an easier path 

into knowing what counsel's theory was, much like -­

much like the case of Wiggins v. Smith, where the Court 

looked at defense counsel's opening statement in the 

penalty phase repeatedly to see what was his theory and 

what didn't he do.  And when there was a suggestion made 

in Wiggins v. Smith that, in fact, counsel's theory was 

37
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

2 

3

something else, the Court said no, look at his opening 

statement.  We know what his theory was. 

 So it doesn't change the standard, but it 

4 

gives us a very keen insight into exactly what he was 

5

7

12

thinking and when he was thinking it. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Gardner, what about 

the argument that all this is beside the point because 

the argument for prejudice is so weak, given all the 

other evidence that Mr. Colombo referred to?

 MR. GARDNER:  Well, it will come as no 

surprise to know that I disagree with that argument, 

Your Honor, and -- and for a couple of reasons. 

 The -- the cases really came down to Gunner 

14 

Johnson v. Petitioner Richter.  Who was the jury going 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

21 

22 

23

to believe?  Even on the record that counsel has 

described, the jury deliberated 14 hours.  And remember, 

that record included a surviving eyewitness, and if you 

believe the surviving eyewitness, the case is over. 

 The jury deliberated over 14 hours, asking 

for reinstruction twice and a rereading of testimony 

three times.  And I think there's good reason for that 

pause. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, of course, Johnson 

24 

had given so many inconsistent statements at the outset 

25

that he was a weak prosecution witness. 

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. GARDNER:  Well, I think -- actually, I 

agree with the predicate of the question, Your Honor, 

and that is Johnson had given a number of stories.  He'd 

given four or five different stories.  And after all, he 

knew both Branscombe and Richter.  When he first spoke 

to the 9-1-1 people, they said:  What happened?  He 

said:  Five people came in and shot me.  Then he said 

four, then he said three.  And when they said, Who, he 

said:  I don't know.  So clearly Gunner Johnson was a 

compromised witness, Your Honor. 

 But the fact that the State has a 

compromised witness is not the reason not to research 

the physical evidence and enhance your client's 

credibility.  It's more of a reason to do it. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you do with the 

19 

ammunition back at Richter's home, that the -- the gun 

20

21 

22 

23

safe is found there and the unlikely story about them 

going -- having the zeal to clean up their workplace and 

then coming back? 

 MR. GARDNER:  Well, let me take them one at 

24 

a time, Your Honor.  And in a sense, the ammo and the 

25

gun safe, the answer is -- is very similar.  All parties 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

agreed in this case that several weeks before the 

incident, Gunner Johnson had stored all his belongings 

at my client's house.  And, so, the only dispute was had 

the -- the gun safe included.  And this is one of the 

unusual features, is that the State's theory requires us 

to believe that this happened so he could rob a gun safe 

that had been at his house for weeks. 

 The question was had -- had the material, 

9 

the gun safe and the ammo -- who's was it and had it

been taken back to Gunner's house?  The ammo is found in 

a place with two other things.  It's found with a scale 

used for measuring drugs, and it's found with shotgun 

ammunition. 

 Now, the record shows that Gunner Johnson 

had a shotgun, and Gunner Johnson was a drug dealer.  So 

the defense theory, of course, is that this ammo wasn't 

my client's.  It was Gunner Johnson's and hadn't been 

moved back.  Similarly, as to the safe, there was 

conflicting testimony as to whether the safe had ever 

been moved back. 

 So, that really is the explanation.  And 

that, I think, is why the jury had such pause about this 

case when it heard the case. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You mean the case 

against Gunner you've just described, would it have been 

40

enough, and wouldn't that have justified counsel's 

decision to focus on credibility rather than expert 

physical evidence? 

 MR. GARDNER:  I think not.  And -- and -­

and we know this again for two reasons.  And let me 

start by saying the fact is that when counsel was asked, 

that wasn't the reason he gave.  It's not as if he -- he 

came to the depo and he said this was my tactical 

reason, and so we can say, okay, that's a reasonable 

10

tactical decision.  That wasn't the decision -- reason 

11 

he gave.

15

17

19

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 When asked did you decide not to present or 

why didn't you present this blood-spatter testimony, he 

said I simply didn't know it was out there.  And after 

all, let's keep in mind this was only his second 

trial -- his second murder trial.  He didn't know what 

was out there.  So, he didn't make that tactical 

decision.  And that's the first reason. 

 The second reason, I think, is that -- and 

almost every case that has ever addressed this -- and I 

have cited most of them -- has come to the same 

conclusion.  When there is a credibility determination, 

when a defense -- any defense lawyer worth his salt 

knows that there's a credibility determination to be 

made, the jury is going to believe either this story or

my client's story, it at least behooves you to 

investigate to see if the physical evidence can support 

your position.  You can always make -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Did -- did counsel 

have to investigate the other aspects?  I mean, we're 

talking -- we're focusing on the scene where the 

shooting took place.  Did he have to consider experts 

with respect to the bypass, where they threw the guns, 

Richter's apartment, the vehicle that was used?  One 

thing counsel said is he thought about hiring a tire 

expert because of the vehicle.  He has to look at the 

possibility of expert testimony affecting every aspect 

of the various scenes that were pertinent in this claim? 

 MR. GARDNER:  I don't believe so. And -- and 

the reason, again, comes back to the same focus this 

Court had in Wiggins, another failure-to-investigate 

case.  What we know is that counsel suggested to the -­

told the jury in opening statement, this is about the 

physical evidence.  The physical evidence will show 

this. 

 When counsel -- when it's clear that that's 

counsel's position in a case, it's simply application of 

the Strickland test.  It's unreasonable for counsel not 

to at least have investigated the physical evidence that 

he told the jury would show that Klein wasn't on the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What does -- what 

happens -- I know you have an answer that that's not 

this case, but what -- what happens if the defendant 

tells his lawyer, look, I did it, I'm guilty?  And the 

lawyer decides that the best thing to do is try to pin 

it on a guy whose nickname is Gunner? 

 (Laughter.) 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does -- does -- what 

else is the lawyer supposed to do?  He thinks no matter 

what -- what physical evidence is found, it's got to cut 

against his client because his client did it. 

 MR. GARDNER:  Well, in a situation where -­

14 

where counsel's investigation will not be exposed to the 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

prosecutor, and -- and there was questions before about 

how California procedure works.  And, indeed, once you 

decide to name -- to call a witness, you name him and he 

becomes, you know, exposed through cross-examination and 

for investigation.  But at least in terms of your 

private investigation of a case, the ABA standards are 

fairly clear that even an admission of guilt doesn't 

affect your ability or your obligation to investigate. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if -- if the expert 

24 

says that the pool of blood all belonged to -- I guess 

25

it's Johnson, I certainly think ethically that you could 

43

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  So, that's a 

reason why defense counsel in this case and, the Chief 

Justice puts, in many cases prefers not to have experts, 

just so they can punch holes in the State's case. 

That's a -- that's a legitimate strategy.  And this 

counsel was very -- an adept cross-examiner.  There's no 

doubt about that. 

 MR. GARDNER:  I -- I don't disagree, except 

that again we come back to the -- the notion from 

Wiggins, which is you can't defend a tactical judgment 

that wasn't made.  And, in fact, when counsel was asked, 

is this the reason you did this, he said no.  I didn't 

call a blood-spatter expert because I didn't know it was 

out there.  I -­

who knows that his client is guilty, and you say the ABA

he was guilty, not that counsel knew he was guilty. 

2

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right. 

 MR. GARDNER:  The ABA standards say that the 

4 

duty to investigate, the broad duty to investigate on 

5

defense counsel exists irrespective of the client's 

6 

statements to his lawyer. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  We've never adopted the ABA

standards, have we?

 MR. GARDNER:  I -- I -- you know, I can 

understand that, Your Honor, but from practical 

experience, I will tell you the fact that a client 

admits to something doesn't mean he did it or she did 

it.  That's the real world consequence we face as 

defense lawyers.  Often our clients tell us things, and 

you can't always believe them, whether they say they're 

21 

innocent or whether they say they're guilty. 

22

23 

24

that's not an infrequent occurrence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  To -- to the police, 

perhaps, yes, but to his own counsel?  I -- I'm -- I'm 

not aware of any literature to that effect. 

 MR. GARDNER:  In which case I'll come back

10

that that's not my case.  It seems like a safe haven at

this point.

corpus in my client's case with an order that said the 

petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied.  That same 

day in five other cases, noncapital cases, the 

California Supreme Court denied the writ saying the 

petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied on the 

merits.  And the State's position here today and in the 

briefing is that the Federal court should simply ignore 

that difference.  And I don't believe that's the case 

for several reasons.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is your answer to 

the -- to -- to the representation that In re Robbins 

settled that when the California Supreme Court says just 

denied, it's on the merits? 

 MR. GARDNER:  Well, actually I agree and I 

disagree.  In re Robbins does settle the matter from a 

State law perspective, but not as the Attorney General 

has suggested.  In re Robbins says a few things. 

 First, it says that when we deny a case on 

19 

the merits, we add the phrase "on the merits."

20

 Then it says that when we find a procedural 

21 

default, we cite to that default so that everyone knows. 

22

23 

24 

25

 And then it says -- and this was in response 

to a question I think you asked, Justice Scalia -- they 

say a third thing.  They say sometimes we'll find both, 

that it's meritless and it's defaulted, and we will say

both.  We will cite a default, and we will say it's 

denied on the merits as well, trusting that the Federal 

courts will give deference to -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But what they cite it for, 

actually, is they make a slightly different argument in 

their brief.  They say going back to 1974, there are at 

least three cases in the Ninth Circuit that have said 

when the California Supreme Court says nothing, just 

denied, we take that as a decision to reach the Federal 

issue and deny it on the merits. 

 Now, not in your case, but in most cases 

that will benefit a defendant, because it will avoid the 

question of whether there's an adequate and independent 

State ground of a procedural nature.  So, what they're 

saying is that that's the Ninth Circuit's statement in 

three cases, and the California Supreme Court over a 

course of 30 years has never said to the contrary, which 

it had plenty of opportunity to do, and in other 

instances where the Ninth Circuit was wrong, it did do 

it. 

 So, that, I think, is a fairly strong 

argument.  Now, you're going to -- the only reason that 

you're not out of court on your own interpretation is 

because you'll say that the State waived the procedural 

issue.  And then they'll come back and say so did you. 

48
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

 So, what -- what is your response to all 

2 

that? 

3

 MR. GARDNER:  Well, I -- there's a whole 

4 

bunch there, so let me see if I can -- if I can tease it 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13

out.  It is true that the Ninth Circuit has had this 

process, this procedure for a long time, and, of course, 

it developed in a pre-AEDPA world, when the fact whether 

something was on the merits or not didn't really matter. 

The only question was, Was it defaulted?  And if it was 

defaulted, it might bar Federal review.  Whether it was 

on the merits was really irrelevant because, before 

2254(d), that really didn't matter. 

 So that's where -- and I agree with the 

14 

State -- that's where those cases come from.  I don't 

15

believe, however, that the waiver argument is really 

16 

implicated here, Your Honor. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, look, for example, in 

Hunter v. Aispuro -- they quote it as saying the 

following:  The California Supreme Court's denial of a 

State habeas petition, quote, "without comment or 

citation constitutes, a decision on the merits of the 

Federal claims."  End quote.  And then they have three 

other cases roughly to the same effect. 

 Now, what you're saying is that this Court 

should hold to the contrary, and by the way, in doing

14 

15

that, we will bar many Federal habeas petitioners from 

the Federal courts, because what it will mean is that 

there is an adequate and independent State ground in 

case after case, which perhaps is an irrelevant feature. 

But, nonetheless, the silence of the California Supreme 

Court is significant, I think, when faced with those 

pretty clear interpretations of what their silence means 

by the Ninth Circuit. 

 MR. GARDNER:  Yes.  And actually if the 

Ninth Circuit were the only voice in the fray, Your 

Honor, I think the argument would be stronger, but the 

Ninth Circuit's voice isn't the only voice in the fray, 

and that brings me to Ylst.  In Ylst, of course, the 

Ninth -- and Ylst v. Nunnemaker is a case which is part 

and parcel of this history from the Ninth Circuit of 

16 

saying silent denial is on the merits. 

17

18 

19 

20

21

24 

25

 In Ylst v. Nunnemaker that's exactly what 

the Ninth Circuit said.  And it came to this Court, and 

the State actually argued that it wasn't on the merits. 

And, indeed, this Court held that you cannot tell from a 

silent denial whether it's on the merits or not.  That's 

the first response, Your Honor, is that there are 

additional voices other than the Ninth Circuit.  The 

second is that well after Hunter v. Aispuro comes the 

Robbins footnote and in the Robbins footnote -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm having a very hard 

time with your reliance on that footnote because the 

very last paragraph of that footnote says when 

Respondent's asserts -- and I'm shortening the 

introductory line -- a State procedural bar and when 

nevertheless our order disposing of a habeas corpus 

position does not impose the proposed bar or bars as to 

that claim, that signifies that we have considered 

Respondent's assertion and have determined that the 

10

claim or subclaim is not barred on the procedural 

11 

ground. 

12

13

 MR. GARDNER:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the footnote itself 

14 

says unless we invoke the procedural bar, we're not

applying it. 

 MR. GARDNER:  I think that's right, Your 

Honor, but that's not the only thing the footnote says. 

The footnote says when we deny on the merits, we say on 

the merits; when we cite a procedural bar, we mean a 

bar; and if the State has raised a bar, as they did 

here, and we don't rely on it, that means we haven't 

relied on the procedural bar. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right. 

 MR. GARDNER:  When you put those together, 

what it means is there was no majority for a decision on

the merits, otherwise they would have said on the 

merits.  There was no majority for a decision on 

procedural default, otherwise they would have said 

default.  And that's what a silent denial means, and 

that's exactly what this Court said in Ylst.  You cannot 

tell because there are seven judges, there are different 

claims, there are different possibilities.  That's why a 

silent denial is there in State court.  It's 

precisely -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  There -­

there's no majority for either ground, and yet you find 

in favor of the State?  How can that be? 

 MR. GARDNER:  Well, I -- you say either 

14 

ground.  There are -- there are multiple grounds for 

15

procedural default, Your Honor, under State law.  There 

16 

are many possible procedural defaults.

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but you're -- you're 

positing that the only time they do not say either 

procedurally barred or on the merits is when they don't 

have a majority for either one? 

 MR. GARDNER:  That's correct. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  How can they render a 

decision in favor of the State, then, if there's no 

majority for either disposition?

 MR. GARDNER:  The question is, Why

deliberate to a majority when they sit around the 

conference, the seven judges -- let's say two judges 

believe there's a procedural default of untimeliness. 

Two judges think it's timely but think it should have 

been raised below.  Two judges think it's both timely 

and it didn't need to be raised below, but it hasn't 

been pled with sufficient specificity, and one judge 

thinks it's improper on the merits.  There's seven 

judges; they all believe it should be denied, but 

there's no majority for any position. 

 There's no reason for the California Supreme 

Court -- and this is addressed more in the amicus brief 

by the California Academy of Appellate Lawyers.  There's 

no reason for the California Supreme Court at that point 

to spend a day, two days debating it when all seven 

16 

judges agree there's a reason to deny the petition. 

17

18 

19 

20

21

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But under your example, 

isn't there a majority for the proposition that there's 

a procedural default, but disagreement as to the 

particular procedural default? 

 MR. GARDNER:  That could be.  And -- and 

22 

what the California -- I'm sorry. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If it's just a binary choice 

24 

between procedural default and merits, isn't there -­

25

and everybody agrees it should be denied, then there's 

53

going to be a majority for one or the other, right?

 MR. GARDNER:  That is true, and I have been 

unclear and I apologize for that.  It is not a binary 

choice between default and merits; it's a choice between 

which default and merits.  And there are many defaults 

under State law.  When the court denies on timeliness 

grounds, it will cite Clark.  When the Court finds that 

it has been pled with insufficient specificity, it will 

cite Swain -­

10

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is there more than one 

11 

possible procedural problem here?

 MR. GARDNER:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought it was just 

14 

timeliness.

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

 MR. GARDNER:  Well, timeliness was the only 

one raised by the State, but -- but to be sure, like 

this Court, the California Supreme Court has never been 

bound in terms of its procedural default findings by 

what has been raised and -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What others could apply 

21 

in this case? 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. GARDNER:  Well, at the risk of not 

wanting to argue against my client, I could give you 

some -- some that could apply that haven't been 

suggested and, therefore, most certainly are waived.

But the California law often requires that you file your 

habeas petition in a lower court first.  Reviewing 

courts often deny petitions for failure to file in a 

lower court first.

 There is a requirement that says you must 

plead with sufficient specificity.  That's often relied 

on by reviewing courts.  There is a requirement that 

says you must attach all readily available documents. 

That's another -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  With this confusion, your 

version, your colleague's version, when the district 

court -- the district court denied relief, did you ask 

the district court, please certify this question of what 

a silent denial means, certify it to the California 

Supreme Court so we will have once and for all an answer 

16 

of what a silent denial means? 

17

21 

22 

23

 MR. GARDNER:  The answer is no, I didn't 

request certification.  When we were in district court 

and when we were in the Ninth Circuit, both sides 

accepted the existing framework the Ninth Circuit had 

established applies to a silent denial, but only under 

-- only through the lens of independent review.  The 

Court's added question has put both of those at issue. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY J. COLOMBO 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. COLOMBO:  Thank you. 

 I think it's important to remember this is 

an AEDPA case.  It has always been an AEDPA case.  We've 

never asserted this case was not an AEDPA case.  The 

Court has had a very spirited discussion this morning 

essentially conducting a de novo Strickland review of 

the claims that are presented in the district court in 

this case. 

 It's important to remember that we have to 

14 

view, as this Court described in Woodford v. Visciotti, 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

23 

24 

25

a Strickland claim through the lens of the applicant's 

burden to demonstrate that the State court's resolution 

of the Strickland claim on the facts of his case was 

objectively unreasonable. 

 Whether this Court were to choose to find 

that the California Supreme Court's determination, if it 

were reviewed de novo, was improper is different from 

determining whether or not the State court could have 

reasonably concluded, on the factual record presented to 

it, that the applicant's claim failed to -- to show a 

basis for relief.  That -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it fair to say that this 

-- in this case, that every party in the lower courts 

assumed this was going to be a merits-related issue and 

that some deference was due, and that nobody ever said 

anything about it being a procedural issue where there 

would be a procedural bar of some kind that was either 

waived or not waived? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  That's correct.  The -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The first time anybody 

mentioned this procedural issue was when? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  When Respondent's counsel 

12 

filed his brief in opposition in this Court. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That was on the merits 

14 

brief in opposition?

15

16

that? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  That's correct.

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It wasn't part of the 

cert -- the question -- we added the question. 

 MR. COLOMBO:  Well, I would submit that if 

there was a dispute about the applicability of AEDPA 

deference to the California Supreme Court's summary 

denial in this case, it should have been raised much 

earlier than when we got to this Court.

Respondent's counsel was avoiding that.  I'm suggesting 

that if this was a legitimately disputed question, it 

could have been addressed much earlier.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  You've lost me. 

I thought you said -- I thought you said that they 

raised it in the brief in opposition to the petition for 

cert? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  No, it was not raised in the 

opposition to cert.  It was not raised -- it was not

 MR. COLOMBO:  Yes.  I wanted, if I may, just 

touch a couple of points real quickly.  On page 23 in 

footnote -- I believe it's 6 of our reply brief, there's 

a discussion about what the detective's testimony was in 

regard to this blood spatter near the couch where the -­

where the murder victim's body was found.  I think it's 

important to remember Respondent's counsel talked about

whether or not this spatter would have been consistent 

with having been shot on the couch if there were blood 

spatter behind the armrest. 

 What the detective testified to and what's 

described in our brief is the detective said because 

this was not a through-and-through exit wound -- that 

is, the bullet lodged in the victim's head -- that the 

spatter would have been what he described as back 

spatter, meaning the blood would have flown out from the 

victim's head outward, and that was consistent with what 

the evidence was at the crime scene that the detective 

observed when he was there after the murder was 

committed. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about the drops 

between the blood pool and the couch? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  The detective described those 

as essentially insignificant, that they didn't reflect 

anything other than that someone was moving around in 

the house, which was consistent with what the crime 

scene investigators had discovered when they first 

responded to the 9-1-1 call from the -- Mr. Johnson to 

the police. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any reason not to 

24 

do this?  I'm just thinking from our point of view -- I 

25

mean, I think it's probably correct what you say:

Nobody mentioned a word about this procedural issue 

until the brief in opposition on the merits, not the 

cert brief.  And the reason they did was perfectly 

legitimate:  We'd asked the question.

 Well, if we were wrong to do that, could -­

and if we took the opinion as being a question of 

reasonable deference, et cetera, and went into it, is 

there anything -- any reason not to put in that opinion 

somewhere, given Ylst and given the Ninth Circuit, it 

would be helpful if the California Supreme Court, for 

future reference, explained what their practice does in 

fact mean, whether it's procedural or whether it's on 

the merits? 

 MR. COLOMBO:  I would submit that that would 

be helpful but unnecessary. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.
