          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument

next in No. 02-1196, the Securities and Exchange

Commission v. Charles E. Edwards.

          General Olson.

          ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. THEODORE B. OLSON

                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

          MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

          Over 10,000 persons in 38 States invested $300

million in respondent's payphone business on the

expectation that their investments would yield a 14

percent return due to respondent's experience, efficiency,

and management expertise.  The decision below that these

transactions were not investment contracts merely because

they specified a fixed return to the investor, rather than

an unspecified portion of the enterprise's profits, can

not be squared with the language, history, and purpose of

the Securities Acts, 70 years of consistent SEC

interpretation and enforcement, and this Court's

jurisprudence.

          The congressional definition of security, as

this Court has repeatedly said, is broad and flexible, and

intended to be all-inclusive to cover the countless and

variable schemes devised by those who would seek money

from others on the promise of a return.  Congress

intended, in the words of this Court, to encompass

virtually any instrument that might be sold as an

investment, and the term investment contract, this Court

has held, was intended to be a broad catch-all. 

Therefore, substance, not form or title, governs. 

          These terms, investment contract, are to be

construed broadly to embrace - again, in the words of this

Court - all forms of investment schemes that bear a

resemblance to what is commonly understood to be a

security.  And this Court has said, because promoters are

so creative, these terms must be flexible and inclusive. 

A catch-all must catch all.  It is irrational to conclude

that Congress would have defined security -

          QUESTION: Mr. Solicitor General, may I jump

ahead for a second?  Is the - is your adversary correct in

saying that as far as decided cases are concerned, not the

position of the SEC, but there is no judicial decision

holding that a - an instrument that provides a fixed

return is an investment contract?

          MR. OLSON: Well, Justice Stevens, I can answer

this by saying that the seminal case, Howey, referred to

and cited Blue Sky cases and Federal court of appeals

decisions, which did contain those type of instruments,

fixed return instruments.  This specific question has not

previously been decided by this Court, but the Court has

never decided, and the cases that the Court referred to in

Howey did not ever say that - that the fixed return

instrument was excluded from the term investment contract.

          QUESTION: How about the United Housing case?

          MR. OLSON: Well, again, with respect to that

case, the - I - the Court has decided consistently that

what is critical is the - that the investor expects a

return.  The Court has never said -

          QUESTION: But the United Housing case did refer

- suggest that the requirement that the income come from

profits, did it not?

          MR. OLSON: Well, the - the references to the -

to the - this - from this - our perspective, Mr. Chief

Justice, is that the return must be examined from the

standpoint of the investor, the invest - and the Court - I

don't think the Court intended to restrict in that case,

and the language is not reasonably susceptible in my

judgement to the - to the understanding that that was

intended to exclude investments or instruments that

provided a fixed return.

          What the Court has repeatedly referred to is the

- from the standpoint of the investor, what the investor

is expecting to do is to put his or her money to work for

him or her, that is to say, put that money into an

enterprise of some sort so the investor can sit back and

watch the returns come in.  The investor doesn't care

whether that's a fixed return or a speculative return.  In

fact, the definition in both the 33 and the 34 Act

includes types of investments, such as common stock, that

have speculative returns built into their definition, so

to speak, fixed returns instruments, such as bonds,

preferred stock, indentures, and that sort of thing.

          Then the term, as this Court has repeatedly

said, those terms are relatively fixed and understood. 

But because Congress wanted to embrace, because this is a

remedial statute intended to protect the investing public

and the integrity of the marketplace so that people will

feel secure in investing their resources in other

instruments that promoters are offering -

          QUESTION: General Olson, you - you put the

stress on investment and that seems right with the statute

refers to investment contracts, but there are surely debt

instruments that would not be investment contracts.  So

what is the dividing line between something that

constitutes a plain old debt that is not an investment

contract and not a security, and one that is?  I mean, how

do we identify something as an investment contract rather

- rather than an ordinary debt?

          MR. OLSON: Well, I think the answer, Justice

Ginsburg, is that many of those instruments that are

ordinary debt instruments may be investment contracts as

well.  This Court has repeatedly said is that these terms

are overlapping -

          QUESTION: And what makes it - what makes

something an investment contract?

          MR. OLSON: Well, what this Court has said is

that when a person puts their money into a common

enterprise with the expectation - expectation of a return,

that is - through the - as a result of the efforts of

others, that is an investment contract.  Now, many notes,

or many types of offerings, might be based upon a fixed

return and might appear in the - to look like notes or

fixed return types of investments and still be investment

contracts.

          QUESTION: But the - depending on the investment

skills of others, that's - is very unhelpful to me.  I - I

would think most creditors who extend credit rely on the

investment skill or the financial responsibility of - of

the lender.  That's how they're going to get their money

back.  So, I - I find that test hard to work with as a

limitation.  I know it comes from Howey.

          MR. OLSON: It does - it does come from Howey,

and I think that the best way to look at that, Justice

Kennedy, is to look at that the investor, as opposed to

using his own resources, his own efforts, his own energy,

his own creativity, is counting on other people to make

the - the instrument -

          QUESTION: Well, but my point is all creditors do

that just on straight loans -

          MR. OLSON: Well - well -

          QUESTION: - so that doesn't advance us very far.

          MR. OLSON: Well, that's right.  That's correct. 

And there are some overlap, but this Court has said, and

it repeated it and analyzed it from that context in the

Reves case, that there are some commercial contexts and

some consumer contexts in which the Securities Acts were

never intended to cover.

          QUESTION: Well, the Reves case had language that

doesn't help you because it seems to exclude a fixed

return, but -

          MR. OLSON: Well -

          QUESTION: - so I - I don't -

          MR. OLSON: We -

          QUESTION: - know how great the Reves case is for

you.

          MR. OLSON: What the Reves case says, and I think

Your Honor is referring to footnote 4 in the case, in

which the Court, in construing what was meant by the - the

term note, looked at the definition of - in - in the

Forman case, which included the earlier Howey case, as to

define an investment contract.  But in that footnote, the

Court very carefully went on to say the definition that

we're examining here with respect to investment contract

is irrelevant with respect to notes.  That is dicta piled

upon dicta in a sense, because the Court - we - I - we

respectfully submit - mischaracterized Forman, the case

that the - where the Court was concentrating on the

difference between someone investing their resources to

get something to use, in that case -

          QUESTION: Well, if - if you - if you don't like

dicta that's against you, a lot of the things you've been

quoting are dicta that weren't really necessary to

deciding the case.

          MR. OLSON: Well, what we - Mr. Chief Justice, I

don't think that what we're quoting with respect to what

we're relying on is dicta.  What the - the Court is - has

defined the term investment contract, first of all, in the

Joiner case, and then in the Howey case in very broad

terms.

          QUESTION: Supposing I - I loaned someone

$10,000, they've just hung out their shingle to practice

law, and I'm - I want obviously the money back, but

whether I get the money back or not is very much going to

depend on his skill.  Is that an investment contract?

          MR. OLSON: That's - that is - that is probably

not an investment contract because it is a personal

transaction between individuals.  What this - could the

factors that this Court used in the Reves -

          QUESTION: Well, but all these are transactions

between individuals.  That doesn't distinguish anything.

          MR. OLSON: Well, what the - one of the - one of

the things that the Court said in Reves is that, to the

extent that there are any ambiguities at the edge and

those particular factors were considered in Reves, it -

the - the scheme of distribution, the nature of the

relationships between the individuals, is this - the - is

someone seeking to acquire money to use as capital in the

- in the operation of an enterprise -

          QUESTION: Well, is - are you saying then that a

one-on-one transaction can never be an investment

contract?

          MR. OLSON: No, we're not saying that.  In fact,

the Court held to the contrary in the Wharf Holdings case

that there may be - and in another case in this Court's

jurisprudence - that simply because there are one

individual or one entity dealing with another entity

doesn't exclude the - the operation of the term investment

contract.

          QUESTION: But the problem is, as - as you well

know, Justice Ginsburg begins it, and the Chief Justice is

asking the same question, if we're going to write this

opinion, it seems to me we have to have some limiting

principles, some limiting language.  Now, we could just

talk about these facts and it'd be a case good for this

ride only, but we're - we're wondering about whether or

not these facts yield certain insights as to what might be

definitional principles for an investment contract.

          MR. OLSON: Well, with respect to the cases at

the margin, the Court articulated the same kind of

analysis that the Securities and Exchange Commission does. 

Where there are cases at the margin, the Court will

consider the motivation of the person raising the money,

the person investing in the - in the operation, the nature

and type of promotion that's taking place, and - and the

motivations of the seller and things of that nature.  What

- what the question presented here is considerably more

narrow, the question presented here is it - is - is it

disqualified as an investment contract simply because the

return is fixed or specified?

          Now, if the Court were to adopt that definition,

imagine the size of the super highway loophole that would

be created in the Securities Act.  Instead of promising

the sky or - or a speculative return, the investors that

develop these types of schemes will simply say 50 percent

or 25 percent -

          QUESTION: Yes, but - but - but you don't - well,

maybe you do - we just say an investment contract can

include a fixed return and then remand it to the Eleventh

Circuit for it to figure out the puzzle?

          MR. OLSON: Well, it's not - the - the only

reason that the Eleventh Circuit decided that this case

couldn't go forward - they couched it in terms of

jurisdiction, but it's really failure to state a claim -

was that this instrument had a fixed 14 percent return and

said investment contracts can't not include that -

          QUESTION: So your point is that's all we have to

decide, whether the fact that it's a fixed return excludes

it from the definition of a security?

          MR. OLSON: Precisely.

          QUESTION: But it would be desirable to have some

clearer understanding of what's covered, and if you had to

take your best shot at constructing a definition, what

would it be?

          MR. OLSON: Well, I would adopt, and the

Government would propose, that the Court do no more than

rearticulate what the Court has repeatedly stated - and

it's stated it as well in Howey as it could possibly state

it - a transaction in which a person invests money in an

enterprise with the expectation of a return, gain, profit. 

Now, in the Forman case that we submit was not

characterized correctly in the Reves footnote, the Court

used all of those terms, the expectation of a profit, the

expectation of a return.  In Howey itself the Court -

          QUESTION: We - we've gone - gone around that.  I

mean, the problem is the ordinary loan, the ordinary loan

from one individual to another.  I loan you $10,000 and

you will pay it back over so many years and give me so

much interest a year, meets that qualification, meets that

description, and you acknowledge that that is not an

investment contract.

          MR. OLSON: The - what the Court has said is that

in - in those kind of cases, where it does not look as

typical as the typical investment scheme -

          QUESTION: What makes it look like a typical

investment - I mean, that's what we're trying to get -

          MR. OLSON: Well, the characteristics are -

          QUESTION: You say it is not the mere fact that

it's not a fixed return.  That isn't it.  What is it then?

          MR. OLSON: Well, the things that make it look

like an investment contract in this context is that the

individual is putting himself, his money, into an

enterprise that is being, in this case, widely promoted -

 as I said, 10 - over 10,000 investors put their money

into this enterprise hoping to get some return as a result

of the - the efficiency or effectiveness -

          QUESTION: So at least where it's marketed to the

public you would say it's covered, at least that, even

though you don't know backing up where to cut it off?

          MR. OLSON: Well, the - the precise lines here,

Justice O'Connor, may be difficult in a particular one-

on-one investment case.  The Court acknowledged that in

the Reves case, said that there - there are - there are

situations that look more like consumer transactions or

they may look - more look like -

          QUESTION: So isn't the question about the

individual transaction really related to the conflict on

this horizontal and vertical distinction that Judge Lay

relied on in his concurring opinion?  And as I understand

it, that's not before us as to the validity of his vote in

the case.

          MR. OLSON: That's - that's correct, Justice -

          QUESTION: Because I don't understand either

party to have addressed the - this alleged conflict over

horizontal or vertical.

          MR. OLSON: That was not what - yes, that's

correct.  Judge Lay discussed that in his concurring

opinion, but the court did not rely upon that, the parties

have not briefed that, and that question is not before

this Court.

          QUESTION: So it's entirely possible that you

could win here and the case would be remanded for the

court of appeals to decide whether or not Judge Lay was

right?

          MR. OLSON: I guess that's - I guess that's -

that's possible.  I -

          QUESTION: Your - your opening argument says

there are agreements for investment contracts -

          MR. OLSON: Yes, we did. 

          QUESTION: - that's what you asked us -

          MR. OLSON: Yes, we do.  And - and - I think that

there is - this is not a difficult case from that

standpoint, because all of the indicia that the SEC has

been using for years, and what the SEC has articulated

this standard in formal adjudications, to which this Court

defers under Chevron, it did 2 years ago in the Zandford

case, with respect to the SEC, there is here in this case

70 years of consistent enforcement of this principle by

the Securities and Exchange Commission -

          QUESTION: So to be clear about your - what

you're saying is, there are a lot of criteria that rule

out loans, ordinary loans, because after all, they would

otherwise come in the words evidence of indebtedness. 

There are a lot of words in this contract that could pick

up ordinary loans, but then there are a lot of criteria

that rule them out, of all those words, not just

investment contract.  And this case is about one word. 

What you would like is a decision that says, the word

profit in Howey meant profit in the sense of ordinary

return, return being broad enough to encompass fixed or

variable returns of various kinds, period, end of the

matter, reversed or remanded.  That's - that's your -

that's your point, not get into these other criteria for

other things.

          MR. OLSON: Precisely, and the Court has not done

that in the past, does not need to do so here.  There are

situations like the Reves case where the Court said, well,

some notes are securities, some notes are not securities,

and then goes through - what the Court in that case was

looking at, a Second Circuit decision that said, well,

some notes are not securities, some are securities, and

then laid out a methodology, which, by the way, is the

same methodology that the SEC understand - well - widely

understood to employ with respect to those cases at the

margin.

          But, Justice Breyer, I agree completely.  This

is a paradigmatic investment contract.  It's like the

cases involving chinchillas or rabbits, one of these cases

involving rabbits, it - there's two of the - two of the -

          QUESTION: Except it's different in that here

there's a fixed return.  In those, there was not.

          MR. OLSON: That's not correct, respectfully, Mr.

Chief Justice.  Two of the - two of the cases cited in

Howey, People v. White and Stevens v. Liberty Packing,

were -

          QUESTION: Well, I thought you meant cases in

this Court.

          MR. OLSON: No.  I'm talking about cases that

this Court accepted when it decided the Howey case, but

this Court has never -

          QUESTION: Well, that's a pretty, you know,

that's a pretty tentative attribution to - to this Court,

that - that it was paying that close attention that it

understood in all of those cases whether it was a fixed

return or not.

          MR. OLSON: Well, it certainly wasn't ruling it

out, Justice Scalia.  What this Court - what the - this

Court specifically said in Howey, because it had nothing

to go on.  Congress, first of all, decided to make the

definition as wide as possible to use again this Court's

language to cover everything that might commonly be

understood to be a security, and because promoters are so

ingenious, to cover all types of investments that might

carry some of those characteristics.

          So the Court said, we're going to look at the

cases that involve the Blue Sky statutes that - that had

been in existence and had been interpreted prior to the

adoption of the 33 Act.  There's not one of those statutes

that limited investment contract to a variable return and

excluded fixed return, was not one of those cases under

the Blue Sky statutes that excluded fixed return

investment contracts from the definition of investment

contract.

          QUESTION: Well, were - were they all fixed

return cases then?  You say there was not one of them that

excluded fixed returns.

          MR. OLSON: They were not - they were not - some

of them were variable returns, Mr. Chief Justice, but some

of them were fixed return.  The two cases I cited, the one

was People v. White, where, if the Court looks at that

case, the Court will find that the - the - the language of

it is - the party of the first part will pay $5,000 and

the party of the second part after 5 years will pay $7,500

back.  That was a fixed return investment.  But not only

did the Court in Howey cite those two Blue Sky cases that

involved fixed returns, but the Court cited then four -

and we mention these, I'll not go through the names again

here, we mention them in our briefs - four court of

appeals decisions that had involved no pooling of interest

and there - there have been two SEC formal adjudications,

which again, as I said, this Court gives deference to. 

          And the first time the SEC sought to enforce an

investment contract in this kind of context is SEC v.

Universal Services, which goes back to 1936.  Very seldom

does this Court have that kind of 70-year history of

consistent enforcement by the agency vested with

responsibility, and again, these have matured themselves

into not only court decisions but, in addition, formal

adjudications.  The securities laws have prophylactic

purposes.  They are designed to protect people that put

their money in the hands of other people who are running

business - businesses - and from whom they expect to make

a return.

          I invite the Court's attention to exhibit 17 and

particularly pages 116 through 119 of the joint appendix,

and this is the type of note that the - the respondent

will say, well, this was not our document, this was one of

our distributor's documents, but it's alleged in the - in

the complaint and there is evidence to support that this

is - this was out there available for investors to see.

There are millions to be made from pay - owning payphones,

watch the profits add up.  And then on page 119, this

document goes on to say, for the payphone owner, the need

to do individual things to make money is taken care of

through these management contracts, because the payphone

owner can benefit from the experience, operating

efficiencies, and management expertise provided by ETS

Payphones. 

          QUESTION: What sort of management expertise is

required to manage payphones?

          MR. OLSON: Well, there's - there are many of

things, at least, A, there was a promise that it was done,

and secondly, Mr. Chief Justice, where that payphone is

put, how it is managed, the appearance of the payphone, is

it - is it mechanically functioning properly.  This was

the promise that was held out - give your money to us, we

have thousands and thousands of these payphones -

          QUESTION: This isn't exactly Warren Buffett,

though, running around replacing payphones.

          MR. OLSON: Well, that's correct, Mr. Chief

Justice, and maybe that's the point, that - that the

thousands of investors who invested in this type of scheme

are the same type of thousands of investors that invest in

other types of schemes.  What the Securities Exchange Acts

require is that for people who are marketing opportunities

to invest widely to the public - and I use the word widely

carefully because it doesn't have to be that widely, but

it was here - to expect people to provide their money and

then to provide a return to put their money to work,

that's what the securities laws are all about, to provide

that remedial prophylactic purpose of requiring

registration so honest transactions will take place in the

marketplace.

          If the investor could do to - to - to comply

with the Eleventh Circuit and say, well, I'm not going to

say 14 percent anymore, I'm going to say you're going to

double your money every 5 years, or it's going to be a

good return, it's going to - it's going to be pie in the

sky, you're going to go home and retire, that would all of

a sudden make it not an investment contract.  And the very

people -

          QUESTION: But you're - you're saying that it -

it somehow remains - does it remain or not remain an

investment contract is - if all that you alter is that it

was not offered to the public, it's one individual who

loans money to this company and the business of this

company is with - with payphones, okay, and the deal with

him is you will get 14 percent a year back on your -

          MR. OLSON: If it's - if -

          QUESTION: - on your loan.

          MR. OLSON: Mr. - Justice Scalia, if it's the

same kind of transaction where I - I'm going to buy this

payphone, lease it back to me, I'm going to have a

management contract, and you're going to make a lot of

money, the fact that it's one person, this Court's

jurisprudence says does not make it not that - does not

make it not an investment contract.

          QUESTION: What - what makes it different just

from a straight loan?  What makes it different?  The

buying -

          MR. OLSON: Because it is a - it is -

          QUESTION: - the buying of the phone first or

what?

          MR. OLSON: It is a - it is a package in which it

- in the - in the first place is, I think, Justice

Breyer's question suggests it might - that might be a note

and that might be a security under certain circumstances.

But is it a - it is the type of scheme transaction in

which people invest their money on - for those types of

purposes, and - and in - where - where there are

difficulties at the margin, this Court and the SEC have

provided a formula by which these various different

factors can be examined as in the Reves case. 

          What I was about to say is that to the extent

that you change the requirement and allow it to be

speculative, the more speculative you can be, the less

likely you're required to comply with the securities laws. 

That seems like tilting the securities laws completely on

their head.  The people that are the least - that are the

most risk-averse are looking for guarantees of returns and

fixed returns.  The people that depend - that aren't the

Warren Buffetts, that depend upon the integrity of the

system, are the ones that are going to be most vulnerable

if the Eleventh Circuit decision is upheld.

          Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the

balance of my time.

          QUESTION: Very well, General Olson.

          Mr. Wolensky, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL K. WOLENSKY

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

          MR. WOLENSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

          We start with the language of the statute, and

that tells us two things.  First of all, commercial leases

is not a term included in the statute, and second of all,

the term investment contract is undefined.  But over a

course of 10 decisions during the past 60 years, this

Court has identified the essential attributes of

investment contracts.  It has identified those, defined

those, and explained those.

          One of the essential attributes of investment

contracts is a return of profits.  The Court's restrictive

definition of profits in the - in the Forman case and then

reiterated in the Reves case, captures very effectively

the investment risk and investment reward characteristics

-

          QUESTION: Is it your position that no debt

security could ever be an investment contract?

          MR. WOLENSKY: As long as it was a fixed return,

that is correct.

          QUESTION: Well, why it distinguished between a

fixed return and an other kind of debt security?

          MR. WOLENSKY: Well, under the SEC's explanation

in its briefs, it refers to a lot of things as fixed

returns, which are really just sham, boastful promises by

promoters, and I believe that's what takes this situation

completely out of what the SEC is proposing.  Both parties

here agree that the correct test the Court should apply is

the Howey test.  There - we don't disagree on that.

          QUESTION: And you contend that test would never

cover a debt security?  That's my question.

          MR. WOLENSKY: That is correct.  That test would

never cover a debt securities because this Court has

defined profits for Howey test purposes to mean an

expectation of profits from earning -

          QUESTION: What would be the underlying reason

for excluding debt securities and limiting the coverage of

the Act to equity securities?

          MR. WOLENSKY: Investment risk, Your Honor.  That

is the key.

          QUESTION: Well, there was an investment risk

here.

          MR. WOLENSKY: Well, there really wasn't, because

what you have is a commercial lease arrangement, a

telephone acts as the collateral, so to speak, to use this

Court's words from the Reves case, but you have a

commercial lease arrangement like commercial lease

arrangements done throughout the country -

          QUESTION: Well, but this is a leasing

arrangement that's really a financing arrangement.  The

use of leasing for financing purposes really developed

after the Act was passed -

          MR. WOLENSKY: It did -

          QUESTION: - and this is really a financing

transaction.

          MR. WOLENSKY: It can be characterized that way,

Your Honor.  That's correct.

          QUESTION: Well, certainly the person's return,

it didn't depend on what happened in his own phone booth,

the one he happened to own.  His - his risk was what the

overall enterprise would produce, as I understand it.

          MR. WOLENSKY: That's absolutely correct, Your

Honor, and that is a credit risk, not an investment risk.

          QUESTION: What's preferred stock?

          MR. WOLENSKY: Preferred stock is an - has both

investment risk, because it can have fluctuating values,

some do.

          QUESTION: So can debt.

          MR. WOLENSKY: Debt can if there's a market for

the debt.  That's correct.

          QUESTION: There is.

          MR. WOLENSKY: But the investor - that's correct

- but the characterization of the return to the investor

in debt is generally viewed as - as a return, the interest

rate, and as far as the market - market -

          QUESTION: That is preferred stock.

          MR. WOLENSKY: Preferred stock, but it's a

capital appreciation issue and that's not an issue here.

          QUESTION: So can debt appreciate.

          MR. WOLENSKY: Well, that's right, but that's

capital appreciation and we don't have capital

appreciation in this case.

          QUESTION: What about bonds?  The definition also

includes bonds.  The term security means any note, stock,

bond.

          MR. WOLENSKY: That's correct, and a bond is a

          QUESTION: It is indeed.

          MR. WOLENSKY: It's a specifically designated

type of security by Congress.  It is not - it does not

fall under the investment contract rubric.  It may vary in

its value and have capital appreciation -

          QUESTION: Yes, but - but when some of the things

that are specifically listed are fixed return items, it

seems hard to credit your contention that somehow the

reason investment contracts cannot cover this particular

arrangement is because this arrangement has a fixed

return.  But - but Congress intended the term security to

cover some things that have fixed return.  Why not

investment contracts?

          MR. WOLENSKY: Without question, it did, but

Congress and - and this Court has stated very clearly,

certainly in the Reves case -

          QUESTION: Yeah, but the Reves case was dictum,

and the question here is, are we going to turn that dictum

into a holding?  And before we get to a holding I think

you've got to answer Justice Scalia's question.  When we

have specific examples of - of - of fixed returns, why

should the general proposition investment contract somehow

be held not to include as a generality a fixed return

contract?

          MR. WOLENSKY: Our position is that investment

contract is an equity-type security, and we think that is

founded on all of the history and when Congress used the

term investment contract -

          QUESTION: Let - let me - I - I don't want to be

- be short with you, but I don't think you're getting at

what he and I want.  We - we have examples in which the

fixed returns securities are specifically listed.  Why -

let's be specific - why would Congress have wanted to

exclude this kind of a scheme?

          MR. WOLENSKY: Because -

          QUESTION: It's being marketed as a classic

investment scheme.  Why would it have wanted to exclude

this one?

          MR. WOLENSKY: Because this is a - this is a

commercial lease. 

          QUESTION: Well, it's not a - a normal commercial

lease.  It's a - it's a commercial lease of an essentially

trivial piece of property, which is replicated thousands

and thousands and thousands and thousands of times.  It is

marketed on - on the theory that you're going to get an

extraordinarily generous rate of interest.  These are -

these are not classic sale and lease-back contracts.

          MR. WOLENSKY: Well, I - I disagree with Your

Honor.  I believe it is a legitimate lease.  There's never

been a question that it's not an enforceable lease. 

There's never been a question that the telephone didn't

have the value ascribed to it.  It was fairly valued.

          QUESTION: But it's being marketed not to people

who want to go into the lease business, but people who

want to invest their money and sit back at home and get at

return. 

          MR. WOLENSKY: That may be true, but it cannot be

denied that in fact there was a lease agreement.  Every

witness who testified or provided a declaration in

connection with the case acknowledged that it was a lease.

          QUESTION: Let's assume it is not denied.  Why

would Congress have wanted to exclude this kind of fixed

return transaction when it is classically being marketed

as an investment?

          MR. WOLENSKY: There were leases that were being

used for commercial purposes in 1933.  Lease financing was

being used on very significant items then in the railroad

area and other areas, but leases are not new, novel, or

unusual.  Investment contract was designed, as this Court

has said -

          QUESTION: No, but as a public policy issue, I

have the same question Justice Souter has.  From a

standpoint of public policy, why in the world would

Congress want to exclude a broadly marketed scheme like

this from the definition of investment contract?  Why

would it?  It's marketed like other schemes that might

have a variable return.  They put all these little phone

booths together and it required the management of others

to know how to place them and service them and make it

work.  It's not something that the - a person acquiring

the lease is going to do individually.  I mean, why isn't

- why would Congress have wanted to exclude this?

          MR. WOLENSKY: Justice O'Connor, the - the only

answer I can give is because it does not have investment

risk.  It's - it is excluded from the term investment

contract because it doesn't have investment risk.  All of

the pre-33 Act cases -

          QUESTION: Well, I suppose it does from the

standpoint of the management required to make this scheme

work.

          MR. WOLENSKY: Well, that's a credit risk -

          QUESTION: Anybody who was investing in - in

payphones in the era of the - the satellite was taking an

investment risk, I would think. 

          MR. WOLENSKY: Well, when the -

          QUESTION: Must mean something special by

investment risk.  You must not mean what we ordinarily

mean because I think your investors don't feel that way. 

So what do you mean by it?  When you say no investment

risk, you know, we're all reacting this way because it

seems so obvious to us, anybody who invested money in this

has now lost all his money, so it must have been pretty

risky.  So - so I - you must mean something special by it. 

If you do, I want you to explain it.

          MR. WOLENSKY: Well, the - the money that was

lost was lost as a result of a bankruptcy and what

occurred in the bankruptcy, but when the bankruptcy was

filed, these phone owners still owned their telephones and

they were still entitled to their lease payments.  That

was dealt with in the bankruptcy and the details of that

are not involved in the record here but in - there's a - a

significant difference between investment risk, which this

Court characterized in Forman and recognized from the

VALIC case, is a matter of fluctuating value generally. 

When you look at credit risk you're -

          QUESTION: I'm sure you don't think a person who

buys a bond doesn't take an investment risk.

          MR. WOLENSKY: A person who buys a bond takes a

credit risk, not an investment risk.  There is a

difference, and I believe -

          QUESTION: There's a significant -

          QUESTION: You think buying a - a whole portfolio

of bonds is not an investment?

          MR. WOLENSKY: Well, it - it is an investment,

but it - it is not the type of investment risk that you

see in fluctuating values securities or equity securities.

          QUESTION: Have you ever held a bond when

interest rates were going up?

          MR. WOLENSKY: I - I agree -

          QUESTION: You would have learned what an

investment risk was.

          MR. WOLENSKY: Justice Souter, I agree that bonds

can fluctuate in value and that deals with a capital

appreciation -

          QUESTION: Which means that it is more than a

mere credit risk.

          MR. WOLENSKY: To the extent you were looking to

the bond to return a value and - and hold it for purposes

of changing value, it theoretically could.

          QUESTION: And anyone who buys a bond with the

possible expectation of selling before maturity assumes

exactly that.

          MR. WOLENSKY: They are going to face that risk

and that - that is, in fact, an investment risk.  But the

key here, it seems to me, is the fact that you do have a

lease agreement, that is what it is involved here.  It is

a legitimate lease agreement.  It is like any other

equipment lease agreement and it is going to be dealt with

under State law.  There is also a significant issue here

with respect to the coverage of other regulatory agencies. 

We have in fact Federal Trade Commission coverage here. 

There's no question about that.  It is involved -

          QUESTION: Mr. Wolensky, you don't challenge, do

you, that under State Blue Sky Laws, this distinction

between variable and fixed return is not made, that State

Blue Sky Laws treat as investment contracts - do not draw

the line between fixed and variable returns?

          MR. WOLENSKY: The - the challenge I make is that

before 1933 the State Blue Sky Laws that were - cases that

were incorporated and mentioned in Joiner and in Howey

were variable return cases.  I disagree with the SEC on

the two cases.

          QUESTION: Do you agree that there are a body of

cases under State Blue Sky Laws that involve - maybe some

of them even involve these payphone schemes - but that

have fixed and not variable returns?

          MR. WOLENSKY: As of today, that is correct. 

That is what I see in the amici brief and I have no reason

to question that.  The way the law has developed under

State law, it would include fixed returns, that's correct.

          QUESTION: So why, if this notion of an

investment contracts comes out of State Blue Sky laws and

we are told that the one thing in this area, because

schemes are invented every day, is that - that the

interpretation should be flexible, not static, to meet the

countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek

the use of money of others?

          MR. WOLENSKY: Justice Ginsburg, this Court has -

 has repeated that over and over.  I will agree with that,

but the Court has talked about new, novel, and unusual

schemes.  There is nothing new, novel, or unusual about

lease agreements and commercial leases, and what you have

to focus on here is what the Court has said.  It has given

guidance.  It has said that unanimously - it may have a

been a footnote in Reves, but certainly -

          QUESTION: But when the issue isn't in the case,

what a court says in a casual footnote, when the case had

nothing to do with fixed versus variable returns.  I mean,

yes, the Court made it used in cautious languages, but we

- but in none of the cases that came here was the

question, do you draw the line between fixed and variable

returns?  In the case that - that you featured - you call

it Forman or United Housing - there it was a question of

investment versus consumption.  Did you buy this thing to

sit back and get money from it or did you buy it so you

could live in the house?  That was the distinction that

was before the Court in this case.  I don't know any of

our cases that - that drew the line between - that where

the issue was before the Court.

          MR. WOLENSKY: Justice Ginsburg, in Forman, the

Court had to address the issue of whether there was an

investment contract involved, and it stated what I would

call the Forman formulation of profits in connection with

doing that analysis on the three types of profits that

allegedly - or that had been found and allegedly were

present in the Second Circuit decision, and it applied

that formulation to each one of those.  So it was -

          QUESTION: But it did - but the case was not

about equity versus debt classification.  It was about

whether you were attracted - whether you were attracted to

purchasing the shares by a desire to get a financial

return or were you attracted because you wanted a place to

live.  That's what - that's the two questions - that was

the dividing line that the Court was dealing with there. 

It wasn't dealing with equity versus debt.

          MR. WOLENSKY: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg. 

And then in Reves, it was dealing with the distinction

between equity and debt.

          QUESTION: Well, but in - in Forman there was no

distinction between fixed and variable income.

          MR. WOLENSKY: It was not, but when you read the

- Justice Kennedy, when you read what the Court said in

Forman, it's talking about an expectation of profits or

capital appreciation, and those are two variable forms. 

They're not - they're not fixed.  They necessarily vary

with the marketplace.

          If I can finish answering your question, Justice

Ginsburg, with respect to Reves, there was a distinction,

a very specific distinction there, between fixed and - and

variable.  That's what that case was about, investment

contract versus note.  And the Eighth Circuit had decided

that the investment contract case of - that the investment

contract test of Howey would apply to notes.  There were a

series of tests and this Court used the Reves opinion to -

 to go through those and decide, and it came up with a

family resemblance test that had been used by the Second

Circuit.  In the footnote in Reves, it is very clear that

what the Court is doing is distinguishing and explaining

why Howey does not apply to notes, which are fixed

instruments.  I think it is not just a passing reference

and it - it was unanimously stated that -

          QUESTION: But I thought that - I thought that

the meaning of investment contract was not at issue in

Reves.

          MR. WOLENSKY: The meaning of investment contract

was not at issue, but distinguishing investment contract

was at issue in Reves, and explaining why it was not

applicable in that case.  The parties briefed the issue,

the SEC briefed the issue as amicus took the same position

it - it has taken here, and the Court in Reves said that

is not the position we accept.

          QUESTION: And it's - it's taken that position

for a long time, Mr. Wolensky.  It's not just the case law

that you have to contend with, it's also - this is after

all an administrative law case.  The meaning of investment

contract, you must admit, is at least ambiguous, and the

SEC has taken the position it's taken here for a very long

time.

          MR. WOLENSKY: Well, if I can address -

          QUESTION: Why shouldn't we defer to the F -

SEC's judgement about the matter?

          MR. WOLENSKY: If I can address that for just a

moment, Justice Scalia -

          QUESTION: That's why I asked the question.  I

hoped you would.

          (Laughter.)

          MR. WOLENSKY: Thank you, sir.  With respect to

the very long time, if you go back to the case the SEC has

pointed to a number of times, the Universal Service case

from 1939 in the Seventh Circuit, when you - and the SEC

talks about its position in that case - its position in

that case was stated in its brief in that case, and when

you look at its brief in that case, it recognizes that it

is not dealing with a fixed return as we would talk about

it.  In fact, in the brief, the SEC says the amount

ultimately credited to the contributor's account, the

amount itself being dependent upon the degree of success

attending the venture - and I'm reading from pages 39 and

40 and footnote 10 - with respect to the Abbett, Sommer

case, which is a 19 - I believe 62 decision - by the SEC,

the SEC admitted in Abbett, Sommer that it wasn't looking

at traditional profits analysis.

          That was a mortgage loan servicing case and they

said that what was being offered there was not just the

repayment on the notes but also the services, and they

found that the reduction of risk in that case was the -

basically the profit.  So they departed from what is a

normal profit analysis and that's freely admitted.

          In the interpretative release they've issued,

the multi-level release under the 33 Act, number 5211, in

there the SEC admits that Howey is an equity-type test. 

They specifically say that.  So I think that when you look

at the history of what this Court has done and what the

SEC has done, when you get to - when you get to Reves and

when you get to Forman, it is - there's no ambiguity left

as to what is meant by profits at that point.  So I think

a position -

          QUESTION: I think there is.  I think that in

United Housing itself they spoke about profit may be

derived from income yielded by an investment, income

yielded by investment.  That doesn't say income from

earnings.

          MR. WOLENSKY: That is correct, but in the very

same area of the opinion is where the Court says by

profits in the Howey analysis, we have meant a

participation in earnings or capital appreciation, citing

the earlier cases.

          QUESTION: They said that in one place.  They

said financial returns in another place.  They said income

in another place.  Maybe they were so incautious about the

precise use of those terms because they were focusing on

an investment purpose versus a - a utilitarian purpose.

          MR. WOLENSKY: I would agree with that, but the

fact that Reves concluded what it did about Forman's

requirements would tend to show that that's really what

Forman required.  The - the court of appeals, of course,

was not free to disregard what was a unanimous statement

by this Court.  This Court obviously can change its

opinion or change its view, but there is no compelling

reason to depart from what has been accepted for 25 years.

Other courts of appeals -

          QUESTION: Well, why isn't there, when the SEC -

 let's assume that you're right about that the SEC was

never crystal clear about its position.  But now it says,

we've looked at these schemes, payphones is a good one, a

lot of elderly people are investing in these schemes

because they promise a fixed return and that sounds secure

to them, better than variable out of earnings and profits,

so this is exactly what we should be protecting the public

against.  If the SEC takes that position clearly now and

you're dealing with a statutory term that's in a line,

some of the things are equity, some are debt, and in the

middle is this term investment contract.  Why should we

tie it to variable versus fixed?

          MR. WOLENSKY: Justice Ginsburg, because this

Court has said more than once, every fraud is not a

securities fraud.  There are other avenues of protection. 

There are several risk-reducing factors involved in these

leases.  The leases themselves are covered by State law in

the Uniform Commercial Code.  There's other regulatory

coverage, other agencies.  In fact, some of the State

agencies that filed amici briefs here have indicated that

they believe they have coverage of those.

          So the fact that the Federal securities laws

might not cover this doesn't mean that there's not going

to be protection of the public.  The consequence, and I

think it's an important consequence that the Court has to

be aware of here if it agrees with the SEC's position, is

that every equipment lease can be brought under the rubric

of Howey if -

          QUESTION: Why, why, why?

          QUESTION: That's not -

          QUESTION: I mean, there are all kinds of other

criteria, you know.  I mean, you have to be putting up

money, it has to be - if it is a big market - scheme

marketed to the - to the public like this, yes.  But if it

isn't, if GM happens to buy some - a railroad car from one

of its suppliers, I would think the answer's no.  But

there are a lot of other criteria, so why everyone?

          MR. WOLENSKY: Well, the - it is not in the

record but it is public knowledge and information that is

available that some $200 billion of equipment leasing

occurs every year, and it - equipment leasing involves

everything from telephone systems to computers, office

equipment.  It is a very, very large industry.  If that

applies to this large industry -

          QUESTION: You'd have to be passive, you'd have

to - you'd have to treat it as an investment.  I doubt

that most of that leasing is really that, but I mean, my

point is, aren't there dozens of other criteria that you

have to satisfy, not just this fixed variable one?  And

that's a serious question.  I'm interested.

          MR. WOLENSKY: Well, on - Justice Breyer, there

are - there essentially are four criteria that the - that

the SEC would say you have to apply: an investment of

money - and this Court said in Daniel that investment of

money doesn't just mean money, it can mean services, it

can mean assets.  That's why we say in analyzing this it

doesn't matter whether you bring your phone to the

agreement or money to the agreement, but if you put

equipment into a lease arrangement, you have an investment

-

          QUESTION: Invest money may itself refer to the

thousands of public people who simply want to give money

to an enterprise in contrast to General Motors that rents

a railroad car as part of its business.

          MR. WOLENSKY: I can contrast that and agree with

you that in General Motors, renting a railroad car is part

of its business.  It is not going to be probably found to

run afoul of the securities laws.

          QUESTION: So what is the example of the bad

thing that happens when we agree with the SG?

          MR. WOLENSKY: General, broad, small item

equipment leases will be covered by the Howey test.

          QUESTION: The people who are not themselves in

business, by people who are not themselves in business or

by people who are themselves in business?

          MR. WOLENSKY: Well, whether they're in business

or not in business the securities laws would still cover

them and I don't believe there's an exemption that would

be available for the ordinary business.

          QUESTION: Why - why isn't your argument equally

applicable to notes?  We've been through that in Reves.  I

mean, you could have argued in Reves, my God, are you

going to cover every note?  You're making the same

argument here with investment - investment contract,

aren't you?

          MR. WOLENSKY: Well, not necessarily.  I think

the Court did set forth some very specific criteria in

Reves.  The family resemblance test exempts out commercial

notes that have credit risk and not investment risk.

          QUESTION: Justice Breyer has just been applying

a family resemblance test to exclude General Motors'

boxcar.  Why isn't that sort of thing just as feasible

under investment contract as it is under note?

          MR. WOLENSKY: It is, and if you - if you look at

the criteria the Court looked to, I think you will see

that several of the criteria that this Court has talked

about indicate that this would not be covered.  I believe

it is - it's not specifically related, but the Court noted

four criteria, and if you apply those criteria, I think

you find that they in fact -

          QUESTION: You've come to this quite late, but I

mean, it seems to me that there are other words besides

working with the nature of the fixed or variable return

that will draw the kind of line that you think - and I

guess I would think - you should draw between an ordinary

business, sale and lease-back so they can carry on their

business, and some kind of general marketing to the

public.  And I'm actually quite interested in that. 

You've written about it, though, and I'll get it out of

the briefs.

          MR. WOLENSKY: We have and - and I was - have

been trying to address the question that was presented

although we felt a different question was involved.  This

Court for 60 years has set a jurisprudential standard for

investment contracts and while the courts work on the

habits of people, people work on the habits of courts. 

There are lines that have -

          QUESTION: In those 60 years we've never said

that a fixed return can never be an investment contract.

          MR. WOLENSKY: That is correct.  You've never

explicitly said that, but by never explicitly saying that,

that doesn't mean that it necessarily is covered.  The

decision of the court of appeals followed this Court's

precedents.  It was correct and it should be affirmed.

          QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Wolensky.

          General Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. THEODORE B. OLSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

          MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  I will

try to make just three points.  One, this is about

securities.  The statute, which is extraordinarily broad,

says note, stock, treasury stock, fractional undivided

interest in oil, gas, mineral rights, straddle, option. 

It's - there - it would be difficult to draft the statute

that was intended to be more all-inclusive than the words

used in these two provisions of the 33 and 34 Act.  It is

manifestly clear that Congress wanted to cover the

waterfront, as this Court has said, everything that looks

like a security, and wanted to cover the whole range from

pure equity, if there is such a thing, to pure debt, if

there is such a thing.

          It would be - and then they put catch-all

provisions.  If the - if the words didn't cover it, there

were catch-all provisions, investment contract is one.  It

would be irrational for Congress to say, well, we've got a

catch-all for those - from A to Z - that go from A to H

that look more - look like equities, but not S to Z that

the ones in the middle.  The purpose for the catch-all

provision is to catch all.  That is what this investment

contract was.

          Secondly, just two of the cases that were

attempted to be distinguished by my colleague, People v.

White, he said that did not involve a fixed return.  Well,

the language of the case - this is in 12 P.2d at 1081 -

the individual promised to spay - pay - a specified sum on

a specified date as principal and earnings for the stated

period of time upon the investment.  That's pretty much

identical to what we have involved in this case.  And in

the Securities and Exchange Commission v. Universal

Services, another one that my colleague referred to, page

234 of 106 F.2d, at the end of 5 years there would be

returned to each member an amount equal to total

contributions plus 30 percent per annum.  Now, this case

is 14 percent.

          The argument's that being made by the respondent

here is an argument that the Blue Sky - a distinction that

the Blue Sky Laws don't make.  Congress did not make this

distinction.  The Court has never made this distinction. 

It conflicts with 70 years of consistent SEC enforcement. 

It is squarely inconsistent with the notion of a broad,

flexible, remedial purpose of the securities statutes.  It

would make no sense, would create a gigantic loophole

where individuals, by changing the terms of - from pie in

the sky to 14 percent, and they would do that immediately,

and Congress would have to deal with it in a way the

Congress has already dealt with, and there is no reason to

change what they - what the law has been, and the Eleventh

Circuit decision should be reversed.

          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, General

Olson.  The case is submitted.

          (Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
