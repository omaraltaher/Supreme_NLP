CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

Congress did not intend to grant a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

century-long copyright monopoly in cheerleader uniform 

 

 

 

 

 

design.  And there are three points that support that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

conclusion. 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

First, by subjecting two-dimensional 

 

 

 

pictures and graphics as well as sculptures to Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

101 separability test, Congress made clear that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-dimensional and three-dimensional designs must be 

 

 

 

 

 

analyzed for separability. 

 

 

            

Second, under Section 101's text, the 

 

 

 

 

 

dispositive questions are twofold:  Whether the deign 

  

 

 

 

 

 

features can be identified separately from the useful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article's utilitarian aspects; and second, whether they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can exist independently, that is, the design features do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not add to or change the useful article's utilitarian --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why, in this case, would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

4 

we even need to get to any question of separability? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What was submitted was a two-dimensional artwork.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

may not be like Mondrian, but it is chevrons and other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

things. 

5 

            

They are not submitting the cheerleader's 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

uniform itself.  They are not saying anything about the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shape of the uniform, the cut of the uniform.  They are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just saying these zigzag designs -- and you can choose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from five different ones that are interchangeable, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

design. 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

So why isn't this a -- a case of not -- not 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part -- the pictorial graphic element is not part of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

design of the cheerleader's uniform; it's superimposed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on it.  It's reproduced on it.  It's applied to it. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  There two reasons, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg.  First, consider the example where you have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designer who designs a military uniform.  And on that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

military uniform, they design the best desert camouflage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's been ever designed in the history of the world. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And they submit it to the copyright office, and they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't claim the design in the uniform, they only claim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright in the design on the uniform. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There is no question they would have the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright in the design, but the courts would still look 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to see whether that adds to the utilitarian aspects of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

5 

1 

2 

3 

that uniform such that that design copyright holder 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could not prevent the military from producing a military 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

uniform that uses that design. 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

That's why it's so important to understand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

that in Section 101, not only two-dimensional -- or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three-dimensional, but also two-dimensional designs are 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to separability. 

 

 

8 

            

And there's a second reason, Justice 

   

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

Ginsburg.  What you're referring to, generally, is kind 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the area of fabric design.  And a good example of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fabric design is the -- the flowers on the fabric in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Folio Impressions case that we reprint on page 7 of our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

reply brief. 

 

14 

            

And those flowers, you could expand the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

design, you could contract the design, you can make any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article of clothing out of it whatsoever, you could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rotate it 45 degrees, and it always works functionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

the same. 

 

19 

            

Here, when you're talking about these 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

cheerleader uniform designs, the arrangement of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

color blocks and the chevrons and the stripes, if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made it smaller and put it in the center of a uniform, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it would no longer have the slimming effects.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't make the wearer look taller.  I mean, if you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put it on a hat or a lunch box, it wouldn't have those 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6 

1 

functions. 

2 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they have put it on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

those other items.  That's their whole point, that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've taken the pictorial design and applied it not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just to a -- by the way, this is not conceding, I think, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by them.  They'll talk on their own and tell me -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this isn't obvious and -- and some of your amici brief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seemed to take that position, that if all we're looking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at is a picture of this color blocks and stripes, that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it may be too obvious to qualify for copyright 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection, or not original enough, whatever. 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

But my point is that they already have done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

that.  They've taken the designs and not put it on a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cheerleading uniform.  They've put it on sweats. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

They've put it on both tops and bottoms. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

17 

            

So what does that do for you? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  Let me respond to both of those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

points, that the obvious in the second; first, the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

garments. 

20 

            

To the extent they're putting it on other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

garments, if you look closely at those pictures, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

design changes.  It's not the same design anymore.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the extent that it remains similar, it's because, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, the warmup jackets are putting those lines in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same place. 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 

            

So the great example of this is on page 21 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

of the Fromer and Buccafusco brief, where it is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Stella McCartney dresses on Kate Winslet.  And she's got 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those slimming, dark lines along the sides that change 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how she is perceived.  It makes her shape look different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to someone who is looking at her, and the lines on these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uniforms do the exact same thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

Similarly, you've got in -- in these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

uniforms you've got the waist-narrowing Vs on the sides. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It creates the optical illusion that the wearer is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinner than they actually are, slimmer.  You've got the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Müller-Lyer lines --

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How could you copyright 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

anything under your use of "utility," under your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of "utility"? 

 

 

16 

            

17 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Because my definition --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Every form -- I suspect 

   

  

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

in most cases, every form gives something else, an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attractiveness, to the purchaser.  That's why you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

designs of anything, even pictorial designs. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  We completely agree.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

that's why it's so important that you focus on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory text, because under the exists-independently 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement that we cite -- this is right from Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

101 -- the feature cannot add to or change the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

1 

"utilitarian aspects" of the "useful article." 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

So let's say that I've got a T-shirt with a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

happy face on it, and maybe that makes me look better 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because I appear happier.  Well, that design has the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

same effect whether I'm wearing it on my shirt, my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pants, my hat, or carrying it on my notebook. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

But here, these designs only work when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

they're on the article for which they are designed in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the exact place where they were designed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose you have a Picasso 

   

  

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

painting or Mondrian or Klee, and suppose they're alive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and they licensed the use of their picture on a garment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it does just what you say:  This Picasso painting or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mondrian just completely captures the shape of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article you want.  The fact that it completely captures 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it means that it can be copied? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

18 

Picasso --

 

19 

            

MR. BURSCH:  No, it does not, because the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What's the difference 

  

 

 

 

20 

between Mondrian or Picasso and these -- and these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

lines? 

22 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Because I could take the 

   

  

 

 

 

23 

24 

Picasso and I could just have it in a frame on the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chest, or I could expand it to the entire breadth of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

uniform. 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

1 

            

With these designs, it has -- the side lines 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

have to be right here.  The Vs have to be right here. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Müller-Lyer line has to be right here.  And if you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would move it, say rotate that 45 degrees, you can do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that with the Picasso and it would still look like a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Picasso.  If you turned one of these designs 45 degrees, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it would no longer make the cheerleader look taller and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

thinner. 

9 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  How is your argument 

  

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

different from this tuxedo shirt that the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talks about -- it's on page 10 of the government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

brief --

 

13 

            

14 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- where the lines really do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

have to be just in a particular place on the piece of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apparel in order for it to make any sense at all and, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, that was found to be copyrightable? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

Is that -- is there -- there any difference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

between the tuxedo shirt and this? 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, there are differences, 

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

and I think even the government would tell you, if you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked them that question, that that design wouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevent you from making the tuxedo.  And what we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about here is making the cheerleader uniform, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the actual three-dimensional cheerleader uniform that 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

you wear, and that's the lesson of one Section -- or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

Section 113. 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  But it prevents you --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5

it prevents you from making this T-shirt with these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lines on it in the same way that you're saying nobody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be able to make a short dress --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

8 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Right.  And the point --

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- with those particular 

  

 

 

 

 

9 

lines in that particular place. 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MR. BURSCH:  The point is you can have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

copyright in that design.  We don't contest that Varsity 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has a copyright in the design.  We wouldn't contest in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the hypothetical I used with Justice Ginsburg you could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a copyright in the camouflage design.  But that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

copyright doesn't extend to prevent you from making the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

useful article depicted.  That's where the line stops. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So I guess I'm not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

sure about your -- does that mean if you can have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright in the tuxedo shirt design that somebody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't draw a tuxedo shirt because that's copyrighted 

   

 

 

 

 

 

21 

two-dimensional? 

22 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Correct, right.  You could not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

replicate the design, but you could make the tuxedo. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's the lesson of Jack Adelman in Section 1. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you're saying you 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

couldn't make the tuxedo shirt -- is that correct? -- or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

you could? 

 

3 

            

MR. BURSCH:  You could not.  Let's take it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

back to the cheerleader uniform, and then bring it back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the text of the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

We don't contest that Varsity could take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

these designs and put it on a notebook, put it on a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lunchbox, put it on a hat, and no one could copy that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's clearly within the subject matter of their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

copyright. 

11 

            

What they can't do is prevent someone from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

making the entire uniform.  And the reason the statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires that is because you have this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

identified-separately requirement. 

 

15 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So are you suing them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

just for the pictures that are in their catalogue?  Is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that what you're suing them for? 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

19 

suing us. 

 

20 

            

MR. BURSCH:  We're not suing them; they're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  You're 

  

  

 

 

21 

right.  I apologize. 

    

22 

23 

            

 

So can you get -- you could stop them from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using their pictures of their uniforms in their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

catalogue --

 

25 

            

MR. BURSCH:  No. 

  

 

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- but you can't stop 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

them from selling their --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  We can't stop them from using 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

their copyright to do anything on a printed page, or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even to take these designs and, like I said, put it on a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lunchbox or a notebook.  But their copyright does not --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I transposed the two of 

    

 

 

 

 

8 

you.  I apologize. 

    

9 

10 

11 

            

MR. BURSCH:  No problem, Justice Sotomayor. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can -- are they stopping 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you from -- you think you can sell your uniforms 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

anywhere. 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what can't you do? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

If we don't agree with you, if we agree with them that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is a -- eligible for copyright absent some other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disqualification, like obviousness or lack of creativity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or whatever else, okay, assume we agree with them; what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can they stop you from doing? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, actually, if you agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with them that they have a copyright, then you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreeing with us, too, because we all agree they have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright in the sketch. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay. 

  

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  They have a copyright in the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

image.  Our position is that they cannot then take that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

image and prohibit us from making the actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three-dimensional uniform.  And the reason for that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

under Section 101 is because the design neither can be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified separately, nor can exist independently, 

 

 

 

 

 

which are the statutory requirements of the "utilitarian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspects" of the cheerleader uniform. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So but if I could just go 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

back and make sure I understand my question about the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

tuxedo shirt. 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  If I have a copyright in the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

design of the tuxedo shirt, not in a tuxedo --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- I have a copyright in the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

design of a tuxedo shirt, can I prevent other people 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

from manufacturing tuxedo shirts? 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So why isn't that exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

the same? 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Because --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because here, I have a 

   

  

 

 

 

design in a copyright dress, and now I'm trying to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevent other people from manufacturing that cheerleader 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dress with that design. 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

1 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Because then that's like 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

manufacturing the tuxedo.  And what Section 113(b) says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that all of the copyright law with respect to this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind of issue, that was --

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't understand why it's 

    

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

like manufacturing a tuxedo.  It seems as though it's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

like manufacturing the thing that I have the design in. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I have design in the -- I have a design of a tuxedo 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

shirt, so you can't make a tuxedo shirt.  I have a 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

design in a cheerleader dress, so you can't make the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

cheerleader dress. 

 

12 

            

MR. BURSCH:  It has to do with the very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

careful statutory requirement that they exist 

 

 

 

 

 

independently.  What that means is the feature can't add 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to or change the "utilitarian aspects" of the article. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

When you're talking about the tuxedo design, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

it's not adding anything functional to the T-shirt. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's simply putting a design on it.  When you're talking 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about these designs on a cheerleader uniform, it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

advances a number of utilitarian designs, and let me 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

just tick those off quickly. 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

First, it changes how the wearer is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

perceived through optical illusion.  And that's some of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the things that I've been referring to:  the slimming 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lines on the side, the waist-narrowing Vs, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

1 

Müller-Lyer lines --

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that the same for all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

five of the --

 

 

 

4 

            

MR. BURSCH:  All five.  And I'll tick 

  

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

through this list, and then let's look at the uniforms 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I can show you how they do that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

The second, like all uniforms, Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

Kagan, it actually identifies the cheerleader as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cheerleader, which was Judge McKeague's point, Judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cleland's point below.  Because if these cheerleaders 

  

 

 

 

 

 

were wearing wrestling singlets, no one would identify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them as cheerleaders. 

 

 

13 

            

And uniforms have a special identification 

   

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

function.  You think about military people who are in a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scene mixed up with civilians, and it's the military 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uniforms that identify them as members of the military 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that tells you whether the rules of war apply to them or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

not. 

19 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought conveying 

    

 

 

20 

information doesn't make an article useful. 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

MR. BURSCH:  I don't think that optical 

    

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

illusions are conveying information.  I don't think that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

identification is conveying optical illusion. 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, you said -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

said a function of the cheerleader -- cheerleader's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

16 

1 

dress is to identify the person as a cheerleader. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes.  That's a second function. 

   

  

  

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

So let me first make clear, the optical illusions isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conveying information; it's actually causing you to see 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the person differently than they actually are.  So at a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimum, that doesn't fall within this. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think with the identification, that allows 

 

 

 

 

 

you to sort people.  That's different than conveying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

information like facts and figures. 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

In addition, Your Honor, the conveyance of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

information is actually something that has to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered as part of the exists-independently prong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And you can see this on page 2 of the blue brief where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have Section 101, both the "pictorial graphic" and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"sculptural works" definition and the "useful article" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

definition. 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

            

And if you start with the "useful article" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition, to determine whether something is a useful 

   

 

 

 

 

 

article in the first instance, you ask whether it has an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portray the appearance of the article or to convey 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

information. 

23 

24 

25 

            

So portraying the appearance and conveying 

 

 

 

 

 

information are utilitarian functions, but if that's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only thing that they do, then it's not a useful article. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

17 

But once you've decided that a garment like a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cheerleader uniform is a useful article, now you turn to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the separability test.  So now we look at the PGS 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition right above the "useful article" definition, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and there you are measuring the features against the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utilitarian aspects of the article. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

It doesn't say only the intrinsic 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

utilitarian functions; it's any "utilitarian aspect." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So having made the first decision, yes, this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

garment is a useful article, the statute requires us to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider all the "utilitarian aspects" of the article. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and that has to be the case or otherwise, again, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

military uniforms, their identifying functions, you 

 

 

 

 

 

could have lay people making military uniform designs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and barring the government from ever being able to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture those uniforms themselves, even if everyone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agrees that that is a useful thing. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Two other quick things on functionality. 

 

 

 

 

 

These designs also define the uniform's style line and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their actual three-dimensional shape. 

 

 

 

21 

            

So, Justice Kagan, the -- the zigzag that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

they have on the bottom of 299A and 299B on page 4 of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our -- our blue brief, it's actually defining the shape, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and everyone agrees that the shape of a uniform can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never be copyrighted.  There is no dispute about that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

18 

The last thing --

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that the -- the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

4 

shape was the same on all of these.  We have different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designs, five different designs, same shape. 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

MR. BURSCH:  No.  The -- maybe this would be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

a good time to turn to the pictures on pages 4 to 5 of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the blue brief, because these are the actual copyright 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deposits involved.  And what you can see -- I'll give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you a moment to pull up pages 4 and 5 of the blue brief. 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

On page 4, you have two of the deposits. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

This is 299A on the bottom, 299B on the top, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

zigzag actually defines the shape.  And it also has the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functional utility of covering up the seams and making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that waistband stronger, not allowing it to stretch when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cheerleader puts it on and off. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The stripes at the top that define the shape 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the collar, again, that's not copyrightable, also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cover up seams. 

 

 

            

That stripe that goes across diagonally 

 

 

 

 

 

right there that separates the white color block from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the red color block, those two color blocks have to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stitched together, and what they do is they put those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stitches on the outside so that it'll be smooth on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inside where the cheerleader is, and they have to cover 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up those sales with a stripe.  So all these things

are -- are functional. 

 

 

 

2 

            

3 

            

So now let's look --

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So do you get a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

different -- a different result if, instead of stitched, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the design is applied? 

 

 

 

6 

            

MR. BURSCH:  If it's -- it's subliminated, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

which is something that they -- they've talked about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's no different with respect to the optical illusion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or the identifying function, because if you print the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same design in a cheerleader uniform, you'd have to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

print it exactly the same way they stitch it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Let's focus now on page 5.  The bottom 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

drawing there is number 815.  This is the red one with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the blue stripes that go down the side.  It's those blue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stripes on the side, just like the Stella McCartney 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dress, that cause the cheerleader to be perceived as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

slimmer and more curvy than they actually are. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Bursch, I go back to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

this point, because I'm a little confused.  You started 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

by saying to me you don't want to be stopped from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacturing this particular uniform. 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do they -- what do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you think they have a copyright in? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  They have a copyright --

   

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

20 

1 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or the -- what do you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

think is eligible for copyright in this picture? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. BURSCH:  I think the copyright 

    

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

eligibility in this picture is the design, so long as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's not being used to prevent the manufacturer of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

useful article that it was intended to be -- to appear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

on. 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Like I said, they --

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that the 

  

 

 

 

government's position too? 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, I -- I think they agree 

   

   

  

 

 

 

with us on that point.  If you look at --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  On that point. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yeah.  If you look at page 22 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and 23 of their brief, they have our little black dress, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then they have this very design here, number 815, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and they explain that if we are right that this design 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has functionality --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what can't you do, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

assuming that you accept what they have a copyright in, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of the -- this thing, but not in stopping the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture of the uniform --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- what do you think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

their copyright stops you from doing? 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

21 

1 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Everything else.  We could not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

print this on a notebook cover.  We couldn't put it on a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lunch pail.  We couldn't put it on a hat.  The -- the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only thing it allows us to do is to actually produce the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

useful article itself. 

 

 

6 

            

And I -- I'm -- I'm talking so much about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

cheerleader uniforms.  I want to focus back on the text 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just for a moment because the purpose of having a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separability test under Section 101 is to make sure that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything that enhances in any way the functionality of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

useful article is not within the subject matter of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

copyright. 

13 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess that's the 

   

  

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

question, is it really in any way, because the opposite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way of reading this statute is that the "utilitarian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspects" of the article that you're talking about in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms of the separability test? 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

19 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That -- that those 

  

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

"utilitarian aspects" should be understood to encompass 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only the utilitarian functions that make something a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

useful article in the first place, which means that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should be held to exclude things that relate to the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portraying the appearance of the article or things that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relates to conveying information, and that seems to me a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

22 

pretty good -- I mean, it's a confusing statute, but it 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to me a pretty good holistic understanding of this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

statute. 

4 

            

But that is what this statute is trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

do, is to say there are certain kinds of things that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might in a broad sense be considered utilitarian, which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to do with portraying appearance or conveying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information, that, for this inquiry, we want you to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclude, that the separability test does not relate to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those kinds of things. 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  And, Justice Kagan, that would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

be a possible policy that Congress could have adopted, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

but that's not what the statute says. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When you're applying the separability test, 

 

 

 

 

 

you're comparing the features to the "utilitarian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspects" of the article, not the intrinsic utilitarian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

function.  Not the ones that made it a useful article, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but all "utilitarian aspects" of the article.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and if you excluded things like uniform's identifying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functions, then someone would be able to prevent the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

military from producing camouflage uniforms if they got 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to that design first, and that's exactly the opposite of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Congress intended. 

 

 

            

You know, in fact, there has been a hundred 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

years of proposed legislation where people have tried --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

23 

1 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the reason why 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

camouflage is such a good example for your side is that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

camouflage actually -- we can understand it as having a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utilitarian function that is different from simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conveying information and it is different from simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making something appear a certain way. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yeah. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  In other words, the 

  

 

 

 

 

utilitarian function that camouflage has is to hide you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the woods. 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And so -- so that function 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not be excluded by these things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Right, but the utilitarian 

  

 

 

 

 

function of the fabric only works -- of the design only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

works in conjunction with the useful article, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same is true here.  When you talk about camouflage, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creating an optical illusion, right?  We've got that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

picture on page 1 of our reply brief, and when you first 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look at that, you don't immediately see that there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person standing in that tree because they are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

camouflaged. 

23 

24 

25 

            

Well, in the same way with these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cheerleader-uniform designs, it creates the optical 

 

 

 

 

 

illusion that they are taller, that they're slimmer, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

24 

that they're -- they're curvier.  You know, all these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functions work exactly the same way as camouflage.

2 

3 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Forget the special things.

6 

I have a picture of a dress now.  The dress is in my 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind.  I have abstracted it.  When I look at those forms 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

in space, it looks like a dress. 

   

 

 

 

 

7 

            

8 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, you'd say, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

I take it, that when I've tried to identify the design 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separately, I've ended up with something that is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capable of existing independently of the -- of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"utilitarian aspects" of the dress, because it looks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like a dress.  So when Marcel Duchamp has a shovel on 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the wall and says it's a work of art, he can have a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright as long as he doesn't try to sue people who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

make shovels. 

 

17 

            

18 

            

19 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Exactly. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's it. 

  

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  That is the "identified 

  

 

 

 

 

20 

separately" portion of our argument. 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

22 

your point. 

 

23 

            

24 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's your point.  That's 

  

  

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  That's one of two points. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And then if you fail on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

that, you have all the specialized arguments about

special purposes of cheerleader costumes. 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

3 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Right.  Now, part --

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But the basic argument is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

what I said; is that right? 

   

 

 

 

5 

            

6 

            

7 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, the part of your --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that right? 

  

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  Yes, but the -- the part of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

your description that makes me nervous is when you talk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about, I'm just imagining something, because that's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"side-by-side" test that Varsity advances.  That you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have to just imagine and visualize whether two things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be conceived of --

 

 

 

 

13 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why not?  It says, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

14 

separable from, so we look to see if it's separable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

from. 

16 

            

17 

            

18 

            

19 

            

20 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Right, but what they ignore --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What else do we have --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  But what they ignore --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- but our imagination? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  But what they ignore is that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

has to be independent.  That means completely separate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on both sides --

 

 

 

23 

            

24 

            

25 

aspects." 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  And this --

  

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  -- of the "utilitarian 

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

26 

1 

            

And so -- so then you lose the utility.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

know, they would say under their test that -- that here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because I can conceptualize this uniform separate from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the fabric, that that's enough.  But -- but it's not, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because if that design is doing work on the fabric in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the place where it was designed to be, then utilitarian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

function is lost when you remove it.  And that's exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Section 101 requires, right? 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

10 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  True, true. 

  

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  So you have to look not only at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

the design; you have to look at the article as well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And if the article does less work when that thing is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gone, it's not separable.  It's protectable. 

  

 

 

 

 

14 

            

If there are no further questions, I'll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

reserve the balance of my time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

MR. JAY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

please the Court: 

 

 

22 

            

Congress directed the copyright office and 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

the courts to protect applied art as well as fine art. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Applied art is art applied to a useful article.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where that directive comes into the statute is in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

27 

Section 101 and in the -- in its definition of pictorial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

graphic and sculptural works, and in the substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions that implement that. 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

Now, there are two key directives there, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

which the Copyright Office has faithfully implemented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over many years in thousands upon thousands of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registration decisions for applied art, and two key 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principles which the Petitioner rejects. 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

Number one is that this is a hypothetical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

10 

inquiry capable of existing independently of, can be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

identified. 

12 

            

And the second is that courts and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What do you do about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

the camouflage case? 

 

 

18 

            

MR. JAY:  We think that camouflage -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

idea of camouflage certainly can't be copyrighted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

under --

 

21 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, no.  This is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

a special design that things are curved one way or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another that nobody else had thought of. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MR. JAY:  If it's a brand-new, original 

   

  

 

 

 

25 

camouflage pattern --

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

28 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

  

 

 

MR. JAY:  -- we think -- although, I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2 

            

3 

4 

5 

6 

think you need to agree with me about this in order to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree with Varsity in this case.  I do think that an 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

original camouflage pattern could be copyrighted and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then reproduced on backpacks, iPhone covers, you know,

other --

19 

20 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, can it be --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

can it be reproduced on a military uniform? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  -- or -- a hunter's garment.  I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

think -- I think it could -- that copyright could extend 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to that.  If -- if that case -- if the camouflage is not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyrightable in that extent, that that's for reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, I think exactly as Justice Kagan said to my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend, for reasons having to do with the utility of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

camouflage design itself.  None of the useful article on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which it appears.  And in this case, our position is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the graphic designs, the striped chevrons and color 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blocks, they are separable from the useful article on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which they appear because they have --

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if you take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

them off the useful article, you have whatever color the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fabric is, a white dress.  If you look at somebody in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the white dress, you don't say, oh, that's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

cheerleader.

MR. JAY:  Well, respectfully, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

Justice, you can -- you can have a white cheerleading 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uniform worn by a cheerleader with the team name and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

team logo on it.  And -- and I think that we've given 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examples of why that is, in fact --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

7 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  From the 1950s. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. JAY:  Well, you could -- you could have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

-- you could have -- if you look at page 34 of the Joint 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix, you'll see in Star's own catalogue examples of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uniforms that have neither stripes nor chevrons nor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

color blocks.  Those simply aren't essential to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

identifying a cheerleader as a cheerleader, even if 

   

   

 

 

 

identifying were a function that's cognizable under the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

statute, which it is not; ultimately, the design can be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken and put on other articles.  It could be, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as I said before, an iPhone cover or on the warm-up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jackets, warm-ups and jackets that are in -- reproduced 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a joint --

   

 

19 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your friend on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

other side concedes that those could be copyrighted.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you take the design of a particular cheerleading uniform 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and put it on the lunchbox or the computer cover, yes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those can be copyrighted.  But because it is the design 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that makes the dress a cheerleading uniform, you can't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate -- you can't copyright the design applied to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

30 

1 

that functional article. 

 

 

2 

            

MR. JAY:  Well, let me resist the premise, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

of course, then, that this -- this particular design or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these five particular designs and striped chevrons and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

color blocks are what make a cheerleading uniform a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cheerleading uniform.  But even -- even setting that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

aside, if you look at Section 113A, which sets out what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights the owner of a copyright in a pictorial or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

graphic sculptural work has, those rights include the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to make copies of it to embody the design in or on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any kind of article, including a useful article.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you know, now, it would be convenient for Star to have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right that just doesn't extend to the product that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to make.  That is not the statute that Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted.  You have the owner of a copyright in a visual 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

work, pictorial graphic or sculptural work, has the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right to embody it on use --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think you're 

    

 

 

 

avoiding the question.  Yes, you can have a copyright in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the pattern; and, yes, you can attach it to a useful 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

article like a lunchbox that's going to have a design. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

But the question is when the design is what makes that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

useful article what it is -- the design on a lunchbox 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't make the lunchbox a lunchbox.  It's still a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

lunchbox.  But the design on a cheerleading uniform is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

31 

1 

what makes it a cheerleading uniform, as opposed to a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

plain dress. 

 

3 

            

MR. JAY:  Well, I guess I just have to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

4 

5 

resist the premise that these particular designs are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what make a cheerleading uniform a cheerleading uniform. 

   

   

 

 

 

6 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if you -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

understand you are resisting the premise as applied to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your case.  But is that right as a general test, that if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is the design that makes the article what it is in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its utilitarian aspect, that that cannot be copyrighted? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  I think that's exactly the kind of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

utility that Congress did not write into the statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That -- that is not the kind of utilitarian function 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress contemplated.  And I think that the best 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidence of that is both in the legislative history, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning the House report, and also in the register's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony about what the Copyright Office had been doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for decades explaining to Congress in the course of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopting doing the '76 Act, both the register and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

House reports say that virtually all two-dimensional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designs applied to useful articles are going to remain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

copyrightable. 

23 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the House 

  

 

 

 

 

24 

report is not the law, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MR. JAY:  To be sure -- we are not -- we are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

not saying that it is, but we are saying that if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look, it's perfectly consistent with our view of what a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utilitarian aspect of a useful article is.  And we also 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that, you know, again you -- even if the House 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

report had not said we are intending to codify this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's decision in Mazer and the Copyright Office 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice, this Court, I think, would have presumed that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress was doing so.  Here, I think that presumption 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

is amply justified. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you're saying 

  

 

 

 

 

that the cheerleading uniforms do not serve a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

utilitarian purpose? 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

            

MR. JAY:  We are saying that they don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

serve the utilitarian purpose -- that the purposes my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friends attributes to them are not utilitarian aspects 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the article under the statute.  They are certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utilitarian.  They cover the body.  They have a --

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

18 

provide mobility. 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does the university that 

  

 

 

 

 

contracts with you know that they have to buy their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uniform for you -- from you for 99 years plus whatever? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Every university that you sell these cheerleading 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uniforms to, do they know that under your copyright, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are stuck with you forever? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  No Justice Sotomayor, that's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

33 

1 

that's not the case. 

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why not?  If you have a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

copyright on this design, and they have adopted their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

school colors, orange and black, and I presume some of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these are cheerleading uniforms belonging to certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

teams, they buy them and they put their names on them, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

correct? 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

            

MR. JAY:  Sure.  Schools certainly put their 

  

  

 

 

 

 

names on cheerleading uniforms. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why aren't they stuck 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with you being their only supplier of their school 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

colors for the rest of their existence? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  There are many, many, many 

  

 

 

 

 

 

variants available, both copyrighted and uncopyrighted, 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, variants, of cheerleading uniforms, that, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, Varsity and its competitors can sell.  Again, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are examples in the Joint Appendix, you know, of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the pages I referred to. 

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So I'm right, once a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

school -- you design a uniform for a school, that's it, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

forever? 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. JAY:  Well, respectfully, Justice 

  

 

 

 

Sotomayor -- Justice Sotomayor, if we -- if we design 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this particular combination of elements and we do own 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- we do own a copyright in that combination, but we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

1 

2 

don't own the idea of an orange and black cheerleader 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uniform or a black and yellow cheerleader uniform. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But the point, the question 

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

is, I think, if I -- because I have exactly the same 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

question.  And it starts with the premise that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything has a design.  Some -- really, a lot of that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

set can be copyrighted.  All women's clothes have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

design.  All men's clothes have design.  For a hundred 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

and more-than-that years, the fashion industry has not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enjoyed copyright protection.  It is an industry on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

women's side, I believe, that 225 billion dollars, at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

least, worth of clothes are sold every year.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suddenly in this case we say that dresses are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyrightable, and they are because every one of them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has some design, perhaps we'll double the price of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

women's clothes.  Now if that's -- that's, I think, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thrust of the question, and that is a practical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

question. 

19 

20 

21 

              

I also have a conceptual question which I'd 

   

 

 

 

 

like to ask, but why don't you disabuse me of my notion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we are into monopoly big-time? 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

MR. JAY:  Absolutely, Justice Breyer, 

  

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

because, you know, Justice Sotomayor's question was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the particular patterns. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And mine is about all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

dresses, all clothes, that's all suits.

killing knock-offs with -- with copyright.  You haven't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

been able to do it with trademark law.  You haven't been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able to do it with patent designs.  We are now going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use copyright law to kill the -- the knockoff industry. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I don't know that that's bad.  I'm just saying. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  So let me clarify at the -- at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outset, we are not claiming the shape, the cut, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything like that about -- about these garments.  Look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at page 60 of our brief, and you will see catalogued all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the places where we set out what our registration is in. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's in the two-dimensional art work that appears on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

surface.

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I see it here, and as 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

I look at it and cut away the wings, I have left -- this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is page 22 of the ASG's brief -- what I have left is, I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have left the design you're after.  It is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-dimensional design that looks to me very much like a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dress.  It looks very much like a two-dimensional 

   

  

 

 

 

 

picture of a dress that covers a woman's body.  Now, did 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you -- that's what you want to copyright, that thing --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  Absolutely not, Justice Breyer. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's not.  So you have a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

different design.  So we are not talking about -- about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

figure eight.  We are not talking about figure eight. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. JAY:  Our design in figure eight, if you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

look at the registration that corresponds to that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure, which you will find in the Joint Appendix at G 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46, you will see that the registration is for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-dimensional art work. 

 

 

7 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Of course.  It's a two- --

   

  

  

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

look, I can do a two-dimensional art work that looks 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

like a Rubik's cube.  I mean, a two-dimensional can look 

    

   

   

 

 

 

like a three-dimensional thing. 

   

 

11 

            

MR. JAY:  No, but it's the two-dimensional 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

artwork that appears on this surface.  It's not -- it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not that we did a two-dimensional picture of a dress and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

said now we own the dress. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You didn't say you own the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

dress. 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

            

MR. JAY:  Correct. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What you said is you own 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the design of the dress. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  No. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- now isn't -- you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

22 

don't? 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. JAY:  No.  We say -- we say that we own 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the design that -- that appears on -- in that case on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the dress, but that can -- that can also appear on the

warmups.  It can also appear on the jacket. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

3 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Jay, see --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, wait.  I have a 

    

  

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

conceptual question.  I'm not yet satisfied with your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer to the practical question because I fear that any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good designer or lawyer could go and take any dress or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit, just about, and produce a picture that looks very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much like that and then sue the companies that use the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same dress or style.  That's my practical, but this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

the conceptual. 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Since we can take -- since we can take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything -- anything -- to a two-dimensional picture and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

put it on the wall like Marcel Duchamp, if I decide in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your favor, am I not allowing copyright for virtually, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

assuming other things satisfied, every design of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

useful article, the very thing that Congress said they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not want? 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  No, absolutely not, because the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ability to take the shovel and hang it on the wall does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not make the shovel a sculpture because the things that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make the "utilitarian aspect" --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not talking about the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

shovel at the moment.  I am talking about an artist's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ability to take a piece of clothing, which is a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utilitarian object, and do a two-dimensional picture of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

38 

1 

2 

3 

the piece of clothing, which it has some things on it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some chevrons, or nothing.  It just looks like a dress. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now on your theory, does that not become copyrightable? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

MR. JAY:  Only in the surface design, not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

the folds, not the pleats, not the shape, not the cut. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And my friend agreed with me --

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

8 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Jay, can I --

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  As to the -- as to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

surface design, I have a similar question.  But suppose 

   

   

  

 

 

 

I go to a Museum of Modern Art and I look at a great 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many famous abstract paintings.  I assume that you would 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that all of those could be copyrighted, could they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

not? 

14 

            

MR. JAY:  You know, if they are original and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

meet the other requisites, one assumes so, yes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  And so the design on any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

fabric, potentially, could be copyrighted, could it not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

19 

            

20 

            

MR. JAY:  The surface --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  If it began as a painting? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR. JAY:  The owner of the copyright in that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

painting has the right to reproduce it on fabric, on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other textiles, you know, or you know, on a -- on a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tapestry, on a rug or on wallpaper.  Absolutely. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And isn't it -- just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

starting from the premise that Justice Alito suggested, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

39 

1 

the -- fabric designs are copyrightable; is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

correct? 

3 

            

MR. JAY:  That's what -- that's what I was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

trying to say to Justice Breyer --

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

6 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Everybody agrees with that. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. JAY:  My friend agreed that the fabric 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

design is copyrightable. 

 

 

8 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So it seems to me that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

question, right, in this case, is are you going to treat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this kind of design just as you would a fabric design? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

12 

            

MR. JAY:  That's right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And as I understand 

   

  

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

Mr. Bursch's point, what Mr. Bursch is saying is, no, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you shouldn't, because this kind of design has -- it --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it follows the figure of a human body, essentially.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the difference between just a design of like 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

stripes and zigzags and chevrons sort of abstractly, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then one that's put on something that looks like a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular piece of apparel that's meant to fit onto a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

human body in a particular way. 

   

 

 

 

21 

            

And that seems to me to be the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

distinction he's making, and I want you to tell me why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that distinction, in your view, doesn't make a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

difference. 

25 

            

MR. JAY:  It doesn't make a difference 

   

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

40 

because what he -- he has identified a number of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different supposed "utilitarian aspects," and some of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which, I think, actually go to the fabric of the dress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and were not -- or the uniform.  We're not laying claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

to that. 

 

6 

            

What he's talking about are the -- are the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

visual ones, the ones that make the cheerleader look a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular way.  And he's saying that you can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright those as it applies to a cheerleader uniform 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

because they're especially useful there.  Like, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

know, that's where they are most effective in conveying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

this image. 

 

13 

            

We -- that is not what the definition of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

utilitarian -- the meaning of "utilitarian aspects" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

encompasses because any work of visual art conveys a --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, a visual message or an aesthetic impact.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have the ones that are most effective be least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyrightable we think doesn't work. 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

            

And I think that --

   

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the difference 

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

between that utilitarian argument and the utilitarian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument as applied to camouflage? 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

MR. JAY:  The utilitarian argument as 

  

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

applied to camouflage is that it's -- I mean, as I said 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the Chief Justice, we do think that if you see 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

41 

camouflage as portraying the appearance of a -- you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, of a particular thing, you know, or -- or sending 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a message that you belong in -- in a particular group, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would not be copyright-eligible -- sorry -- that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would not be a "utilitarian aspect." 

   

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

If camouflage is not copyright-eligible, 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

it's because it performs something that's different from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making you look good in a -- in an anesthetic way.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it conceals.  You know, ultimately, we think the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

best answer is that --

 

 

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But why -- why should that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

make a difference? 

   

13 

            

MR. JAY:  I mean, the word "utilitarian" is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

the key word in the definition.  And I -- I think maybe 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

using one of the fine arts examples, you know, might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

help to illustrate this point. 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

If you look in the amicus brief of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

Professors Buccafusco and Fromer, they have in their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illustration number one is the fresco painted on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dome of a church.  And they say that's not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

copyright-eligible because it uses techniques to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the dome look bigger. 

 

 

 

            

And now you certainly can't get a copyright 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in the idea of Trompe-l'oeil art, but you certainly get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a copyright in a work of fine art that decorates a room 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

42 

or a rug or a useful -- you know, a useful article, and 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that makes the room look better or makes the person who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wears it look better.  And the fact that it's effective, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it makes -- you know, it serves to make that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular church look bigger, that is not a reason to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

withhold a copyright protection. 

   

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your -- the argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

is not that it makes the room or whatever look better. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The argument here is the design makes this look like a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cheerleader uniform, which is different and distinctive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

function in -- than a normal dress. 

   

 

 

 

 

12 

            

13 

            

MR. JAY:  Well --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not simply to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

cover the body.  It's to convey a particular message. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

It shows that you're a member of the cheerleading squad 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

and --

 

17 

            

MR. JAY:  Well -- well, if that were true, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

Mr. Chief Justice, they'd have a decent argument under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the merger doctrine if there were -- if there were only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a few ways of expressing that you are a cheerleader and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you are wearing a cheerleader uniform.  You can't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

get a copyright in an idea.  That's 102(b). 

   

  

 

 

 

 

23 

            

The merger doctrine, not this utilitarian 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

separability analysis that we've been talking about, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merger doctrine is the primary way in which courts and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

43 

the Copyright Office can, you know, prevent the owner of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a copyright from locking up the ways of expressing a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular idea.  So that if, on the facts, there were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only a couple ways of looking like a cheerleader, that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

would be the way to -- to get at that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under your -- under your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

argument, and as you best understand your colleagues' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument, to what extent are there findings of fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved here?  I mean, are we the ones that decide 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

this? 

11 

            

You wanted to introduce expert testimony. 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

What was the expert testimony you wanted to introduce? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

MR. JAY:  The other side wanted to introduce 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

expert testimony, Your Honor.  Petitioner told this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Court under page 40 of the petition for cert that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a pure legal question. 

   

 

 

17 

            

We agree that, under the correct analysis, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

it is a pure legal question.  We think that's a real 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

vice of the other side's view, that they are asserting, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, essentially, as a matter of law that certain 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things are necessary to be a cheerleader; that certain 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

things are -- influenced by function or form. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you just said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

that.  You said there are a lot of other ways to show 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that somebody's a cheerleader.  And, you know, maybe I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

44 

started to try to think of them.  And, you know, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not just that they all look alike, it's -- so maybe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's one area which you have testimony, that 95 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent of the cheerleading squads look like this.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe there aren't other ways. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

MR. JAY:  Well, ultimately, the question is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

-- the question is the hypothetical question whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this design can -- can be identified separately from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

articles on which it appears and whether it has -- it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has an existence separate from those articles. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think --

   

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And when you say "this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

design" -- I'm sorry, Mr. Jay. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  No, Your Honor --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  When you say "this design," 

  

 

 

 

 

 

just to make sure I understand what you're claiming 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright in, so if I'm looking at page 4 and there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this design with a blue stripe and a white stripe and a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

red stripe and a white stripe and a blue stripe, could 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody else come along and just add another red stripe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to that?  And would that -- would you then say you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violated our copyright? 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  Our copyright is in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

arrangement of the design elements. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The particular arrangement.

So if somebody just added a different, another stripe. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. JAY:  Well, adding another stripe is --

I -- I hesitate to agree with because usually 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reproducing a copyrighted work and then adding some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

other stuff around it is not enough to avoid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement.  But if they changed the colors and -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reordered the elements, I think they'd have a good 

   

   

 

 

 

 

argument that it's not infringing. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN 

 

 

 

 

 

          

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

MR. FEIGIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This case is about the reproduction of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-dimensional artwork on a useful article.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

question here is fundamentally indistinguishable from 

 

 

 

 

 

the tuxedo shirt that my friend conceded would retain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright protection, or putting a sports team logo on a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

T-Shirt that identifies somebody as a team member or a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

fan. 

24 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Or putting 

  

 

 

 

camouflage on a military uniform? 

   

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

46 

1 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  So, Your Honor, camouflage has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

been protected by copyright for decades.  The Copyright 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Office's practices on that reflect the view that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

camouflage is generally eligible, at least for a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

thin copyright, in the creative elements of a particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

camouflage pattern that aren't dictated by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

underlying ideas and scientific principles that make it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

work. 

9 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  As applied to a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

10 

military uniform. 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  So as applied to a military 

   

  

 

 

 

 

uniform, if someone were asserting a copyright in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

camouflage in such a manner as to prevent the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacturer of a uniform from actually manufacturing a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

uniform that would perform a concealment function, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

if concealment were, as Justice Kagan was positing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered to be separate from the sorts of expressive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functions that are traditionally protective by 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

copyright --

 

20 

21 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All of which --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  -- then there might 

  

 

 

 

 

22 

infringement --

 

23 

24 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- suggest the 

  

 

 

 

 

answer was yes; right? 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Then there might be some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

47 

infringement defenses that would apply in that context. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But what I think the dispute in this case is really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

boiling down to is a question of what the utilitarian 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspects of the "useful article" are.  And I think there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are two the Petitioner's identifying:  One is conveying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the information that someone is a cheerleader, 

   

 

 

 

 

identifying someone as a cheerleader; and the other is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

affecting the viewer's perception of the wearer's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appearance.  And I'd like to just explain overall --

JUSTICE BREYER:  What about the woman or the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

man who wishes -- and, indeed, this is a normal reason 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for wearing clothes -- they are making a statement about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves?  They're saying who they are?  The clothes 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

on the hanger do nothing; the clothes on the woman do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything.  And that is, I think, what fashion is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

16 

about. 

17 

            

18 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's so romantic. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It always has been in

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, it is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why do we wear robes? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, it is clear and it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

is common ground among the parties and with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Copyright Office that the actual cut and shape of a

JUSTICE BREYER:  What about Lemley's --

page 17 of his brief?  As I -- as I read it, as I read 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it and I thought -- and I'm sure you've read it -- and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it seemed to me that it does say that a two-dimensional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

picture of a three-dimensional piece of clothing is not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to copyright because it is not a design of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything but a utilitarian object, the clothes, whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

they are beautiful clothes, ugly clothes, cheerleader, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or anything else. 

 

 

12 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think I --

   

   

  

 

 

 

13 

14 

we disagree that you can't take the aesthetic aspects of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cheerleading uniform and put them in a different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

medium. 

16 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But do you agree with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

Lemley's statement, which, I mean, it's such an -- all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the professors are there --

 

 

 

 

19 

            

20 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  No.  Your Honor --

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and that's why I thought 

   

  

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

probably you've read it.  And it's from all over the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

country, and I wanted to get your opinion of it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, as you've 

  

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

characterized the statement, we don't agree with it.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do think that the two-dimensional artwork here is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

49 

1 

2 

separable from the garment, the cut and shape of which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not copyrightable.  Let me just make a couple of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

points. 

4 

            

One is about the act and what it's doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

overall.  The act overall is drawing a distinction 

   

  

 

 

 

 

between the kinds of aesthetic communicative expressive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functions that are traditionally protected by copyright 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the kinds of mechanical, pragmatic, utilitarian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

functions that are exclusively the domain of a "useful 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

article."  And the kinds of functions that Mr. Bursch is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about here are fundamentally expressive 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

functions. 

13 

            

First of all, conveying the information that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

someone is a cheerleader.  When someone is wearing a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

particular piece of clothing intended to convey that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're a member of a particular group or that they hold 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a particular belief, that is the kind of expressive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

function that copyright traditionally protects. 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

And, indeed, there is an express exception 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

in the definition of a "useful article" for conveying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

information.  And I think this is indistinguishable from 

   

  

 

 

 

 

putting a sports team logo on a T-shirt to identify 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

someone as a Washington Capitals fan, for instance. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what do you do in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

Mr. Bursch's examples of military uniforms or police 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

50 

officer uniforms, something like that? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  So, Your Honor, those also are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

conveying information.  Now, if someone were trying to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

assert a copyright in the design of a policeman uniform 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

in such a way that it turned out there were, say, only a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limited number of ways to identify someone as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policeman and a copyright were being asserted to prevent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

identification of someone as a policeman, then the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

defenses that we discuss at pages 39 to 40 of our brief, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the "merger" doctrine, the "scènes à faire" doctrine, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

would apply to prevent what would effectively be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

monopolization of that idea.

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

            

So if that were really happening in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

case -- and there are some reasons to think that's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually happening in the cheerleading realm, and we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discuss those in our brief -- if that were happening, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those defenses would apply. 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the Galiano 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

case?  That was the casino uniform.  Why is that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different from the cheerleader uniform? 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, we -- we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

don't agree with the result in the Galiano case.  To the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent there was some sort of unique, two-dimensional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements that some casino wanted to put on its uniforms 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to identify its employees, that artwork would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

51 

1 

2 

3 

copyrightable and -- just like the cheerleading uniforms 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case. 

 

 

              

I also want to address the argument --

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, before you get away 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

from that, one thing very quick, because maybe I really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree with you. 

 

 

7 

            

8 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  I hope so. 

    

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I had looked at page 22 of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

your brief at figure 8.  And what I had seen there when 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I took the arms away was a picture of a thing that was a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

picture of the cut and style and not just a picture of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chevrons.  And so -- but if that's what it is, then you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would agree and I would agree that it's not -- everybody 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would agree, I guess, it's not copyrightable. 

   

 

 

 

 

15 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  The point of figure 7 and 8 in 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

our brief, Your Honor, is that everything you see in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure 7 that's also in figure 8 is not copyrightable. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

That's the cut and shape of the dress.  It's the stripes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the coloration, the lines and the design in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

particular arrangement. 

 

21 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So what happens if when you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

look at the picture that they submit to the Copyright 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Office and try to figure out if it's separable what you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see is a picture of a dress that goes around a woman 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

which does look like, you know, shape and cut and so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

52 

1 

forth? 

2 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  So they have generally checked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

a box, as they did here, that says two-dimensional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

artwork, and the Copyright Office understands all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're trying to protect is the surface imagery of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

garment, and that, they'll register. 

 

 

 

 

              

I do want to address this idea that making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the viewer look different is somehow the kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non-expressive function that is associated with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"useful article" -- with a "useful article."  And I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think that approach would be contrary to congressional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intent and completely inadministrable. 

 

 

 

13 

            

If you look at page 55 of the House report, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

you'll see that Congress believed that two-dimensional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designs on fabric or on wallpaper would be separable and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thus copyrightable.  But that wouldn't be true under the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approach petitioner is urging. 

 

 

 

18 

            

Under that approach, you'd have to look at a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

particular two-dimensional design on wallpaper and try 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to assess whether and to what degree it might make the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

room look bigger or brighter or smaller or darker.  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not aware of any scientific reliable or consistent way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

--

24 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that seems a problem. 

   

  

 

 

 

25 

But on the other hand, it seems a little bit strange 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

53 

that, you know, take a garment designer who wants to do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a design that is slimming.  And if -- there are all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds of structural things you can do that are slimming, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and those would not be copyrightable.

the -- that the placement of stripes or color, that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyrightable, even though the garment designer is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really trying to do the same thing through color and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through graphic design as he was doing through the shape 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the article. 

 

 

12 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  So, Your Honor, I definitely 

   

  

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

think there is a spectrum here, but let me try to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain why I think this is on the expressive side of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the line, not the non-expressive side of the line. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

If I were to wear a shirt that said "Please 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

focus on my very nicely toned arms.  I've worked very 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hard on them," I think we'd all understand the message 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conveyed by that shirt to be expressive and separable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the non-expressive functions that the shirt 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performs covering my body. 

 

 

 

22 

            

Now, what -- the kinds of things that we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

talking about here are essentially sending that same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

message, albeit in a nonverbal, more subconscious way, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

but they're still fundamentally expressive because

5 

they're about how the wearer is trying to portray 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves and their appearance to the world, and that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all that's being copyrighted.  That's traditionally 

  

 

 

 

 

within the domain of copyright.  It is not copyrighting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a particular functionality. 

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is the domain of copyright 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

to copyright the way people present themselves to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

world? 

9 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  The way that someone 

  

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

expresses -- the way that someone expresses an idea to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the world -- in this case, the idea would be how they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look -- is something that is very akin to traditional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expression that's protected by copyright. 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

Again, here we're just talking about 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

two-dimensional artwork.  If we were -- if we adopted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petitioner's view, the Copyright Office, when it looks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at a particular two-dimensional design, would have to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

figure out what effect it would have in all sorts of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contexts on various "useful articles," which would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

really --

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The whole point of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the case is we're not just talking about two-dimensional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

artwork.  We're talking about two-dimensional artwork 

  

 

 

 

 

applied to a -- the fabric in a way that conveys a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

utilitarian function.  It's not just -- your friend 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

55 

concedes that if you want to put a picture of this on a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lunchbox or whatever that you have a copyright in that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's only when you apply it to a garment -- because it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is what makes that garment a cheerleading outfit as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed to somebody else; it serves that utilitarian 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

function -- that you don't have a copyright. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

            

MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, I think our 

   

  

 

 

 

8 

9 

fundamental disagreement is whether this is actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

performing utilitarian functions.  If I could just --

   

  

 

 

 

 

10 

            

11 

            

12 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

MR. FEIGIN:  -- finish my response. 

  

 

 

 

 

And I think one -- I think one problem with 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

the approach you've just articulated is it really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

divorces Section 101 and 113(a) because you could get a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright in the illustration, and then he would say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's not copyrightable in certain applications, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't make much sense. 

 

 

 

            

Thank you. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Bursch, six minutes. 

 

 

 

           

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

              

I want to start with that final point that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government makes, that if you had a statement that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

56 

1 

2 

3 

4 

says look at my arms on your shirt that somehow that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be conveying the same message.  That -- that's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what this is doing.  No one is saying, look at my arms. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Like with camouflage, you're not saying, look, you can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

see me. 

 

6 

            

The camouflage is actually doing work when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

it's put in connection with the garment that it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designed for.  That's the point. 

  

 

 

 

9 

            

And on that point, Justice Kagan, I just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

want to make clear about the functionality that we are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claiming here with respect to these designs.  It's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just that the lines follow the figure of the human body. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's that they actually make the human body appear to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look different than it would if they were not wearing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those designs.  It's just like camouflage. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the colors do.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

mean, the colors are just colors.  You can -- what he is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying is you can achieve the same thing with probably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most colors and stripes and whatever else is in these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

designs. 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, they are not claiming 

  

 

 

 

 

 

copyright in the colors.  They -- they can't --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, they are not. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  -- the arrangement. 

  

 

 

 

            

And I would say even as to color, this Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

57 

in the Qualitex case, that was a trademark case, you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said that black, the color black has the ability to make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a motor look smaller than it actually is.  It has a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

function that makes it ineligible for trademark 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protection, and, really, that's the same thing that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are talking about here.  That you can use graphic design 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like camouflage --

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Before we are going much 

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

further, you're now saying that any -- you're saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is no copyright on those things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

12 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Oh, no.  We are saying --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  On those pictorial 

  

 

 

 

13 

representations --

 

14 

            

15 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- because they can 

  

 

 

 

 

16 

always be applied in a way that has a function. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

MR. BURSCH:  That -- that's not correct, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

because if you took the sports logo that the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned, that's a perfect example of something that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't require the garment for its functionality, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because, just like we were discussing earlier, you could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take the logo, and you could put it on your hat or your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

socks or your lunch pail or on your -- your mitten that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you hold up when the folks hit the home run, right, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it doesn't rely at all for the article on which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

58 

1 

it's appeared for its functionality. 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

3 

            

But here, these designs rely entirely --

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Certain kinds make you 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

look fatter --

 

 

5 

            

6 

            

7 

            

8 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Right.  Exactly. 

  

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You believe that --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  And if --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you're saying none --

  

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

even if you find a color rainbow of some weird elk that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could never be copyrighted, because --

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

MR. BURSCH:  They -- they could have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

copyright in the two-dimensional design, but if there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was an application where it would create functionality 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when paired with a garment, then, yes, their copyright 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not extend to prevent --

 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about the gorilla, a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

gorilla's hand around your -- one of the pictures in --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Right.  That -- that's a much 

   

  

  

 

 

 

19 

closer case than this one. 

 

 

 

 

20 

            

For starters, if we're walking through the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

analysis, first you look at the identified separately, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and, here, when you look at the arrangements of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stripes and the color blocks and the chevrons, you --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you see the cheerleader uniforms. 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

And this is Justice Breyer's point about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

59 

1 

2 

3 

4 

page 17 of the Lemley brief, right, that the aesthetic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements exist only as part of a cheerleader uniform. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's nothing to extract.  That's why this case is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different than the gorilla case. 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

So then what you have to ask is if the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

the -- the T-shirt in that case was less functional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without the design, and I think that's a -- a close 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

8 

call. 

9 

            

But -- but this case is like the camouflage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

because it's -- it's doing the work of changing the way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the body is perceived just the way camouflage changes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way the body is perceived, and just like military 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uniforms, having an identifying function which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

extremely important. 

 

15 

            

So I -- I bring this all back to what the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

Chief Justice said, isn't it the test, if it's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

design that makes the article what it is, then you can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright it.  And I would say that that's almost 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

exactly right. 

 

20 

            

They can copyright the design and prevent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

reproduction of the two-dimensional design on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notebook or the lunchbox, but if it's the design that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes the article what it is, you can't manufacture --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do we decide that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

it's -- how do we decide that it's the design that makes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

60 

it what it is, as opposed to the cut of the garment, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shape, the pleats or whatever, the tightness of the top? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What -- why should we say that -- that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-dimensional design, which could be put on many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things, is what makes this article utilitarian? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But what do you do about the shape? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Well, here it's more than just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the shape.  If we go back and look at page --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we -- everybody 

  

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

agrees that the shape, the cut of the dress, that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

garment itself is not copyrightable, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

13 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Correct.  Everyone agrees. 

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So we are talking about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

the -- the design. 

 

 

 

15 

            

16 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So why -- why is this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

close to a fabric design? 

   

 

 

18 

            

MR. BURSCH:  Because, again, the fabric 

  

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

designs work anywhere, anyplace, no matter how you move 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them.  If we are looking at page 5 and you've got the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

waist narrowing Vs, which are not the shape of the dress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but they -- they make the illusion that the shape of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dress is cutting in to make you slimmer, those only work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that particular place on this article. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

If you put those on the lunchbox, they don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

61 

make the person look narrower.  They don't even make the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lunchbox look narrower. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

The designs, the shape of the designs work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

just like the shape of the garment itself, and -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's why this is different than that flowered print 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we were talking about in the -- the Folio case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

You know, in -- in conclusion, I want to go 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

back to what Justice Breyer and what Justice Sotomayor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said:  That if you recognize their -- their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-dimensional copyright extends to prohibit the 

 

 

 

 

 

manufacture of actual three-dimensional cheerleader 

 

 

 

 

uniforms, then -- then you're giving them 100-year of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copyright monopoly, and that school can't go anywhere 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else.  And that's really ironic because you have to keep 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in mind that --

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, can't the school just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

go to somebody who puts the zigzag where the chevron 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was, or the chevron where the zigzag was, or makes it a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple of different colors or adds another stripe? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, there's this -- my clerk found --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm sorry.  Just add that --

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, you can --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm done with my question. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BURSCH:  Yeah, as my -- as my friend on

the other side said, it -- it would still be a copyright

problem because they would claim that it was too close 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the original.

that we have in our reply brief, that there are only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain places that these stripes and chevrons and color 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blocks can go, otherwise it doesn't look like a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cheerleader uniform anymore.  It doesn't identify the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

person.  Certainly doesn't have the slimming effect, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

making taller effect, and all the other things that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

camouflage do. 

 

11 

            

So we respectfully request that you not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

grant a 100-year copyright monopoly in design.

The case is submitted.
