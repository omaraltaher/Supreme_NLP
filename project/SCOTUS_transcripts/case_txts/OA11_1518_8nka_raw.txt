12  meaning of defalcation, which is found currently in 
13  Section 523(a)(4) of the Code.  It is an undefined term 
14  in a Bankruptcy Code with more than 100 defined terms 
and it has been in the Bankruptcy Code -- Bankruptcy 
15

17  since then.  There is no plain contemporary, ordinary 
18  meaning that we can resort to, with respect to 
19  interpretation of the word because it is not in common 
20
 This case presents both the question of the 
21
22  action required to establish defalcation and the mental 
23  state that most -- that must accompany it.  And on the 
24  mental state issue, the circuits have split in probably

three ways, at least.

 The Eleventh Circuit here held that 


various candidates for applicable mental state, if there 
is one, could you tell me what this mental state applies 
to?  Does it apply to facts or does it apply to law? 

 MR. BYRNE:  Your Honor, it should apply to 

both, but it applies -- the act must be accompanied by a 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, before we get to the 

Petitioner committed defalcation by acting recklessly 

and affirmed on summary judgment -- a summary judgment

11  culpable mental state.  We will argue that -- and have 
12  argued that mistake of law can be relevant to the 
13  knowledge that the actor has when he commits the act, 
14  and we have argued that in this particular circumstance 
particularly involving dischargeability, that a mistake 
15
16  of law ought to be permissible in responding to the 
17  claim of defalcation. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what we have here 
18
19  is, I think everybody agrees, that these transactions 
were not authorized and they were self-dealing to the 
20
21  extent that there was a benefit to Mr. Bullock from the 
22  investments that were made.  So what, in addition to 
23  being unauthorized and self-dealing, which the 
24  government tells us should be enough to make 
25

defalcation, what else other than that it was not 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

authorized and it was self-dealing? 

Official 

 MR. BYRNE:  Your Honor, we believe that a 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But is a trustee who is 
taking -- borrowing against the cash value of the life 
insurance making an investment for the benefit of 

showing of extreme recklessness at least is required as 
to the self-dealing, and so we have advocated for the 
First and Second Circuit standard, which requires either 
extreme recklessness or conscious misbehavior by the 
actor.

11  himself and his mother getting profit from that 
12  investment and not sharing it with the other siblings 
13  who are also.  So what more than -- I mean, he did that 
14  all advertently. 
15
16  to the question, first were -- were the loans 
17  authorized?  Now, this case -- the finding of 
18  defalcation here is based entirely on the two Illinois 
19  court orders in collateral estoppel.  And the Illinois 
20
21  loans were authorized.  But let me put that aside, 
22  please, and answer your second question. 
23
24  what -- what at least creates a factual question on 
25

courts specifically reserved the question of whether the

 And what -- what sets this case apart and 

whether Mr. Bullock committed defalcation was what was

least a factual question that would have entitled him --
should have entitled him to a trial on the question of 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what about the two 

his -- what was the overall transaction.  This is a 
family trust, it was created by his father, involving 
his father's life insurance policy.  There is 
uncontradicted evidence that he did not know that making 
a loan to his mother at his father's request would 
somehow run afoul of the law more than a decade later 
when this all came -- when this all came to court. 
 So we say, Your Honor, that there is at

10
11  the mental state that accompanied his actions. 
12
13  other transactions which were not done at the bidding of 
14  the father? 
MR. BYRNE:  Well, Your Honor, they were done 
15
16  at the bidding of the mother and also they were -- they 
17  went into the family business.  These are two loans that 
18  went into the business created by the father and the 
19  mother, the garage building business.  That's where the 
proceeds went.  And so it would have been a surprise, we 
20
21  say, to the average person to learn that there was a 
22  legal problem with those loans. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I mean, it's 
23
24  often the case that -- that children don't want to go 
into the family business and it's often the case that 
25

 MR. BYRNE:  Well, it's not unusual to have 
some sort of conflict about that, Your Honor.  But the 
record is very limited in this case as to what the 
preferences of the others were.  It is -- it seems clear 

some of them do and some of them don't and the idea that 
one of the children who wants to put the money back in 
the family business is -- you know, you wouldn't think 
that was wrong when the other children want to take the 
money out or put it somewhere else.  That's not at all 
unusual.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Their preference is that

14  want the profits from that investment.  Whether they're 
15
16
17  clear now, Your Honor, that -- that background, these 
18  loans were made, please, recall, in the '80s. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I assume the other 
19
children did not have an interest in the business, but 
20
21  just the trustee and the mother did.  Or is that clear 
22  from the record.

question, but it is not in the record in the case, so -­

entitled to it is a different issue, but --

 MR. BYRNE:  That -- that position seems 

 MR. BYRNE:  That is not clear from the

 I mean, I didn't think there is any doubt 

here that the individual, your client, knew what he was 
doing.  He knew for a fact that he was taking money from 
the trust.  He knew he was giving it to his mother.  And 

please, to Justice Alito's question?  I -- I don't 
understand the answer to that.  That is, I don't 
understand, and it's just something I don't understand. 
I'm not saying it facetiously.  I don't understand the 
relationship of mental state to the issue.

11  he knows where it's going.  And he knows it was later 
12  paid back with 6 percent interest.  So you don't have to 
13  assume extreme recklessness.  He knew it.

15
16  things, embezzlement, larceny, fraud in the trust, I 
17  don't think any of them require a knowledge that what 
18  you're doing is unlawful.

21  the law of embezzlement. 
22
23  saying.  And as far as I know, a person to commit fraud 
24  lies, knows it's material, knows, et cetera, but he 
doesn't have to know there's a law against it.  And -­
25

 So if I -- or do they?  I don't think -- you 
can be convicted of embezzlement while misunderstanding 

 Now, what he didn't know was that that was 
unlawful.  And therefore, if I look at the accompanying 

Official

 You can be convicted of larceny, it's

Now, that I think is what Justice Alito was 

driving at.  And I'd like to hear an absolutely clear 
answer on that. 

and so -- if I do what Justice Harlan was doing and 
comparing it to the other three, it looks as if you 
don't need to know that what you're doing is against the 
law, where you commit defalcation.

 MR. BYRNE:  Your Honor, let me -- let me 
8
try -- let me try to give such an answer.  The first, 
9 
with respect to larceny, embezzlement and fraud, a 
10
11  mistake of law is admissible where it negates the 
12  scienter or the mental state. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But I didn't think there's 
13
14  any respect here in which admissing -- mistake of law, 
would negate the mental state as to having taken money 
15
16  from the trust, used it in the family business and then 
17  paid it back, which I take it are, we assume, which is a 
18  different question I have, but for present purposes, we 
19  are assuming that that's sufficient for defalcation. 
Is that right?  Where does it, where does 
20
21  it negative the intent in respect to what happened? 
22
23  of the law, knowledge of wrongdoing I think is what --
24  what you're asking, where does that come into this?  And 
it comes into the question A, if you didn't have it; and 
25

 MR. BYRNE:  Well, Your Honor, the knowledge

B, the question becomes was it extremely reckless under 

the scienter standard that the First and Second 

Circuits -- the First and Second Circuits follow --


 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it had nothing to do 


with recklessness.  He did these three things knowingly. 
That is a stronger mental state than recklessness, not a 
weaker one.

21  thought the very basic definition of defalcation in 
22  every dictionary of the time and forever, one of the 
23  three definitions has always been that you cause a loss

 MR. BYRNE:  Well, Your Honor, the -- in many 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  My problem is the 

Official 

 MR. BYRNE:  Well, Your Honor, the question 


would be whether or not on the mental state and I'll
 
get to the actus reus element of this quickly, but 

as to the mental state, if the mental state is not 

culpable, then it seems entirely inconsistent --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that's Justice 

 I think that your stronger argument is that 
loss to the estate, or the one that you have to -- can 
direct your attention to, is what is the loss to the 
trust?  But what does it matter whether I intended to 
lose it or not if I wasn't entitled to lose it?

12  Breyer's point, which is if you took the money and lost 
13  it, what does it matter?  You took it.  Unless -- unless 
14  you were drugged and didn't know that you were taking 
the money and somebody else forced you to in some --
15
16  under some sort of duress defense, some outrageous 
17  question, isn't the issue the one that Justice Breyer 
18  came to?  If you're a fiduciary, why should an excuse of 
19  ignorance of the law ever save you when you are required 
20
21
22  does not save you from liability.  Our issue here is 
23  dischargeability, which is a --
24
25

discharged if you took -- if you knowingly did an act, 

to exercise the highest protection of the trust? 

 MR. BYRNE:  Well, Your Honor, of course, it 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why should you be

mental state.  You intended to take the money. 

 MR. BYRNE:  Because --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- with its concomitant 

MR. BYRNE:  Well, Your Honor, because for 
dischargeability purposes, because of Gleason v. Thaw, 
and the rule that -- that bankruptcy discharge 
exceptions are confined to those plainly expressed 
doubts are resolved in favor of the debtor.  And if you 
look at the other requirements for exceptions to 

1 
2
3
4 
5
6 
7 
8 
9 
10
11  discharge in Section 523(a) you see a high level of 
12  culpable conduct.  For example, in Geiger the Court held 
13  that reckless torts do not amount --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but you see -- should 
14
I have to write the opinion in this case, I would have 
15
16  to deal with this issue and I'd have to say something 
17  about it.  And as soon as I look at the other words, 
18  those are words like "embezzlement," "larceny," and 
19  "fraud."  Now, elsewhere in the U.S. Code where those 
are crimes ignorance of the law is not an excuse.  It 
20
21  often is an excuse where in fact it's a tax violation or 
22  some other technical violation. 
23
24  "defalcation" when linked to those three is being 
25

 So I would have to explain why the word 

treated differently.  Or I'd have to say Congress used 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

words which never have ignorance of the law as an excuse 
and meant them differently.  Each of those is pretty 
hard to say. 

 MR. BYRNE:  Well, Your Honor, you're 

alluding to Cheek v. United States and Rasco v. United 
States, cases in which ignorance of the law, as an 
exception to the general rule, was found to be a defense 
in those cases.  And what you had in those cases was a 
complex legal regime.  You had the tax laws and then you 
had the -- anti-structuring statute. 

1 
2 
3 
4
5
6 
7 
8 
9 
10
 And here, we say that trust law in and of 
11
12  itself is a complex enough legal regime that a mistake 
13  of law at least ought to be admissible, not for 
14  liability, but for establishing bankruptcy --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I have one other question 
15
16  on a different subject that may be more helpful to you 
17  or not.  I think of defalcation as the individual who 
18  has defalcated shows up in Rio with two suitcases full 
19  of money, and it seems to me if you look at the root of 
20
21  and cutting something down, and therefore it did seem to 
22  refer to an instance where you take the corpus or money 
23  belonging to the trust, now it becomes ambiguous, and 
24  you run off with it. 
25

the word, it consists of diminishing, taking a sickle 

Is there anything you would like to say 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

about that? 

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But there is a 

shortage of accounts at the end of the day.  It's just a 
question of what day it is.  When he takes -- takes the 
stuff and it's a lost -- it's either viewed as a lost 

 MR. BYRNE:  Yes, Your Honor.  I would like 
to say that defalcation requires a shortage in accounts 
at the end of the day.  And so there must be -- if it's 
a trust, there must be some res missing when the trustee 
is called to account. 

1

3 
4 
5
6 
7
8 
9 
10
11  opportunity or an increase in the risk to the 
12  beneficiary, and that's a loss to them at that point. 
13  The fact -- it's like a bank robber giving back the 
14  money.  There is no loss to the bank, but it's still 
15
16
17  of the word "misappropriation" in 1978 from the 
18  Bankruptcy Code by Congress suggests that 
19  misappropriations that are on an interim basis that 
cause -- that do not cause a loss to the trust and 
20
21  are -- are never accounted for is not the kind of action 
22  or act that should result in an exception to discharge. 
 But if you look with respect to defalcation 
23
24  at the definitions at the time, the definitions that 
25

were available in 1841 as I believe Justice Breyer has 

a crime. 

 MR. BYRNE:  Well, Your Honor, the deletion 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And the origin of the defalcation exception, 

done, the -- the definitions you get are, for example in 
Webster's 1828 dictionary, the act of cutting off or 
deducting a part. 

1 
2 
3 
4
and I believe the amici for Respondent are correct in 
5
this respect, was the Swartwout scandal in 1838, when 
6 
one Samuel Swartwout, who was the -- in charge of 
7 
collections for the New York Customs House, which was a 
8 
substantial part of the Federal budget at that time, was 
9 
found after he departed the country to have $1.2 million 
10
11  missing from his accounts.  And that was referred to as 
12  a defalcation at the time and it's quite reasonable to 
13  assume that's how it ended up in the statute. 
14
15
16  collecting at the time of -- that he turns over his 
17  office because this really originated with public 
18  officials, is the relevant time. 
19
20
21  away and then you give it back, or even if you give it 
22  back with 2 percent interest or something, I mean, maybe 
23  if that money had remained in the trust and I realize 
24  that this is a strange trust, but we have to think about 
other kinds of trusts, if that money had remained in the 
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I guess the question is 
how do you measure this loss?  I mean, if you take money 

 So the loss of res there -- the loss of 

funds to which the fiduciary is responsible for

trust, there would have been a profit to be made from 
that money. 

 And -- you know, it's not -- if you say, 
well, I gave it back, well, yes, but if you had just 
left it there, you would have had that money plus all 
the money that that money earned. 

 MR. BYRNE:  Correct, Justice Kagan.  But 
here, there was never any money taken from the trust 
that didn't wind up with the trust at the end of the 
day.  The evidence is that the net policy value on the

11  day Mr. Bullock unwittingly became a trustee in 1978 was 
12  the same as when he, at the end of his tenure --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what -- what about 
13
14  the profit from the transactions, the profit that he 
made?  Yes, he paid back everything with interest, but 
15
16  in addition to that, according to the Illinois court's 
17  judgment, there was a profit that he made that he didn't 
18  put back in the trust -- he didn't put in the trust. 
 MR. BYRNE:  He was -- he was charged with 
19

21  loans, Your Honor. 
22
23  dollars in loans.

 MR. BYRNE:  That's correct, Your Honor. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that did not go back 

having profited with respect to one or more of the

Official 

 MR. BYRNE:  He -- he does for liability 
purposes, of course, Justice Scalia.  But here the 
question is whether there is a bankruptcy defalcation. 
And that's a question of Federal law. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I ask you a question 

 MR. BYRNE:  It did not. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  As it should.  Doesn't the 
trustee have to disgorge whatever he makes by improper 
use of the trust funds?

12  the objective of filing for bankruptcy was to get rid of 
13  this judgment debt, this Illinois judgment debt, right? 
 MR. BYRNE:  Yes, Your Honor. 
14
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the Eleventh Circuit 
15
16  said -- you know, we're really sympathetic to that, but 
17  the problem is that the bank would not let you sell the 
18  collateral.  If you could sell the collateral, then you 
19  could pay off the loan and you wouldn't need to declare 
20
 Did you bring such a suit, the suit that 
21

best answer to the rule that we should write, okay? 

 If I agree with you that you need to prove 

brought, Your Honor.  And in that action, let's say it 

were brought today, it could do nothing to relieve 

Petitioner of the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit and 

the lower courts here that he has a debt that is -- a 

substantial debt that is excepted from discharge.  He 
could continue litigating perhaps if he has the 
resources in -- in Illinois for many more years perhaps, 
but --

10
11  Forgetting that I don't accept that you need a mental 
12  state, okay?  Let's go to just the loss issue. 
13
14  the loss, this is a very unusual trust because the 
15
16  was the amount of the trust plus the fixed interest, 
17  essentially.  This is a very unusual trust.  In the 
18  norm, the trust just says to the trustee invest 
19  prudently.  And the trustee self-deals by taking the res 
20
21  takes the profit. 
 In that situation, how would you measure the 
22
23  loss?  In the normal self-dealing where the trustee just 
24  has to invest prudently and is depriving the trust of 
that investment value, would you say in that situation 
25

measure of what the trust's res should be is fixed.  It 

out, puts the investment in his or her own name and 

18
 

Alderson Reporting Company

that the loss is measured by the lost opportunity? 

 MR. BYRNE:  Your Honor --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because there is a 

difference between what the trust loses and the gain 
that the trustee makes, which under normal trust 
principles the gain has to be disgorged. 

 Are you separating out those two things and 
how are you separating them out and how would I -- how 
would we write -- the Court write this opinion to give 
loss meaning?  What's the -- what's the meaning you want 

1 
2
3
4 
5
6 
7
8 
9 
10
11  to give it? 
12
13  the trust should be measured by the economic loss to the 
14  trust between points A and point B.  And -- and it's --
it's as simple as that, and of course here there wasn't 
15
16  loss to the trust.  As you point out, it's an unusual 
17  situation perhaps, but of course life insurance trusts 
18  and other kinds of trusts that present this situation 
19  are --
20
21  the profit to the trustee is never a measurement. 
 MR. BYRNE:  The profit to the trustee would 
22
23  not come into play.  It could come into play for fraud. 
24  It could come into play for embezzlement.  It could come 
25

into play if the mental state that we argue for is 

 MR. BYRNE:  Your Honor, the -- the loss to

12  the guy knew. 
 MR. BYRNE:  Well, for the -- for that worst 
13
14  case, Your Honor, there is embezzlement in the statute. 
So if a -- if someone comes into possession of property 
15
16  and misuses it and does so with fraudulent intent, it 
17  sounds like here, then there is a -- then embezzlement 
18  can be established under the statute.

Eleventh Circuit thought was a solution to this problem. 

stick to the record in responding and there is no real 
explanation for that.  There is in the record a 
consistent track of Petitioner trying to get the bank to 
sell the collateral in order to pay the debt off over 
time and with an urgency to it because the collateral 

was deteriorating in value.  But beyond that, there's 

not anything else in the record about the practicality

 MR. BENSINGER:  Generally speaking, Your 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, of course, that's 
one of the things we are arguing about here.  I don't

that's borne out by the history.

14  history of the Bankruptcy Act.  Defalcation was first 
15
16  exception to discharge for defalcation.  There was no 
17  mention of fraud, there was no mention of embezzlement,

 MR. BENSINGER:  Yes, Your Honor.

10
11  here, I agree with you, as far as the act is concerned. 
12  It wasn't just reckless, it was intentional.  So you 
13  don't have to worry about that one. 
14
15
16  come from the other side, but you -- you concede, I take 
17  it, that there has to be an element in which the person 
18  not only knows what he has done, but that he does it 
19  with an element of moral turpitude; i.e. he knows that 
the law forbids it or -- or are you conceding this and 
20
21  then fill in the blanks, or? 
22
23  apologize if I misspoke.  All that is required is an 
24  intent to do the act and that's what --

 Thus Justice Kennedy's basic question I'd 
like to hear your answer to.  I thought it might have

required?

 That suggests a knowledge that what you are 
doing violates the law.  And if we read in pari materia, 
we get the same kind of requirement for this, indeed 
more so.  Indeed, you just conceded it existed even in 

your position, what do you say to what Justice Kennedy 
said, add in Justice Harlan's comment that embezzlement 
and larceny are set off.  These two concern fraud and 
defalcation in respect to the trust.  There is a case of 
this Court that says fraud in respect to the trust 
requires an element of moral turpitude.

money.  Justice Breyer and I both agree you intended to 
take the money.  So why are you adopting the need for 
recklessness, unless you're trying to avoid the second 
component that the other side's talking about, which is 
that you caused a loss to the trust?  Because that's 
where you have a problem here, where you have a problem

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the problem is

17  that, yes, there was a breach of the trust.  But in 
18  terms of the terms of the trust, the trust got every 
19  penny that it would have earned if the money had not 
been taken.  It got the trust plus the fixed 6 percent

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, the -- why are you

16  that is borne out also by the other exceptions to

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

concerning that the required mental intent or the mens 
rea, both in the petition and here this morning, the 
Petitioner has not been able to articulate exactly what 
mens rea is required, that is, what mental intent is 

not.  That was not an issue that ultimately came before 
the bankruptcy court.  The bankruptcy court made no

14
15
16  Specifically, if the mental intent required were an 
17  intent to cause an injury, Section 523(a)(6) of the 
18  Bankruptcy Code already accepts from discharge debts for 
19  willful and malicious injury. 
20
21  embezzlers -- not all of them -- many embezzlers fully 
22  intend to pay everything back once things turn out all 
23  right.  But there's still an embezzlement.  But there is 
24  also a criminal intent at the time, or a wrongful

 And it -- it seems to me that you're 

standing very firm on the fact that defalcation means 
something different than fraud in the first clause, or 
embezzlement and larceny in -- in the following clause. 

MR. BENSINGER:  It does, Your Honor. 
Defalcation when it was first introduced into the 
Bankruptcy Act in 1841 had a known meaning, and that 
known meaning, at least according to the Oxford English 
Dictionary, is a monetary deficiency through breach of 
trust.

14  there's two problems with this.  Number one, it's not 
consistent with these -- with the meaning of the other 
15
16  three terms in the -- in the statute; and two, it's not 
17  consistent with the idea that discharges should be 
18  freely given so that debtors can begin again. 
19
subsequent inclusion of the terms fraud, embezzlement 
20
21  and larceny cannot retroactively modify or change the 
22  known definition of the word defalcation.  This Court in 
23  Schwager v. Northern Burlington considered two sections 
24  of -- or two statutes in the Securities and Exchange 
25

Act, Section 14(e) and Section 10(b).  Section 10(b) was 

 MR. BENSINGER:  But, Your Honor, the

Alderson Reporting Company

the first enacted statute.  Section 14(e) was 
subsequently enacted. 

 Both statutes prohibited a manipulative type 
of transaction with regard to securities.  Section 14(e) 
also prohibited a fraudulent act with regard to 
securities.  This Court stated in that case -- while it 
wasn't central to its holding -- the Court did state 
that the inclusion of the term "fraudulent" in Section 
14(e) could not modify the understanding of the term 
"manipulative."

12
13  certainly an issue that the parties have contested in 
14  the briefs before this Court and in the courts below, 
whether there was a loss.  And there was a loss.  The 
15
16  State court recognized that there was a loss in the 
17  amount of $250,000. 
 That judgment of $250,000 creates a claim. 
18
19  The Bankruptcy Code in Section 101-5 defines a claim as

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if he made 
21
22  nothing on the deal, and it just turns out he got 
23  whatever the -- the trust was getting under its interest

that case.  And that -- there would be nothing --

12  If I'm inconsistent in that answer, I apologize.  I did

14  a debt.  For there to be a defalcation, that merely goes 
to the bad act.  The act of, in this case, self-dealing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why are you fighting that? 
16
17  You're going to have to prove the loss anyway.  You say 
18  there is a loss. 
 MR. BENSINGER:  Your Honor, the loss in that 
19
case occurs -- Your Honor is absolutely right -- at the 
20
21  time that there is that cutting off, at the time in this 
22  case the Petitioner used the trust assets for his own

million plus 6 percent. 

 MR. BENSINGER:  Your Honor --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  The only part they don't 

have is the extra money that the trustee made, that 
there is no cutting down of the size of the trust.  At 
least that's an argument.  Now, what's the answer? 

1 
2 
3
4
5
6 
7 
 MR. BENSINGER:  Because, Your Honor, the 
8
loss occurred.  There was a loss in the amount of the 
9 
loans that he took out.  And that loss was compounded, 
10
11  if you will, Your Honor, by the Petitioner's failure to 
12  return those -- the proceeds of those loans --
13
14  unusual part of this trust, which is that by the terms 
of this trust, it was only going to grow at principal 
15
16  plus a fixed interest.  Most trusts are not written this 
17  way. 
 This is the highly unusual trust, where it 
18
19  never -- should have made more money because taking the 
Chief Justice's hypothetical, which is he had invested 
20
21  it and just gotten the interest due, why would there be 
22  a defalcation?

24  you would have suffered?

required, and he paid all of that back just as he did

MR. BENSINGER:  The defalcation there, Your

12  has created a conflict of interest, and that causes a 
13  loss.  There might not be a monetary -- a straight 
14  monetary loss at that time. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I've never heard of a 
15
16  defalcation that didn't result in some monetary loss.

15
16  I think that the dictionary definitions, if you look at

19  dictionary definitions and the legal dictionary

 MR. GANNON:  Pardon?

 MR. GANNON:  We did quote the Samuel Johnson 

dictionary and the Webster's 1828 dictionary that have 
that meaning.  If you look at the Oxford English 
Dictionary definition, that was an obsolete meaning. 

 And I think that it's quite clear that the 

meaning that Congress was invoking here is what is dealt 
with under heading five in the Oxford English 

it was confirmed by my law clerks, it comes from 
medieval Latin, starting with a sickle and meant to cut 
down, to cut down, and that suggested reduction.

11  Dictionary.  And my friend quoted it earlier, there is 
12  either a monetary deficiency through a breach of trust 
13  by one who has the management or charge of funds --
14
again, isn't that a loss?  But I thought that your 
15
16  position was that there didn't need to be a loss. 
17
18  there and I think that one of the illustrative 
19  quotations that the OED uses for that very definition 
doesn't actually refer to a monetary deficiency, and 
20
21  neither do most of the other dictionary definitions.  So 
22  I do think that there's probably an open question about 
23  what the purest meaning of the term defalcation, whether 
24  it requires a loss. 
25

 MR. GANNON:  Well, there are two questions 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, monetary deficiency, 

Here, we do think that there is a loss. 

43
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's certainly 

true --

There is a loss in a very real and traditional sense. 
There is no doubt about it that because the Petitioner 
took -- engaged in self-dealing and made a profit with 
that, with the money that he had taken out of the trust 
corpus and refused to return those profits to the trust, 
that is a loss to the trust, just as it would be had he 
taken the money and invested it in some great investment 
scheme and -- or he decided to bet it at the track --

10
 MR. GANNON:  -- and he decided --
11
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- in an ordinary trust, but 
12
13  isn't there a real question as to this trust because if 
14  this trust would -- the trustee shouldn't have been 
investing this in the first place.  All that this trust 
15
16  was going to get was the principal plus a fixed income. 
 MR. GANNON:  I don't think that's a fair 
17
18  statement of the way this trust operates.  It's not 
19  consistent with Petitioner's own arguments. 
Petitioner's argument in the State court and in the 
20
21  Bankruptcy Court, the argument that he says is the 
22  reason why there is no -- no determination about whether 
23  this was an authorized use of the money under the trust 
24  instrument is that -- that he was allowed to invest the 
25

assets of the trust.

have offered to lodge the trust instrument with the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would you just repeat 

what you said?  Your voice turned. 

 And so the way the courts -- and the parties 

 MR. GANNON:  The last part I said, that the 
parties have offered to lodge the trust instrument with 
the Court, but my understanding is that it's not in the 
record.  But I don't think anybody has taken the

12  trust was the life insurance policy plus 6 percent. 
13
14  understood.  So you're saying that that is not the case? 
MR. GANNON:  I believe that that is not the 
15
16  case and that is not even consistent with Petitioner's 
17  own position in the State court, where he said he was 
18  taking this money and investing it in some alternative 
19  thing because he thought that would be safer than 
leaving the money with the life insurance company. 
20
21
22  why I think that this is a loss and so I think that this 
23  trust is not as unusual or unique as you think it is, in 
24  part because we don't have the language of it in front 
25

 And I think if I can go back to explaining 

of us.

 But secondly, I was trying to say that had 

 And he decided, well, you know what, had I 

he taken this money for an authorized purpose or not and 
decided he was going to go invest it, he had some boffo 
scheme, he had some friend who had a great stock tip, or 
he had a tip at the races and he was going to go down to 
the track and bet this money, and he made 1,000 percent.

not taken the money out of the trust all I would have to

do is return, all I have to do is make it whole in the 
9 
sense of having the 6 percent that it otherwise would 
10
11  have had.  That everybody would understand, that's a 
12  breach of his duty of loyalty.  That's a defalcation. 
13  It is an injury to the trust.  It is a loss in every 
14  relevant sense. 
15
16  State court awarded for attorney's fees and costs is 
17  also another concrete loss to the estate.  And this 
18  Court's decision in Cohen v. De la Cruz, which was about 
19  nondischargeability of a fraud judgment, of a debt for 
20
21  legal liability associated with the underlying fraud --
22
23  components of the award, the attorney's fees plus the 
24  $250,000 profit.  And you're representing to me right 
now that, as a trustee, he was entitled to invest that

fraud, said that that debt for fraud included all of the

here as well? 

 MR. GANNON:  It's not that there -- it's not 
the opportunity loss.  It's not the fact that the trust 
wasn't already earning the interest in the -- vis-à-vis 
the insurance company as it otherwise would. 
Petitioner's position is if he already gave back the 
money that it would have earned in interest vis-à-vis 
the insurance company, my position, the government's 
position, is that the loss here is that he failed to

18  about and quote "Learned Hand" and say it means -- "If 
19  it doesn't mean a deliberate malversation," said Learned

 Now, the other argument was, yes, fine, a 


loss.  Two, done deliberately, but with an innocent 

state of mind because he didn't understand the law. 

Justice Kennedy quoted, fraud -- from this Court, that 

fraud in bankruptcy for purposes of this provision 
requires some degree of moral turpitude.  Well, that 
suggests that you aren't innocent in respect to 
knowledge that it's against the law.  What about that?

7 
8 
 MR. GANNON:  My response to that is that the 
9
Neal v. Clark decision that's being discussed here is --
10
11  and we discuss this in our brief -- is distinguishable 
12  in part because its current descendent is actually not 
13  this provision.  It is not this reference to fraud.  It 
14  is the exception from discharge in paragraph (a)(2)(A). 
And what makes this different is that this 
15
16  is fraud in a fiduciary capacity which was not true in 
17  the context of Neal v. Clark, and that's something that 
18  the Court said at the time, that because it did not 
19  actually have the limitations of the fiduciary context, 
20
21  inferred it, the Court inferred it, from embezzlement. 
22
23  question, the way Congress has dealt with that is that 
24  it has put actual fraud in (a)(2)(A), and here it has 
grouped fraud with defalcation in a fiduciary capacity 
25

they needed to infer some type of limitation.  They 

 And so going back to Justice Kennedy's 

48
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

and therefore it includes the type of limitation that 

the Court was trying to impose in Neal v. Clark. 


 We don't think that there is any inherent 


mens rea in defalcation and --


JUSTICE ALITO:  Could you explain what you 

mean, before your time expires, in footnote 18?  I 
understood your argument until I got there, but then you 
said that there was no particular mental state required. 
And then in footnote 18 you said, well, there may be 
cases where a particular mental state is required. 
 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think when it gets

11
12  further away from the heartland definition of 
13  defalcation, which does -- which, as we discussed in 
14  this Court's 1844 decision in Chapman and in the 1841 
15
16  self-dealing in trust assets.  And so we think that's 
17  the heart of defalcation. 
 As you move away from that particular type 
18
19  of fiduciary breach, and if you move away from there it 
20
21
22  look to find out what is the border between the 
23  heartland of defalcation and the badlands of defalcation 
24  and whatever else?

 And so if you look at the Ninth Circuit, for 

dictionary definitions are broad enough to include other 
types of fiduciary breaches, but it's not clear that 
that means that defalcation needs to be doing all the 
work here of potentially putting limits on the scope of 
the exception.

instance, the way it has handled this is it has 
7 
recognized, as we do, that defalcation can be innocent 
8 
and -- but it has, it has concluded that the essence of 
9 
defalcation is the failure to account for or to produce 
10
11  funds, and therefore it wouldn't be something that would 
12  just be garden variety mismanagement of the assets. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why not?  I mean, 
13
14  it's a -- it's a violation of the trustee's 
15
16  the funds, right? 
17
18  should be turned over.  It's a defalcation. 
19
20
21  that would be further away from the core of defalcation, 
22  but it's not this case, so we would urge the Court to 
23  affirm.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then why isn't the loss

14  loss to the trust.  Then his mental state would -- would 
15
16
17  to -- to the first issue, whether a mental state is 
18  required or not. 
19
Now, to respond to a few things said by Respondent and 
20
21  by the solicitor, the Petitioner actually did put into 
22  the record when he opposed summary judgment pro se in 
23  the bankruptcy court all of his evidence about what 
24  he -- what should have been done with the money that was 
25

in the constructive trust, what should have been done

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then we have to go back 

 MR. BYRNE:  That's correct, Your Honor.

during that period. 

 He put that in -- in evidence, it's in the 

 The Respondent relied entirely on the two 

 And it's interesting, the constructive 

record and his repeated pleas that the assets be sold to 
pay the judgment are reflected by that.

Illinois court orders and put in no evidence other than

the original pleadings, if they are evidence, in the --

in the Illinois case.  So there is that question about 
9 
the record, and Petitioner did track what -- what his 
10
11  efforts were to try to persuade the trustee to consent 
12  to the sale of the property. 
13
14  trust, of course, was imposed on the properties that 
15
16  any profit from the loans, they would have been caught 
17  in those properties.  And eventually, of course, they 
18  were not sold. 
19
here, a trial would be needed.  And that's really why we 
20
21  were hoping the Court will give us -- give Mr. Bullock a 
22  day in court here to establish under the proper legal 
23  standard what any loss really was, if there was one.

 And it was said earlier that a conflict of 
interest itself is a defalcation, but not if there's no

loss.  That's just -- that's entirely inconsistent with 
the other exceptions to discharge in the Code. 

 Mr. Gannon read the -- noted that the 

dictionary definitions evolved over time, but the 1856 
definition of defalcation from Bouvier's Law Dictionary 
that's quoted in the government's brief actually still 
reflects the -- the idea that -- or the definition that 
defalcation is the act of a defaulter.  And a defaulter 
is defined as, "one who fails in making his accounts 
correct."

 So by 1856, years after the first enactment 
11
12  of defalcation, that was still the definition that was 
13  prevailing in the day, at least according to that 
14  dictionary, and according to the others that -- that we 
15
 Petitioner here made a mistake in judgment. 
16
17  There was never any finding of dishonesty on his part. 
18  There was never any finding that he acted with a 
19  malicious intent.  In fact, there was a finding that he 
acted with no apparent malicious intent in the Illinois 
20
21  courts.  This question is one of dischargeability, and 
22  his debt is really what bankruptcy is for.  It's for a 
23  fresh start for an honest, but unfortunate debtor.

 Unless the Court has any further questions, 

that concludes my argument.
