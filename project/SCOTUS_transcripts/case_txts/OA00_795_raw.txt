CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 00-795, John Ashcroft versus the Free Speech


Coalition.  Mr. Clement.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it


please the court:  In 1996 Congress updated the child


pornography laws to keep pace with technological


developments.  Congress extended the existing prohibitions


on visual depictions of actual children engaged in


sexually explicit conduct to cover virtually


indistinguishable images in material pandered as child


pornography.  These provisions are constitutional for the


same basic reason that other laws prohibiting child


pornography have been upheld. They protect real children


from real abuse.


They do so in two important ways.  First, by


preventing the publication and production of materials


that are as effective as traditional child pornography in


seducing children, and second, by allowing the government


to effectively prosecute cases involving traditional forms


of child pornography.


First, these provisions allow the government to

attack material that poses the same risk of enticing


children into illicit sexual activities and to pose for


child pornography as traditional child pornography.


The government has a clear and compelling


interest in targeting such material; indeed, this court in


Osborne against Ohio used that rationale to uphold Ohio's


prohibition on the possession of child pornography.


Second and equally important, the government has


a clear interest in promoting the effective prosecution of


the traditional laws against traditional forms of child


pornography.  The advent and increasing availability of


computer technology has allowed individuals to generate


computer images that are virtually indistinguishable from


traditional photographs.  This allows criminal defendants


to inject reasonable doubt arguments into virtually every


case.


QUESTION:  Has any case, to your knowledge, been


lost on that ground in which that was a substantial


argument?


MR. CLEMENT:  No case has been lost on that


ground but that is largely a result of the 1996 Act, which


has taken that argument away from criminal defendants. 


And to give you one very specific example, the case that


the Fifth Circuit heard in the Fox case, United States


against Fox which is one of the cases where the lower

courts upheld this law in an as applied context, the


government's expert witness, Special Agent Barkhausen was


forced on cross-examination to admit that she could not


tell definitively whether or not the image was of a real


child.  Now that concession prior to the 1996 Act would


likely have been fatal to the government's prosecution.


QUESTION:  Was that because she couldn't tell


whether the real child was over 18 or under 18 or because


she couldn't tell whether it was a real person?


MR. CLEMENT:  That case was because she couldn't


tell it was a real person.


QUESTION:  Wouldn't she have the same difficulty


on the distinction between an 18-year-old and a


19-year-old?


MR. CLEMENT:  In the cases where the line that


the courts are concerned with is the line between 18 and


19, there's an additional aspect of the statute that


clears up many of the problems and that's the affirmative


defense which allows individuals to produce and distribute


materials if they make clear they involve actual


individuals who are over 18.


QUESTION:  But in terms of what you outlined, in


terms of the two dangers, you say just the same as if it


were an actual child.  Well, if it's a very young adult


who looks like a child, it seems to me everything that you

said about the virtual pornography would apply to a young


adult who looks like a child.


MR. CLEMENT:  That's certainly true, but I think


Congress in recognizing an affirmative defense for


materials that were produced using people who had reached


the age of majority struck a balance and recognized that


this Court has provided additional protection to


pornographic depictions involving actual adults.


QUESTION:  Okay, well the question of the


balance raises the question of tailoring, and what I


wanted to ask you was if it's appropriate to have the


affirmative defense that the children or that the people


depicted were in fact over 18, why isn't it equally


appropriate to have an affirmative defense to the effect


that the depiction does not have anyone who is not a real


child under 18.  In other words, if the government's


interests are protected by the affirmative defense in the


real child case, why shouldn't there be a comparable


affirmative defense for the simulation.


MR. CLEMENT:  I think there are at least two


reasons for that differential treatment.  One is with


respect to age that's a fact that's uniquely verifiable


and in a lot of contexts we recognize that somebody's age


is something that one can verify.  And in fact what we're


really talking about in most of these cases where the

affirmative defense for age would be implicated are films


and the like where there would be witnesses who could


testify that somebody was of a particular age on a


particular date.


QUESTION:  But in effect you're depending on the


witness to say that the actors here were in fact over 18. 


Maybe they'll produce facsimiles of birth certificates or


maybe they'll produce children or whatnot.  Why can't you


have the same evidence to the effect that there were no


real children being used in manufacturing the film? 


You're depending on witnesses in each case.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, in most of the cases when


you're talking about somebody who's going to make the


claim that they actually generated the photographs


themselves, there will be no witnesses. But I think more


important than the presence or absence of witnesses is --


QUESTION:  But that's a question of proof and I


suppose that if the only person who steps up to the stand


and says, there were no live children here, is the person


who was accused of the pornography, that person may have


something to worry about in not having a very convincing


affirmative defense.  But that's the defendant's problem,


not the government's problem.


And so I don't think that answers the question,


why if the government is sufficiently protected with the

affirmative defense in the one class of cases it wouldn't


be in the other.


MR. CLEMENT:  And I do think that age rather


than whether an image is computerally generated is


something that is uniquely subject to verification and


this Court in its Ferber decision confronted the argument


that the New York statute was overbroad because it didn't


limit its protections to photographs and images that were


produced in the state of New York.


And the court rejected that overbreadth argument


for two reasons; one, that it would be virtually


impossible for anybody to prove what was the state of


origin for the photo.  And I think the same analysis


applies for a computer generated image. The second reason,


of course, was that even materials --


QUESTION:  Why is it -- why is it that witnesses


can explain the age but cannot explain whether it was


computer generated?


MR. CLEMENT:  Because, again, in sort of the


stylized case that the person who's computer generated an


image, that's not something that requires a film crew to


be brought in so there aren't necessarily going to be


witnesses.  In the case --


QUESTION:  But that's not the government's


problem.  I mean, that may be the problem of the person

who has the burden of proof to carry on the affirmative


defense and if it is a problem then the government is the


-- in effect going to be the winning party in resolving


that problem, but like Justice Stevens, I don't see what


is essentially unique in the probative process to acclaim


that it was a computer generation rather than a claim that


the kid shown was over 18.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I'm not sure it's absolutely


unique but I do think age is uniquely subject to


verification.  And if I could get to the second reason


that this Court pointed out in Ferber why you didn't need


to have a limitation just to pictures generated in the


State of New York, the Court recognized in footnote 19


that those materials, even if produced outside the State


of New York, pose harms and potential risk to children


inside the State of New York.


QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, may I ask you a question


again relating to the affirmative defenses or youthful


adult pornography.  There appears to be no affirmative


defense for possession of something that in fact used


adults, is that right?


MR. CLEMENT:  That's right as a matter of the


statute.  There's no express affirmative defense for


possession.


QUESTION:  Well, let's relate that to something

that perhaps a number of people in this courtroom have


seen.  The film, Traffic, which depicts I guess someone


who purports to be under 18 engaged in conduct that would


fit under the definition of the statute to be banned,


right.


MR. CLEMENT:  I believe that's true.


QUESTION:  Did you see it?


MR. CLEMENT:  I did see it.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Okay.  So presumably it would be


covered.  Now, there is no defense to someone who rents


the movie, they possess it, no affirmative defense.


MR. CLEMENT:  There's no affirmative defense for


possession but I think what the statute does is it


effectively makes it so that in virtually, in the vast


majority of cases where the producers and distributors of


a film will be able to claim the affirmative defense, the


individual possessor will be able to claim the affirmative


defense because of a failure of the government's ability


to prove scienter, because if you think about the


affirmative defense it gives people the ability to


distribute a movie if it involves actors.  But if they


have the right to distribute a movie that nobody can


lawfully possess, it doesn't give them much, that's not


much comfort to them.

 QUESTION:  I don't understand.  I mean I buy at


the video store three films, Traffic, Lolita, and Titanic. 


Each film has a scene of simulated sexual behavior by


17-year-olds, all right?  I think that was the question. 


The question is, why am I not guilty under your


interpretation of the statute of a federal crime for


possessing those three films?


MR. CLEMENT:  There's two reasons.  One is


precisely in order to deal with this anomaly that they


don't want to be producing a film that nobody can lawfully


possess, the affirmative defense gives an incentive to


producers and distributors to make it clear in the


marketing of the material that those scenes that you're


talking about were scenes that were produced using adults


or scenes used with body doubles, and so in that sense


through the marketing of the material they can make it


clear to people that it involved adults.


QUESTION:  There is the defense for the


producer, but there isn't for the person who rents the


film.  It's just I --


MR. CLEMENT:  Exactly.


QUESTION:  -- I'm struck by what we're supposed


to do with a statute like this.


MR. CLEMENT:  There is a requirement, though,


that the government prove scienter with respect to age in

any prosecution for possession and I don't see how the


government could prove scienter as to age in the case of


these films where they're marketed in a way where it's


clear that they involve adult actors.


There's a second aspect in which this Court


could find the affirmative defense to cover individuals


and that -- individual possessors, and that is the statute


does give an affirmative defense for receipt and as the


government argued in its briefs that naturally would cover


possession incident to receipt.


What it doesn't cover, though, and why I think


Congress didn't have a blanket affirmative defense for


possession is it doesn't apply to somebody who receives


some material that's marketed in a way or has a disclaimer


that makes it clear that it involves adult actors, but


then the individual somehow modifies it, strips out the


disclaimer.  In that case, the possession is covered by


the statute and I think rightly so.


QUESTION:  Does it trouble you at all that the


statute would prohibit a motion picture company from


employing an 18-year-old actress to play the three roles


that Justice Breyer identified?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, it would trouble me if the


statute had that effect but it doesn't have that effect. 


The affirmative defense makes it crystal clear.

 QUESTION:  Even though the actress is under the


statutory age, 18?


MR. CLEMENT:  Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said


18.


QUESTION:  Would it trouble you that the statute


would prohibit an 18-year-old who is a child under the


statute from performing those three roles?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think it's 17, but in any


event it doesn't trouble me if it's a 17-year-old is


prohibited because they wouldn't be prohibited from


playing those roles if -- the studio would have two


options.  They could either not include the sexually


explicit conduct which is all that's covered by the


statute, and I think it would be possible to have made the


film Traffic without involving simulated sexual activity.


But putting that to the side, the other option


is to use a body double and make it clear in the marketing


of the film that that's precisely what you've done.


QUESTION:  I take it your answer to the question


if this afternoon I go out, go to the video store, buy the


three films and bring them home is, yes, I am guilty of a


federal crime.


MR. CLEMENT:  Not at all.  You could not be


guilty because the government could not prove scienter and


because you would have lawful --

 QUESTION:  What do you mean you can't prove


scienter?  It says that it is a crime to buy, to possess a


film that has simulated sexual activity by persons who


appear to be under the age of 18. Well, I would tell you


right now, I think that film did contain simulated sexual


activity by persons who appeared to be under the age of


18.


MR. CLEMENT:  And again --


QUESTION:  I don't think it was real activity, I


think it was simulated, and I think they did appear to me


to be under the age of 18.  So am I guilty or not?


MR. CLEMENT:  You are not guilty for the two


reasons that I've said and let me just say that you would


have the same problem with respect to the statute at issue


in Ferber.


QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, I'm not sure what


simulated sexual activity consists of.  I didn't see any


of these movies.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  They were pretty good actually.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  One described in the briefs


supposedly was the shot of a juvenile, whether played by a


juvenile or not, from the waist up supposedly engaged in


sexual activity.  Would you consider that to be covered by

the statute as sexually explicit conduct?  I mean what if


it was just the hand?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, certainly if it was just the


hand and certainly -- I think there would be certainly a


number of ways --


QUESTION:  Don't you think, I mean the


definition of sexually explicit conduct is and what the


statute prohibits is this conduct by minors under 17 or


younger, sexual intercourse, engaging in sexual


intercourse, bestiality, masturbation, sadistic or


masochistic abuse or lascivious exhibition of the genitals


or pubic area.  Now, the government has not made the


argument that at least as applied to juveniles this is


unprotected speech anyway and consists of obscenity which


a state or federal government is free, if it wishes, to


prohibit?


MR. CLEMENT:  To the contrary, the government


has argued throughout this case that it's all unprotected


speech because it's child pornography.  And I think 


--

QUESTION:  Not because it's obscenity, you're


creating, you would have us create yet another category of


prohibitive, something that falls totally outside the


first amendment.  Have you claimed, as Justice Scalia


suggested you might have, that at least some of this


material is obscene and therefore covered without regard

to any new, any child pornography catalog -- category.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I want to be clear, I think


government would take the position that virtually all the


material covered by this statute is independently obscene,


but that's not how the government chose to regulate it.


QUESTION:  If the scene of a head of a person


who the other information in the movie makes it appear


they're engaged in sexual intercourse and all that is seen


is the head of a male and a female kissing one another,


that would come covered by the statute.


MR. CLEMENT:  No, I don't think that would be


covered by the statute.


QUESTION:  Why not?  It's simulated sexual


intercourse.


MR. CLEMENT:  I think you have to read the term


simulated sexual intercourse in conjunction with the other


terms in the statute.


QUESTION:  It expressly says there's no patently


offensive requirement.


MR. CLEMENT:  That's certainly true but I think


if you read the statute in context, I think there's some


requirement that the sexual intercourse that would be


depicted would require some display of nudity in the


process.  Certainly -- well, it doesn't -- it may not say


that and the statute itself may not address that case.

And I would suggest that the proper way to resolve that


case is in an as applied challenge.  Wait for the


government to bring that prosecution.  In fact, I think


the government won't bring that prosecution.  I mean, it's


interesting to talk about the film version of Lolita and


the like but that involves just a tiny fraction of


materials covered by this statute, and if you want to bet


--

QUESTION:  Ferber pretty much said that child


pornography is of almost no value, did it not?


MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely, and that's why this


material that we're talking about is all probably


virtually, the government could capture it as obscenity


but of course if it tried to do that it couldn't ban the


possession, and child pornography was treated as a


different case in Ferber.


QUESTION:  Child pornography is a different case


but very much like obscenity.


MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely, like obscenity, what


this Court said in Ferber is the reason the statute was


permissible is because it defined a category of conduct


that could be proscribed and was outside the protection of


the First Amendment.


QUESTION:  There's a vast difference between an


actual child who was violated and a picture, a simulation

in Ferber that you have relied on so heavily, what do you


make of a sentence that is not in the footnote, it is the


text, that simulation outside the prohibition and the


prohibition was using an actual child, simulation outside


the prohibition could provide an alternative?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, let me just clarify one


thing because the statute in Ferber itself also covered


simulated sexual activity so all these line drawing


problems about what, you know, at what point does the


scene in Traffic come under the coverage of the statute


also applied in Ferber because it also captured simulated


acts involving adults.  So the only difference between the


coverage of this statute and Ferber is that this statute


does attempt to prohibit materials that do not involve


actual individuals but are virtually indistinguishable


from --


QUESTION:  Yes, but even that sentence in Ferber


said we're not touching in this case, here we have an


actual child simulation outside that prohibition could


provide an alternative.


MR. CLEMENT:  With respect, I don't think that's


what Ferber meant to say.  I mean, Ferber, after all, was


decided in 1982.


QUESTION:  It used those words.  It used those


words.

 MR. CLEMENT:  It did, but it was decided in 1982


before this technology even existed.  And interestingly,


if you look at footnote 20 in the Ferber opinion the Court


went out of its way to invoke the general doctrine that


you don't apply cases before they arise and you don't


adopt a rationale any broader than necessary to decide the


case before it.  And it just seems to me --


QUESTION:  What if we read that sentence as


though it were not there?


MR. CLEMENT:  No I think you read it in the


context --


QUESTION:  Not in the opinion.


MR. CLEMENT:  -- with respect, I think you treat


it in the context of what was prohibited by the New York


statute and the technology that was available at the time. 


And I think what's important here is any avenues for


speech that were left open in Ferber are left open by the


statute in conjunction with the affirmative defense.  The


only materials that are covered by the statute and not


covered by Ferber are materials that didn't exist at the


time of Ferber and it seems to me that Congress is


entitled to update the tech -- the pornography and


obscenity laws to deal with technological developments.


The first federal obscenity statute in 1842


didn't cover photographs because the technology wasn't in

widespread use at the time.  Subsequently Congress added


photographs to the cover to the obscenity statutes because


technology developed and new problems arose.


QUESTION:  The Court relied very heavily on the


notion that if you use actual children they are harmed,


they are actually harmed, so what is the primary reliance


that you make for applying the same prohibition to these


video images?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well I think there's -- I would


make two responses.  First, I think this Court has never


strictly limited itself to the protection of the child


depicted in the image and it recognizes that legislatures


in Congress have an interest in protecting all children


but secondly --


QUESTION:  It did seem to me that the Court, and


I was here, played heavy reliance on harm to children.


MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  Actual children.  So I'm asking you


what is your primary reliance when you don't have that?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I don't know that we have to


answer that question in this case because we do have that,


because this statute enables the government to continue to


prosecute effectively cases involving traditional forms of


child pornography, because the advent --


QUESTION:  But that's not an answer to Justice

O'Connor's question.  Basically we're talking here about


overbreadth and the government's argument seems to be that


since there is a class of materials that we can proscribe,


the fact that it's overly broad is the respondent's


problem.  But the law works the other way around, you have


to show that this statute is precise as to its coverage


and that it covers no more and let's just for argument's


sake, although I don't think that's the law, concede not


substantially more than what can be prohibited.  And


Justice O'Connor's question was directed to this latter


problem and it seems to me you're not answering the


question.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I'm trying to and I think


that, I mean, first of all, even in an overbreadth


challenge the burden does lie on the party challenging the


statute and they have to show things from actual fact in


order to challenge the statute and I don't think they've


carried that burden.


Second, this statute is responsive to the


problem of protecting both the children depicted in the


image and all children who can be seduced or enticed into


this kind of activity can be depicted themselves.


QUESTION:  But the gravamen of her question,


Justice O'Connor can explain her own question, but as I


understood it, is that there's a substantial area here

where adults who are play acting roles of children are


covered, and the question is what is the government's


interest in that?


MR. CLEMENT:  There isn't an interest in those


play acting cases and that's why the affirmative defense


allows those to take place.  But again, the question is as


you indicated substantial overbreadth and these questions


we're talking about, about Traffic and the film version of


Lolita really are a tiny fraction of the cases covered by


the statute.


QUESTION:  Why is it that the question I really


would like you to get to if you can is one that's really


bothering me very much is the question that Justice Scalia


asked and the thing in this area I do not understand, in


the entire area is why doesn't Miller work?  There is


obviously a set of materials which Justice Stewart used to


refer to as I know it when I see it and that material does


not have at its object communication.  It has at its


object a certain activity which is not communication.  Now


that's all over our society, and why, given this Court's


decision in Miller, is that so?  And if I knew the answer


to that question I would be better able to deal with this


kind of case.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, let me first try to say two


reasons why I don't think Miller is directly relevant and


22

if those aren't responsive to your questions, maybe --


QUESTION:  I'd rather not hear why it's directly


-- not directly relevant because my question, which is my


own problem, not your problem, is I'm trying to understand


the area.  There are several cases in this area coming up,


this is not the only one, and I want to know from the


government why it is, you've read in this area, maybe you


just should direct me to an article.  The problem I


personally am having as a judge is I think what Justice


Scalia was driving at, maybe, that's his question, is why


doesn't Miller work.  Now maybe you'll tell me that it


does, but that's contrary  to my experience because it


seems to me I see much material that would have flunked


Justice Stewart's test all over the place.  And it seems


to me that that's the material that parents are worried


about their children getting a hold of.


Now, if I knew why Miller was insufficient to


deal with that problem I would know better how to deal


with this kind of a case.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, one reason that Miller is a


difficult case and doesn't -- isn't terribly satisfying is


it requires a case by case adjudication of that


three-prong test which I would say with deference is not


self-defining.  And what Congress decided to do in this


context is follow the lead of Ferber where it said that

Miller wasn't the test of child pornography and defined a


much clearer class of material that whether or not it


applies in Miller, whether or not the work as a whole is


implicated, this is a definable class of material that is


outside the protection of the First Amendment.


If you have concerns about the Miller test then


you really should seize upon this statute and Ferber and


the analysis in Osborne as one way to deal with that


problem because here's a test that doesn't rely on


community standards or other difficult considerations to


apply in practice.  It has a test that says when we're


talking about visual depictions only, we're not talking


about novels here, and we're talking about material that


depicts children engaged in sexually explicit conduct then


we don't have to look to the value of the work as a whole. 


You can put all the Shakespeare around these visual


depictions you'd like and they're still visual depictions


of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.


QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, before you finish


there's something of great concern to me too because it


seems that this is a big step away from actual child,


injury to an actual child to the effect on the viewer and


the same thing could be said for women with respect to


pornography, portraying women in a degrading way.  The


same thing could be said for hate speech.  So this, where

there is no actual child victim, where it's a picture and


you're talking about the effect of that on the viewer, why


isn't it the same for all these other things that can have


a very bad effect on the viewer?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think there are two


principal reasons why you shouldn't be worried about that


particular slippery slope.  One is this Court already put


one foot down that slope in Osborne when it relied on the


seduction rationale in conjunction with the concern for


the children who were depicted. And in the same way this


statute responds both to harm, potential harm, to other


children in the seduction rationale and to children


actually depicted because as a matter of practical reality


it's become very difficult for the government to prosecute


cases involving actual, traditional child pornography.


QUESTION:  If you have this out you can use


simulated children, that will protect the actual children


from being exploited.  Why can't you say one as much as


the other?


MR. CLEMENT:  Because I think, as I indicated


before, there are real verifiability problems that don't


arise in the context of age that do arise in computer.


The second reason, though, I think that you have


to be less worried about the slippery slope in this


context is the government has consistently gone to the

courts and told them to interpret appears to be to cover


images that are virtually indistinguishable from


traditional child pornography. It doesn't seem to put this


Court on a slippery slope to say that material that is


virtually indistinguishable from material that's already


been held to be outside the protection of the First


Amendment also will be outside the protection of the First


Amendment.


QUESTION:  Are you asking us to read that phrase


into the statute, the virtually indistinguishable phrase?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, the virtually


indistinguishable phrase already appears in the text of


the statute, it just doesn't appear in the operative


provision.  So what we're asking you to do is to read that


term, appears to be, in light of the legislative finding,


where it's not just the legislative finding where it's


virtually indistinguishable.


QUESTION:  You're asking us to construe the


statute narrowly to apply only to things that are


virtually indistinguishable from actual behavior, it would


eliminate cartoons and that sort of stuff?


MR. CLEMENT:  That's absolutely right and that's


the position we've taken in all the lower courts.


QUESTION:  Even the language that says conveys


the impression, you want us to give the same meaning to

that?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I actually think that the


conveys the impression language could be given that


meaning but I think the conveys the impression language is


much less problematic from a constitutional standpoint if


you understand subsection D of the statute to be addressed


to pandering and in that context the concerns about


vagueness are much reduced because you're not going to be


focused on just the image, you're going to be focused on


the way it's marketed, and I think in that context it


won't be difficult to see whether or not it conveys the


image.  I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for


rebuttal.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well, Mr.


Clement.  Mr. Sirkin, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. LOUIS SIRKIN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. SIRKIN:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it please


the Court:  The petitioner's argument if adopted would


have three radical tragic consequences for First Amendment


jurisprudence.  First in the name of protecting children


all visual messages of adolescent sexuality will be


forever barred regardless of their scientific, artistic or


educational value.


Second, countless visual depictions --

 QUESTION:  Excuse me, such as what?  Such as


what?  You know, I try to think what great works of art


would be taken away from us if we were unable to show


minors copulating or any of the other acts set forth in


the definition here.  Can you give me a couple of


examples?


MR. SIRKIN:  Certainly, in the film area.


QUESTION:  Lolita?


MR. SIRKIN:  Lolita, Traffic.


QUESTION:  That would be a great -- leaving the


book, the movie Lolita, the book is perfectly okay, right? 


This only applies to the movie?


MR. SIRKIN:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  The great work of western art.


MR. SIRKIN:  It's gotten critical acclaim. The


movie Traffic, I think, won an Academy Award. There's the


movie Tin Drum.


QUESTION:  What else besides the movie Lolita


would we be deprived of in order to prevent little


children from being exploited?


MR. SIRKIN:  There's the movie Traffic, there's


the movie Tin Drum, there's a whole bunch of, you know,


there's the Brooke Shields movies that maybe some people


don't enjoy, but again it's there, the Blue Lagoon and the


series of movies such as that.

 QUESTION:  In respect, this is not, you know,


the Mona Lisa or Venus de Milo or anything that has lasted


more than 30 years.


MR. SIRKIN:  It could very well affect, I think,


painters because the statute -- excuse me.


QUESTION:  How about Romeo and Juliet?  It


interprets one scene there that way.


MR. SIRKIN:  It could, if the movie -- a movie


of Romeo and Juliet were made.


QUESTION:  Gee, you've seen a different version


of that play than I have.


(Laughter.)


MR. SIRKIN:  Well, it depends on how they wanted


to portray it.  I think they would have to be prevented


from showing or simulated sexual activity because if they


are in fact, you know, to be considered to be underage. 


And secondly, countless visual depictions of adult


sexuality will be prohibited where the adults depicted


appear to some unknown censor to be younger than 18.  And


third, it would open the door to banning other forms of


expression simply because the expression could be misused


and/or abused by a small segment of society.


QUESTION:  Very well, how should it be read? 


How would you write the statute so that it did take


Justice Stewart's material that flunks.

 MR. SIRKIN:  One is, I think, enforcement of the


obscenity laws would be one way.


QUESTION:  Apparently that doesn't work and


that's why I'm puzzled.  And where children, where you're


depicting children engaged in this activity, let's say


that flunks the Algerian seaman test or whatever it was he


used to have.


MR. SIRKIN:  Your honor, there's --


QUESTION:  How is Congress to write a statute in


the area of children that gets at that problem, which is a


problem?


MR. SIRKIN:  I believe that Title 18, section


2251 covers that problem.  In the past there have been


numerous prosecutions, I think, prior to the passages of


this Act.  In 1995 a member of the Department of Justice


testified before the Senate committee that heard evidence


about this statute and indicated that there had been a


conviction rate of over 97 percent in cases that had been


brought against people for the possession or dissemination


of material containing a depiction of a minor.


So that in fact has not been a problem in the


past and apparently in this all in umbrella statute where


they used any visual depiction, which in fact if you use


the terminology any visual depiction it's not just limited


to virtually indistinguishable --

 QUESTION:  You have no problem then with the


statute before it was amended.


MR. SIRKIN:  I have no problem, this is a new


statute, 2251 and 2252 did exist.


QUESTION:  What did it do?  How did it change


the law?


MR. SIRKIN:  It used the terminology, it created


a category of computer images that would be nonreal or


other pictures or images that are nonreal and that are


fictional characters into the act and it would be


prohibited if disseminated or possessed.


QUESTION:  So, well, whatever was going to be


threatened in the way of free expression and so forth


under the new act was simply computer images of things


that were already prohibited if done by real people?


MR. SIRKIN:  No it did not, it included, it said


any visual depiction, that would include that could be


considered cartoons, illustrations, drawings, paintings.


QUESTION:  If the statute is construed to be,


say, virtually indistinguishable then I think cartoons


would not be covered.


MR. SIRKIN:  But the problem is it would still


suffer from the vagueness because what would happen is


that in fact I had a computer image of a fictional


character I'd never have a defense because I could not

come forward and prove that that fictional character was


over 18.  So if someone believed --


QUESTION:  That seems way out at the fringes


somewhat.


MR. SIRKIN:  Well but that leaves it to the


discretion.  It may be that the current administration may


not enforce this language but down the road nobody knows


what will happen.


QUESTION:  You could cross that bridge when you


come to it then.


MR. SIRKIN:  Well, I believe when you begin to


talk about First Amendment rights to put it on to a case


by case basis I think you are abridging, you know, a


fundamental right and I think that in addition to that you


have the problem that if I get charged you're not just


being charged with a violation of an obscenity law, you're


being accused of being a child pornographer and that does


have some connotation and that has some ill effects just


from the fact of being charged.  And I would have no


defense.


QUESTION:  Well, does it cover things beyond


obscene speech?


MR. SIRKIN:  Well --


QUESTION:  In your view.


MR. SIRKIN:  In this it does, it would cover,

you know, the morphing situation --


QUESTION:  Excuse me?


MR. SIRKIN:  I'm using the term morphing where


you use an identifiable and you can merge it in on the


computer to, you know, into similar --


QUESTION:  Images of obscenity.


MR. SIRKIN:  That's correct, or of a sexual act


--

QUESTION:  That is the expansion, is covering


images of obscenity.


MR. SIRKIN:  Well, it would be images, it would


be copying images of obscenity with an identifiable


individual or in sexual conduct and that is harm to a real


child because that person is an identifiable child and


that becomes a permanent record.


QUESTION:  But does it cover depictions of


something more than obscenity?


MR. SIRKIN:  Well, when you use the terminology


simulated sexual activity it would, you know, it depends,


I guess that goes community to community.  But what you


have is like in the movie Trafficking where you have a


young lady under a cover with a man on top of her, you


only see their heads but, you know, the simulated means


the appearance of, and that in fact does give the


appearance and, you know, in that situation it is a

representation in the movie that that person is under the


age of 18 --


QUESTION:  Don't you think the statute can


reasonably be read giving the definition of the activities


covered not to cover two people under a bed with no


depiction of sexual organs or anything else.


MR. SIRKIN:  The problem is, is that the statute


uses the term actual sexual activity and/or simulated, and


again 


--

QUESTION:  It depends on what you mean by sexual


activity.  If it's just a depiction without any indication


of the sexual organs it's certainly reasonable to say that


that isn't covered.


MR. SIRKIN:  But that's not what the statute


says, though.


QUESTION:  Well, the statute does say explicit. 


Doesn't that cover what Justice Scalia --


MR. SIRKIN:  No it doesn't, because it says


explicit sexual conduct, actual or simulated and I guess


it depends on how you read that word simulated.


QUESTION:  You say explicit.  What work does the


term explicit do?


MR. SIRKIN:  It means clearly and again clearly


would mean to me that if it appears that they're under the


blanket and that's what they're doing I think it's a

reasonable inference to be made and I think that it would


cover that as simulated activity.


QUESTION:  But explicit certainly can mean


something different than clearly.


MR. SIRKIN:  It can, but it's not defined in the


statute.  They could have gotten rid of the word


simulated.


QUESTION:  Then maybe the courts will define it


so that it wouldn't cover the kind of thing you're talking


about.


QUESTION:  It is defined in the statute,


sexually explicit conduct that was in quotes means actual


or simulated sexual intercourse.


MR. SIRKIN:  And some other things, and it uses


masturbation and --


QUESTION:  It includes sexual intercourse, it


seems to me it's sexual intercourse whether you see the


entire body or only part of it.


MR. SIRKIN:  I agree with Your Honor that it


would be simulated if they're under the blanket and you


see the heads.


QUESTION:  I think the question is whether you


could, a court could say well, to keep this within


constitutional bounds we will read into the statute this


broad requirement that there be an actual showing of

sexual organs.


MR. SIRKIN:  You know, legislatures write


statutes, I think the courts interpret them and I think to


construe it you'd be basically rewriting the statute if


you did that, if you eliminated that terminology and I


don't think the government has urged that.


QUESTION:  Am I not correct in remembering that


one of the amendments to this series of statutes by


Congress specifically eliminated the requirement of


patently offensive and the like?


MR. SIRKIN:  They've done that in the child


pornography area a long time ago.  They did that in Ferber


when they said that it, just if it merely is children


involved in sexual activity it's a violation of the law


and it's not subject to the three-prong test of Miller and


the patently offensive is a part of the Miller test.


QUESTION:  Do you have any examples of the use


of computer generated images covered by this statute where


it has serious literary or educational value or scientific


value?


MR. SIRKIN:  Well --


QUESTION:  Do we have examples of that?


MR. SIRKIN:  Today I don't know that we have


examples today of that.  I mean, I would think that if we


convert the videos and the films that are being made today

into DVD, those are, that's a computer, digital computer


--

QUESTION:  Because your concern is with the


expansion to these images of things that are already


prohibited and yet I don't think we have examples of any


serious use of them in --


MR. SIRKIN:  Well, if I --


QUESTION:  -- areas which would be of concern. 


The examples that we've talked about today and that I


think you've identified seem to be of films using youthful


adults.


MR. SIRKIN:  Well, that would be correct but I


think it's not, you know, too in the distant future that


we will be making films that will be virtual reality.


QUESTION:  But they're their strongest argument


is -- I mean, I thought their argument is you're right,


those things you're talking about are not covered. 


They're not covered today because everybody knows they're


not really under the age of 18, the actors.  And tomorrow


if we have a new system we'll worry about it tomorrow on a


case by case basis.  Maybe all they'd have to do is put on


the top these are not real, I don't know what they'd have


to do, but they're so few and far between that we


shouldn't strike the statute down on its face.


Now that's why I think people are asking you for

particular examples because if you have to make up an


imaginary example that doesn't really exist then maybe the


correct thing to do is say the statute shouldn't be struck


down on its face and we'll proceed case by case as a


reasonable literary or scientific virtue to a particular


thing.  Of course the person can't be convicted.  Now


that's case by case.  I'm putting what I take it is their


argument here.


MR. SIRKIN:  But the problem with that is it


creates a chilling effect because who's going to take the


chance?  I mean that's it, if the government says if it's


close to the line I think the petitioners have indicated


in their brief that if it's close to the line then just


don't do it, you know, don't publish it, don't make it,


and that's censorship.


QUESTION:  What about the other argument which


is look, we're trying to protect the real children who are


the subjects of the film and the reason we need this to


protect them is because there is no way for any expert or


anyone else to say when they see a film whether this is a


film of a real person or whether it is a fake film made


through virtual technology.  The experts just can't tell


us.


MR. SIRKIN:  Well, I think that becomes, you


know, an excuse.

 QUESTION:  Is it true?


MR. SIRKIN:  It is not true.


QUESTION:  All right.  You think it is not true,


they think it is true.  Is there somewhere in the record I


could look or some place I could find out as to what


experts think?


MR. SIRKIN:  Yes, because I think you can look


at the Senate hearing report where it's indicated that in


1995 in relation to cases that were brought there was a


conviction rate of 97.6 percent. In addition to that, that


since the enactment of this law the government has not


lost a case and it was raised in the Kimbrough case and it


was raised in the Fox case, they were able to get a


conviction.


QUESTION:  You say the congressional finding is


wrong then because the statute begins with, among other


findings, new photographic and computer imaging


technologies make it possible to produce by electronic,


mechanical or other means visual depictions of what appear


to be children engaging in sexually explicit conduct that


are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer


from unretouched photographic images.  You say that that


congressional finding is wrong?


MR. SIRKIN:  That congressional finding, I don't


think it was empirically, there was no empirical evidence

that was really shown to Congress that that is correct,


that the computer, and I believe, and I think it's clear


--

QUESTION:  So you have both your opponent and


the Congress who think you're wrong on this point.


MR. SIRKIN:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Okay.  But your point still is, I


take it is, even if in fact the Congress is correct on


that, there's no evidence that cases are being lost


because of this virtual indistinguishability problem,


cases involving real children.


MR. SIRKIN:  That's correct.  And I believe if


you want to make it easier for the government to make


convictions I think that we could get rid of the Bill of


Rights and it would be much easier for the government then


to get convictions.


QUESTION:  Mr. Clement gave an example of


another case in which the government did obtain a


conviction but only because of the new statute in which


the government witness was unable to say.


MR. SIRKIN:  That was that government witness. 


That doesn't mean that there are not witnesses out there


and experts that can make that distinction that if, you


know, there clearly would be, pardon?


QUESTION:  This was just a bad government

witness, you say?


MR. SIRKIN:  It could have been.  I didn't hear


the testimony in that case but they did in fact get a


conviction in that case.  But I think it's equally as


dangerous to create a barrier to First Amendment.


QUESTION:  Wouldn't have gotten a conviction if


the law had been what you want it to be, isn't that right?


MR. SIRKIN:  We don't know they wouldn't have


gotten a conviction with that -- the testimony in that


case was that the expert indicated that he was not sure


and could not positively say whether it was real or not


real.


QUESTION:  And on that basis can you find beyond


a reasonable doubt that it was a depiction of an actual


minor.


MR. SIRKIN:  It creates an inference and a jury


can draw inferences from the evidence.


QUESTION:  Suppose the law put the burden on


you, on the defendant to show that this depiction does not


use an actual child.  The defendant, because of this proof


problem, is not brought out, the confusion is it a real


child, is it a simulation. Suppose it were made the


defendant's burden to show that no actual child was used


in this picture, would you have a constitutional objection


to that?

 MR. SIRKIN:  Yes, I would.  And the reason being


is that at least in the possession area that is not an


affirmative defense because all it has to be in the


affirmative defense, there is no, the element of age, of


being able to come forward and show that it's not a real


child or that it's underage is not available --


QUESTION:  Okay, let's assume that that too was


fixed.  Those two features, Justice Ginsburg's and the


inclusion of the possession is subject to the defense,


would the statute then be constitutional?


MR. SIRKIN: I, the possessor though, you'd be


switching the burden of proof then I believe and I think


that would be an unconstitutional shifting of the burden.


QUESTION:  Well, you'd be making, you be -- are


you saying that the affirmative defense therefore is, in


effect, has got to be constitutionally relevant across the


board?


MR. SIRKIN:  I believe that it is.  I think the


affirmative defense that's in this statute is


unconstitutional.


QUESTION:  So there's no way to tailor it by


affirmative defense in effect is your argument.


MR. SIRKIN:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  And how would that affirmative


defense prevent some of the evils that the government is

trying to prevent, for example the seduction of minors to


sexual conduct by showing things that appear to be minors? 


How would this, affirm -- the existence of this


affirmative defense still enable the government to do


that?


MR. SIRKIN:  There are currently, there are


currently lots of laws that deal with anyone who attempts


to entice a child and I believe that those laws could be


enforced and I believe that the penalties could be


increased and that could be a deterrent effect on that. 


We're talking about the use of this material potentially


by a very small segment of the population and I think it


affects --


QUESTION:  Well, you could say the same thing


about a murder statute, you know, you don't expect a whole


lot of people to go out and commit murders but that


doesn't mean Congress can't legislate against it.


MR. SIRKIN:  But here you can't legislate that


if it's not, if it's a virtual murder and there has been


no murder, you don't go out and arrest people.  Here if


you use a virtual, a fictional character you can go out


and arrest people.


QUESTION:  Well, if you want to talk about a


very small portion of the population I would think there's


a very small portion of the population that wants either

to produce or to watch adolescents and children engaging


in sexual conduct of the sort described in this statute. 


You're dealing with a small portion of the population to


begin with.


MR. SIRKIN:  But if you use the principle that's


involved here then I do believe you begin the slippery


slope.  You go from the idea you can use this and expand


it, you can use it, you know, that if you have depictions


such as, you know, the movie the Godfather, the movie Pulp


Fiction which are cult, you know, movies that are


attractive to children, someone could come out and say,


hey, look, join my gang, look how much fun it can be if we


go out and become extremely violent.


QUESTION:  What's worrying me about what you're


saying now is that if their factual hypothesis is true,


which I tend to doubt, but I'm not an expert, that there


is no technical way to distinguish between a photograph of


a real child and an imaginary child, if it were true,


there is no expert who could tell you the difference and


you tell me I can not have an affirmative defense, then


the government cannot prosecute real child pornography.


MR. SIRKIN:  I think they can --


QUESTION:  Because there would be no way to


prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was a real child. 


So if you deny the government the possibility of the

affirmative defense weapon you are denying them the


possibility of prosecuting real child pornography.


MR. SIRKIN:  That's not correct because they've


been able to get convictions and they've gone forward and


they've gotten convictions.


QUESTION:  Well, presumably people think that it


is possible to distinguish between the real child and the


virtual fake.


MR. SIRKIN:  But I don't believe, you know, at


least currently they've not lost any of the cases and


there's only been the one where someone has raised the


issue and that expert had indicated that they weren't


sure.


QUESTION:  I think what you're doing is in


effect varying the question, you're saying, look, in the


real world it doesn't happen, they can tell.  But if you


assume the hypothesis that Justice Breyer started with,


the factual hypothesis that if these are well enough made


you can't tell the difference, then doesn't it follow that


if you rule out the affirmative defense route for the


government, the government simply won't be able to prove


the case in the instances in which real children are being


used.


MR. SIRKIN:  I'm going to go back and I'm not


begging the question, again, if I have, if there is

virtual murder that looks so real on the screen, I don't


go out and charge anyone with murder.


QUESTION:  Well, we can distinguish attraction


to other forms of socially damaging behavior from that


particular category of social -- socially damaging


behavior that has for hundreds of years been treated as


obscenity.  I don't think there's any risk of the Court


suddenly declaring that excessive violence constituted


obscenity.  We know what obscenity is.  There have been


laws against this particularly infectious kind of


solicitation to conduct for centuries.  I don't know why


you think we're going to suddenly flop over into


prohibiting the Godfather because that also portrays


socially undesirable conduct.


MR. SIRKIN:  If you take the logic that's behind


here about people, you're getting at the person who is


misusing the material and there certainly I think is, you


can't even do medical --


QUESTION:  Sexual material in a category called


obscenity which has traditionally for hundreds of years


been regulable by government.


MR. SIRKIN:  But the obscenity here we're making


just because it's a fictional character visually


participating in an activity that I can write about, we're


now saying you cannot express, that we're saying, we're

giving it a social status, and I think when we start to do


that then we start to eliminate, we can start eliminating


other areas equally.


I further believe that, you know, as I've


indicated, that the affirmative defense seems to be


inadequate.  It certainly does not cover the individual


possession and that individual is in a position where if


he has three images, if he gets a DVD movie and he takes,


and it has more than three images in it, he's now, you


know, can be prosecuted for possession of child


pornography.  And, again, with the definition, when you


put it together with the definition of simulated.


I think that it is not narrowly tailored, it is


overly broad because I think, again, it covers literary


material, it carries certainly for medical research, one


cannot, there is no bona fide exception here for medical,


scientific or educational or artistic merit, it's a


blanket across the board prohibition.  I believe the Court


clearly indicated in Ferber --


QUESTION:  But what if we accept the


government's limiting construction, the government is


urging that we use this, take the congressional finding,


read it into the text of the statute and then it would cut


out all the good things.


MR. SIRKIN:  I believe that the Court has

indicated in the past in Turner Broadcasting and in the


landmark communications case that it's not for the Court


to be rewriting statutes as they come out of Congress and


particularly in the area when it deals in areas of First


Amendment.  And I think that the Act, you know, and what


we're proposing here --


QUESTION:  Supposing that -- suppose we could


consult Congress, they would say yeah, preserve as much of


this as is constitutional.  We wanted to do a whole lot


but if the constitution only allows us to do a little we'd


rather have the Court say that than to throw out our


entire product.


MR. SIRKIN:  All we're asking is, is the Court


sever out two phrases and that is that is, is it appears


to be and that it, you know, and where it conveys the


impression that a minor is engaged in sexual activity.


QUESTION:  Well, in X-Citement Video we did


something not too different from this, reading in a


requirement that wasn't express in the statute.


MR. SIRKIN:  You did read in the elements of


knowingly and you have to do that.  Basically the


government is doing the same thing in this particular


statute because the knowingly appears in this statute


exactly as it appeared in the statute that was interpreted


by the Court in X-Citement Video.  It says knowingly in

relation to mailing or to transporting, it doesn't say

QUESTION:  But that's an example of a case where


there was a First Amendment challenge where we have read


something into a statute that we might not necessarily


have done.


it.


MR. SIRKIN:  The Court has the power to do that.


QUESTION:  And there's precedent for our doing


MR. SIRKIN:  Yes, in X-Citement Video the Court


did do that.  But we're urging here that the fact is that


the Ferber and Osborne were based upon the harm to real


children and we're now limiting something because of the


message.  We are socially making a determination here that


this is speech we don't like.


QUESTION:  Are you saying that if real children


are not used in the depiction of simulated sexual activity


that it cannot be barred unless it meets the Miller


standard?


MR. SIRKIN:  Yes.  It would mean --


QUESTION:  Eight year olds, ten year olds,


twelve year olds.


MR. SIRKIN:  They're fictional characters,


because I think they do have a valid use in medical


research.

 QUESTION:  Suppose you said -- suppose you said

MR. SIRKIN:  It would make it narrower.


QUESTION:  Would it be constitutional?


MR. SIRKIN:  Again, I'd have to see the whole


statute and, again, I think that it would depend on how it


works and whether it still had the problems with the


affirmative defense.


QUESTION:  Suppose you took -- I just want to


follow up on what Justice Kennedy said.  Suppose you took


Miller and said where you have clearly minors we as a


matter of law assume that it's patently offensive.


MR. SIRKIN:  That could be done.


QUESTION:  That could be done, you'd still have


the other two parts.


MR. SIRKIN:  Yes, and I think that most


communities would feel, I think that all communities would


feel that that is patently offensive.


QUESTION:  I wonder if Miller would work more


satisfactorily if you did that in the case of people who


clearly appear to be minors.


MR. SIRKIN:  I believe that it would.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you Mr. Sirkin,


Mr. Clement you have one minute remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.


Counsel for Respondent notes the 97 percent conviction


figure.  Well, that reflects a couple of things.  One, it


reflects that the 1996 Act has allowed us to prosecute


cases even where there is a reasonable doubt about whether


it is a virtual image or not.  The other thing that the 97


percent conviction rate reflects is that we are not out


there prosecuting people who pick up Traffic at the


Blockbuster.  It's no accident that the one court that


considered this case in a facial challenge struck the


statute down, but the four courts of appeals that


considered it in an as applied challenge upheld the


statute.


Those cases give you an illustration of what the


statute is really applied to.  The Mento case involved


over 100 images of prepubescent children.  The Acheson


case in the 11th Circuit 


--

QUESTION:  Is there any precedent that we judge


a free speech statute based on the kind of prosecutions


the government has been bringing?

 MR. CLEMENT:  There is precedent and the best


one I can think of is Ferber for waiting until as applied


challenges to deal with the fringe cases, the tiny


fraction cases.  And I think, as in Ferber, if you wait


for those cases to be brought you'll find that they are


not brought in these cases.


Another point I think worth emphasizing is that


I don't think given that this statute only covers explicit


sexual conduct that there'll be much medical research


involved.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Clement.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 10:58 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
