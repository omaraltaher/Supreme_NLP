 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I don't think it's 

irrelevant, Justice Kennedy.  I would have a different 
argument.  I think that I would stand first and foremost 
on this Court's decision in Cleveland, where it 
recognized that something like, I think the commitment, 

returned the verdict, which is at JA142, and it had 
marked that the attempt to extort was to extort the 
commitment, you might still maybe have some causation 
arguments, but I assume the property argument you're 
about to make is just irrelevant.

11  certainly the video poker license was at issue there, 
12  the Court also referenced an unissued patent. 
 And it recognized that there are things that 
13

Government, they don't have value, and therefore don't 
15
16  qualify as property.

19  which what they were taking was the commissions that 
20
21
22  might have been possible to say that what was obtained 
23  here was money, but I think if the Government had 
24  prosecuted it under that theory, it would have to prove 
25

that somehow the Government paid too much.  I don't 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could -- could the case 

would ultimately have been generated? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Kennedy, it

Alderson Reporting Company 

 And I would analogize it to the McNally 
case.  In the McNally case, you know, there was this 
scheme in which various sort of friends of government 
officials were getting the commissions from a workmen's 
compensation policy.  And what this Court said is, well, 
it would have been one thing if the Government had come 
in and said that the Government paid commissions that 
were too high, or the Government had received inferior 
quality insurance.

 But what the Government did there instead 
11
12  was sort of take the shortcut and plead that what had 
13  happened is, the Government had been deprived of its 
14  interest in having the honest services --
15
16  Petitioner wanted were the commissions, ultimately.  And 
17  you can't commit extortion in order to get -- and that's 
18  real money.  It's for the Government to answer, not you, 
19  but can -- do you have any idea why they didn't charge 
20
 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think the reason that 
21
22  they didn't charge that is probably practically twofold. 
23  One is that a commitment under New York law and practice 
24  is not quite as what it sounds, it's not really a 
25

commitment.  And the best evidence of that is with the 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, here, what the

last fund for this particular management company, they 
got a commitment from the State and there was no 
ultimate investment made. 

McNally, I think they would have had to prove that the 
management fees were somehow excessive or something like 
that, so they -- they didn't do that.  They focused on 

 So there's a subsequent step down the road. 
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I see.  I see. 
 MR. CLEMENT:  So I think that's part of it. 
 The other thing I would say is as in

12
13
14  your argument about intangible property. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Clement, just along the 
15
16  same lines.  What you're saying is that it still would 
17  not be extortion -- let's say somebody in your client's 
18  position runs an investment company, wants an 
19  investment, wants the fees that come along with that 
20
21  person who gets to decide whether to make that 
22  investment, and so to pay those fees, goes to that 
23  person, threatens that person with something terrible 
24  happening to him. 
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Clement --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I took you away from 

investment.  Goes to -- let's say that there's a single 

You're saying that that does not count as 

6

extortion, that there's a reason that the Government 
didn't charge it like that? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  I would say that that -- I 
would say a couple of things.  I would say that's a 
harder case than the one I have before you today.  I 
would say that I don't think that's actually extortion 
if what they charge is the commitment, not the money 
that goes -- that flows from the Government.  And then 
what I would say -- and the reason I would say that is 
because of Cleveland.

12  investment with -- and the fees that come with the 
13  investment.  So -- and that's why they're threatening 
14  the person. 
15
16  under McNally, in that kind of case, what the Government 
17  has to prove is that if they want to make the property 
18  the money interest that the Government is paying out and 
19  the person is obtaining, they have to show that there's 
some sort of excessive commission or excessive sort of 
20
21  management fee. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Even -- even though they 
22
23  wouldn't have gotten the investment and they wouldn't 
24  have gotten the fees absent the -- the threat of force 
25

MR. CLEMENT:  Right.  And I would say that 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, they want the 

or -- or violence? 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Again, that would be my 

 And the Government's theory was that just 

position.  And I think it would follow from this Court's 
decisions in cases like Cleveland and McNally because in 
McNally, of course, the people who were part of that 
fraudulent scheme, they were getting commissions from 
the workmen comp program. 

1

3 
4 
5
6

interfering with the Government's decision about who to 
8 
give the workmen -- where to place the workmen's comp 
9 
policies was enough of an interference to -- to support 
10
11  a fraud conviction.  And this Court said no.  And one of 
12  the things it then said is well, it would be different 
13  if -- if the Government went in and proved that the 
14  commissions that were paid were too high, or that the 
15
 But if all they're doing is saying that 
16
17  what's going on here is sort of the interest of the 
18  Government in having its employees serve them honestly 
19  and in their best interest, and not in some third 
20
21  honest services.  And nobody's saying that doing that's 
22  a good thing, but it's -- it's the traditional office of 
23  the State law crime of coercion.  It's --
24
25

party's best interest, that brings you squarely into 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's -- the coercion 

crime, at least under New York definition, requires 

Government somehow got inadequate insurance. 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. CLEMENT:  I don't believe that's 

correct, Justice Ginsburg. 

 This was charged by New York State 

authorities as coercion.  So the very crime that 

force.  And -- and here, it's a threat of exposure of an 
embarrassing fact. 

 So what -- am I right about that, that the 
coercion, which is not a Federal crime but is a State 
crime, requires a threat of force to restrict another's 
freedom?

5
6 
7
8 
9
10
11  Congress didn't incorporate into the Hobbs Act, the New 
12  York crime of coercion, was charged here, and it's my 
13  understanding that the New York crime of coercion, like 
14  the earlier version of coercion in the racketeer -- in 
the Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934, like the traditional 
15
16  model penal code definition of coercion -- it's the --
17  the threat part of it is the same as extortion. 
18
19  property.  And it's been interpreted certainly to 
include threats to disclose information like this. 
20
 So I think the real difference between the 
21
22  crime of extortion and the crime of coercion, both as a 
23  general matter and under New York law, is whether or not 
24  property is obtained.  And that's ultimately what's so 
25

problematic about the Government's definition here 

 So it covers a threat to a person or to 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

because their definition is essentially the property 
includes the autonomy interest of a business to operate 
free from coercion. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What is your definition 

of -- of property?  In your reply brief, you begin by 

saying that you're -- you are not arguing that the 

property has to be tangible and includes some forms of 

intangible property. 


1 
2 
3 
4
5
6

8 
 How would you draw the line? 

9
MR. CLEMENT:  I would say that for property 
10
11  to come within the terms of the Hobbs Act prohibition on 
12  obtaining property, it has to be alienable, 
13  transferable, moveable.  That's the critical thing.  So 
14  the distinction is not between alienable and 
15
16
17  rather, a patent is an intangible property right, but 
18  it's transferable, it's obtainable, it is sellable, and 
19  so it has the characteristics of things that I think 
20
21
22  the mob goes to a grocer and says, you know, you're dead 
23  or something if you sell Cheerios, and the reason is 
24  because they have a monopoly, some other grocer who's 
25

connected has a monopoly.  And they threaten him.  Now, 

come within the traditional definition. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What about -- what about 

inalienable. 

 A patent is an inalienable -- I mean, 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

does that violate Hobbs Act? 


Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now -- now, in fact, 

he's -- he's not going to sell Cheerios. 


MR. CLEMENT:  Right.  I -- I would say that 

 MR. CLEMENT:  I think --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What he did was -- and 


that hypothetical that you've given me would be 
coercion, it would not be extortion under the Hobbs Act. 

1 
2
3
4 
5
6 
7 
8
they're doing it to get money, and they do get money, 
9 
but via the means of the other grocer.  And there is 
10
11  nothing in the words of this Act that says that the 
12  property has to be taken from the individual whom you 
13  coerce. 
14
15
16  and so forth, with the person who has the money.  So 
17  what happens when, say, the mob coerces the person 
18  without the property so that he will do a thing such 
19  that the person with the property gives them the 
20
21
22  understand your hypothetical, where the relationship 
23  between the two parties, basically they are competitors, 
24  I would say that that's two distinct relationships. 
25

 It's easy to imagine situations where the 
coerced individual has a relationship, direct, special 

property? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  I think, at least as I 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now just make 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I think the answer to it 

it different.  What they do is they get the assistant 
bank employee and they threaten him to do such a thing 
such as shout at a certain time where they know that 
that shouting will lead them to be able to rob the bank. 
I mean, you know, it's easy to think up. 

 What I can't figure out here is, is there 
some requirement that the person who is coerced has to 
be the same person as the person who gives them the 
property.  If the answer to that's no, then none of the 
Government's chamber of horribles is horrible because

14  definitive that the --
15
16  anything on this.  You'd be making it up now, is that 
17  basically it? 
18
19  tell you is I think the assumption of most of the cases

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't that what the word 

"extort" means?  You extort something from someone?  It 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And you haven't found 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, what -- what I would 

is that the person that is the pressure of --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is the -- is the one? 
 MR. CLEMENT:  Is the person who's offering 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

means you get it from him, you don't get it from some 

third party. 


 MR. CLEMENT:  I think that's basically 


right, Justice Scalia.  What I would say, though, is I 

think there's an exception to the -- at least to the 
following extent, which I think it would be open to the 
Government, to basically say that within an entity, if 
you sort of put the pressure on one agent of the 
corporation and you actually get the money from another 
agent of the same corporation, that that's probably 

1 
2 
3
4 
5
6 
7 
8 
9 
10
11  close enough. 
 And so in this case, if the pressure was put 
12
13  on a particular individual and they obtained like actual 
14  cash from the Government, that might be a different 
15
16  commitment, which I think is analogous to the video 
17  poker license in the Cleveland case, so I don't think 
18  that's --
19
20
21  real property, right?  Then it wouldn't matter under 
22  that -- under what you just said, that the threat was 
23  made to the general counsel rather than to the final 
24  person who issued the money, isn't that right? 
25

case.  But, of course, here what they received was this 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if you think the 

commitment is real cash, is a real contract, real cash, 

MR. CLEMENT:  I -- I don't disagree with 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  But you wouldn't 

say, well, we're dealing with an organization, so it's 
only extortion if you threaten the person who writes the 
check? 

that, Justice Kagan, but I think that's because they're 
all sort of agents to the same principal.  And I'm not 
sure you get all the way to what Justice Breyer was 
suggesting, which you can sort of run it through 
competitors or something like that.

MR. CLEMENT:  No.  I --
10
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  If you threaten the person 
11
12  who makes a recommendation to the person who writes the 
13  check, that's good enough. 
14
15
16  there are real jury findings, and as Justice Kennedy 
17  alluded to, there were a variety of theories of property 
18  put in front of the jury.  They were invited to circle 
19  as many of them as they could, as many as they found 
20
21  recommendation. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Clement, what is --
22
23  I'm sort of trying to figure out why you're trying to 
24  get the word "property" to do the work of the "obtain" 
25

 MR. CLEMENT:  Exactly, Your Honor.  But what 

I would also say is, you know, this is a real case and 

satisfied, and the only one they circled was the 

part of the statute because when you answered 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 So what you're using in my mind, and not 

illogically, is to say that the second part of the 
statute has to do some work, so it has to mean that 
you're taking something of value away from someone else. 
That makes logical sense to me.  And I understand the 

Justice Alito you were using the terms of "obtain" to 
define property, which is in my mind a sort of strange 
way to do things, okay?  Property generally means value 
of some sort and you don't use any of those words in 
your definition.

11  second piece of your argument, which is the 
12  recommendation -- not the recommendation, but his honest 
13  services were -- wasn't being given to your client, it 
14  was being given to the employer. 
15
16  himself.  He didn't get anything transferred to him. 
17  And that -- that argument makes eminent sense to me. 
18  And I tease it out of your brief, but I don't know why 
19  you're trying to get our definition of "property" to do 
20
21
22
23  the "obtain" part? 
24
25

 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Sotomayor, I'm happy 
to have you rule in favor of my client on "obtained" or 

So your client obtained nothing of value for 

that work. 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why isn't the work in 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And you contrast that with, say, the Clayton 

Act that talks about disjunctively property and -- or 

"property" and, as Scheidler II demonstrates, those 
terms are really kind of married together.  And I guess 
the reason I sort of think that the "obtained" and the 
"property" should be construed together is twofold. 
One, structurally that's what the statute does.  So when 
you're talking about, in a statute, property that can be 
obtained, I think that's a clue that you're not talking 
about property in its broadest manifestation. 

1 
2 
3 
4 
5
6 
7 
8 
9
10
11  property rights, and there you have a clue that Congress 
12  means a very broad conception.  When it's talking about 
13  it in conjunction with "obtained," I think it has a 
14  narrower ambit in mind. 
15
16  definition that property is anything of value. 
17
18
19  assume because it -- as I said, that seems to have some 
sort of conceptual appeal.  Then make the argument for 
20
21  me. 
22
23
24  for me why this isn't an obtaining. 
25

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then make your argument 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So take the Government's 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Right. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  And let's 

MR. CLEMENT:  Well, what I would say is 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

obtaining, as this Court made clear in Scheidler II, is 
not some metaphysical obtaining.  I mean, the argument 
was made to this Court that the abortion protesters 
obtained the autonomy interest of the business in -- the 
clinics, in deciding whether -- who to serve and when to 
serve and when to be open and when to be closed. 
 And this Court said no, and it said 

1 
2 
3 
4 
5
6 
7
principally that that's not obtaining, but it's -- but 
8 
it also noted, I guess you'd call it dictum, that 
9 
what -- what -- obviously, what the Hobbs Act, based on 
10
11  its common law roots in extortion, is talking about is 
12  the kind of property that can be deprived, it can then 
13  be transferred, sold, exercised. 
14
15
16  roots here are also where you see the definition of 
17  property can't be as broad as the Government suggests. 
18  Because extortion is one of the classic common law 
19  property crimes.  The definition of property, for 
purposes of extortion, ought to be the same as the 
20
21  definition of property for larceny, embezzlement, 
22  burglary. 
23
24  their honest services or their autonomy interests.  So 
the kind of property you can obtain for purposes of the 
25

 And I do think.  Just to get the second part 
of my answer out if I could, it's just -- the common law 

 You can't go into somebody's house and steal 

17

Hobbs Act is that same kind of alienable, transferable, 
moveable property.

the Cleveland case, if there was a corrupt official who

17  the sly, I don't think that would change the result there.

19  not have value in the hands of the government.  The fact

here. 

 This is not a client who's trying to get --

like, you know, they wanted an opinion on how to 

incorporate in the State of New York and they thought, 

well, the lawyers are kind of expensive in the private

some voting rights that are transferable in that sense. 

I mean, if you have a stock -- a proxy in a stock, or 

something like that, that may well come within the 
definition.  But when you have these essentially voting 
or autonomy interests that are really -- you know, 
they're -- they're sort of inherently inalienable 
because this recommendation matters because it's the

government's internal deliberative process, that really 
belongs to the general counsel, and he can't --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, just let me make 

sure that I understand your position.  Suppose roughly 
these facts, the general counsel is threatened with 
something very serious, let's say violence, unless he 
makes a favorable recommendation.  He does.  They act on 
that recommendation, it's -- it's a substantial cause in 
making the investment, and the investment is made and

 MR. CLEMENT:  I would say no, but I would 
12
13  say it's a much more difficult case.  And the reason I 
14  would say no is because the Government -- or I'd say 
15
16  has to prove something more, which is that it's an 
17  investment where there either was not the optimal 
18  investment or they paid too high a commission.  And --
19  and I take that from McNally. 
20

22  property. 
23
24  is simply that if the Government --

potentially no.  I would still say that the Government

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It has to be more property,

 MR. CLEMENT:  I think that's right.  If 

what's obtained is money, and that's what the Government 
focuses its prosecution on, then that is -- that 

MR. CLEMENT:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so then we just have a 

point in my hypothetical, if the recommendation leads to 
the contract and the contract leads to the commission 
and the commission means money in your pocket, that's 
property.

16  answer -- go ahead because I -- that's the qualification 
17  you're making, the McNally qualification. 
18
19  exactly.  So you obtained the property, so that box is 
20
21
22  transfer, sell, but there's also exercise.  And the 
23  theory is that the defendant sought to take away the 
24  officer's right to make this recommendation, take it 
away from the officer, exercise it himself.  So why 
25

But I don't think that's -- I mean, right.  But the

checked, but the -- sorry. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about -- you said

doesn't it fit -- why isn't this an intangible right 
taken from one and exercised by another? 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Justice Ginsburg, I would say 

 And whatever -- I mean, you know, we're 

that what you've just articulated is exactly the 
Government's theory, and the problem is that I can use 
that same theory to take any autonomy interest and turn 
it into property that can be exercised, it can be 
obtained by somebody and then exercised by them in a way 
different from the way that the person would otherwise 
exercise it.

23
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. CLEMENT:  There's -- there's no Federal 

on point, but it's a very conscious decision by 

crime and that's the result of a very deliberative 
decision by Congress in 1946 in enacting the Hobbs Act. 
Of course, they had in front of them the model of the 
Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934 that prohibited both 
coercion and extortion.  Congress made a conscious 
decision to, in the Hobbs Act, prohibit robbery and 
extortion, but not pick up the prohibition on coercion. 
 And so there isn't a Federal crime directly

11  Congress.  And, of course, the New York crime on point 
12  is exquisitely on point because not only is there a 
13  coercion offense under New York statute, but it is an 
14  aggravated offense if the victim is a government 
15
16
17  State courts have a crime that directly fits.  It's 
18  as -- I mean, it's almost amazing because it's not just 
19  any State, it's the State of New York.  And Congress, in 
passing the Hobbs Act, was looking at New York law.  And 
20
21  they looked at New York law and they said, New York has 
22  a coercion prohibition and extortion prohibition.

24  New York -- was the New York case dropped and the State 
officials urged the Government, the Federal Government,

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I'd be happy to address 

that.  What happened is there were some pretrial 
rulings.  And one of the pretrial rulings gave the 
defendant an opportunity to do some discovery on the 
State government to figure out whether this was really 
done in the discharge of public duties or maybe this was 
sort of a political thing that was going on.

12  And the Federal prosecutors are just down the street, so 
13  they were very happy to lateral it to the Federal 
14  prosecutors and have them take it over.  And because the 
Federal offense doesn't have an element of interfering 
15
16  with the public duty, they didn't have to worry about 
17  the discovery.

18  commissions at the end of the day after the investment.

But what McNally actually said was the case 
20
21  would have come out differently if the property that had 
22  been alleged to be deprived was either money or 
23  property, but it also said it would have come out 
24  differently if the Commonwealth had been deprived of 
control over how its money was spent.  And that's the 
25

 I'd like to start, if I could, where Justice 

Kennedy began and ended, which is asking whether there

 Now --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Harrington, just to go 


back to Justice Kennedy's -- I mean, suppose -- was 
there a reason why it wasn't charged in what seems to me 
to be the simpler way, which is a threat was made in 
order to get an investment and in order to get fees to 
put in your pocket and -- and go away with, and that's 
extortion.  So why wasn't it -- why wasn't that the

the jury found was the property that was obtained, so 
15
16  it's not the verdict that we are here defending today.

19  to think that there's an obstacle, that even though 
20

result would have been different if the State had been 

deprived of control, of the ability to control its 

money, and that's the property that would have been 

obtained in that kind of a case.  Because property and 

control of property are just -- are just different 

aspects of the same property.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The obvious problem, which 
13
14  you might want to address at some point, is that -- that 
if you take your definition that this recommendation,

17  you know, I'm going to fix you if you don't do it, if

reaching, hard to reconcile with the abortion case --

reconcile with the honest services case. 

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, I guess I would have 
two points.  The first is that this is not about honest 
services because the victim here is not the State of New

kind of --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I mean, that sounds 
11
12  technical.  You see, the problem I'm interested in is, 
13  by accepting your definition do we suddenly throw within 
14  the statute, which speaks of property, any time there is 
an appropriate threat which has as a condition the 
15
16  person doing the job differently?  That's true of 
17  whether it's a postman, you know, any public official, 
18  any private official, anybody. 
19
20
21  far-reaching.  So what's the answer? 
22

24  secretary/typist is -- the stenographer is charged with 
25

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Whatever --

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, I want to separate 

her and she says "I recommend."  She has an interest in 
her integrity to give an honest transcription.  Under 
your view, and this is what Justice Breyer is getting 
at, I think, that -- that secretary has property that 
you are taking.  That's very far-reaching. 

1 
2 
3

5
6
again the question of what is property and when property 
7 
is obtained.  Under the Hobbs Act -- the Hobbs Act 
8 
absorbed the New York State extortion law.  And in 
9 
that -- in the -- in the cases construing that law, they 
10
11  had construed the word "property" to include the running 
12  of a business, the engagement of a person in their 
13  occupation, and the doing of a job.  People have 
14  property interests in doing those things because those 
are the source of economic wealth for those people. 
15
16  They generate a stream of revenue for people to live 
17  their lives on. 
 Now, it's a different question -- not every 
18
19  time you interfere with someone's doing of their job are 
you obtaining that property.  Here, what Petitioner was 
20
21  trying to do was not keep the general counsel from 
22  making a recommendation, he was attempting to dictate 
23  the substance of what the recommendation was. 
24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, I understand that. 
But I still would like an answer to my question, and

about to write a recommendation for somebody to go to 
college or some other thing then is faced with a threat, 
you put in name such-and-such or put in yes instead of 
no, and is under your definition that person's property, 
that what she does the taking of property?  The answer 
is either you think yes, in which case I would like you

19  obtained in the law, and including in New York cases

 A person has a property interest in running

23  their business.  They also have a property interest in

cases.  The Barondess case and the Short case are the 
best cases.  And in the Barondess case, which is from 
1893, I think, the -- the Court said that the running of 
a business was property.  And in the Short case the 
Court said that, just the same way that the running of a 
business is property, a person's doing their job is 
property, and that that can be damaged --

12  property wasn't taken.  Under the New York extortion 
13  law, the law used "property" in two different places, 
14  and this is noted in our brief.  First, it was something 
15
16  extortion.  And second, it was -- one of the means of 
17  committing extortion was doing violence to property, it 
18  was harming property.  And the court was construing 
19  property -- in those cases, it was -- it was in the 
latter sense of what qualified as harm to property. 
20
21
22  is from 1911 -- the court noted that property is used 
23  in -- in both provisions, Section 850 and Section 851, 
24  and said it was construing it as it was used in both of 
those sections.  And in that -- that was the case that 
25

that could be taken, that could be obtained through

said there was not extortion when there were threats of 
violence meant to close down an abortion clinic's

threats of violence had been targeted at the abortion 
clinic's lawyer in order to get him to tell the clinic 
to shut down their operations because they were a

whereas in the real case it wasn't? 

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Yes, because Scheidler came 
out the way it did not because there wasn't property at

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that -- that's the 
15
16  problem with your New York cases as well.  You -- you 
17  are focusing on property in another context, where the 
18  property is harmed, not whether property is taken. 
19  You -- you have neither a New York case nor any other 
common law case involving extortion where the property 
20
21  taken consists of somebody's doing his job. 
22
23  York courses -- the New York cases said that they were 
24  construing the word "property" to mean the same thing as

MS. HARRINGTON:  They might not be, but they 

 Just, if I can just note that --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not sure that 

word "property" to include the concept of being 

obtainable because the statute already separately

14  engage in an occupation.  In a particular instance that 
property may not be obtainable and then there won't be a 
15
16  Hobbs Act violation.  But you don't have to read the 
17  obtainability into the definition of "property."

physical violence against property.  Now, in their 
20

22  be physically harmed, it can't be property.  We are 
23  happy to see in the reply brief they sort of gave that

means if it's property that can't be harmed, then it --

 The -- the concept of property and control 

of property is well illustrated by this Court's decision 
in Carpenter.  There the property -- one of the pieces 
of property at issue was confidential business 

recommendation, his right to do his job, and that was 

his property.  He wasn't just trying to keep him from 

going to work, he was trying to literally dictate what 

the recommendation was.  And that's how it was charged 

in the indictment, that's what the jury found.  That was 
where the obtaining came in.

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, I guess -- I mean, 
16
17  it's sort of two -- two different kinds of responses. 
18  One is that when you're asking if something is property, 
19  you want to look at it sort of on a class-wide or 
aggregate basis.  If you have one, single unauthorized

22  going to cause harm to the record company --

going to be. 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's not the issue. 

 MS. HARRINGTON:  But I'm just saying you 


want to look at something in the aggregate on a 

class-wide basis, and persons doing their job on a 

class-wide basis is something that is economically 
valuable to them.  And therefore, it's property.

10
11  It was trying to get at organized crime families.  And 
12  Congress knew that one of the main means that organized 
13  crime families use was taking control of businesses. 
 Now, those cases might seem easier because 
14
taking control of a brick and mortar business may seem 
15
16  more obviously like property than taking control of a 
17  person's occupation or their job.  But a person's right 
18  to labor is economically valuable to them and is 
19  property to them in the same way that the running of a

21
22  mean, his real view is that he'd want to wipe out the 
23  heartland of Hobbs Act organized crime prosecutions, but 
24  I think his fallback position is that he would want to

wipe out any extortion of a business that provides

services instead of providing a tangible good.  But that 
doesn't make sense either. 

 If Petitioner had threatened harm to a 

plumber if the plumber didn't come and -- and fix his 
leaky faucet, he would have been extorting that 
plumber's labor, and the same thing for a gardener, if 
he tried to get a gardener to come and mow his lawn. 
Now, he wouldn't end up with anything tangible at -- at 
the back end, but what he would have taken from those 
laborers would be their right to labor, their right

making one recommendation rather than another is 

 It's the same thing here, he's trying to 
take from the General Counsel his service of making a

he's trying to dictate the substance of the

recommendation, a positive recommendation.

MS. HARRINGTON:  It has economic value

21  because the lawyer's job is to give his advice in 
22  keeping with his client's best interest.  It's the same

honest lawyer should do that, but that doesn't prove 

that it's economically valuable for the lawyer to give 

the right advice rather than the wrong advice. 


 MS. HARRINGTON:  It is.  If Petitioner had 


tried to blackmail the General Counsel every week to 
give a different recommendation than what he wanted, the 
result would have been the General Counsel would have 
lost his job.  He would have lost his stream of revenue. 
He might have been disbarred.

14  economic harm to a record company, but it's still taking 
property because in the aggregate, the rights of that

20
21  that was against his -- his will in order to get a 
22  $35 million investment from the State.  Now, again, this 
23  might seem like a harder case than if he was trying to 
24  coopt the running of a brick and mortar business, but 
25

what he was trying to do is coopt an individual's doing 

blackmail to coerce a State agent into doing something

of his job.  He's trying to dictate the substance of the 
recommendation.  In doing that, he's obtaining property 
from the victim. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Harrington, I guess I'm 

just confused, and this goes back again to 
Justice Kennedy's initial question, why it wasn't 
charged in a much simpler way where the property is not 
a right by a lawyer to do his job, which seems no other 
person can get, but where the property was the contract, 
was the -- was the investment and the fees, and the

 And why wasn't -- why isn't that just -- you 
13
14  know, I look at the facts here and I say extortion, but 
not on your theory, on my theory.  And why wasn't that 
15
16  simple theory used? 
17
18  several different theories, and one of the theories was 
19  that he was trying to gain the commitment to the 
20
21  circled the lawyer's positive recommendation as the 
22  property that was obtained.  I assume that's because the 
23  evidence in the case, the e-mails from Petitioner to 
24  General Counsel talked about the recommendation and so 
25

investment.  Now, the jury was given choices.  The jury 

that was a tangible thing in the jury's mind.

17  that was what the e-mails were about, they were about 
18  the recommendation.

The General Counsel's job was to give his 

 MS. HARRINGTON:  JA 142.  What they circled 
was the General Counsel's recommendation to approve the 
commitment.  And I think that wording is very helpful to 
us because it's not just that he's trying to obtain a 
recommendation from the General Counsel.  He's trying to 
obtain a particular recommendation, the recommendation 
to approve the commitment.  I think that encapsulates 
both the property and the obtaining that is the theory 
of our case.

only limited to acts by an official.  There was no --

22  again, it's a separate question here whether the 
23  property was obtained.  We think it's clear that there 
24  was property.  We think it's clear the property was 
25

 MS. HARRINGTON:  I concede that point.  I

 And I do think it's important to keep in

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's true.  Not the

Alderson Reporting Company 

out, of course, that it was based on the New York law,

carry forward the separate crime of coercion, which was 
in the New York law but not in the Hobbs Act? 

1
2 
3 
4 
5
 MS. HARRINGTON:  That's true -- I mean, it 
6
was a separate crime of coercion.  There was a separate 
7 
crime of coercion under New York law.  I think, you 
8 
know, the Congress conceived of the Hobbs Act as a 
9 
property -- as a crime of -- against property, and so it 
10
11  didn't want to include coercion.  It included extortion 
12  and robbery. 
13
14
15
16  coercion? 
 MS. HARRINGTON:  In this case.  Well, I 
17
18  think it's important to note, and Petitioner doesn't 
19  mention this, that the attempted extortion charge he was 
20
21  attempted coercion charge he ultimately ended up being 
22  charged with in State law was a felony.  So I think that 
23  explains what was going on there.

51
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

that one. 

Official 

 This Court -- this Court distinguished that 

 I think -- so let's take the Scheidler case 
for an example.  There were different types of property 
that were initially alleged in that case.  One of them 
was the right of women to access the services of the 
clinics. 

1 
2
3 
4 
5
6 
7
from the other alleged property interests, which were 
8 
the running of the business that was the clinic.  And 
9 
the Court said that the right of women to access the 
10
11  services of the clinics was really more of a liberty 
12  interest and the running of a business was really more 
13  of -- it didn't say it was property because it didn't 
14  have to decide that, but it said that's really more in 
15
16  right alleged. 
17
18  could characterize the right to work as more of a 
19  liberty interest than a property interest. 
20
21  so someone -- the general counsel could have been 
22  coerced in this case if he had been prevented from going

is -- there's no obtaining and in the latter there's 

obtaining because what you're doing is you are 

exercising the person's right to do their job.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So why -- instead of 

inducing us to define property so broadly that it's 
unrecognizable, as far as I am concerned --

 MS. HARRINGTON:  But, Justice Scalia, you 
have already defined it this broadly in cases dealing 
with Section 20 of the Clayton Act, the Due Process 
Clause, the scope of a court's equity jurisdiction.  The

14
15
16  of extortion. 
 MS. HARRINGTON:  I hear what you're saying. 
17
18  But what I am saying is that property is property.  And 
19  it's true that in extortion the property has to be 
20
21  the word "obtained." 
22
23  property.  I think property can -- can have a -- a 
24  different meaning with -- with regard to various 
25

property for purposes of extortion, the common law crime 

obtained for there to be a crime.  That work is done by 

provisions of the law.  And -- and the provision of the 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  We're talking about 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think property is

Alderson Reporting Company

law defining extortion brings with it a whole baggage 

of -- of common law cases.  And that may well be 

different from the word "property" used in some other 

Federal statute that does not invoke the common law of 

extortion. 

 MS. HARRINGTON:  But this Federal crime of 
extortion brings with -- brings with it the baggage of 
the New York State extortion law, and the New York cases 
said in that law the word "property" includes the 
running of a business and doing a job.

13  property means.  And if you are worried that those 
14  things can't be obtained, you don't need to worry -- you 
15
16  take care of that because the Hobbs Act already requires 
17  that property be obtained before there is extortion, so 
18  there is no need to have a redundancy built in for that. 
 Again, I can understand how -- how the main 
19
Hobbs Act, sort of heartland cases which involve the 
20
21  co-opting of a brick and mortar business, seem like 
22  easier cases.  And you might want to draw a line between 
23  the running of a business and the doing of labor.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

A couple of points in rebuttal. 

 Ms. Harrington started by pointing to the 

reserved two possible prosecutions.  One would be the 

57
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

government's loss of control over its allocation of 
these workman's comp policies. 

 The problem is, of course, that McNally 

precedes Cleveland.  And in Cleveland, the government 
seized on that language and said, well, even if the 
video poker license isn't property, the right to control 
who gets it is property, and that got exactly zero votes 
from this Court.  So I think that argument is no longer 
viable. 

1

9 
Ms. Harrington also points to these New York 
10
11  cases about the scope of property for purposes of 851 of 
12  the New York Penal Code.  But of course, what we're 
13  talking about is 850 of the New York Penal Code, the 
14  kind of property that can be obtained.  I think it's 
15
16  are -- there is property that you can obtain that you 
17  can't threaten. 
 Indeed, the classic thing you obtained in --
18
19  in an extortion case is money, and I'm not sure how you 
really threaten money.  You can threaten to take money 
20
21  from someone, but you don't really threaten the money. 
22  So these are different terms. 
 So relying on the Barondess case, which is 
23
24  the same case that Justice Stevens relied on in dissent 
25

common ground that -- they are not co-extensive.  There 

in Scheidler II just doesn't work. 

58
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

extortion at common law only involved official 

extortion, but that doesn't mean that there aren't 

common law places to look for a relevant definition of 

property.  Because the same basic concept was in the 
larceny statutes, the -- not statutes, the common law 
crime of burglary, larceny, and embezzlement. 

1
2 
3 
4 
5
6 
7 
 And indeed to this very day, New York refers 
8
to extortion as larceny by extortion.  And if you go to 
9 
those New York cases, the place I would point you to is 
10
11  the Ashworth case, which is cited in both of our briefs. 
12  This is a case that makes very clear that under New York 
13  law, they didn't even think that services at all were 
14  property. 
15
16  gets the bright idea that he's going to do some work for 
17  his own company using the mill's facilities.  And he's 
18  charged with larceny.

20
21  of common law property is in order to be the kind of 
22  property that you can steal or extort it has to be 
23  moveable.  One of the elements of the common law crime 
24  is asportation, literally moving it --
25

 And the court in that case says, no, that's 
not larceny, you didn't obtain any goods.  Classic sort

captures what's going on here.  They say, well, maybe 
5

6 
they say to conceive this requires a certain

13  we take your argument to its logical conclusion, what 
14  you are telling us is, do away with the Second Circuit's

 The most common is the threat to a business 
17
18  that says pull out of this market because we don't want

24  there were customer accounts that were obtained, and

transferred from one business to another. 

 So I think what would happen in the Second 
Circuit, if you decide this case the way we would like 
you to, is the Government's going to have to be careful. 
They're going to have to write their indictments to 
focus on things like money or obtainable property, and 
they can't get sloppy and put together these autonomy 
interests and call them property.
