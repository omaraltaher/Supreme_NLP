CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 01-705, Jo Anne Barnhart v. Peabody Coal


Company and a related case.


We'll wait just a minute.


Ms. McDowell.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL


ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER BARNHART


MS. McDOWELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The Coal Act states that the Commissioner of


Social Security shall, before October 1st, 1993, assign


each beneficiary to a signatory coal operator or related


person that remains in business.  That provision


understood, in light of this Court's precedents,


establishes the deadline that is mandatory but not


jurisdictional.  It does not deprive the commissioner of


the power or the obligation to complete the assignments


after that date, if necessary. 


That understanding comports with the text and


structure of the Coal Act, as well as with -- with one of


its central purposes, that to the maximum extent possible,


each coal retiree's benefits would be paid for by a coal


operator that actually employed that miner or a related

person.


QUESTION:  But that's not true.  In fact, if


later research has showed that somebody should have been


assigned somewhere else, you -- you don't shift the


beneficiaries.  It -- it isn't the case that -- that this


is designed to assure a perfect system in which somebody


who is responsible, no matter that a mistake was made in


the past, in the future that person will be reassigned the


way he should be. 


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, the statute does provide


for administrative review of assignment so that a coal


operator who was assigned a miner in error could challenge


that before the commissioner, and if the commissioner


found that the assignment was erroneous, the miner could


be assigned to a -- a more appropriate coal operator.


In addition, the regulations promulgated by the


commissioner for the administrative review process allowed


the commissioner herself to reopen an assignment if she


found that it had been erroneous within a 1-year period.


QUESTION:  What happens to someone who wasn't


assigned before October 1st?  They're -- they're not just


left out in the cold, are they? 


MS. McDOWELL:  No.  Congress did provide a


fallback position for all of those who weren't assigned by


October 1st or -- or at any time because they had no

former employer or related person who remained in


business, and that is, that they will be treated as part


of the unassigned beneficiary pool.  The benefits for


those miners are paid from an appropriation from the AML


Fund, a fund originally created to ameliorate the problems


of abandoned mines, and if that fund proves insufficient,


the funds will come from a -- a premium imposed on all of


the coal operators to whom beneficiaries who have been


assigned.


QUESTION:  Ms. McDowell, there -- there is a


section, 9704(f)(2)(B), that deals with annual adjustment


of unassigned premiums.  And it says that if there's an


assigned miner and the operator goes out of business in


any given year, then that assigned miner becomes part of


the pool.  And it doesn't matter really whether the


initial assignment was before the October 1 deadline or


not.  They just go into the pool in time.  And that seems


to work somewhat against your interpretation.


MS. McDOWELL:  I think the situation addressed


in that provision is quite different, even assuming that


it unequivocally establishes that the commissioner


couldn't reassign somebody after a company went into


bankruptcy.  But assignments at the outset of the process,


the sorts of assignments that we're concerned with here,


are quite different from an assignment after bankruptcy

that could occur 20, 30, or 40 years down the road, and


Congress may well have been interested only in achieving a


correct initial assignment at the outset and not with


continuing to readjust the assignments --


QUESTION:  Well, it does show at least that


much, that Congress didn't want to continue perpetually to


adjust these things for the --


MS. McDOWELL:  Yes, that's correct.  But the


fact that the -- that Congress directed that the


applicable percentage for calculating the assigned


beneficiary premium shall be adjusted in certain


circumstances doesn't suggest to us that Congress would


not have permitted it to be adjust in other -- adjusted in


other circumstances as well that Congress may not have


explicitly contemplated at the time that the Coal Act was


enacted.  One of those was the fact that --


QUESTION:  Is it possible that that deadline was


some kind of political compromise, so to speak, at the


time it was passed and the operators thought, well, that's


it?  You know, after that deadline, it's fixed. 


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, there's -- there's no


indication in the text or legislative history that that


was contemplated.  And indeed, since Congress was


legislating in light of this Court's opinions in Pierce


County and Montalvo-Murillo, the provision could not

readily be understood as providing coal operators with


that sort of assurance. 


In addition --


QUESTION:  Well, you -- you say Congress is


legislating in light of our decision in Pierce County. 


You're -- you're just applying the general presumption


that Congress does that?  Certainly there's -- is there


any indication here that Congress was legislating in light


of Pierce County? 


MS. McDOWELL:  Congress didn't explicitly say


so, no, but as, we have cited a number of statutes in our


briefs that made clear that when Congress wants to


terminate an agency's authority to make decisions at a


particular point, Congress knows how to say so explicitly


and it has done so in those situations.  It has not done


so here. 


QUESTION:  Well, this is -- this is quite


different than Pierce County, though, at least certainly


on its facts.  There you had a provision that the --


you're supposed to ferret out some sort of


misappropriations and saying that the inspector general,


whoever it was, was supposed to do it in 4 months.  That's


simply a message to the agency to get going.  And we -- I


think we said quite properly that didn't mean that you


couldn't ferret out this sort of thing after the 4 months.

But this thing has -- has somewhat different


ramifications, I think. 


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, I think it's clear that


Congress imposed deadlines, not only this deadline, but


other deadlines in the statute, because it wanted to get


the new funding mechanism established by the Coal Act into


place.  Congress wanted the assignments to be made


promptly so that the Combined Fund could then send bills


for premiums to assigned operators. 


But it wasn't essential to that scheme that


every last assignment was made by October 1st, and there's


no indication that Congress adopted the deadline in order


to provide any sort of certainty to coal operators.  To


paraphrase the Court's decision in James Daniel Good, it


would seem somewhat curious that a deadline that was


intended to expedite the collection of premiums by the


Combined Fund could be construed to prevent the Combined


Fund in some circumstances from collecting premiums at


all.  And that's the effect of --


QUESTION:  Is there any limiting principle to


your interpretation?  I mean, can this go on forever and


ever? 


MS. McDOWELL:  Oh, the statute doesn't itself


impose a limit on the commissioner's authority.  However,


as a practical matter, the commissioner has not made

initial assignments for more than 5 years now and has no


intent to recommence them.  Obviously, Congress can cut


off the authority to do this at -- at any particular time


by denying an appropriation for the process or by doing it


explicitly.


QUESTION:  Would you tell us what percentage of


the assignments were made after the deadline, and how long


after the deadline was the most recent assignment?


MS. McDOWELL:  Yes.  The -- to answer your last


question first, the last one was made in 1997.


Congress made a total of approximately --


rather, the commissioner made a total of approximately


40,000 assignments before the deadline, in addition to


another 15,000, approximately, assignments that the coal


operators had agreed to. 


After the deadline, the commissioner made 10,000


more assignments.  A quarter of those were made in October


1993 or a handful in February 1994.  The rest were made


primarily in 1995 and 1996 and a few more, about 55, in


1997.  And the process has been completed. 


QUESTION:  When there is a reassignment or


taking somebody out of the unassigned pool and attributing


that person to an operator, does the operator who has now


gotten the assignment have to pay interest for the period


from October '93 on, or is it just that you pay now the

bill that we would have sent you if we had charged you in

MS. McDOWELL:  The latter.  There's no interest


charged.  So to the extent --


QUESTION:  So that the --


MS. McDOWELL:  -- the operator benefits by


having the use of the money during the period before the


obligation is imposed. 


QUESTION:  What about the argument that the


Social Security Administration stood before Congress and


said, we can make this date?  Then the operators who might


be saddled with additional responsibility could breathe


easily and say, well, we don't have to set up any reserve


for the assignment of more operators to us.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, in fact, Your Honor, the


commissioner didn't say we will make the deadline.  The


commissioner did express optimism in September of 1993


that the deadline could be complied with. 


QUESTION:  I thought there were quotations in


the record that had an official from the Social Security


Administration telling Congress we are going to do it.  It


was more than, it's a hope.  I -- I don't have that at my


fingertips now. 


MS. McDOWELL:  I think it could have been only


an expression of hope in -- in September 1993, and then

the operators would have received, in many cases, and --


and these respondents certainly did -- assignments of


additional beneficiaries during October 1993, so that


should have put them on notice to make inquiry as to


precisely when the assignment had been made. 


I think a particularly more telling and -- and


earlier statement from a -- an acting commissioner came in


February 1993 when the acting commissioner was testifying


before a House appropriations subcommittee.  He said at


that point that it did not appear that the assignments


could be completed by the deadline. 


One Member of Congress asked, well, what is the


-- the crucial date, then?  When is it that beneficiaries


will lose benefits if the assignments aren't made?  And


the acting commissioner went on to explain that, well,


because there was a -- a $70 million transfer coming into


the Combined Fund on October 1st, 1993 from the United


Mine Workers 1950 pension fund, there would be money in


the Combined Fund for some time to pay benefits, and that


the assignments could be done on a rolling basis to bring


money into the fund.  So it was clearly understood at that


point that there was no jurisdictional cutoff of the time


to make assignments contemplated by the statute.


QUESTION:  Ms. McDowell, what do you do with the


provision of 9704(a)(3)(D) which makes an assigned

operator's unassigned beneficiaries' premium equal to the


operator's applicable percentage, which is defined as its


percentage of total assigned beneficiaries, quote,


"determined on the basis of assignments as of October 1,


1993"?


MS. McDOWELL:  The statute then goes on to


provide for adjustments in years after 1993 for two


circumstances:  when a change has been made as a result of


the administrative review process, and when a change has


been made as a result of coal operators going out of


business. 


QUESTION:  Right, but -- but --


MS. McDOWELL:  And the fact that Congress --


QUESTION:  -- but does not make a third


exception; that is, a change is made as a result of the --


the finding of additional assigned beneficiaries under the


-- under the commissioner's ability to -- to find it after


October 1.


MS. McDOWELL:  That's correct, Your Honor, but


the fact that Congress said that these adjustments shall


be made doesn't suggest that Congress did not intend to


permit other appropriate adjustments to be made as well.


QUESTION:  No, but what does -- what does


suggest that is the language, determined on the basis of


assignments as of October 1, 1993.  And then there's no

provision for -- elsewhere that would enable you to -- to


make the other adjustment.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, Congress was obviously


contemplating, at the point that it enacted the statute,


that the deadline would be made, satisfied.  So it's --


it's therefore somewhat understandable that Congress


didn't discuss all the permutations of what would happen


if -- if the deadline was, in fact, not satisfied.


And an additional point is even if one assumed


that the unassigned beneficiary premium, the applicable


percentage used to calculate it had to remain fixed as of


October 1st, 1993, that doesn't really address the


commissioner's assignment authority after that date, and


it is not essential to the statute --


QUESTION:  Well, no, it isn't essential but it


makes --


QUESTION:  It has to because then you'd be


paying more than your share.  You'd be paying based on the


assumption that you only had X number of -- of permanent


beneficiaries, but then your -- you'd be paying that


premium, but then you have additional beneficiaries that


you must take care of on their own account because they're


assigned to you.  So you -- so you are hurt if you can't


-- if you can't change the formula.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, I'm not sure that it would

significantly change the -- the percentage of the whole


that the operator would be required to pay for. 


But in any event, in practice the Combined Fund


has gone back and taken subsequent assignments, just like


subsequent reassignments, into account in calculating the


applicable percentage, and the statutory scheme has worked


quite satisfactorily in that respect. 


QUESTION:  Would you clarify one thing for me? 


I don't know whether the -- the fallback position to


finance the unassigned -- the benefits for the unassigned


miners -- they -- there are two -- some money comes out of


the first pension fund.  Later it comes out of a


Government fund.  And then there's the third possibility


that that money may run out and the miners will be


assessed for the payment -- for the unassigned -- the


companies will be assessed for the payments for the


unassigned miners.


Now, what is the Government's position with


respect to a company that, say, had nobody assigned prior


to the October date, but after the October date, say, 500


miners were assigned?  Now, as I read the statute, that


would mean the -- that company would have no


responsibility to contribute to the payments for the


unassigned miners.  Am I right about that?  Or would you


adjust it based on post-October assignments?

 MS. McDOWELL:  I'm not aware of any company in


that situation, but I think it would be adjusted for post-


October assignments as well.


QUESTION:  Despite the language of the statute


that Justice Scalia referred to.


MS. McDOWELL:  Yes, Your Honor.  We think it's


flexible enough to allow those additional adjustments to


be taken into account. 


QUESTION:  When do you do the adjusting in the


-- I gather that's what you're doing.  When do you


actually make the adjustments? 


MS. McDOWELL:  That's a task that's left to the


Combined Fund to do.  It's not an adjustment that the


commissioner herself made. 


QUESTION:  But is -- is the percentage


recalculated as of the beginning of -- of each kind of


fiscal year following the -- the initial October 1 date?


Or -- or in the middle of a company's -- in the middle of


a year running from October 1, are they suddenly socked


with a -- or at least liable to be socked with an


assignment for which they had no reason to plan on October


1?


MS. McDOWELL:  You know, I think the


commissioner typically made one round of assignments a


year during the time --

QUESTION:  And is that made in advance of


October 1 each year to commence on October 1 or be


effective as of October 1 each year? 


MS. McDOWELL:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Okay. 


QUESTION:  I still don't see your basis for


doing it.  You say it's flexible enough, but you're


confronted with language that says it will be determined


on the basis of assignments as of October 1, 1993.  I


mean, there it is.  It says it in cold, hard language. 


There is no -- no exception elsewhere to do what you say


there's flexibility to do.  Where do you get the


flexibility from? 


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, Congress didn't foreclose


additional adjustments to be assigned beneficiary premium


in addition to those specified in the statute.


QUESTION:  What do you mean it didn't foreclose? 


Yes, it did.  It said, determined on the basis of


assignments as of October 1, 19 -- what -- what more does


it have to say?

QUESTION:  For other -- exactly.  That -- that


makes it even clearer that except for those expressed


exceptions, everything else has to be done as of October


1.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, in any event, Your Honor,


that particular provision is a separate section of the


statute from one addressing the commissioner's assignment


authority.  It doesn't provide the sort of clear and


unambiguous indication that Congress intended to prevent


the commissioner after the statutory deadline from


completing the task that Congress thought was important. 


QUESTION:  No, but if -- if you don't read the


two provisions together, if you don't read the shall


clause and -- and the calculation clause together, you --


you get a system which is simply incoherent.  You've got a


system in which assignments are being made, but in fact


the -- the Combined Fund is being operated as -- as if


they were not being made.  And, you know, it seems to me


that you -- you've got to go the whole hog.  You -- you've


simply got to say that the -- the October 1 deadline has


got to be read together with the shall clause, and if the


shall clause can be varied, then the October 1 deadline

can be varied, too, because otherwise you just get an


incoherent system.  Do you agree?


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, that is certainly how it


has been applied.


QUESTION:  That's what you're doing.


MS. McDOWELL:  It has been applied flexibly and


adjustments in the applicable percentage have been made


retroactively.


Thank you.  I'll reserve.


QUESTION:  I have one question.  I -- I take


it's possible if a company had received assignment of --


of all of its employees, that it could argue that it was


paying too much if there wasn't the adjustment.  Have any


companies made that argument? 


MS. McDOWELL:  Not that I'm aware of, Your


Honor.

Mr. Buscemi, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER BUSCEMI


ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS HOLLAND, ET AL.


MR. BUSCEMI:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The respondents in this case are seeking a


windfall because the Social Security Administration didn't


complete its work on time.  They should not get it.

 It is conceded in this case that the


beneficiaries at issue were supposed to be assigned to


Bellaire and Peabody. 


It's conceded that these respondents are not


being asked to pay a penny more than Congress wanted them


to pay. 


It's conceded that Congress wanted as many


beneficiaries as possible to be assigned to particular


operators.  Section 9706(a) itself directs SSA to assign


each beneficiary.  Now --


QUESTION:  Counsel, would you explain to us the


real world consequences at the end of the day for the


respective positions of the parties?  Apparently the


miners will be covered one way or another.


MR. BUSCEMI:  That is correct, Your Honor.  And


respondents make a great deal of that as if the only


purpose of the statute was to ensure that the


beneficiaries would continue to receive their health


coverage.  That was surely a major percentage. 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. BUSCEMI:  But the financing method of the


benefits was also a key component of the statute.


QUESTION:  Well, that's -- the next part of


Justice O'Connor's question is -- and I had this in mind


also -- is the fund will always have adequate funds to pay

for the unassigned miners, will they not?  The plans.


MR. BUSCEMI:  Well, the Combined Fund will --


QUESTION:  The -- the plans in that sense aren't


hurt because they're -- they're not going to run out of


money.


MR. BUSCEMI:  The Combined Fund will receive


funds in accordance with the provisions of the statute.


The answer to Justice O'Connor's question is threefold. 


It is complicated. 


For the first 3 plan years, beginning February


1, 1993 and ending October 1 -- I'm sorry -- September 30,


1995, if these beneficiaries are not assigned, as they


should be, to Bellaire and Peabody, all of the other


assigned operators will receive a greater assessment, and


they will -- because there will be an increased number of


unassigned beneficiaries during those first 3 plan years.


QUESTION:  A backwards looking assessment --


MR. BUSCEMI:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  -- for those early years. 


QUESTION:  But they're not complaining, as I


understand it, or am I wrong about that? 


MR. BUSCEMI:  Well, they -- they surely are


complaining.  The Apogee case, for example, in the


Eleventh Circuit was a case that arose precisely because


of that sort of supplemental, after-the-fact assessment

designed to take into account the fact that there was a


greater number of unassigned beneficiaries in the plan. 


And that, in particular, arose as a result of this Court's


decision in the Eastern Enterprises case.


QUESTION:  But they're not in this case. 


MR. BUSCEMI:  They're -- they're not intervenors


in this case, no, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Why?  I'm just -- as I understand it,


which may show I'm wrong, the -- the -- all this is about


is, since the -- this receptacle, the -- the -- what are


we calling it -- the fund -- is --


MR. BUSCEMI:  UMWA Combined Benefit Fund?


QUESTION:  Yes.  That's financed by the coal


companies, too.  So -- so that -- aren't -- isn't the


money that we're just talking about coming from them and


-- and -- the unassigned people go into a fund.  The


unassigned people go into a -- what's the word?  It's


escaped me. 


MR. BUSCEMI:  Your Honor, both the assigned


beneficiaries and the unassigned beneficiaries are


beneficiaries of the Combined Benefit Fund.  The Combined


Benefit Fund receives premiums for each beneficiary from


the assigned operator, if the beneficiary is assigned.  If


the beneficiary is not assigned, as I was starting to say


in response to Justice O'Connor's question, there is a

complicated system.  For the first 3 --


QUESTION:  And you've given us step one.  Right?


MR. BUSCEMI:  Step one is the first 3 plan


years.


QUESTION:  All right. 


MR. BUSCEMI:  During those 3 plan years, the


unassigned beneficiaries are paid for out of the transfers


from the UMWA 1950 pension plan.  Those were transfers


that could not have been made but for the statute because


pension benefits and the health benefits are different. 


And Congress intervened and said there will be $210


million moving into the Combined Fund from the pension


plan.  That money is used for unassigned beneficiaries'


premiums.  It's used for death benefit premiums, and for


the first year and the first year only, it's used to


reduced the assigned operators' assigned beneficiary


premiums. 


So every time the number of unassigned


beneficiaries goes up, a greater share of that $210


million must be used to pay for the unassigned


beneficiaries.  Less is left for death benefits and to


defray the first year assigned beneficiary premiums, and


accordingly, a supplemental assessment is made on all


assigned operators when the number of unassigned


beneficiaries goes up.

 That's part one. 


Part two.  Beginning on October 1, 1995,


Congress says that there shall be annual transfers from


the interest earned by the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation


Fund established under the Surface Mining Control and


Reclamation Act. 


Now, obviously, you can't transfer interest that


you don't have.  The interest earned by the AML Fund has


been declining.  Interest rates have been going down, and


accordingly, the interest rates that are earned by the


fund goes down.  The fund at one time earned $80 million a


year in interest.  It's now projected to earn only 30 in


fiscal 2003.  So there's a limit to how much can be


transferred from the AML Fund. 


The third component.  If the AML Fund transfer


is not sufficient to pay for the beneficiaries, the


unassigned beneficiaries, then there must be an unassigned


beneficiary premium assessed against all assigned


operators, thereby shifting the cost of these


beneficiaries from these respondents to all assigned


operators.


QUESTION:  Which hasn't happened yet in fact.


MR. BUSCEMI:  It has not happened yet.


QUESTION:  And how much are we talking about?


MR. BUSCEMI:  Well, right now we're talking --

if everyone nationwide affected by this case, if the rule


were to change, and you were looking purely prospectively,


you have about 4,000 people.  But if you go back to the


beginning --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. BUSCEMI:  -- you have about 10,000 people. 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. BUSCEMI:  And as Mr. Tennielle's


declaration, which is in the joint appendix, shows, there


is approximately $105 million that was already at stake as


of the time of his declaration in 1999, and that number


has been growing ever since.


QUESTION:  What exactly is the interest of the


trustees that you represent? 


MR. BUSCEMI:  Your Honor, the trustees want to


see this statute operate the way it's supposed to operate.


The trustees --


QUESTION:  But that's a fairly -- what is their


financial or pecuniary interest? 


MR. BUSCEMI:  The trustee -- it's -- it's not a


financial interest.  The trustees believe that the policy


of the statute was to have the greatest possible amount


paid for from the private sector by the employers who


employed the beneficiaries, retired miners.  And the


trustees have been, in each of these cases, arguing that

the system ought to work the way Congress intended. 


Now, on the applicable percentage, I do want to


say one thing in response to Justice Scalia's several


questions on this, and that is, the "as of" language in


the statute is very important.  Every time there is a


reassignment as a result of an administrative appeal, it's


made as of October 1, 1993.  Every time there's an initial


assignment made after September 30, 1993, it's made as of


October 1, 1993.  They all go back to the beginning


because these beneficiaries all need health care --


QUESTION:  You can't read that language that


way.  It -- it says applicable percentage is defined as


the percentage of total assigned beneficiaries determined


on the basis of assignments as of October 1, 1993.  You're


-- you're telling me that means assignments made later,


but that you say on their face, we're making these


retroactive to October 1, 1993? 


MR. BUSCEMI:  It must be, Your Honor.  It must


be because if there is a reassignment --


QUESTION:  It must be because otherwise your


theory doesn't work. 


MR. BUSCEMI:  No.  Otherwise the statute --


QUESTION:  And -- and the other side's theory of


the case is -- is correct. 


MR. BUSCEMI:  No, Your Honor, because when

there's a reassignment after an administrative appeal, for


example, the reassignment occurs in 1995 or 1996.  If an


administrative appeal is successful and there's a


reassignment, that reassignment is as of October 1, 1993,


even though the reassignment isn't made until later. 


That's absolutely plain --


QUESTION:  So there's a -- there's a retroactive


assessment? 


MR. BUSCEMI:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  All of


these assignments, whether they're reassignments after


administrative appeals, whether they're initial


assignments during this period when the commissioner was


finishing the assignment process, they all go back to the


beginning.  In fact, they go back to February 1, 1993


because that's the beginning of the first plan year.


I might say there are many provisions in this


statute that say do something by a date certain.  The


trustees had to be appointed by a date certain.  The $70


million transfers from the '50 pension plan had to be by a


date certain.  The merger of the '50 benefit plan, the '74


benefit plan into the Combined Fund had to be by a date


certain.  Yet no one would argue that if any of those


dates was missed, then there was no authority at all. 


And --


QUESTION:  Wouldn't you have to give back money

if -- if your side does not prevail?  Then these payments


have been made -- the assignments that were made, 


payments have been made as of October 1, '93.  And


wouldn't the fund have to give those payments back? 


MR. BUSCEMI:  That's precisely what Mr.


Tennielle's declaration points out, Your Honor.  As of the


time of his declaration, there had been approximately $105


million worth of payments by various assigned operators


who had received assignments, initial assignments of


beneficiaries that were made after September 30, 1993. 


Those amounts would have to be refunded or credited. 


Indeed, the respondents in this case sought just such


refunds or credits.  If you look at Judge Kinneary's


opinion, for example, in the Bellaire case in the


appendix, he grants a credit to Bellaire in the amount of


the payments that they made on behalf of the beneficiaries


assigned to them. 


QUESTION:  Well, of course.  They were assigned


incorrect -- I mean, what's so extraordinary about that? 


It just means you've been collecting money from the wrong


people. 


I mean --


MR. BUSCEMI:  I was just responding to --


QUESTION:  I -- I would hope you give it back. 


MR. BUSCEMI:  And we did.

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Buscemi. 


Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.


ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS PEABODY COAL COMPANY, ET AL.


MR. ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The petitioners' position is that when Congress


said shall before October 1st, 1993, it meant may before


or after October 1st, 1993.  That is so, according to the


petitioners because, as they read the statute, Congress


could not really have intended to limit the authority of


the commissioner to make assignments under the act.


But there is nothing implausible or even unusual


about reading the statute to mean what it says.  The


consequence of not assigning a particular miner by the


statutory deadline is that the miner is unassigned under


the statute.  The statute tells us what to do with


unassigned miners.  There is an elaborate backup


provision, as the Solicitor General calls it, to deal with


unassigned beneficiaries. 


First and foremost, they receive the same


benefits as assigned miners.


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, all I -- all that, I


guess, is conceded in the argument, but the -- the -- when


all is said and done, there seems to be an -- an inequity

as among the operators.  And I can understand your -- I do


understand, I accept your argument that at least to get


the plan going initially, that the objective of Congress


would have been, as it were, a good system rather than a


perfect system. 


What I don't see is why Congress would want --


would have wanted to make it impossible to improve on that


system later by eliminating the -- the inequity of an


erroneous failure to assign.  And it's -- it's that issue


that makes it difficult for me to read the -- the shall


language as being, as -- as they say, jurisdictional or


providing a cutoff.  Can you address what the reason


Congress would have had for wanting to preserve that


inequity? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Certainly.  First of all, from


Congress's point of view, the overriding purpose is to


continue benefits.  That's taken care of. 


Second, the coal miners get the same benefits


whether they're assigned or unassigned.


Now, but the argument is this undermines the pay


for your own principle.  But the pay for your own


principle itself is -- embodies rough justice.  A company


that employs a miner for 2 years pays for all his


benefits.  Another company may have employed him for 25


years.  That's the compromise that was agreed to and

that's fine.  But it doesn't mean that this pay for your


own principle is some unqualified desideratum that you can


assume Congress intended to pursue at all costs in


perpetuity.  We know that's not the case.  They had a


deadline and they imposed it. 


QUESTION:  But, Mr. Roberts, didn't you omit one


of the other statutory purposes, which was, insofar as


possible, to assign responsibility for paying the benefits


to the company that had the best, the closest connection


with that particular miner? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, and we know that was, for


example, not a purpose they wanted to pursue ueber alles. 


If a company goes bankrupt, those miners --


QUESTION:  But it was one of the major purposes,


was it not? 


MR. ROBERTS:  It was one of the purposes, yes,


and it was one that Congress said, spend a year trying to


make these assignments.  But then we've got to launch this


fund and --


What is really going on here is that the


commissioner wants to do a different sort of job than


Congress delegated to her.  This is the sort of project --


and I think this is a critical distinction from the


deadlines in Pierce County and those sorts of cases.  The


agency could have done a reasonably good job on this

project in 4 months, a better job in a year, maybe a


nearly perfect job in 5 years.  Congress said, we want the


1-year version.  Why do we want the 1-year version and not


the nearly perfect version?  Because the miners are going


to get the same benefits either way.  Coal companies or


funds established by coal companies are going to pay for


them either way. 


QUESTION:  But they will pay in different


amounts.  Different coal companies will be paying for some


of the miners under your proposal rather than the


Government's proposal. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, and the question is-­


QUESTION:  And the specific hypothetical that


troubles me -- let me put it right out on the table. 


Supposing a company had no assignments made to its prior


miners until after October 1st.  If I understand the


system correctly, at the end of the line, if they have to


finance the payments for the unassigned miners out of a --


a pool contributed to by the operators, that company will


not have to contribute to that pool. 


MR. ROBERTS:  No.  That's right.  If it had no


assignments. 


Now, Congress --


QUESTION:  And -- and the company which had a


full assignment is going to be paying more than its pro

rata share. 


MR. ROBERTS:  And Congress knew --


QUESTION:  And even though that there was -- you


say there's rough justice.  This is making it even -- even


more rough, and if the companies are not paying the


proportion of the -- of the benefits that the statutory


scheme requires.  They're paying more. 


MR. ROBERTS:  And Congress knew there was some


unfairness in requiring the companies to pay for


unassigned beneficiaries, and it cushioned that unfairness


by saying we're going to draw from this AML Fund that coal


operators established earlier.  That will -- it has to


date ensured that there is no unassigned beneficiaries --


QUESTION:  But I take it that fund itself is


maintained based on the -- your share of fully assigned


miners.  More, the more you're assigned, the more you have


to pay to that fund.  Or correct me if I'm wrong. 


MR. ROBERTS:  No.  That -- it's a preexisting


fund that was established based, I believe, on per-ton


royalties. 


The point is everybody is contributing in


different amounts to establish --


QUESTION:  No, but Mr. -- let me just interrupt


you as to your answer to Justice Kennedy.  It's true for


the first and second stages that it doesn't matter, but if

you have to go to the third stage where the unassigned


miners are paid by the companies, then what he says is


absolutely right. 


MR. ROBERTS:  If you have to get to the third


stage where there's an unassigned beneficiaries premium


assessed, yes.  It's done pro rata.  And Peabody Coal, for


example, will have a very sizeable bill if that reaches it


because they have over 4,000 assigned miners.  This case


is about 330 miners who were assigned after October 1st.


But the point is not whether you could write a


funding mechanism that is more equitable or fair.  It's a


question of whether that's the one that Congress wrote. 


Congress --


QUESTION:  What is the harm?  That is to say, as


you agree -- I think we both agree there are many statutes


with deadlines in them.  There are regulatory statutes


set, health regulations by such and such a date set,


consumer, trucking regulations.  And the courts regularly


set that those dates, even though they use words like


shall, are not fixed because obviously Congress wanted the


regulations written, even if late. 


Well, here they're saying this is roughly the


same thing.  Obviously, Congress would have wanted this


assigned in the principle of pay for your own way, and


nobody is hurt by doing that late.  Nobody is really hurt.

 Now, I want you to reply to that.  What's the


down side of trying to interpret this like we'd interpret


other regulatory statutes?


MR. ROBERTS:  Well -- well, it's not like the


other regulatory statutes, first of all, because it's an


extraordinary grant of the authority to impose retroactive


liability.  The grant exists nowhere other than in the


same sentence that says shall.  I think that's quite


different than saying, EPA, in 2 years issue clean air


regulations.  That's -- that's a different case.  And


Pierce County is quite different.  I think the Government


probably has inherent authority to recover misspent funds.


The harm is the same harm that comes from


disregarding any kind of deadline.  As I said, this is the


sort of project you can spend 20 years on and always come


up with a more perfect assignment.  Congress knew that. 


They knew that a significant amount of work was involved. 


They had to go and set up an interim funding system for


February to October to give the commissioner time.  The


commissioner came back and said, we've done it.  We've


completed the project. 


QUESTION:  Is there any way that you or your


clients or anyone have been hurt by the delay?


MR. ROBERTS:  Oh, of course. 


QUESTION:  That is -- how?  How were you hurt

specifically by the delay compared with if they had done


it all perfectly within 5 minutes?  Imagine they got the


same assignments on time.  Now imagine they got them late,


and how are you hurt by that? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Oh, sure.  Well, it's the same


concern the Court noted last term in the Sigmon Coal case.


The coal industry is characterized by a significant amount


of transactions, mergers, acquisitions.  You could be


looking at acquiring a coal company, and of course, given


the nature of the industry, the first question you ask is


what is your liability, and they're going to say, well,


it's this much.  And then you -- then the -- the merger or


the acquisition takes place, and then you get another


notice, here are, you know, 40 new miners.  And now, all


of a sudden, it's this much.  That was a significant


concern in Sigmon Coal, and it is significant in this


instance as well. 


QUESTION:  But, Mr. Roberts, on the other hand,


you are, in fact your companies are paying less than they


would have paid had they been billed properly on time


because you have had the use of the money in the interim,


and Ms. McDowell said you're not being charged any


interest because you're paying in 19 -- or any adjustment


for inflation because you get to pay in 19-whatever, '97


dollars a bill that was due from October 1993 and you

don't get charged any interest on that. 


MR. ROBERTS:  I don't think interest is a


significant factor just the way the interest rates have


been over this time period.  It certainly doesn't do much


to cushion the unfairness and inequity of getting a bill


retroactive as much as 5 years. 


QUESTION:  But my -- my point is simply had you


gotten that bill, that -- timely, it would have been more


costly than getting the bill later because you have had


the use of the money in the interim. 


MR. ROBERTS:  The -- the interest is apparently


not -- not charged. 


QUESTION:  Unless you're -- unless you're a


company that had bought a company which, which had that


switch pulled, in which case you're -- you're out of


pocket a good deal.  Despite the fact that you're -- that


it's less money than -- than would have been charged


originally, it's coming out of your pocket when you bought


a coal company that you did not believe had that


liability. 


MR. ROBERTS:  And the -- the key factor that


such transactions play in this particular industry may


well explain why you don't see any companies on this side


of the case.  I think it's always wise to be skeptical of


fairness arguments that are raised by proxy.  There are no

companies complaining about, oh, we're going to end up


potentially paying a higher pro rata assessment than


otherwise because -- a number of reasons. 


Again, Congress cushioned the unfairness;  they


recognized it by making the AML Fund available. 


Second of all, this is a statute that is


suffused with concepts of rough justice.  It is not


necessarily a more perfect result to pursue 5 years


instead of 1 year to pay for your own principle.  That


does not necessarily lead to a more perfect result.  It


may mean that more companies who employed miners for 2


years are paying over all of those benefits than companies


-- when companies who employed the same miner for 20 years


don't have to pay for any.


But the critical --


QUESTION:  But there is -- I mean, Congress did


provide that if you think you were assigned people who


belonged to someone else, you can complain and then


there's an adjustment long after the 1993 --


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  We think that helps us, of


course, because it's an express provision for an


assignment after October 1st.  There are no other such


provisions and because --


QUESTION:  But isn't -- isn't it true that with


regard to the as -- with regard to as of language that

Justice Scalia is emphasizing, isn't it true that those


post-October changes are made as of the October date?


MR. ROBERTS:  The reassignment provisions, yes. 


Now, I'm not aware of a situation where it's reassigned to


someone who never had any assignments --


QUESTION:  No, but at least the cancellation of


-- of an assignment would be made as of the earlier date


even though it took later -- took place later.


MR. ROBERTS:  That's right. 


But the other point is that although there's a


provision for --


QUESTION:  So -- so you -- you admit that that


language doesn't really mean what it says.


MR. ROBERTS:  Oh, no.  It means as of October


1st.  What I'm saying, in the case of a reassignment, they


say you can go back and -- and reassign it.  The


applicable percentage is based on the assignments a


particular company had as of October 1st.


QUESTION:  If you can do it with a reassignment,


why can't you do it with an initial assignment?


MR. ROBERTS:  Because there's --


QUESTION:  Without doing violence to the


language? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Because there's a specific


exception that allows reassignments.  There's no exception

for reassignments.  And, I would point out, there is no


provision that allows changes in the case of an unassigned


miner, and that is what has been going on here primarily. 


The commissioner has been revisiting the unassigned pool,


and that's why this is quite different from a lot of the


other deadline cases.  This is -- we think the


commissioner did get the job done on time.  She just wants


to do a different job. 


QUESTION:  But Congress didn't think so, at


least the Congress that made an appropriation so that the


-- the administration could get the job done.  There was a


supplemental appropriation, wasn't there? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And part of it was supposed to be


spent to enable the administration to finish the job.


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, part of it.  And the one


thing Congress did not do, with being told, you know,


we're coming up with the deadline, they didn't change the


deadline.  They kept that in place. 


Look at what the Solicitor --


QUESTION:  I thought that supplemental


appropriation was made after October 1st, 1993. 


MR. ROBERTS:  No, before.  In June I believe. 


It was asked for in February, made in June or early July.


QUESTION:  It's a little hard for me to accept

your argument that the equitable structure of the statute


is enhanced because the commissioner didn't get his work


done on time. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, I think the commissioner did


get the work done on time.  It's just she just wants to do


a more perfect job.  And what I'm saying is it's


reasonable for Congress to determine we don't need the


more perfect job.  We need a good-enough job.  And this


job is good enough to get the fund launched. 


The one thing that's clear is that the way the


petitioners read the statute, if that had been proposed


when the Coal Act was -- was enacted, it never would have


gotten off the ground.  The idea of giving the


commissioner significant discretion on an open-ended


timetable was certainly not in the cards.  This is the


legislative equivalent of trench warfare, parties fighting


over every inch.  They had the black lung model which did


give the Secretary of Labor significant discretion in


allocating responsibility for that consequence of -- of


the -- of coal mining, and they wanted nothing to do with


it.  That's why --


QUESTION:  How -- how do we know this, Mr.


Roberts?  I -- I take it there's no helpful statement in


the legislative history saying, you know, by the way, this


is, you know, the linchpin of the deal, that with respect

to unassigned miners, there will be no monkeying around


after October 1st, '93? 


MR. ROBERTS:  I think we know it primarily --


no.  There's no statement like that.  I think we know it


from the structure of the statute which is carefully


reticulated.  There is no delegation of discretion to the


commissioner.  The compromises in the statute are spelled


out. 


And when you talk about revisiting fairness,


keep in mind you're looking at one particular provision


and you say, well, that looks unfair.  It may be because


another provision that's not at issue balances that out.


This is, as the Court noted in Sigmon, an


instance of legislative horse trading and log rolling, and


they're setting up a system and everybody has to pitch in


some.  The older pension funds pitched in some.  The


operators pitched in.  Congress came forward with the AML


Fund, and it moved forward.  And it had to be in place by


October 1st or the wheels would have fallen off.  This is


not a deadline of the sort you've got 120 days to issue a


decision. 


Thank you, Your Honor.

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS BELLAIRE CORPORATION, ET AL.


MR. SUTTON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  May


it please the Court:


I'd like to start with a legal point, and I want


to start by looking at 9706(a), which I'm sure you have


handy.  I'm going to -- 9706(a).  I'm going to be reading


from the red brief, Bellaire's brief, at A19.  And this is


the assignment provision we've been discussing.  And there


are two things that are important about the language of


9706(a). 


The first is, of course, that it says, shall


before October 1st, 1993, and I think you understand our


arguments there. 


But the second point --


QUESTION:  Which one are you reading from, Mr.


Sutton? 


MR. SUTTON:  The Bellaire --


QUESTION:  I know, but where on the page? 


MR. SUTTON:  A19, 9706(a), section (a), 9706(a).


QUESTION:  Oh, thank you. 


MR. SUTTON:  And the -- the first point you


notice is the shall before October 1st, 1993 language. 


And of course, you -- we've made our point there. 


But the second point is that it's the same shall


term that modifies other clearly mandatory jurisdictional


43

requirements under the act.  The commissioner would agree


that she had no option of assigning these miners to


nonsignatories or to assigning them to people that were


out of business or to not following the statutory


prescribed order of priority.  It's one term, shall.  As


the Court made it clear in another deadline case, Mohasco,


we're going to assume the same word has the same meaning


throughout and --


QUESTION:  No, but -- I mean, that -- that's an


assumption we can't make.  I mean, I think there is a


clear understanding that when someone is given an


either/or choice, shall may be -- mean one thing.  When


one is given a timing or a deadline choice, it may mean


something else.  The statute is addressing different


issues and the same verb may well have different meanings


in -- in the different contexts.


MR. SUTTON:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I'm not


aware of a case from this Court that has said one word in


one sentence can have different meanings in the statute.


QUESTION:  It doesn't have different meanings. 


It has the same meaning.  But in fact, it doesn't tell you


what happens if you don't do it.  All right.  So they


didn't do it. 


Now what?  If you don't do what it says, then


what?  And there the statute is silent.

 MR. SUTTON:  And the point --


QUESTION:  And furthermore, the argument is that


the shall merely enhances and makes more meaningful the


other shalls.  I mean, that's --


MR. SUTTON:  Well, there's just one shall.  And


the petitioners would agree that there's a clear


consequence if they had not assigned to a signatory


operator.  Why isn't there the same mandatory --


QUESTION:  Because it's a -- look.  It's not a


linguistic point.  The point is, what happens if you don't


do it, what you shall do?  And there, the consequence in


the case -- you said you couldn't go back.  You're


absolutely right.  And now our question is what's the


consequence here?


MR. SUTTON:  Well, the consequence here -- and


that's what makes this an easy case -- is the fact that


unlike Pierce County, the statute did provide a


consequence.  It did provide a fail-safe safety net for


all miners. 


QUESTION:  Well, it provided -- it had a default


provision.  In effect, it says, if there hasn't been an


assignment to an operator, this is where the person goes


for purposes of this tripartite calculation.


But the fact that there may be a default


provision in the case of -- of inaction, I don't think

necessarily is -- is equivalent to saying that there is a


provision for all time about what shall happen.  It's just


that their immediate object was there had to be a grouping


of these miners as of October 1 or there would have been


no way to calculate the -- the sources of the -- the


various assessments to pay for it.  But that -- all that


does is say, okay, you've got a default in place --


default position -- provision in place so that you know


what to do as of October 1.  But it doesn't answer the --


the question here. 


MR. SUTTON:  The proof, Your Honor, that this


was not that mysterious in terms of language is the fact


that the commissioner had no problem doing what -- just


what we say the statute required.  As of October 1st,


1993, she did just what Congress said she should do, which


is to divide the world of miners into two parts, assigned


or unassigned.


After October 1st, 1993 -- and keep in mind this


was a statutory beginning, not a statutory --


QUESTION:  Well, she could have done that if she


had done absolutely nothing at all.  If -- if she had done


zero on -- on October 1st, the -- the default provision


would have -- would have come into play and there would


have been a result of October 1st.  And -- and I assume


you would not take the position there that a -- a total

default by the Government of any action at all would --


would be required to go unremedied for all time. 


MR. SUTTON:  Well, no.  Of course, the statute


wouldn't have worked in that setting. 


QUESTION:  No. 


MR. SUTTON:  There's no doubt, you would have


required a congressional fix.  But the point --


QUESTION:  But there would have been a result as


of October 1st.


MR. SUTTON:  But the point I'm making is there


were only 5,000 out of these 80,000 miners that they ran


out of time on.  As of October 1st, what did they do with


these miners?  They put them in the unassigned pool.  The


statute has very specific requirements for transferring --


QUESTION:  Yes, but the unassigned pool wasn't


created just for that purpose.  It was also created to


take care of people who couldn't be hooked up with any


particular company. 


MR. SUTTON:  But to use Justice Souter's words,


all default provisions cover everything.  It would be an


odd safety net that said, some in and some out.


QUESTION:  But you would agree that the default


position was not just to take care of the timing problem. 


MR. SUTTON:  No, of course, not.  But -- but


this gets to --

 QUESTION:  The universe -- the universe of


assigned and unassigned was, I don't think, intended by


Congress to include people that the commissioner didn't


get around to.


MR. SUTTON:  Well, there's one thing that


Congress clearly appreciated, and let's make sure we're --


I -- I make this clear.  Of the 10,000 people that have


been reassigned, i.e., original assignments after the


date, 7,500 are folks that the commissioner originally


did, quote, "designate" in the unassigned pool.  They


reviewed the records.  They looked at them.  They said, we


can't find anyone to whom they belong.  They're going to


the unassigned pool. 


Now, the proof that Congress contemplated that


possibility is exactly the administrative review


provisions we've been talking about.  What were they


about?  Fact error.  And so they were aware of --


QUESTION:  Can you give me that number again? 


What is the percentage of the unassigned we're talking


about that were initially determined properly to be


unassigned for other criteria? 


MR. SUTTON:  20,000 were initially decided.  If


you look at the Herrin affidavit at JA179 to 184, it


specifically says that 20,000 were initially designated


unassigned.  And this proves Mr. Roberts' point that

what's going on here is not a missed deadline case.  They


met the deadline.  What's going on is they decided to


reinvent the task.


QUESTION:  So we're talking about 20,000, and --


and what's the total universe that we're talking about


here of unassigned? 


MR. SUTTON:  Oh, well, they started with 80,000


altogether.  I'm making the point that 20,000 were


initially designated unassigned.  Out of that 20,000,


7,500 later they decided we can do a better job with that.


And our point -- our point is -- I mean, there's a


cost-benefit analysis here.  Congress could have said,


Commissioner of Social Security, you can keep doing this


into perpetuity until you get the job just right.  They


didn't say that. 


QUESTION:  All right.  So their -- their


reassignments cost your clients money.  I understand that. 


What I don't quite understand is Mr. Roberts' point which


he mentioned.  If they're right in the case -- I mean, if


-- if you're right in the case, then other companies


should have had to pay more, isn't that right, to balance


what you paid by way of less? 


MR. SUTTON:  But, Your Honor, I mean --


QUESTION:  And why weren't they are on the other


side of the case?  I'm genuinely puzzled about that.

 MR. SUTTON:  Well, that's an important question. 


But ultimately, it's robbing Peter to pay Peter.  All of


these funds, at the end of the day, came from coal


companies. 


QUESTION:  Yes, that's my understanding.  So I


would appreciate why they aren't -- I mean, Mr. Roberts


brought that up.


MR. SUTTON:  Because of the cushion.


QUESTION:  And I'm just curious why they're not


here.


MR. SUTTON:  The cushion, Your Honor.  The


cushion.  A critical part of the compromise that led to


the enactment of the act was a cushion of funds to provide


for the benefits of unassigned beneficiaries.  That


cushion has been sufficient.  So there's no -- there's --


there's not been a concern yet for this pro rata --


QUESTION:  Yes, but it isn't assumed it will


always be sufficient, is it?  It's been sufficient up to


now.  But isn't it assumed that in time that they will


have to resort to a -- a company financed pool of money to


pay for the unassigned miners?


MR. SUTTON:  Your Honor, the Government all the


time relies on much less reliable proxies than this one. 


Keep in mind that 93 to 94 percent of these miners'


records were reviewed.  The risk that somehow this pro

rata unassigned beneficiary premium is going to awkwardly


hurt one company I think is fanciful.  I can't imagine how


that could happen given the numbers --


QUESTION:  Well, do you not agree -- I'm not


sure you're responding to my question.  Do you not agree


that there is a significant possibility, even a


likelihood, that you'll reach the third stage of financing


for the unassigned pool?


MR. SUTTON:  I don't know, and the reason I


don't know is that you -- these AML transfers have done


the job.  Since 1995 they have done the job, and this is a


declining population. 


QUESTION:  Where would that money go?


QUESTION:  Assume there is a significant risk. 


QUESTION:  But they haven't eliminated the


unassigned pool. 


MR. SUTTON:  No, they haven't.  Of course, not.


QUESTION:  And the question is who -- who should


pay for those? 


MR. SUTTON:  And the rough justice calculation


that the Congress made is we're going to do it on a pro


rata basis.  If I could just step back for one second, I


think this, I hope, puts the 1992 decision in context. 


Through -- from 1946 forward, they paid for


these benefits in two ways.  One was pay for your own.

The employer paid for his or her employee.  And the second


one was pay as a group.  They've been doing that through


-- since 1946. That's what the AML tax does.  That's on


all coal companies. 


QUESTION:  Suppose the Secretary had gotten


around to only half instead of what it was.


MR. SUTTON:  Right. 


QUESTION:  You're saying she couldn't -- she --


she should not have tried to make it perfect.  It was good


enough for Government work.  But suppose it was only --


she -- she was much slower and she only did, say, one-


third.  Then what? 


MR. SUTTON:  There's -- there's -- I'm sorry.


There's clearly some point at which the wheels


of the statute would fall off, but I think from the


Court's perspective of construing what the statute means,


it's appropriate to assume the commissioner is going to


act in good faith.  She did act in good faith.  She did


get --


QUESTION:  When you say it would fall off, do


you mean that in that event, if she had been slower than


she was, then she would have been permitted to make


assignments after the deadline? 


MR. SUTTON:  No, Your Honor, I don't mean to be


saying that.  The point I'm making is that --

 QUESTION:  Well, what would have happened? 


Let's say she did only one-third of the job and you had


this large pool of unassigned people. 


MR. SUTTON:  Well, the bigger problem would have


been the assigned miners and they wouldn't have had enough


money to pay for them.  When I say the wheels fall off the


statute, if they didn't get this job done by October 1st,


they've got a very serious problem on their hands because


the statutory beginning that starts on that date is they


began sending out these premium requirements.  The first


ones went out on October 22nd, 1993.  And if they hadn't


done a sufficient number, you wouldn't have enough money


to pay for their benefits.  You'd be back --


QUESTION:  I thought the first 3 years they got


the money from the pension fund. 


MR. SUTTON:  Those were used primarily for


unassigned.  They were used some to help with assigned,


but most were used to pay for unassigned benefits.  So


that's the point I'm making there. 


I'd like to make a point about Pierce County


that I think is helpful in thinking about deadline cases


in general.  Here's why we're not saying that when a


statute says you must complete this FOIA request in 20


days, our -- our case would control it.  In Pierce County,


as in that situation, these governmental agencies have

preexisting general grants of authority to do these acts;


i.e., go get misspent Federal funds.  There are general


statutes.  There was one in Pierce County.  If you look at


page 257 of Pierce County, the plaintiff conceded there


was otherwise jurisdiction to get this money. 


Here -- and so what Pierce County means is we're


not going to say there's a repeal by implication of that


general grant of authority merely because we now have


another statute that says do it quickly, get it done. 


That's not this case. 


9706(a) is the only provision either petitioner


has pointed to that gives you this grant of authority.  So


the grant comes with a limit. 


QUESTION:  May I just interrupt with -- with one


more question, if I may?  In response to the as of


argument that Justice Scalia identified, Mr. Buscemi gave


a -- a list of a whole bunch of things that are as of


October 1st.  What would be your response to his -- his


list of as of things that really happened later than that


October date?


MR. SUTTON:  There are express exceptions to the


October 1st deadline, and under this Court's decision in


Sigmon, you follow the Russello rule.  They knew about the


possibility --


QUESTION:  It was an express exception like on

the appointment date of the trustees and so forth? 


MR. SUTTON:  Oh, I'm sorry.  The other shalls. 


I'm sorry.  The other shall -- I'm sorry.  Thank you. 


The other shalls throughout this statute --


you've got two different issues there.  One of them is


that they apply -- there's no contingency plan if you


miss.  Here we've got a contingency plan.  That's one


inference.


The second is they all regulate private


entities.  This goes back to the point I just made about


Pierce County.  If a private entity is told do something


by this date, they don't do it, a court clearly has


authority to say, we said do it by this date, do it.  They


had -- they had -- you don't have a authority problem with


a private entity.  They can do what they want.


With the Government, however, and particularly


when it comes to these extraordinary retroactive


assignments of liability, the commissioner is not born


with that authority.  It's not inappropriate to ask the


Government to turn square corners in that kind of a


setting as opposed to a setting where they're merely


exercising a general power to get misspent Federal funds,


fulfill a FOIA request.  There --


QUESTION:  Mr. Sutton, I -- I thought that or


maybe I just hoped that Justice Stevens was -- was asking

about why it is that the -- the crucial language


determined on the basis of assignments as of October 1,


1993 is in fact not so crucial, that -- that as Mr.


Buscemi said, there are other instances in which something


was not determined before October 1, 1993, but


nonetheless, it is deemed to have been determined before


October 1, 1993.


MR. SUTTON:  By the statute.  It says that if


they -- if a company goes out of a -- goes into


bankruptcy, we're going to alter the applicable percentage


as of October 1st, 1993 because they went into bankruptcy.


If there's a reassignment, it goes back to October 1st.


QUESTION:  Well, does the statute say it goes


back to October 1st?  Does the statute say the


reassignment shall be deemed to have been made as of


October 1? 


MR. SUTTON:  Let's go back to it right here. 


You've got -- in the provision you're talking about,


9704(f), the applicable percentage, it has the general


rule. 


QUESTION:  Where is that?  What page? 


MR. SUTTON:  A13 of the appendix. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MR. SUTTON:  The general rule is stated in


9704(f) and then you have the adjustments to the general

rule. 


QUESTION:  Right. 


MR. SUTTON:  And then it says, look at number 2:


by making the following changes to the assignments as of


October 1st, 1993.  They -- they stuck with it.  I mean,


they understood what was going on, and that's -- that's


what's so inappropriate here. 


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. SUTTON:  I mean, Justice Ginsburg, you made


the point that there's no interest running on this, but


keep in mind we don't get interest when they make mistakes


on our assignments.  That's a wash.  Right?  I mean, if


they mistakenly assign someone to us, we don't get


interest there.  But -- thank you, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Sutton.


Ms. McDowell, you have 1 minute remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL


ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER BARNHART


MS. McDOWELL:  Justice Breyer asked why there


weren't coal companies on our side of the courtroom.  It's


because we, that is, the Federal Government, has been


paying through the AML Fund for the benefits for the last


few years.  It appears that in the next few years that


interest is going to run out, and at that point, there


will be coal operators who will be bearing a larger burden

through the unassigned beneficiaries' premium.


QUESTION:  What would the interest be used for


if it weren't being used to make up the --


MS. McDOWELL:  It would be used for correcting


the severe health and safety problems caused by abandoned


mines from the period before 1977.


The suggestion was made that coal operators were


being denied certainty in making transactions.  If that


had actually been a concern, there is a remedy provided by


the Administrative Procedure Act, section 7061, an action


for administrative action unreasonably delayed.  A coal


operator conceivably could have brought an action under


that statute. 


QUESTION:  But they said that -- they answered


that by saying, how did we know there was going to be?  We


didn't know there was going to be anything reassigned to


us.


MS. McDOWELL:  They received initial assignments


at -- for the first time in October 1993.  That was at a


time when no reassignments were being made through the


administrative review process.  It therefore should have


occurred to them that these were post-October 1st, 1993


assignments. 


In terms of there having been a political


compromise that the October 1st, 1993 date would have

jurisdictional effect, in light of Pierce County and


Montalvo-Murillo, no such compromise could be assumed.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms.


McDowell.


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
