Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. BEARD, II, 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 This case is about the extent to which

14  conditions to land use approval.

21  mitigation for the loss of wetlands, I am going to 
22  voluntarily create a conservation easement on the rest 
23  of my property.  So he recognized, from day one, that 
24  there had to be some mitigation for what he was seeking 
25

property, Coy Koontz was told by the district that he 
had to finance enhancements to 50 acres of publicly 
held --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let's back up.  When he 

asked for a permit, he voluntarily said, I -- as 

Here, before he could make small use of his 

to do in the permit.  Is that right?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And if he had offered 

1

3  in the form of a conservation easement on most of his 
4  property. 
5
6  nothing, and he just said, I want this permit to develop 
7  my land, and the agency said, you have offered no 
8  mitigation, we deny your permit, would he have a claim? 
9
attached to the permit denial, then there would be no 
10
11  claim; although it would be up to the district, under 
12  Nollan and Dolan, to make the individualized 
13  determination, both of the amount of impact to wetlands 
14  and the amount necessary to offset.

denial was based on the idea that he was obligated to 
offer mitigation and that was the extent of the 
district's communication with him -- in other words, 
that the district told him, you must offer us something, 
we won't tell you what, and we'll let you decide what 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose he just put in 
the application, no mitigating -- no mitigation of any 
kind, and the agency says no.  You recognize that he 
would have no claim, right?  That he had an obligation 
to mitigate. 

MR. BEARD:  It depends, Your Honor.  If the

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You are -- you are posing a 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  For what?  For what?  You 
wouldn't -- you wouldn't know what property was taken. 

1  you want to offer in mitigation -- if that was in the 
2  record and that was the -- and the result of that was a 
3  permit denial because Mr. Koontz said, for example, 
4  well, gee whiz, I don't know how much I need to mitigate 
for, you haven't told me, I still believe there would be 
5
6  a Dolan violation because, in Dolan, the Court made 
7  clear, there has to be an individualized 
8  determination --

13  situation in which he never came forward with any 
14  suggestion.  They never came forward with any 
15
16  a taking? 
 MR. BEARD:  Not for --
17
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  A taking of what? 
18
 MR. BEARD:  Not for a taking, Your Honor, 
19
but he -- he may have a cause of action, under Nollan 
20
21  and Dolan, for the imposition of an unconstitutional 
22  condition that may not -- the contours of which may not 
23  be known.  But the fact that the district told him, you 
24  need to --

 MR. BEARD:  Excuse me.  I didn't understand? 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wouldn't -- wouldn't the 

MR. BEARD:  That is correct.  They -- they 
are saying that we don't have a cause of action for a 
taking.  Of course, in Nollan and Dolan, there was no 
transfer of property from the applicant to the relevant 
agencies. 

1  that you may have such a cause of action here. 
2
3
4  other side in this case acknowledge that you have such a 
cause -- that you may have such a cause of action here? 
5
6
7  they -- well, their argument --
8
9  you don't have a cause of action for a taking.

11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19
20
21  very clear that a conservation offer is not considered 
22  mitigation because there's still a net loss of wetlands. 
23  The policy is abundantly clear, stated, and undisputed. 
24  Okay? 
25

As this Court will recall, in both Nollan 
and Dolan, there was an imposition of an exaction, and 
immediately, the applicant in both cases sued to prevent 
the unlawful exaction from being consummated. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I've had a 

problem with your argument, okay?  From the record, it's 

So, given that policy, why are we even in 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 So why are we here? 
 MR. BEARD:  Justice Sotomayor, we don't 
contest the legitimacy of the policy, of course, in 

1  this case?  Meaning whether there was an exaction or no 
2  exaction or whatever happened in terms of the denial, 
3  you couldn't win on your offer because the policy of the 
4  State was clear and, in my mind, unassailable:  We have 
to preserve wetlands.  Conservation of other wetlands is 
5
6  not enough.  Mitigation means make sure that we get a 
7  net gain of wetlands. 
8
9
10
11  preserving wetlands; nor do we contest, for that matter, 
12  the ratios that the district has imposed via its 
13  regulations. 
14
 It is undisputed -- the trial court found 
below, the Court of Appeals affirmed, and the finding 
15
16  was undisturbed in the Florida Supreme Court, that, in 
17  fact, the offsite mitigation -- that part of the 
18  mitigation that went beyond the conservation easement 
19  was in excess, it violated Nollan and Dolan. 
20
21 
22
23  you have a problem then, Mr. Beard, because, if you look 
24  at the record, the record is very clear that it was 
25

not -- that the district didn't come back and say, take 

So the underlying factual findings are not 

in dispute. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think you -- I think 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

So if we can't -- we really can't say this 

least half a dozen, maybe more, that the -- the district 

1  it or leave it, you -- you improve our wetlands, or you 
2  get no permit. 
3
4  in the Respondent's brief at pages 13 to 15, oh, at 
5
6  said, here are several ways -- several ways that you 
7  could sufficiently offset the adverse impact.  And some 
8  of them had nothing to do with improving the 
9  government's own land. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
 MR. BEARD:  Justice Ginsburg, it's true that 
18
19  there were negotiations and that a range of offers were 
made.  On Mr. Koontz's application to use 3.7 acres of 
20
21  his property in conjunction with the conservation 
22  easement, the district made a final decision denying him 
23  his permit because he would not go beyond the easement 
24  and offer offsite mitigation. 
25

was a take it or leave it, either you do the 
improvement that we are asking you to do, or you get no 
permit, what do you do with the fact that, as the 
appendix certainly bears out, that the district offered 
a range, it offered many, many ways that this permit 
might be granted.  And then it says, then you are free 
to come up with some other -- something else.

The -- the staff suggested eliminating -- no, that --

conservation easement.  Now, if that -- if he took that, 
would you have any -- any case here? 

1
2  wouldn't go beyond what he was offering, but that's --
3  some of these options -- one was that he -- that he 
4  adjust the size of his project, that he make it smaller. 
5
6  that's a different one. 
7
 But there was one that suggested that he --
8  he reduce the scale, the Petitioner reduce the scale of 
9  his project to one acre and preserve the rest for the 
10
11 
12
13  we took --
14
give you -- we will give you a permit if you reduce the 
15
16  scale of your project to one acre, and then preserve the 
17  rest by a conservation easement? 
 MR. BEARD:  Unlikely not, Your Honor, 
18
19  because the trial court did conclude, based on the 
evidence, that he was having minimal impact on any 
20
21  viable wetlands.  And so even a reduction in the size of 
22  the project, with an increase in the amount of 
23  mitigation, would have a fortiori gone beyond even what 
24  we have in this case.

 Suppose that the State just had a policy 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Beard, can I go back to 

Justice Ginsburg's first question and make sure I 

1  of law, that Mr. Koontz did -- was entitled to a 
2  determination on the application he submitted.  He 
3  submitted that application.  And, as the district 
4  admitted in a pretrial statement right before trial, the 
denials were based exclusively -- and this is a quote --
5
6  "The denials were based exclusively on the fact that the 
7  plaintiff would not provide additional mitigation to 
8  offset impacts from the proposed project." 
9
10
11  understand your answer to it? 
12
13  that said, We're concerned about wetlands; in order to 
14  develop your piece of property, you have to come forward 
with a proposal -- a mitigation proposal and an adequate 
15
16  mitigation proposal.  And then it gives some guidance 
17  about what an adequate mitigation proposal would mean, 
18  but it really leaves it up to the landowner. 
19
20
21  this on my own without providing any mitigation.  Is 
22  that -- and -- and the State says, well, then, sorry, 
23  you don't get a permit.

MR. BEARD:  My answer was that he may have a 
Nollan/Dolan claim.  I don't want to get confused about 
the term "taking" because "taking" could imply many 
kinds of regulatory takings claims. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I -- that's the next 

question I was going to ask you because my understanding 
of Nollan and Dolan was that it assumed the condition, 
if taken alone, would constitute a taking. 

Do you disagree with that? 
MR. BEARD:  I do not disagree with that, 

Your Honor. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So then you need a 

taking someplace in the picture; isn't that right? 
Nollan/Dolan says this is how we analyze takings in the 
context of a permit scheme.  So we have to look for a 
taking.  So, in my example, where is the taking? 

This was Justice Ginsburg's example. Where 

is the taking? 

MR. BEARD:  Right.  And I think that's 

correct, that, under Nollan and Dolan, you would have to 
have a condition that was imposed on you. 

My only point was would it be lawful --
or there be a problem in the district shifting its 
burden on to the applicant and saying, we're not going 
to establish what mitigation is required, and we're not 
going to establish what the impacts are, we'll leave

 And then two cases, both hypothetical, one 

policy that, for every acre you develop, you have to 

1  that up to you, you give us what you think is -- is 
2  necessary. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the district 
3
4  did -- did have, as I think it did here, a uniform 
5
6  preserve 10 wetlands -- 10 acres of wetlands. 
7
8  is somebody had an 100-acre parcel, and they want to 
9  develop five acres, and they have 50 acres that they 
mitigate for wetlands.  The other person has only one 
10
11 
acre, and he wants to -- and he has to develop the whole 
12 
acre. 
13
14  the one-acre development permit, if you reclaim wetlands 
on 10 other acres that you -- that we can designate for 
15
16  you elsewhere?  The hypothetical being designed to point 
17  out whether or not the crux of your argument is that he 
18  had to go off -- offsite. 
19
20
21  court's analysis as to the connection between his impact 
22  and what was being required, and there was testimony 
23  below that there was no connection there.  And the fact 
24  that the mitigation was four to seven miles away played 
into the analysis as to whether there was a connection. 
25

 Can the district then say, we'll give you 

 MR. BEARD:  The crux is not that he had to 

go offsite, but that -- that did play into the trial

MR. BEARD:  It depends, Your Honor, because 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you normally 

decide whether the agency has done that right or not? 

 It's not --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, in my hypothetical, 

1
2
3  you would -- would there be a violation in my 
4  hypothetical, as you understood it? 
5
6  you have to determine what -- in each respective 
7  hypothetical, what the impact was actually to the 
8  wetlands and then determine what the appropriate 
9  mitigation --
10
11 
12
 MR. BEARD:  Excuse me? 
13
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you normally 
14  decide?  Let's assume Justice Kagan's question -- or 
15
16  to us with a mitigation plan.  And you say, this is what 
17  I offer, and it's enough.  And they say, no, it's not 
18  enough; denied.

administrative process, to figure out whether that was 
20
21  arbitrary and capricious, whether it was a Penn Central 
22  violation?  What would you do with that claim in the 
23  normal circumstance?  Justice Kennedy's question.

 MR. BEARD:  Correct.  It could be an inverse

JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- so what I think might 
be driving some of these questions is the district court 
says -- just as you say, had Koontz offered additional 
mitigation -- the additional that would have cost 
$10,000, he would have gotten the permit.  That's what 
he said. 

1  Nollan and Dolan claim.  There may be another kind of 
2  claim, say, under Penn Central, and that could be 
3  brought.  That wouldn't have to be brought via 
4  administrative remedies, if there was a final agency 
5

7  condemnation. 
8
9  condemnation type of a claim. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15

 So then you look back to see what additional 
17  mitigation.  And, here, we have in the record, at least 
18  that my law clerk finds -- you know, that -- that they 
19  went to Koontz and they said, here are some choices: 
20
21  development -- I mean, right on your land -- or reduce 
22  the size to one acre; or eliminate the filling of the 
23  slide slope areas; or replace 15 culverts and eliminate 
24  a ditch system somewhere else; or enhance 50 acres

Install a subsurface stormwater management system in the

7  is not some land somewhere off the site.  We're talking 
8  about his land.  If, after all, they said you have to 
9  leave all the coal in the mine to hold up the ceiling --
you know what I'm referring to -- then they go too far.

11
12  conditions proposed and said -- you know, this is just 
13  terrible, they don't do it for anybody else, your 
14  client's the only one, it bears no relation, oh, it just 
15
16
17  saying you're going to win, but I got it clear what the 
18  framework is.  But suddenly you bring this Nollan/Dolan 
19  business into it, and I get confused.  And the reason is 
20
21  and Dolan. 
22
23  easement in front of -- and an easement is a piece of 
24  property in Nollan, and there was a bike path in Dolan,

 So -- so I don't see how Nollan and Dolan

 MR. BEARD:  Justice Breyer --

1
2  have to do with this.  I see everything that Penn 
3  Central has to do with it, and that grows out of the 
4  nature of what was being offered.  You are saying what 
they are offering you is simply going too far.  Okay. 
5
6  I've got that conceptually. 
7
 I ask this question because all these briefs 
8  are about Nollan and Dolan, and I don't understand what 
9  they have to do with it.  I must be missing something, 
10
11
12  Justice Breyer, Nollan and Dolan, fundamentally, are 
13  about whether a property owner has been singled out to 
14  bear public burdens that, in fairness and --

24  related to his building the house.  I got it.  I just

JUSTICE BREYER:  But, of course, they are

everybody assumes -- right in front of his house -- and 
said, you've got to let everybody from the beaches walk 
back and forth from one beach in the north to another

3  something, in this case, make use of your property.  And 
4  the --

6  fact, there is too much coal.  That's an

2  whether they didn't issue the permit and would have, but 
3  they haven't quite, or maybe they have -- it means 
4  nothing. 
5
6  what your argument is, is that this is a form of 

7  regulatory taking of the kind that Holmes was talking 

8  about.  And that -- that's what was going on in -- in 

9  Penn Central, and so we simply look to see if it went

14  different part to this case, called the Nollan/Dolan 
part and explain that to me.  That's why I asked the 
15
16  question.  I want to hear what you're going to say. 
17
18  part, a very distinct part, and that part goes to the 
19  question of the condition that produced the denial.  So 
there are -- there are actually two parts here.  There's 
20
21  the -- the conditioning of your permit; in other words, 
22  we will not issue you permits unless you agree to 
23  perform offsite mitigation.

But the crux of the claim that was litigated 
in this case, from the trial court all the way up to the 
Florida Supreme Court, is was the condition to perform 
offsite mitigation -- and that was accepted as true by 
the courts below, that this was a condition that had 
been --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose the record just

19  could do, some -- some of them having nothing whatever

 Suppose the -- whatever the district court 
22  might have said, the record shows that the agency said, 
23  you're right, seven things you could do, come up with 
24  here are six, if you have something else.  And some of

 MR. BEARD:  We agree that there were 

And, by the way, the reference --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where -- where is that? 
 MR. BEARD:  It's in the Joint Appendix, 

1  properties. 
2
3  negotiations and that, even in the order, it's alleged 
4  that various options were provided to Mr. Koontz, but, 
ultimately, the decision -- as the district admits, the 
5
6  decision -- the final decision to deny the permit 
7  application for 3.7 acres of use was Mr. Koontz's 
8  refusal to acquiesce in the condition that he perform 
9  50 acres of offsite improvements. 
10
11
12
13  pages 70 to 71, which is the pretrial statement where 
14  each party sets forth his and her position.  There, the 
court -- I'm sorry -- the district made clear that the 
15
16  condition that had been refused and was the cause of the 
17  permit denial was the one to perform offsite mitigation 
18  at a cost of a range between $10,000 on the low end. 
19  Our experts said in the range of 100 to 150,000 -- 90 to 
20
21
 So the district, later on -- even in the 
22  Florida Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg, said, in its 
23  Petitioner's brief on jurisdiction, at page 1, that it 
24  required additional mitigation before it would authorize 
25

the permits and that, quote, "Additional mitigation

 So there's no question that an actual 

condition was imposed, whose rejection produced a permit 

another question whether that condition is a taking.  And 
we've been trying to figure out what's the taking here. 
In Nollan and Dolan, they took an easement, they took a 
piece of land, so that's the taking.  Now, you said the 
funds are the taking; is that correct?

6  conditions that we would demand -- and I will assume 
7  here that they are true demands -- you can always argue 
8  that the impact of the conditions, be they onsite, 
9  offsite, or monetary, would be so burdensome that it 
10
11
12  there is no -- there is no restraint on the agency.  It 
13  can ask for the moon -- before it will give a permit?

8  Central -- I think that, in Lingle, when this Court tried to 
9  sort of restore -- you know, some -- some coherence to 
the -- to the takings jurisprudence and repudiated the 
10
11 
Agins point, the Court pointed out that -- that the --
what -- that the normal -- sort of the normal

jurisprudence is that the government is not required to 
establish, by a heightened scrutiny, sort of that there 
14 
is a connection between means-ends analysis, when it 
15
16 
engages in economic -- economic regulation. 
 And that --
17
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just -- just to nail 
18
19  it down, your -- your position is that there is no limit 
in the Federal Constitution on what the agency can 
20
21  demand as a condition for the issuance of a permit? 
22
 MR. WOLFSON:  No, no, no.  I don't think 
23  that is our position.  First of all, the Due Process 
24  Clause may certainly impose conditions.  The Equal 
Protection Clause may certainly impose conditions.

 In those two situations, what we said in

3  has ever -- has ever been faced with exactly such a 
4  case, but I think that would raise very serious 
5

7  wrong about -- I might have this -- I thought the

9  case that Penn Central applies only where there is a

12
13  Lucas is it applies without case-specific inquiry, but 
14  there are another set of cases where Penn Central and

17  you look into such things as whether the regulation 
18  destroys investment-backed expectations.  And then you 
19  look to the nature of the government interest and the 
relationships, et cetera.  That's what I thought the 
20
21  framework was. 
 Now, if that's the framework, then, when the 
22
23  government says, I will let you develop your land if and 
24  only if you give $50,000 to the Shriners Hospital, you 
would say, I can't develop my land.  And, besides, that

3  whatsoever.  Therefore, I win under the Takings Clause. 
4
 Now, I spell all that out because I -- if 
I'm wrong about that framework -- if I am right about

and Dolan? 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  That is what -- if -- if the 

permit had issued and the -- and an easement was 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  If -- if --

12
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but it -- wasn't what 
13  was taken unreasonably the ability of this homeowner to 
14  make the alterations to his house that he wanted to 
15
16  and the State said, you can't do it. 
17
18  it was because you wouldn't give us the easement. 
 MR. KNEEDLER:  The -- the basis of the --
19
the theory of Nollan and Dolan -- and the Court made 
20
21  this clear in -- in Lingle -- and in Del Monte Dunes, 
22  for that matter -- is those two cases apply in a 
23  specific situation where there is an exaction of a right 
24  of access, an easement for the public to enter the land 
25

make?  He wanted to add another story and the court --

 And its only basis for saying, you can't do

 Nollan and Dolan shift that burden to the 

as a condition.

 And the -- the reason for that, the Court 

 The other is that it was a per se taking. 

1
2  explained in Lingle -- there are really two reinforcing 
3  points.  The first was that there would be public 
4  access, which is a permanent physical occupation, which 
is one of -- one of the exceptions to the general Penn 
5
6  Central test for regulatory takings. 
7
8  The -- it -- it was per se that the government could not 
9  have acquired that easement for paying -- without paying 
compensation; therefore, the government could not attach 
10
11 
as a condition to the granting of a permit that the 
person convey something, unless it was proportional. 
12 
13
 So the -- the theory began with the idea 
14  that the easement itself would have been -- the taking 
15
16  different situation because the other way in which 
17  Petitioner's theory would constitute a radical departure 
18  is that compliance with regulatory programs frequently, 
19  maybe almost always, requires the expenditure of money. 
If someone wants to build a power plant -- a 
20
coal-fired power plant, he's going to have to install a 
21 
22 
scrubber to protect the air, to prevent no -- diminution 
of air quality.  Constructing that costs money.  It 
23 
24 
can't be that the requirement to spend money to comply 
with a regulatory program is itself a taking. 
25

of that would have been a per se taking.  This is a very

 The taking would be --

which there is no question, under Nollan and Dolan, 

5
6  about the relationship, proportionality, and nexus. 

7
 Let's put those to one side because the 

8  issue is whether Nollan and Dolan apply.  Can the 

9  government say, okay, you want a permit, we will give 

you the permit, if you fund the new football stadium? 
10
11
 MR. KNEEDLER:  I think, in that situation, 
12  there would be a very substantial equal protection challenge

25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, I agree with you --
MR. KNEEDLER:  -- which -- which imposes 
the -- the burden on the government and, basically, 
treats the -- the payment of money as, itself, a taking. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Kneedler, can I go 

winning argument? 

below did two separate rulings, I think. 

50

 If the only issue is an obligation to pay 

money, that that's not a takings claim, correct? 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  And this is not even an 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right.  There was a 

second holding, however, which really gets ellipsed by 

 One is there can't be a taking if the -- if 
1
2  the claim is that it's of an undifferentiated money, not 
3  a res.  And I think you would agree with that. 
4
5
6
7  obligation to pay money.  It's an obligation to spend 
8  money to come into compliance. 
9
10
11  the second, which is a denial of a permit doesn't permit 
12  you to raise the Nollan/Dolan case.  And it appears, to 
13  me, even if there is an easement situation -- so, even 
14  if there is an actual takings claim at issue, do you 
15

18  not to undifferentiated money, but is there a difference 
19  between a denial or a grant?

MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  If the -- if the agency 
decision is written where there is an express condition, 
we don't think that it matters -- an express condition 
satisfying Nollan and Dolan; in other words, an 
exaction, a per se taking, we don't think it matters 
whether the -- whether it's a permit grant or permit

 There was no actual taking in the sense that 

1  denial. 
2
3  compensation would be owed, but it could be challenged 
4  as an unconstitutional condition under the Nollan and 
5
6
 But we think it's critical, when thinking 
7  about that, that the -- that the permit denial -- that 
8  only applies if the permit denial expressly is based on 
9  the condition because, otherwise, you would get into a 
situation of negotiations and what was discussed and --
10

and liability could turn on an exchange of ideas; 
whereas it should turn on the formality of the agency's

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you agree -- your 
17  friend on the other side cited a number of places in the 
18  record, where he thought your condition was satisfied, 
19  that the denial of the permit was expressly based on the 
20
21
22  the orders denying the permit applications in the record 
23  at -- I believe it's 49 to 51 and 59 to 61.  In those

4

6  you are saying, all along, in the negotiations, the 
7  agency says, if you do X, you get the permit.  And X 
8  is -- would -- would be an unconstitutional condition. 
9
 Okay.  He refuses to do X.  The permit is 
denied with a general statement like this:  The permit

18  assurances.  What assurances -- the way in which he goes 
19  about it, whether offsite or onsite -- the offsite part 
20
21
22  offsite -- onsite problem.  But the ultimate question is 
23  he didn't carry his burden of establishing no net loss 
24  of wetlands. 
25

 Isn't it clear that the reason he's refused 

just arises because this is a wetlands case. 

 Normal regulation wouldn't raise the 

last demand of the agency? 

 MR. KNEEDLER:  But the ultimate standard

 So they're saying why in heaven's name are 

So he is going to say that that is like the Shriners 
Hospital.  You are going to say, no, it isn't like the 
Shriners Hospital. 

1  say, in part, is -- I guess, I did a little numbers from 
2  your brief, the 37 million acres in Florida, say about 
3  4 million are bodies of water and say a third of them 
4  are built up, and we have 11 million that are wetland 
5
6
7  we supposed to -- everybody wants to build.  And why 
8  should the people that happen to live in wetland have to 
9  pay for all the other wetland?  That's just coincidence. 
10
11 
12 
13
 Now, all I'm saying is isn't it at least an 
14  issue, under the Takings Clause, whether it is or isn't? 
MR. KNEEDLER:  I think it's clearly not like

21  denials -- just general permit denials, the Court made 
22  clear, in Del Monte Dunes, are not covered by Nollan and 
23  Dolan.  They are covered by Penn Central.

the Court could have denied the permit without attaching

2  always have that option. 
3
 And the third point is --
4
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you may be right, but 
5
you are making Nollan and Dolan a trap only for really 
6  stupid districts -- you know, if they -- they say the 
7  right words and then they are out from under it; isn't 
8  that right? 
9
10
because -- because there are situations in which an 
11  agency actually wants to get the easement.  But this 
12  Court, in Lingle, made clear that -- that the general 
13  rule is Penn Central, with only the two exceptions for 
14  regulatory takings --
15
16  the -- whether the permitting authority says expressly 
17  in the denial, "It's denied because you didn't do this," 
18  or it just says, "It's denied," but it's perfectly well 
19  understood what was needed -- what they were going to 
20
21
22  because the agency has to reserve -- has to have the 
23  ability to -- to deny the permit because the conditions 
24  required by the statute were not met. 
25

And Nollan and Dolan deal with formality and

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. BEARD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
10
11
 I would just like to point the Court -- and 
12  particularly Justice Scalia, to pages 30 and 31 of our 
13  brief on the merits where we describe, with citations to 
14  the Nollan and Dolan, what precisely happened there. 
I want to make sure that it's clear that

21
22  Mr. Kneedler says is a ruling in your favor on this 
23  question, that all denials are subject to Nollan and 
24  Dolan?  What do we do with that? 
25

what they did there was not issue permits.  They 
approved with conditions, but the property owner still 
had to satisfy the conditions in order to receive the 
permit. 

As to the question about --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do we do with what 

I mean, what's the -- I see an enormous

an unconstitutional taking. 


 They should just plain say no and not 


 MR. BEARD:  Justice Sotomayor, I don't 


believe that negotiations will suddenly break down, and 

1  flood gate here and one in which we are sending a signal 
2  that, perhaps, States should be more quiet, rather than 
3  more engaging.  They should just say no because anything 
4  they offer is going to be seen as an -- potentially, as 
5
6
7  explain why, not engage in any work with you to 

8  mitigate. 

9
10
11  we will see a flurry of permit denials, if the Court 
12  rules in our favor.  What will happen, instead -- it's 
13  true, I should say, they will lose flexibility in 
14  demanding whatever it is that they want under the 
15
16
 They won't have any review.  But the benefit 
17  of applying our rule that says monetary exaction should 
18  be treated like other exactions and be reviewed under 
19  Nollan and Dolan --

are asked to pay taxes.  Homeowners are asked to pay 
taxes all the time; development fees, if they want to 
develop something.  People are subject to money 
exactions all of the time in this society. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they're not.  People

context, we are not talking about taxes, homeowners' 
10
11 
fees, we are talking within the discretionary land-use 
process -- that is imposed there, then the risk of 
12

coercion, undue influence, and the like arise, and 
Nollan and Dolan should apply.

Justice Breyer's questions about Penn Central.  I think, 
conceptually, there is an important difference between 
the Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine, which is what 
we seek to apply here, and what would be a permit -- or 
what would be a Penn Central claim. 

But I wanted to respond specifically to 

 The Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine, 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Finish your thought. 
 MR. BEARD:  The offense there is the 

conditioning -- the improper conditioning of a permit.
