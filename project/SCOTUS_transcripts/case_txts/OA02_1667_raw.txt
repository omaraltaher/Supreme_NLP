CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 02-1667, Tennessee v. George Lane.


Mr. Moore.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. MOORE


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. MOORE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may


it please the Court:


Whether the Court chooses to view Title II of


the Americans with Disabilities Act in the entirety of its


indiscriminate application through every facet of every


state program, activity, and service, or in the


alternative, as the private respondents urge, in the 

narrow courthouse access context, presented by the


particular allegations of the complaint they have filed in


this case, the Court should conclude that Title II exceeds


Congress' enforcement authority under section 5 of the


Fourteenth Amendment for essentially two reasons.


First, because there was no evidence before


Congress that the states were involved in a widespread


pattern of violations of the Fourteenth Amendment rights


of disabled persons when the ADA was enacted in 1990.  And


second, because Title II shares all of the incongruent and


disproportionate features that proved fatal to Title I of

the same statute in the Garrett case and then some. 


Title II's lack of congruence and


proportionality to any identified constitutional injury


inflicted upon disabled persons by the states is apparent,


we say, on the face of the statute.  Congress made no


effort to tailor its provisions to those contexts which


might conceivably pose a threat to the exercise of


fundamental constitutional rights by individuals with


disabilities.  Instead, Title II applies indiscriminately


to every service, program, or activity of the states.


QUESTION: Let's assume that the - that the state


- and it's just an assumption - would concede that


sovereign immunity could be abrogated insofar as access to


courthouses for handicapped people, so that Congress could 

have drafted a congruent and proportional statute.  The


fact that this injury comes within a statute which has a


much larger coverage is grounds for striking the statute


down, even though this case involves what we will assume


to be a - an injury that could be remedied under the


Fourteenth Amendment with money damages?


MR. MOORE: Your Honor's question focuses on a


debate that we really haven't engaged in.  It's - it's one


between the respondents and the United States, because in


our view, whether the Court views the statute in its - in


overall operation, or as focused narrowly on the

courthouse access context, either analysis leads to the


same conclusion.


Having said that, I would say that the


prohibition of Title II is a single, unitary, very elegant


one-sentence prohibition in section 12132 of Title 42.  It


doesn't purport to subdivide the statute - the statute's


prohibitions into particular subject matter areas.  And as


the United States points out in its brief, this Court's


prior congruence and proportionality cases in - in the


abrogation context suggest that the Court looks usually at


the overall operation of the statute.


If the Court chooses that perspective on this


problem, we think yes indeed, even if the statute,


assuming the statute, a narrowly-tailored statute could 

have been drafted that would validly abrogate sovereign


immunity in the courthouse access context, Title II's flaw


is that it is not so targeted.  In fact, of the myriad


activities it covers, Your Honor, a very small percentage


conceivably implicate the exercise of any constitutional


right.


QUESTION: Mr. Moore, does Tennessee provide any


cause of action for the alleged violations here, the lack


of access to the courthouse?


MR. MOORE: No private right of action under our


State Public Buildings Act.  Our State Public Buildings

Act, Your Honor, was enacted in 1970.  It applied to all


buildings constructed on or after that date.


QUESTION: So you're satisfied that under


Tennessee law, there would be no monetary relief


available?


MR. MOORE: I think that is - I think that is


right. 


QUESTION: And would there be any enforcement


action at all available to compel under Tennessee law the


courthouses to be accessible?


MR. MOORE: No, Your Honor, because under


Tennessee law, the - the injunction to build fully


accessible buildings applies to buildings constructed


after the enactment of the Public Buildings Act in 1970. 

There is no provision in the Public Buildings Act


requiring retrofitting.  But, of course, in this case,


Tennessee does not dispute its obligation to comply with


Title II, and we do not dispute that our state officials


can be called to account for a failure to comply with the


provisions of Title II in an Ex parte Young action.


QUESTION: Well, do you take the position that


Title II, even if this Court were to find monetary damages


are not available, is there a way to enforce Title II by


the Federal Government against the State of Tennessee?


MR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor, there is, in an

enforcement action by the United States, injunctive relief


and monetary damages would be available against the state. 


In addition -


QUESTION: Under what power?  I guess - I guess


you're arguing that there's no section 5 authority -


MR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION: - for enactment of this provision. 


And that would leave what, the Commerce Clause?


MR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION: And you think it would survive the


Commerce Clause challenge, do you, as applied to states?


MR. MOORE: Your - Your Honor, of course, this -


this case doesn't present that question.


QUESTION: Right.


MR. MOORE: But -


QUESTION: But I'm asking.


MR. MOORE: But we have not challenged and do not


question Congress' -


QUESTION: Other states have though, have they


not?


MR. MOORE: I - it's my understanding that that


claim has been raised in certain lower Federal courts,


yes.


Young -


QUESTION: How about an action under Ex parte

 MR. MOORE: Absolutely, Your Honor.


QUESTION: - against a state official, not for


money damages, but for compliance?


MR. MOORE: Absolutely, Your Honor.


QUESTION: Well, I can understand that if the


state official was standing at the door saying, no, you


cannot bring a wheelchair in here.  But if the building


itself simply does not allow for - for - for ready access,


how would an Ex parte Young action be a source of remedy?


MR. MOORE: Well, of course, Your Honor, Title II


doesn't really apply to buildings.  It applies to


services, programs, and activities, and so long as they -


QUESTION: Well, if the - if the activity - the -


the conduct of - of the business of courts is taking 

place in a courthouse, I think that gets us to focus on


the building, doesn't it?


MR. MOORE: But so long as the - so long as the


court in question offers the service in - in a - in


another venue, for example, as occurred in this case, Mr.


- at every step of Mr. Lane's interaction with the Polk


County criminal court, an accommodation was offered to


him, albeit it was rejected.


QUESTION: So they're - they're saying, look, you


- you could have an Ex parte order - Young order - saying


hold court on the first floor.  That's - that's what

you're getting at?  Okay.


MR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor.  I mean, the - I - I


should think a - a court could fashion whatever remedy is


- is deemed appropriate to ensure that a - a person in Mr.


Lane's circumstance enjoys the full panoply of his - of


his constitutional rights in - in -


QUESTION: But I - I take it your position would


be that under Ex parte Young, a court could not say to a


state official, build an elevator?


MR. MOORE: Well, I think courts have wide


discretion to fashion injunctive relief in Ex parte Young


actions, and if, in a particular circumstance, that were


the only reasonable way of delivering the service, I - I


think that would be inappropriate.


QUESTION: So you would as - as a last ditch, you


would concede that?


MR. MOORE: Yes.  I think - I think in an Ex


parte Young action, courts have enormous discretion to


fashion equitable relief that is appropriate to - to


whatever the particular facts and circumstances are


presented -


QUESTION: But that would still be Commerce


Clause-based, right?  Because you're excluding the


Fourteenth Amendment altogether.


MR. MOORE: That would be true, Your Honor, yes.

 QUESTION: And there is something strange about


that, given that it was Congress' purpose to enable people


to exercise the rights - the full rights of citizenship. 


I mean, it's a kind of a dignity right that Congress was


recognizing, and it doesn't fit as comfortably under the


Commerce Clause, does it, as it would under the Fourteenth


Amendment?


MR. MOORE: I think it fits quite comfortably


under - under the Commerce Clause, Your Honor.  But, of


course, under this Court's case law, in order to invoke


its Section 5 power, Congress had to have evidence before


it or some reason to believe that the states were engaged


in a widespread pattern of violating the constitutional


rights of disabled or - or - of - of whatever group is 

involved, and here there was no such evidence, certainly


not in the courthouse access context.


QUESTION: Well, what about the - that's what I


want to get to.  I - I mean, to put the whole question to


you, I'm assuming we're talking here to use the statute


about judicial or courthouse-related services, programs,


or activities.  So I was seeing this as a kind of as-


applied challenge, and if it's constitutional in this


area, maybe we leave the other areas for a later time.


Now, on that assumption, as you well know and I


do, the majority criticized my appendix in Garrett -

 (Laughter.)


MR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION: - for certain inadequacies.  And among


those inadequacies which it highlighted was, one, the


inadequacy that it talked about public employment instead


of, says the majority, public accommodations and public


services.  Here we're talking about public accommodations


and public services.  Second, the majority criticized it -


I'm, you know, aware of these criticisms, I read them


carefully.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION: The - the - the - criticized it


because the Senate reports hadn't said anything.  Well,


here the committee report talks - says discrimination 

still persists in such critical areas as public


accommodations and public services.  And third, the - the


concurring opinion says there is no record of litigation


on this point and the SG has filed a whole brief with


loads of - and fourth, the majority made a major point of


there being a relaxed, rational basis standard of judicial


review, but here we have access to a courthouse, something


that would seem to call for more strict scrutiny than


that.


All right.  Those are the four things that I


could see as distinguishing this case, and I think it's

reasonable to ask you, why don't they?


MR. MOORE: They don't, Your Honor.  Let me take


each one in turn.  First of all, in the appendix to the


Solicitor General's brief, indeed, if the Court will look


at all of the hundreds of pages of briefs filed in this


case by respondents and their amici, the Court will not


find a single case from a single jurisdiction that has


held that anytime, anywhere in the United States, a


person's fundamental constitutional rights of access to


the courts has been denied as the result of architectural


barriers at courthouses.  And if there's one context in


which one would expect to find case law, it is in the


courthouse access context, because after all, the business


that takes place there is litigation.  We think that is a


particularly telling point.


Similarly, in - we find in the Government's


brief, who has - the Government has called from Your


Honor's appendix the pertinent entries, and we find eight


of them that have sufficient detail that would permit one


to actually ask the question, was a constitutional


violation involved?  And we say that under the - even the


most creative interpretation of any of them, they don't


make out a constitutional violation.  All of the other


references to courthouses in appendix C to Your Honor's


opinion, we've pulled every single one of them, and they

simply - they simply label courthouse facilities as


inaccessible.


But, of course, under the ADA, inaccessible is a


term of art.  It doesn't mean there's literally a wall


around the building and no one can get in.  It means that


they are inaccessible in the sense that the - the


amenities required by the ADA are not present, so that


there are not - there is no evidence before this Court,


and there was no evidence before Congress, that anyone's


constitutional rights, rights of access to the courts,


were being violated as the result of the existence of


these architectural barriers.  And for those reasons, we


don't think the - the so-called task force report, which


is summarized in the appendix to Your Honor's dissent in 

Garrett, helps the respondents. 


There is no mention in the text of the act


itself, of course, of courthouse access, and if one looks


at the Senate and House reports on the legislation, one


will discover that there is not a single mention of the


subject anywhere and no other indication that Congress


thought courthouse access was a matter of particular


concern.


QUESTION: Mr. Moore, I'm sort of concerned about


this.  Our prior cases dealing with this issue of - of the


scope of Congress' - whether Congress' power under the

Fourteenth Amendment has been properly exercised, none of


our prior cases parse it out issue by issue.  Boerne, for


example, doesn't - doesn't just limit it to, you know, to


- to whether, given that there was no - no discrimination


in this case, Congress could move.  You're - what you're -


the State of Tennessee is entirely happy to have us


change course and begin to rule upon congressional


legislation of this sort, case by case -


MR. MOORE: No, Your Honor.


QUESTION: - whether there was enough evidence on


courthouses, whether there was enough evidences - enough


evidence on each of the other innumerable state functions


that - that were covered by this bill.  But, I mean,


that's the argument you're making. 


You - you just want us 

to - to say there's not enough evidence about courthouses,


and therefore, in this case, they can't do it.  And we'll


hear - we'll hear another case further down the line


about, you know, any of the other innumerable state


functions that are impinged upon by this law.


MR. MOORE: I would agree with Your Honor that -


that the Court's prior abrogation cases, each one of them


looks at the overall operation of the statutory scheme and


does not look at its application in a context-by-contact -


context basis.  And we would agree that if the Court


chooses to continue that practice and - and for many of

the reasons discussed in the United States brief, we think


that is probably the better view of it, this statute


clearly falls, because under no circumstances can - can


one say that it - it - it is congruent and proportional to


a valid, remedial objective.


QUESTION: How - how do you do that?  Because if


I think of the antitrust laws, for example, or other


congressional statutes in olden days when the Court, you


know, was worried about the scope of the Commerce Clause,


what would happen is they would say, of course the


antitrust law is valid, the statute's valid, but it's not


valid to apply it to baseball, because baseball's not an


interstate commerce, or it's not valid to apply it to


insurance. 


Well, why wouldn't the Court take the same 

approach here, that this statute may be valid as applied


to X, Y, and Z, where they did have enough evidence, but


not A, B, and C, where they didn't?


MR. MOORE: I - because I think the abrogation


inquiry is fundamentally different.  The abrogation


inquiry focuses on whether Congress invoked its power


under Section 5 in a fashion that is congruent and


proportional with a valid, remedial objective, that being


a - a - an identified pattern of unconstitutional


behavior.


QUESTION: In City of -

 MR. MOORE: And in order to - excuse me, Mr.


Chief Justice.


QUESTION: In City of Boerne, we certainly did


not go in and analyze whether the church has a claim under


the Constitution or not.


MR. MOORE: That's true.  That's true, and - and


the same can be said of the Kimel case.  The Court didn't


focus on the peculiar allegations of the complaint in that


case.


QUESTION: Justice Breyer's question, how can you


do that, reminds me of, you know, there's a story about


the Baptist minister who was asked whether he believed in


total immersion baptism, and he said, believe in it, I've


seen it done.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION: And that - that is surely the


situation here.  We've done it before in - in each of the


other cases involving this area.


MR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor.  The statute lacks


congruence and proportionality also, not just because of


its sheer breadth, which Justice Scalia's question


highlights, but also because in the myriad contexts to


which it applies, it imposes obligations on the state that


go far beyond what the Constitution itself commands.


It really does so in two ways generally.  First,

most of the rules under Title II promulgated by the


Justice Department to enforce its provisions require


states to modify otherwise disability-neutral policies and


practices in order to eliminate adverse, disparate effects


those policies may have on the interests of disabled


persons, whereas, as this Court noted in the Garrett case


itself, under the Fourteenth Amendment, disparate -


disparate effects of that - those sorts, without more, do


not make out any sort of constitutional violation.  Second


- yes, Your Honor?


QUESTION: I was going to ask you to get out of


the courthouse area of the case for a minute.  The


Government's brief contains a statement that in 1975,


approximately one million disabled students were excluded 

entirely from the public school system.  If that were


true, and if - because of their disability, if that were


true, would that constitute a constitutional violation?


MR. MOORE: I don't think we have enough facts to


draw any conclusion.


QUESTION: And then my next question is, there's


nothing in the record - suppose you had several


Congressmen who said, I'm going to vote for this statute


because I'm convinced that this fact is true, but there's


nothing in the hearings, but - but it definitely motivated


the voting of people who voted for this statute, could -

would it be valid in that fact, that situation?  Or do we


have to have evidence in a - in a congressional hearing in


order to justify a congressional decision?


MR. MOORE: I think there must be evidence of a


pattern of constitutional violations, and merely saying


that a particular class of persons is excluded from public


schools, for example -


QUESTION: Is it - is it -


MR. MOORE: - without more information doesn't


permit a conclusion necessarily that a constitutional


violation is going on.


QUESTION: Is it true then that in a case like


this, we must examine legislative history in order to


determine the validity of the statute?


MR. MOORE: Unless - I mean, there are certain


contexts where - where the - the history of discrimination


is so well known and has been documented in this Court's


own opinions, that perhaps that's unnecessary.


QUESTION: Well, it hasn't been - I'm assuming it


hasn't, but it's just clear that the Congressmen who voted


for the statute thought it was true.  They got letters


from their constituents and acted on that sort of


information, and that - but that can never be sufficient


under your understanding of our cases?  It must be


something in the congressional record?

 MR. MOORE: I think there must be something in


the - in the record that establishes a state - state


participation in a widespread pattern of unconstitutional


behavior, yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION: Mr. Moore, you - you don't concede, I


assume, that the Constitution is violated by not - not


providing educational - public educational facilities that


will be accessible to all handicapped persons?  You don't


concede that that's a constitutional violation, do you?


MR. MOORE: No, I do not.  No, I do not.


QUESTION: I didn't think it was.


MR. MOORE: The - the - and in fact -


QUESTION: I mean, you - you need a rational


basis.


MR. MOORE: That's right.


QUESTION: And - and if - if the - the additional


expense for constructing the buildings in - in a manner


that would render them accessible to all handicapped


persons is excessive, it's not a constitutional violation. 


Now, it may be a very bad idea, but we've never held that


that's a constitutional violation.


MR. MOORE: I - I think that's right, Your Honor. 


The only -


QUESTION: So saying that so many handicapped


persons couldn't get into public schools would prove

nothing at all, would it?


MR. MOORE: I think you're absolutely right, Your


Honor.  The only context in which this Court has applied


heightened scrutiny in - in the education context is where


there was a - a - a punitive class-based exclusion, and -


and there only in the K through 12 context, and so merely


reciting that a certain number of students were being


excluded without more information, Your Honor, I think


would not make out a constitutional violation.


QUESTION: Just out of curiosity, in your view,


is the requirement that Congress have a kind of


legislative - I've called it an administrative or court


record - to document the evidence of unconstitutionality


of practices applicable only in Section 5 of the - of the 

Fourteenth Amendment, or is something - is it a


constitutional requirement that applies to all the


provisions of Article I, including the Commerce Clause and


other provisions?


MR. MOORE: Quite frankly, I focused only on this


Court's cases construing Section 5 requirements in this


context.  But I - I think - I think Congress - when


Congress invokes one of its powers in a way that intrudes


upon the sovereignty of the states, it must document that


it has an adequate basis in fact for concluding that that


power exists.

 QUESTION: It's like - it's like a mean question,


because if you - if you answered the question that they


had to be different, I'd said why, and if you answered the


question they'd have to be the same, each of us can cast


our minds over dozens of pieces of important legislation


where, let's say, the underpinning - let's take the


Copyright Clause or let's take any one of a dozen where


there isn't really much of a legislative record. I mean,


that's - do you want to say anything about that?  I mean,


that's the problem I see there.


MR. MOORE: Well, of course, here, this case


deals with a specific context, the - the - the invocation


of Congress' power to - to abrogate the state's sovereign


immunity, and it seems entirely reasonable for the Court 

to construe section 5 as requiring that before the


Congress alters the Federal-state balance in such a grave


way, that it document very carefully its basis for doing


so.


QUESTION: Of course, the - the commerce power


exists whether or not other - other facts are - are


established.  It is a power that Congress always and


everywhere possesses.  Congress does not always and


everywhere possess the power to subject the states to - to


- to lawsuits.


QUESTION: Yes, but -

 QUESTION: That power exists only - only when, as


- as we - we found was not well-enough established in


Boerne, only when there has been a constitutional


violation by the states, so why isn't that an adequate


reason for the difference?


QUESTION: But is that quite correct?  Isn't it


true that under section 5 they prohibited the poll tax and


literacy tests, even though they'd been held permissible? 


They were not unconstitutional, they were prophylactic


measures.


MR. MOORE: But that was, Your Honor, only after


a - a well-documented history of discrimination and


discriminatory application of those -


QUESTION: But you would agree that it's not 

essential that there be a constitutional violation?


MR. MOORE: I - I think there must be evidence of


a pattern of a unconstitutional behavior.


QUESTION: The answer is no.  The answer is no.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION: You don't agree with that.  There has


to be a constitutional violation.


MR. MOORE: There has to be -


QUESTION: The remedy may go beyond the


constitutional violation, but there has to be a


constitutional violation, does there not?

the rest of my time for rebuttal.


QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Moore.


Mr. Brown, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. BROWN


ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS LANE AND JONES


MR. BROWN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


Unlike Garrett and Kimel, and entirely


consistent with this Court's opinion in Hibbs, Title II as


applied to the case that is before the Court today


presents a constitutional application of the powers of


Congress under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. 

QUESTION: When you say, Mr. Brown, as applied to


the case that's before the Court, you're suggesting that


it can be kind of sliced up and just, say, address


courthouses?


MR. BROWN: Your Honor, please, I think the


history that this Court has used in the past is to focus


on the case and the circumstance and the issue that's


before the Court.  The case that's before the Court


involves the fundamental right of access to the court.


QUESTION: Well, but in - in our other cases


dealing with Congress' section 5 power, I don't think

we've taken that position.  We have said, particularly in


the City of Boerne, the Government response must be


congruent and proportional, which suggests that there may


be constitutional violations, but they're simply not


sufficient to justify what Congress did.  That's the


meaning of - I understood - of the term, congruence


proportionality.


Now, if you - if you simply focus down narrowly


enough and say, was there a constitutional violation in


denying the church the zoning, the - that really


eliminates the idea of proportionality entirely.


MR. BROWN: Respectfully, Chief Justice, the way


that I took Boerne was that this Court made a direct


statement to Congress that they had overstepped their 

bounds in interpreting the First Amendment and the


Fourteenth Amendment and its applications.  The Court


looked directly at Congress and said not that in these


particular circumstances, but on this particular


constitutional issue, you went too far.


Now, what we're talking about in this case today


is not about whether or not Congress dealt with a


fundamental right.  That's unquestionable.  Today what


we're talking about here is what I would suggest to the


Court the quintessential element of the Fourteenth


Amendment, and that is the right of each of us as

individuals to due process of law, to life, liberty, and


property.


QUESTION: The legislation doesn't deal with that


constitutional right.  It doesn't - doesn't mention, you


know, due process and - and - and courthouses


specifically.  It - it embraces innumerable things.  And


what you're saying is, because one of the innumerable


things that it embraces happens to involve a


constitutional right, the legislation is a valid exercise


of - of section 5 power as to that particular


constitutional right. 


And I - that doesn't strike me as - as accurate. 


If Congress wants to enact such a sweeping statute, a


statute that - that, in effect, as we said in Boerne --

what was going on in Boerne was that Congress was


rewriting the First Amendment, and here Congress is


rewriting the Equal Protection Clause essentially, saying


that - that - that there must be constitutionally or by


virtue of this - of this supposedly constitutionally


remedially statute, there must be equal treatment of - of


handicapped people. 


And it - it seems to me it's exactly parallel to


what was going on in - in Boerne, rewriting the First


Amendment versus rewriting the Equal Protection Clause,


and we looked at the whole sweep of - of Congress' action,

not just at the particular First Amendment claim.


MR. BROWN: Justice Scalia, respectfully,


Congress does not have a real good record of writing


memorandum opinions.  What it said specifically was, this


law deals with the Fourteenth Amendment, and what the


statute says is that citizens, qualified citizens for


programs and services and activities of the state, have a


right to participate in those activities without having


the onerous issue of their disability come into play.


QUESTION: Mr. Brown, are you saying that these -


what fits within this statute would independently violate


the Constitution, and all that the statute does is


provide, in this case, a damage remedy?


MR. BROWN: I think it does.


QUESTION: So that in - in all the cases that


would fit under this legislation, someone could come in,


say, and seek injunctive relief -


MR. BROWN: Well, absolutely.


QUESTION: - for a violation of a constitutional


right?


MR. BROWN: Well, the beauty of Title II is that


we don't have to chase all those rabbits.  I mean, Title


II gave me the benefit of a trial lawyer in Tennessee


whose sole purpose and interest was, one, to make sure


that our courthouses in Tennessee were accessible, and

two, that individuals that were harmed, that suffered


pain, embarrassment, humiliation, as they individually, on


their own, by virtue of their right under the Fourteenth


Amendment to represent themselves had to crawl up the


stairs of one of our courthouses -


QUESTION: But let's take, say, it's a - it's a


seat in - in a public stadium, which is also covered, or a


theater, and it's inaccessible to certain people with


disabilities, would that be a violation of the


Constitution, for which this statute provides a remedy?


MR. BROWN: It may not provide or deal with a


constitutional violation, but it certainly deals with a


prophylaxis issue.  And - and let me give you this


example. 


Suppose there was a political rally in that 

stadium, suppose the President came to address a large


audience of individuals in that particular stadium, and


those individuals who have mobility disabilities decided


that they wanted to go and hold up a sign that says, Mr.


President, make our buildings accessible.  Is that not


really a fundamental First Amendment right, and the fact


that they can't get there implicates their right to


petition their government?


The concept that we as individuals have a right


under the Fourteenth Amendment to be citizens in all of


its aspects, not just simply in one context that may or

might - may not ever come, surely today in the year 2004,


Congress has the power to ensure that we as individuals


have all the rights of citizenship without reference to


any individual context.


QUESTION: Then - then would you -


MR. BROWN:  That doesn't make any sense.


QUESTION: Would you explain to me the difference


between your position and the Government's position then? 


Because you've - you've gone beyond - at least, as I


understand your answer, you've gone beyond a - a kind of a


strict, as-applied argument, and - and I'm not sure where


you and the - and the Government part company at this


point, if you do.


MR. BROWN: Your Honor, I represent six people in 

Tennessee who are trying to get access to the courts of


our state.  If I can win their cause, then I will be


satisfied with the results that I initiated in 1998 when I


filed this lawsuit.  If I have a responsibility to go


broader and to defend all the other aspects of Title II,


but lose my clients' case, then I have not done them a


service, nor have I done a service to other individuals


who are seeking access.


QUESTION: Is - is your argument still that what


you are complaining of would independently be a


constitutional violation, so that the virtue of this act,

in effect, is to provide a remedy, and that's all we need


to consider?


MR. BROWN: Absolutely, Your Honor.


QUESTION: Okay.


QUESTION: You - we don't have to just say this


one individual, do we?  I mean, there is a pretty good


record here.  I - well, I better not characterize it,


because I come from a certain point of view on this, but


there's a pretty good record, and I felt the Chief


Justice's question was getting to this.  I mean, are you


arguing that if this - this statute could constitutionally


be written giving you constitutionally this lawsuit as a


remedy, in respect to your client that's good enough, that


is a harder argument possibly than to say, well, if it's 

valid in respect to the general problem of providing


judicial services, which is a big category, one whole


branch of the state.  I mean, that category might be


valid.


MR. BROWN: Let me say, Your Honor, respectfully,


I think we do have to establish a category.  I don't think


that Title II nor this Court would ever suggest that


literally every person who comes in with a Title II claim


has to state a constitutional violation, because then it


takes away from the prophylaxis benefits of Title II.


What is says, what Title II fundamentally says,

and literally adopts what I think is the fundamental


purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment, is back to what I


said before.  We as individuals have a right to be there


where our government works and where it operates.  And


George Lane is a classic example of that.  George Lane


confronted as an individual with a misdemeanor charge, a


driving on a revoked license case, the proposition that


the only way he could get to the courtroom where his


liberty was at stake was by crawling.  The state suggests


there were alternatives.  Where were the people offering


to carry him up the stairs the first time?  Where were


they?


QUESTION: There has to be an affirmative offer? 


He could not have asked for assistance getting up the 

stairs?


MR. BROWN: Your Honor -


QUESTION: It's a constitutional violation not to


offer it as opposed to refuse it when he asks for it?


MR. BROWN: Your Honor, please.


QUESTION: I mean, he appears downstairs and -


and he sees one of the constables there and says, you


know, I can't make it upstairs in my wheelchair, could I


have assistance get - getting upstairs?  Now, is that a -


is that a constitutional violation not to have an


elevator for him, but to say, you know, we'll - we'll see

that you are carried up by - by constables?  Is that a


constitutional violation?


MR. BROWN: I think that it is, Your Honor,


because the presumption is that somebody would be there to


carry him.


QUESTION: I - I don't understand that.  It is


because the presumption is that somebody -


MR. BROWN: There is no constitutional right - if


he doesn't have a constitutional right generally to get


there, what gives him the constitutional right to have


somebody carry him up there?  You're asking what George


Lane to rely on -


QUESTION: He has a constitutional right for the


state to provide him the means of being present at his 

trial.  Now, does the means have to be an elevator or


could it be someone assisting up the stairs?  Now, there -


it - it may be less dignified in the latter - in the


latter situation, and that's a proper subject for


statutory activity, but is it a constitutional violation,


so long as the state assures that he can - he can be


present at his trial?


MR. BROWN: His safety, Your Honor, is a critical


issue.  Ralph Ramsey, who is one of my clients, weighs 350


pounds.  To say that he has a constitutional expectation


that one or two or five or the whole battalion of deputy

sheriffs in Cocke County would and could carry him up


those stairs, I mean, what's he going to do, file a


Federal lawsuit to make sure that somebody will carry him


up there?  I don't think he has that right. 


What he has is the prophylaxis benefit of a law


that says we're going to create buildings where people can


gain access to their rights as citizens.  That is as


important to say as it is to say that we all have a right,


no matter what our circumstances, our background, our


class, to get to the civic center of life, public life in


our communities, and that should be done, Your Honor, and


I don't know that you all have ever said that, but that


should be done with dignity and respect that the


Fourteenth Amendment speaks about all of us as 

individuals.  And today I think that is what is so


important and at stake.  This case is not just about


individuals with disabilities.


QUESTION: Probably this is universally accepted


what you're saying, and what I wonder is, is why, if you


could explain it, what your opponent is saying is that to


give people a remedy for the violation of that principle,


it is adequate to have the Federal Government bring a


lawsuit or they bring an Ex parte Young, et cetera,


action.  Now, why isn't that sufficient?

Government was not there the day George Lane confronted


those stairs.  George Lane could not call upon the Federal


Government that day to ensure that he didn't go to jail


because he refused to crawl those stairs.


QUESTION: Neither was a Federal judge who could


hear his lawsuit.


MR. BROWN: And that's why the -


QUESTION: I mean, the Federal Government brings


a lawsuit or he brings a lawsuit.


MR. BROWN: That's -


QUESTION: Neither one of them is there


instanter.


MR. BROWN: Respectfully, Your Honor, that is why


Title II is there, to make the State of Tennessee 

anticipate that problem, solve that problem, so our


citizens don't have to confront those obstacles and face


pain, suffering, and public humiliation as a condition of


citizenship.


Respectfully, Your Honor, please, this deals


again, as I have said, not just with the rights of


disability individuals, but the rights of all of us to go,


to petition our government, to have a right to represent


ourselves in a court of law.


QUESTION: There is a difference, though, if you


talk about non-discrimination, say, with respect to race

or religion, you - you use the word dignity to say the


state has to respect the dignity of every human being, but


to respect the dignity of certain people with disability,


the state has to do more than not harm them, not


discriminate against them.  It has to have a kind of


affirmative action that's permanent, isn't that so?


MR. BROWN: Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, an


elevator to an individual with disabilities is no


different than stairs are to me as a person without


disabilities.  It's the way I get there.  The fact that I


happen to have an opportunity to walk upstairs doesn't


make those accommodations any different to me than it is


with an individual with disabilities.  The point of the


matter is, suppose as in Meigs County, where you've got a 

stairway getting to the second floor that barely one


person can climb up, it's creaky, I mean, are we going to


say if they shut down those stairs, we can haul people up


with a pulley and a rope?


QUESTION: That's not the point that I'm making.


MR. BROWN: I'm sorry, Your Honor.


QUESTION: The point is that sometimes to respect


the equal dignity of a person, we have to treat them


specially, and I think that that's what the elevator is. 


It is special for a class.  It isn't the same as everybody


else has.

 MR. BROWN: Your Honor, I think the word special


accommodation is something that is a problem.  I - I hope


the Court will understand that -


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Brown.


MR. BROWN: I'm sorry, Your Honor.


QUESTION: Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT


ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES


MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


Unlike Title I of the ADA, which regulates


states as employers and treats public and private


employers alike, Title II of the ADA focuses on states and


state governments as governments in their distinct role as 

providers of public services.  As a result, Congress


focused specifically on the conduct of state and local


officials rather than simply extrapolating from the


experience of private employers.


Equally important, Congress in the statutory


findings and legislative reports, the same reports this


Court found lacking in the Garrett case because they did


not include specific findings of public sector


discrimination in employment, those same findings and


reports found persistent discrimination in such critical


areas as access to public services and voting.  Moreover,

as this Court -


QUESTION: That - that - that's persuasive or


not, depending on what was meant by the term


discrimination.  If it simply meant that - that the


handicapped were not accommodated by special provisions,


such as elevators, that might be quite true, but it would


also not be a constitutional violation, would it?


MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I think that


brings us to the second important distinction between


Title I and Title II, which is because -


QUESTION: Well, let - let's stay on your first


one.  I'm - I'm - I'm waiting to hear what - what findings


Congress made that has anything to do with constitutional


violations by the states -


MR. CLEMENT: Well, and - and -


QUESTION:  - which is the premise for this


legislation.


MR. CLEMENT: And again, Justice Scalia, I think


the problem in Garrett, when this Court saw findings of


discrimination in an area like employment discrimination,


that's governed by rational basis review, then there's


very little reason to think that the small "d", if you


will, discrimination Congress found resulted in


unconstitutional discrimination.  But because Title II


focuses on government services, many of which implicate

fundamental rights, there's every reason to believe that


when government - when - when the Congress found - take


voting for example - discrimination in voting, that they


were actually finding unconstitutional discrimination in


voting, because voting and access to polling places


triggers fundamental rights and heightened scrutiny.  And


as this Court recognized in -


QUESTION: Well -


MR. CLEMENT: - in the Hibbs case, when -


QUESTION: These two sections - these - these two


things were debated and - and passed simultaneously, or at


very different times?


MR. CLEMENT: Title I and Title II?


QUESTION: Right.


MR. CLEMENT: They - they passed at the same


time.


QUESTION: And - and they're - they're using


discrimination to mean one thing in - in one half and


another thing in the other half?  That's - that's what you


want to argue to the Court?


MR. CLEMENT: I think whatever way they were


using discrimination, I think that that finding of


discrimination is going to be much more likely to be


correlated with actual constitutional violations in an


area that implicates fundamental rights.  And I think when

there's a specific finding in the text of the legislation


itself of discrimination in voting, I think it's very


likely, given the heightened scrutiny that applies to


voting -


QUESTION: Okay.  You said - but now what - what


does it mean to say discrimination in voting?  Does that


mean that a person was actually not allowed to vote?


MR. CLEMENT: In - in some cases, Mr. Chief -


QUESTION: How - how many cases do they - do you


have where the person was not actually allowed to vote


instead of not being facilitated in the ability to vote?


MR. CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, let me say


the - the relevant congressional committee heard testimony


of individuals that were turned away from the voting place 

on - on election day, so there is that kind of evidence. 


Now, I can't articulate for you how many instances of that


there were.


QUESTION: What - what do you mean by turned


away?  Turned away because there was no elevator?


MR. CLEMENT: Turned away because there was no


elevator, turned away because -


QUESTION: Is - is that a constitutional


violation?


MR. CLEMENT: If - if the voting official tells


the individual, we - you can't vote here, because this -

 QUESTION: He tells them -

QUESTION: - we - we don't have an - we don't


have an elevator.


MR. CLEMENT: Right.  If he tells them -


QUESTION: So if you want to get up to vote, you


have to find assistance to get up there.  It's very bad,


and this legislation is directed against it, and can


remedy it upon a suit by the United States, but is it a


constitutional violation?


MR. CLEMENT: With respect, I think maybe you'd


need to know more, but if the individual in the polling


place is turning people away because of their disability


and they're not offering, don't worry, we have a school 

down the road that is accessible, that's not the facts. 


They're saying, you can't vote, I'm sorry, we don't have


the facilities.  I think that would state a constitutional


violation.


QUESTION: How - how many of these instances did


Congress find of people who were actually refused the


right to vote?


MR. CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there was


testimony of individuals, I don't have the exact number,


and -


QUESTION: What - what order of magnitude?

 MR. CLEMENT: I - I think it was anecdotal


evidence, and I would say - I mean, to give you a feel for


the - the - the sort of order of magnitude, in the state


task force reports that Congress authorized, there were 35


instances of inaccessible voting places.  Now, I can't


tell you the breakdown of how many of those involved


people refused at the door and how many of those involved


simply physical barriers.  But I do think it shows that


there was a significant problem in this area.


QUESTION: I don't think it does at all. 


Inaccessible voting place proves nothing at all.  It just


proves that the state did not go out of its way to make it


easy for the handicapped to vote, as it should, but as it


is not constitutionally required to do. 


To simply say 

many voting places are inaccessible proves nothing at all.


MR. CLEMENT: And again, Justice Scalia, I think


that when you couple an inaccessible voting place with


local officials who are saying, you can't vote today, we


don't have any facilities for you, that does violate the


Constitution.


QUESTION: They're not saying you can't vote,


they're saying we don't have facilities for you to get to


the voting place.


MR. CLEMENT: I - I guess I fail to understand


the difference in that in a practical way.

 QUESTION: I do too.


MR. CLEMENT: And I think this Court has said on


a number of occasions, in areas of fundamental rights, it


is simply not true that only intentional discrimination of


the kind you have in mind would violate the Constitution. 


In the access to court context, in particular, this


Court's decision in M.L.B against S.L.J. suggests that in


many instances in order to avoid unconstitutional


discrimination, the courts have to waive filing fees of


indigent defendants or indigent individuals trying to


provide their constitutional right.


If that's true in areas of fundamental rights,


it's not clear why - why state officials don't have some


obligations under the Constitution itself to make 

accommodations for individuals with disabilities.


QUESTION: I'm not under - I really don't


understand one - one argument that's going on.  I don't


know why one violation wouldn't be enough to justify


congressional action.  It often is that one - one incident


triggers a legislative response.  Why wouldn't one - one


example be enough?


MR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, I think one


example might be enough, especially when coupled by other


evidence in the record that is reinforcing and suggestive


of the problem, especially when coupled with judicial

decisions that we provide in appendix A of our brief.  If


you put all that evidence together, it's clear that


Congress was reacting to a real problem in this context.


QUESTION: And solve that problem by requiring


access to - to state-owned hockey rinks or any state-


owned buildings, whether it's a courthouse or anything


else.  I mean, you're - you're talking about it as though


all Congress was directing this legislation at was - was


the problem of people getting to the voting place or the


problem of people getting to - to courthouses.  That's not


how the legislation reads.  It's all public facilities run


by the state, hockey rinks, whatever.


MR. CLEMENT: That's true, Justice Scalia.  And


let me say two things in response. 


First of all, I think 

Congress was entitled, once it found a problem in areas of


fundamental rights, to say that it's permissible


prophylaxis to - to provide a remedy for a broader array


of government services.


QUESTION: Well, there - do -


QUESTION: Where there are no conceivable


constitutional rights involved.


MR. CLEMENT: Well, if I could respond to that, I


don't think it's that there's no conceivable


constitutional rights involved.  Even in areas that don't


implicate fundamental rights, this Court itself has found

a constitutional violation in the disability context in a


case like Cleburne.  And I think if Congress finds that


states are engaging in unconstitutional discrimination in


areas implicating fundamental rights, that may lead to an


inference that they're simply not turning off the switch


when they get into other areas.


QUESTION: Well, would it - would it be a


violation - a constitutional violation to refuse to afford


special access to a hockey rink?


MR. CLEMENT: I - I don't think standing alone,


Mr. Chief Justice, it would, and I think I would defend


that in part as part of the permissible prophylaxis of the


statute.  If I could say -


QUESTION: This is what I'd like to get at. 

I -


I have the impression from your brief that you were


suggesting that we could just address the fundamental


rights aspect of this case and forget about the rest, but


you seem to be saying now that we should consider the


whole thing and consider it all valid as a prophylaxis


proposition.  Which is it -


MR. CLEMENT: Well, I guess -


QUESTION: - that you're proposing?


MR. CLEMENT: In fairness, Justice O'Connor, it's


both.  I mean, I'm here defending the constitutionality of


the statute as a whole, but I also think it would be fair

for this Court to follow the practice that I think was


suggested in a case it decided called United States


against Raines, and focus in on the aspect of the statute


that is constitutional, that is valid, and that would be


fundamental rights.


QUESTION: Well, we haven't really done that in


other cases of this type, of the sovereign immunity of the


states, have we?


MR. CLEMENT: You have not, Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION: No.


MR. CLEMENT: And we pointed that out, and I


think there is some tension between the proportionality


and congruence test in this as-applied mode of analysis. 


But I do think the Raines case points out -


QUESTION: It was decided maybe 50 years ago,


before any of our more recent cases. 


MR. CLEMENT: I think that's fair, Mr. Chief


Justice.  I simply point to Raines because Raines shows


that there's nothing inherently inconsistent between


analyzing a section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment or


section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment piece of


legislation, an as-applied analysis.  And I think there's


an important relationship between this Court and Raines,


because in Raines, this Court in a sense identified a


fault line in a statute that was broadly applicable.  It

applied both to state actors and private individuals.  And


in a case in which it applied to state actors, they said,


we may have some concerns about whether it can validly


apply to private actors, but we're going to uphold the


statute as applied to state actors.


And in the same way, I think if this Court


thinks that the statute is constitutional as applied to


fundamental rights, but has concerns in its applications


to non-fundamental rights, that it could, in effect,


decide the case along the same lines.  And, of course, the


narrowest ground this Court could decide the case on would


be to simply focus on access to the courts.


QUESTION: Suppose the state is building a new


stadium, a new hockey rink.  Does it have a constitutional


obligation to make it accessible to the handicapped?


MR. CLEMENT: I'm not sure that it does, Justice


Kennedy.  I think that if you isolate the example of the


non-fundamental right and ask the question of whether or


not that standing alone violates the Constitution -


QUESTION: So - so the Government - the


Government's position is citizens don't have some rights


of access to public facilities as a matter of the


Constitution?


MR. CLEMENT: I think they have - they might have


some access under the Constitution and some right.  I'm

not sure though that I'd be able to make an argument that


that constitutional right is protected by something more


than that rational basis review.  I think that -


QUESTION: You're - you're saying that if the


only public facility without a ramp was a hockey rink,


you'd have a tough row to hoe, but if every public


facility, courthouses, schools, et cetera, have no ramps,


then you've got a broader context and you've got a


different argument?


MR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Justice


Souter.  And one other thing I think that's worth bearing


in mind is that -


QUESTION: And what is - what is the


constitutional right?  Freedom of movement?


MR. CLEMENT: In - in - in the hockey ring


context?


QUESTION: What is the - what is the basis for


the constitutional right that you accepted in your


response to your question - in response to Justice


Souter's question?


MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think it would depend on


the facility in particular.  I think in the access to the


- in - in trying to get access to a court, it would be


access to the courts.  In trying to get access to a


polling place, it would be the right to vote.  I think one

thing I'd like to emphasize though is that the - that


Title II -


QUESTION: There's - there's no - there's no


greater right to freedom of movement or general - on the


part of citizens, freedom of access to all governmental


facilities?


MR. CLEMENT: I - I'm not sure that - that this


Court has said that yet.  If it's interested in -


QUESTION: I'm asking your position whether or


not in your view there is such a right.


MR. CLEMENT: It's certainly not one that this


Court has ever articulated, and - and - what I would say


though is that -


QUESTION: So you don't have a position on the 

point?


MR. CLEMENT: I have - it's not - it's not a


matter I've really given any thought, Justice Kennedy.  I


apologize for that.  I think the one thing I would like to


emphasize is that Title II does not just give an access to


buildings, it doesn't give an access to hockey rinks.  It


gives an access to programs, services, and activities, and


in many cases, it's going to be the same municipal


building that has the courthouse in it as well as other


non-fundamental rights, and that's exactly a good


illustration of why Title II is appropriate prophylaxis,

because by making the municipal building accessible, even


for something like a kiddie concert that might not


implicate fundamental rights, you're also making the


courtroom in the same building accessible to individuals


who have a constitutional right to access to that


building.


One other point I'd like to make is with respect


to the damages remedy, which is precisely what seems to be


the gravamen of the concern of the state here.  As Justice


O'Connor pointed out, this is not a situation like other


cases, where, if the Court strikes this down as


inappropriate section 5 legislation, there's going to be


lots of other remedies.  The state provides none and


people are raising constitutional challenges to the 

Commerce Clause legislation. 


The damages remedy that's particularly provided


in Title II of the ADA is provided by double cross-


reference.  Title II incorporates the remedies available


under the Rehabilitation Act, which in turn incorporates


the remedies available under Title VI.  Those remedies are


entirely judge-made, and as the Thornburgh amicus briefs


points out, to the extent that those remedies are the


gravamen of the constitutional concern, their judge-made


origins gives this Court unique flexibility to interpret


the compensatory damages remedy in a way that renders the

statute as a whole constitutional.


Broadly speaking, Congress, in passing this


statute, found a real problem with the individuals and the


entities that are responsible for protecting the civil


rights of everyone, denying the rights of individuals with


disabilities.  One element of its solution was the element


of compensatory damages.  Those compensatory damages are


an appropriate response, but it would be very sad if that


one element of the statute was used to bring down the


entirety of Title II, given that it remains vitally


necessary to make the promise of the Fourteenth Amendment


a reality for individuals with disabilities.


QUESTION: Is there a reason why there's a damage


remedy in Title II and not in Title III?


MR. CLEMENT: I think there is, Justice Ginsburg. 


I think that one thing, I think, is that Congress - the


difference in remedies between Title II and Title III


reflects two things.  One, it reflects a judgment that -


that unconstitutional action by a state is worse than


unconstitutional action by a private entity.

briefly, the type of discrimination Congress was referring


to in the statement of findings of - and purpose of the


act itself is made clear if the Court examines the fifth


finding, which - which tells us what sort - what - what


concept of discrimination was in Congress' mind when they


used the term throughout those findings.  And it talks


about not just outright intentional exclusion, but it


talks about discriminatory effects of architectural,


transportation, and communication barriers.  It talks


about overprotective rules and policies and their effects. 


It talks about failures to make modifications to existing


facilities and practices, and exclusionary standards that


screen people out, in other words, an another disparate


impact sort of conception of discrimination. 

And I think for that reason one can reliably


conclude that - that - that Congress was not using


discrimination in the sense of completely arbitrary and


irrational discrimination of the sort that's prohibited by


section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to


disabled persons, but rather, in the findings and purpose,


Congress makes clear that it is addressing a very real


social problem, one that needs addressing, but one that


does not arise to the level of a - a widespread pattern of


constitutional violations on the part of the state.


QUESTION: But it begins section 5 by saying,

individuals with disabilities continually encounter


various forms of discrimination, including outright


intentional exclusion.  So it seems to want to deal with


it all.


MR. MOORE: Right, but out - of course, outright


intentional exclusion is not necessarily unconstitutional


either if it is rationally based, with respect to disabled


persons.  So one - the use of the term discrimination -


QUESTION: What - what's your authority for that


proposition?


MR. MOORE: The City of Cleburne case, Your


Honor.  Action by the state that intentionally and


expressly classifies on the basis of disability is subject


to minimum rational basis scrutiny, and in the examples 

discussed during the Solicitor General's argument, for


example, the hockey rink example, I mean, one impact of a


lack of ramps or - or -


QUESTION: May I ask you about the hockey


example?  Supposing building a new hockey example, the


architect said you could do it with equal cost, providing


access and not providing access.  Would it be


constitutional assuming there's no extra expense to

lets them in and one doesn't, and the manager says, oh, we

MR. MOORE: That - under this Court's minimum


rational basis jurisprudence, yes, it would.


QUESTION: Do you think the Cleburne case was a

lawyer for a state, we must take what the Court said at
