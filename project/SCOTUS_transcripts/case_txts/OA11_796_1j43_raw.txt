 MR. WALTERS:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK P. WALTERS 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

1

3
4  argument next this morning in case 11-796, 

5

7

9
10
11
12  patented article is sold, it passes outside the 
13  protection of the Patent Act, and it is available to be 
14  used by the purchaser to practice the invention. 
Now, what's the invention here?  The 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21
22  would anybody spend any money to try to improve the seed 
23  if as soon as they sold the first one anybody could grow 
24  more and have as many of those seeds as they want? 
25

invention is a bit of DNA that, when inserted into a soy 
bean seed, makes that seed and all the plants that grow 
from that seed resistant to the active ingredient in 
Roundup.  Now, the only way to practice that invention 
is to plant the seed and to grow more seeds. 

MR. WALTERS:  I agree no one would do that, 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why in the world

is based, I think, on a recognition that contractual 

 MR. WALTERS:  Well, part of the patent 

agency model, but the more I think important --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's true, that's 

 MR. WALTERS:  Correct. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the patent system 

1  and I don't think that is the situation here.  I think 
2  we have, and we have explained how Respondents here can 
3  protect their invention through contracts.  They don't 
4  have to sell it outright.  They can sell it through an 
5
6
7  true in the case of any patented article, right? 
8
9
10
11  protection is inadequate to encourage invention. 
12
13  policy, as well, is to protect the purchaser, and that's 
14  been part of this Court's law for more than 150 years. 
Under Respondent's theory, any farmer who

17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22
23  last sentence.  Any farmer who plants and grows soybeans 
24  is violating the patent? 
25

grows a soy bean seed is infringing the patent, but for 
the grace of Monsanto.  And that's -- a lot of farmers 
in this country, when we have over 90 percent of the 
acreage that is Roundup Ready.  So under Monsanto's 
theory, there is really no limit by the Exhaustion 
Doctrine? 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I didn't understand that 

MR. WALTERS:  Is infringing under license by

Alderson Reporting Company

that the only claim here? 

 MR. WALTERS:  The reach of Monsanto's theory 

1  Monsanto.  Let's take the first --
2
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought that their claim 
3  is that he only violates the patent if he tries to grow 
4  additional seeds from his first crop.  Right?  Isn't 
5
6
7  is that once that seed is sold, even though title has 
8  passed to the farmer, and the farmer assumes all risks 
9  associated with farming, that they can still control the 
ownership of that seed, control how that seed is used. 
10
11
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, not that seed.  It's 
12  different seed.  That seed is done.  It's been planted 
13  in the ground and has grown other seed.  It's the other 
14  seed we are talking about.  It's not the very seed that 
15
16
 MR. WALTERS:  That's correct, Your Honor, 
17  but if we don't apply -- if exhaustion is eliminated, 
18  rather, for the progeny seed, then you are taking away 
19  the ability of people to exchange these goods freely in 
20
21  things that are exchanged, and every grain elevator who 
22  makes a sale is infringing. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I think you may be 
23
24  right in the way you characterize Monsanto's argument, 
25

commerce.  You have essentially a servitude on these 

and I have great difficulties with characterizing it 

was sold.  Right? 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company

goes, but it seems to me it's one way to characterize 

1  that way, as Justice Scalia's question indicates.  But 
2  Monsanto can still prevail if you say that there's a 
3  patent infringement, if he plants it for seed and uses 
4  the seed to replant.  That's not as far as Monsanto 
5
6  their argument and to make it sensible. 
7
 MR. WALTERS:  If you assume that there is 
8  exhaustion in the seeds that are sold to the farmer --
9  let's take our particular case here.  Mr. Bowman went to 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
 Let's take for example Claim 130, which is 
18  at the supplemental appendix 19, that is a method for 
19  selectively controlling weeds in a field.  It has two 
elements; the first element is planting the crop seed 
20
21  and it's a particular crop seed with all the particular 
22  genetics that encode for resistance to Roundup, and then 
23  the next step is to apply to the crop and weeds in the 
24  field a sufficient amount of glyphosate herbicide. 
25

a grain elevator and he bought from the grain elevator 
without restriction seeds to – and it was his purpose to 
plant them.  Now, the only way that he can make use –-
if you assume in the first instance that there is 
exhaustion to the seeds that Mr. Bowman purchased from 
the grain elevator, you are taking away any ability for 
him to use that seed or use the invention. 

Now, if you say that there is exhaustion in

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but you are allowing 

 There are three generations of seeds.  Maybe 

1  the seeds that Mr. Bowman purchased from the grain 
2  elevator, but you say it doesn't apply to the progeny, 
3  you are not allowing him to actually practice the 
4  invention to grow more seeds. 
5
6  him to use those seeds for anything else he wants to do. 
7  It has nothing to do with those seeds. 
8
9  three generations of seeds is enough. 
(Laughter.) 
10
11
 JUSTICE BREYER:  It is for this example. 
12  First of you have the Monsanto, the first generation 
13  they sold.  They have children, which is the second 
14  generation.  And those children have children, which is 
15
16
17
18  he can do what he wants with the first generation. 
19  Anything he wants.  And moreover, when he buys them from 
Monsanto, he can make new seeds.  He can make generation 
20
21  2 because they've licensed him to do it. 
22
23  what he wants with those seeds.  But I'll tell you, 
24  there is a problem because the coming about of the third 
25

 (Laughter.) 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So we are talking here --

the third generation, okay?  So bad joke. 

 Here, he buys generation 2.  Now, he can do 

generation is itself the infringement.  So the second 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company

have infringed Monsanto's patent with that third 

 MR. WALTERS:  No. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, he wouldn't have?  You 

seeds, which happens to do with you pick some grass and 
you intertwine it and various things like that, and lo 
and behold you have a perfect copy of Monsanto's patented 
seed, he hasn't made it, he hasn't infringed?  Why not? 
 MR. WALTERS:  Well, I guess I misunderstood 

1  generation seeds have nothing to do with it.  If he went 
2  into a room and had a box that he bought from a lab and 
3  he put rocks in it and he said, hocus-pocus and lo and 
4  behold out came the third generation of seeds, he would 
5
6  generation, would he not? 
7
8
9  mean if he goes and finds a new way of making these 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16
17  with the grass as with the magic box.  I am saying the 
18  problem for you here, I think, is that, infringement 
19  lies in the fact that he made generation three.  It has 
20
21  coincidence.  But that is, in fact, the way he made 
22  these seeds.  But he can sell, resell generation 2, he 
23  can do whatever he wants with it. 
24
25

 If he sterilizes it and uses them in a 

circus, he can do it.  The only thing he cannot do is he 

your question. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  My question is the same 

nothing to do with generation 2.  That has just a 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Now, what is your response to that? 
 MR. WALTERS:  Justice Breyer, my response 

1  cannot create generation 3, just as he couldn't use 
2  generation 2 seeds to rob a bank. 
 You know, there are certain things that the 
3
4  law prohibits.  What it prohibits here is making a copy 
of the patented invention.  And that is what he did.  So 
5
6  it's generation 3 that concerns us.  And that's the end 
7  of it. 
8
9
is, if you applied the law that way to side making over 
10
11  use, you are eliminating the Exhaustion Doctrine in the 
12  context of -- of patented seeds.  You're saying that he 
13  can do --
14
15
16 
17
18  making or use and it isn't an either-or thing then -- as 
19  the other side has pointed out.  You can use the seed to 
make new seeds.  So use and make aren't -- it's not 
20
21  either you use it or you make it.  You can use it to 
22  make a new item. 
 MR. WALTERS:  Justice Ginsburg, that is the 
23
24  point of the invention here.  If you look at claim 130 
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why --
MR. WALTERS:  -- anything but practice the 

invention. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why -- you said 

again, for example, you are saying he can't practice 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. WALTERS:  No. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So he never has to buy 

any seed, at all, from Monsanto. 

1  claim 130, which is certainly embodied in the seeds he 
2  purchased from the grain elevator. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, suppose he -- he 
3
4  had never bought any Monsanto seeds.  He just goes to 
the grain elevator and 90-odd percent of those seeds 
5
6  have the genetic composition.  So -- and he planted that 
7  and he harvested it.  Would he be infringing on 
8  Monsanto's patents? 
9
10
11 
12
 MR. WALTERS:  Well, in practical matters it 
13  doesn't work that way because the seed that's available 
14  at a grain elevator is not a very good source of seed 
and farmers are not going to be able to eliminate the 
15
16  need to go to Monsanto or the other seed companies every 
17  year by going to the grain elevator. 
 Great evidence of that is the fact that my 
18
19  client, every year that he planted a second crop using 
the grain elevator seed, he bought high quality seed 
20
21  from Pioneer.  Now, if this grain elevator -- grain 
22  elevator seed was so good, why didn't he use it for his 
23  first crop? 
24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm still not getting the 
answer.  I'm going to try once more.  Now, when you buy 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Now, there's another law that says you 

cannot make copies of a patented invention.  And that 

1  generation 2, well, there are a lot of things you can do 
2  with it.  You can feed it to animals, you can feed it to 
3  your family, make tofu turkeys.  I mean, you know, there 
4  are a lot of things you can do with it, alright. 
But I'll give you two that you can't do. 
5
6  One, you can't pick up those seeds that you've just 
7  bought and throw them in a child's face.  You can't do 
8  that because there's a law that says you can't do it. 
9
10
11  law you have violated when you use it to make generation 
12  3, just as you have violated the law against assault 
13  were you to use it to commit an assault. 
14
15
16  with the Exhaustion Doctrine.  It has to do with some 
17  other doctrine, perhaps, that -- that somehow you think 
18  should give you the right to use something that has as a 
19  basic purpose making a copy of itself.  Maybe you 
20
21
22  exception to the Exhaustion Doctrine for 
23  self-replicating inventions. 
24
25

 Now, I think that's what the Federal Circuit 
is trying to get at.  And so it really has nothing to do 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 
MR. WALTERS:  The invention here is --

should, but I don't see that.  Where is that in the law? 

 MR. WALTERS:  Your Honor, that's an 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that there?  Is that --

 MR. WALTERS:  It is not there.  This -- this 

Exhaustion Doctrine, and in fact it's explicitly said it 

buy.  It never permits you to make another item from 
that item you bought.  So that's what I think 
Justice Breyer is saying, which is you can use the seed, 
you can plant it, but what you can't do is use its 
progeny unless you are licensed to because its progeny 
is a new item. 

1
2  is that there in the Exhaustion Doctrine? 
3
4  Court has -- has not created an exception to the 
5
6  won't do that and that's an act -- and that's an 
7  activity for Congress. 
8
9  Exhaustion Doctrine permits you to use the good that you 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  case where we're dealing with the -- the doctrine of 
18  patent exhaustion in the context of self-replicating 
19  technologies.  So what you have here is if you take the 
Federal Circuit's view, then you have no ability -- you 
20
21  have no exhaustion at all for someone to practice the 
22  invention.  Sure, you can do all the things that you 
23  talked about, Mr. Breyer -- or Justice Breyer, but that 
24  has nothing to do with the -- or with the invention. 
25

 MR. WALTERS:  This is obviously a brand-new 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  The 

So you're taking the Exhaustion Doctrine for 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, you just said 


MR. WALTERS:  The Exhaustion Doctrine, the 

have a new -- when you create a copy of the original. 

 So it's -- it's not that we have law in 

that -- that we haven't had a case involving 

1  self-replicating inventions, you're modifying this 

2  Court's case law substantially, and that's something 

3  that ought to be done in Congress.  In fact --

4
5
6  self-replicating.  I mean, the Exhaustion Doctrine was 
7  shaped with the idea of an article; there was an article 
8  that you could use and then you use it and it's used up. 
9  But we haven't applied the Exhaustion Doctrine when you 
10
11
12  place.  We've been dealing with an item with the 
13  Exhaustion Doctrine and now we have hundreds of items, 
14  thousands of items, all growing from that original seed.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, except to the extent, 
23
24  as Justice Breyer suggested, except to the extent that 
the purchase is going to use the article just to create 
25

policy that underlies this Court's cases is 
fundamentally a choice about the purchaser's rights in 
that personal property over the patentee's rights in the 
monopoly to use that monopoly and increase its sales. 
This Court has always chosen the purchaser's rights over 
the patentee's rights to increase sales.  And we're just 
asking you to make the same choice here.

particular genetic sequence that was made, principally, 
by Monsanto's genetic engineers.  And farmers, when they 
plant seeds, they don't exercise any control or dominion 
over -- over their crop.  Otherwise, every year they'd 
have a bumper crop. 

1  a new one of the exact same kind.  And it seems to me 
2  that what you're suggesting is that the basic rule that 
3  says that the purchaser does not get to do that should 
4  have an exception for self-replicating technologies. 
MR. WALTERS:  First, we disagree that the 
5
6  activity of basic farming could be considered making the 
7  invention.  If you read the statute, it says making the 
8  invention, not just making a copy like it would be in 
9  the Copyright Act.  We have the invention, which is a

do any work, they don't lay the soil and the nutrients 
it needs, water when it needs watering, protect it from 
animals?  They do no work --

 MR. WALTERS:  They absolutely --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- in growing the seed? 
 MR. WALTERS:  They absolutely do work, but

do all of the things I said, it doesn't grow.  So aren't

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. WALTERS:  Absolutely.  And -- and that's 

how broad this position is.  It doesn't matter how you 
come into possession with these seeds.  You are 
committing patent infringement if you -- any cell 
division is patent infringement. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true, but that's 

they're not the ones who are making these --

1  they involved in its creative -- in its creation? 
2
 MR. WALTERS:  They certainly aren't in 
3  control of it.  You ask any farmer who's lived through a 
4  drought or through a terrible flood and they will say 
5
6
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you only need 
7  one -- I mean, you throw the seeds on the ground, one or

just as much of a violation.  That's why we, Monsanto, 
25

what I thought you were going to respond.  I thought you 
were going to respond to me that my question then makes 
it infringement when your client buys generation 1 from 
Monsanto because they buy generation 1 from Monsanto, 
they plant it in the ground and lo and behold up comes 
generation 2.  And generation 2, on the basis of what I 
was asking you, is just as much a violation. 

 But I think, though I'll find out from them,

 MR. WALTERS:  Thank you, Justice Breyer. 

patented item, which you cannot do without the approval 

1  give the buyer a license to do it. 
2
 And so it all seems to work out.  You don't 
3  need any exception.  There's no exception from anything. 
4  When you create a new generation, you have made a 
5
6  of the patent owner.  Therefore, Monsanto gives that 
7  approval when you buy generation 1. 
 Now, it seems to me all to work out without 
8
9  any need for exception.  And I'm putting to you my whole 
10
11
12  What Monsanto wants to do in your scenario is they want 
13  the farmer to assume all the risks of farming.  They 
14  want -- but they still want to control and act as owners 
of the property that is owned, no doubt, by that farmer. 
15
16  When that farmer grows the progeny seed, that they 
17  insure the risk that they're not going to have a crop in 
18  the first place.  If they drive to the grain dealer to 
19  sell their harvest -- they get one paycheck a year, by 
the way -- they, if they get into a wreck, that's not 
20
21  Monsanto's problem; that's the farmer's problem. 
 So what they're essentially asking for is 
22
23  for the farmers to bear all the risks of farming, yet 
24  they can sit back and control how that property is used. 
25

And that's fundamentally inconsistent with how this

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And they may -- they may 

1  Court has interpreted the Exhaustion Doctrine.  The 

2  thing that's very important is this is not a license, 

3  this is an outright sale to the farmers of the first 

4  generation. 

5
6  because they have, under the Exhaustion Doctrine, a 
7  right to use the invention, and then those progeny seeds 
8  are owned outright by every farmer, and they assume all 
9  risk of loss.  So if -- if -- Monsanto wants to 
10
11
12  they own them, but that doesn't mean that they are 
13  infringing.  They may -- the seeds are owned by the 
14  farmer.  But when he uses them to grow more seeds, he's 
15
16  ownership has anything to do with it. 
17
18  title.  And those things get sold to the grain 
19  elevators, and now every time the grain elevator makes a 
20
21  something that our law has never allowed for centuries. 
22  And one of the main problems is that you have farmers, 
23  their main livelihood here is to sell the seeds that 
24  they grow.  Now, if they don't have clear title and if 
they don't have the ability to sell the property that

infringing on that patent.  So I don't think that the 

sale, it's technically infringing.  And -- and that's

you are going to make seeds, you leave the crop in 

leave the plants in the ground the same amount of time? 
 MR. WALTERS:  You know, most farmers are not 

1  they -- that they grow, then that impinges upon their 
2  ability to make a living. 
3
4  so far, it's a farming question.  With some crops if 
5
6  longer.  In -- what about soybeans?  If the farmer has 
7  the north 40 and the south 40, the north 40, he's going 
8  to plants soybeans to be used for flour, human 
9  consumption, and south 40, he wants seeds.  Does he

that is very close to the -- to the first generation

Chief Justice asked you what incentive Monsanto would 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Okay. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Walters, could you go 

1  that question. 
2
3
4  back to the Chief Justice's opening question because the 
5
6  have to produce this kind of product if you were right. 
7  And you said, well, they can protect themselves by 
8  contract. 
9
peculiarly insufficient in this kind of a case because 
10
11  all that has to happen is that one seed escapes the web 
12  of these contracts, and that seed because it can 
13  self-replicate in the way that it can, essentially makes 
14  all the contracts worthless.  So again, we are back to 
15
16  incentive to create a product like this one. 
17
18  where -- where Petitioner bought commodity seeds, it's 
19  an undifferentiated mixture, it can't be overemphasized 
20
21  Monsanto from a Pioneer from an Asgrow.  You don't know 
22  the maturity rate.  If I am a farmer, I need a 
23  particular maturity bean for my field because I don't 
24  want it to mature before it gets high enough for the 
25

the Chief Justice's problem, that Monsanto would have no 

 MR. WALTERS:  Taking our example here 

how different every single seed is, you don't know a 

combine to come around and cut it.

 So you want to be able to have -- you have 

just get a mixture, that's not going to be real --

1
2  all these things dialed in, these different 
3  variabilities.  So if you go to the grain elevator and 
4  you don't know what exactly it is that you want and you 
5
6  competitive at all to Monsanto's first generation seed. 
7
 Now, the possibility of somebody selecting 
8  one and saying, ah, that's the exact one that I need for 
9  my field, I'm going to cultivate that and let it grow 
into enough seeds so I can plant my first crop, that 
10
11 
would take a number of years to grow a 1,000-acre farm, 
and it's not -- and by that time, farmers -- the nature 
12 
13 
would have changed and evolved where you would want the 
latest in disease resistance by that point.

So there are --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Please correct me if I am 
17  wrong.  I thought that's exactly what Bowman did here. 
18  He went to a grain elevator and he -- he used the seeds,

4  disease resistance, maturity rates.  And if you are a

8  all the commodity seeds, and then applied the Roundup, 
9  so that all that was left was the Roundup resistance 
10
11
12  look at a field that you plant with grain elevator 
13  seed, it's going to be all different color because 
14  they're going to be all different variety, they're all 
going to mature at a different rate.  So that if -- when 
15
16  it comes harvest time, some of them are going to be too 
17  close to the ground so that your combine's going to 
18  miss --
19

 MR. WALTERS:  Absolutely.

 MR. WALTERS:  Yes. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that doesn't make 

1  a problem the first time you plant? 
2
 MR. WALTERS:  It's a problem each time. 
3  This is a very poor choice -- choice of seed, but it 
4  only makes sense to plant in a risky situation, like 
when a farmer has been washed out from a flood, for

allow these seeds to be dumped into the common grain

client when he purchased them from the grain elevator.

 Now, to answer your question, Justice Kagan, 
22
23  about -- well, under our theory, if somebody does breach 
24  a contract with Monsanto, they don't have to do it under 
25

people going to the grain elevator to plant. 
Nevertheless, it's -- it's an outright sale, an 
exhaustion applies to that particular sale, and permits 
that farmer to use it.  It's never going to be a threat 
to Monsanto's business -- people planting grain elevator 
seed. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So all the Monsanto seeds

1  model, like General Electric did in the 1920s.  And then 
2  that's only fair because there, the agent growers are

4  the farmers are. 
5

16
17  may it please the Court: 
18
19  Court's decision in J.E.M. because I think it largely 
resolves this case.  J.E.M. was a patent case, and the 
20
21  issue there was whether or not you could get a utility 
22  patent on a plant.  The argument was that you couldn't 
23  get a utility patent because the Plant Variety 
24  Protection Act implicitly repealed the Patent Act in 
25

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY, 

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

 I'd like to start by talking about this 

that respect.

Alderson Reporting Company

 This Court rejected that argument, and the 

 And it said, most notably, there is no seed 
saving exemption in the Patent Act, there is no research 

1
2  reason it rejected that argument was because it found no 
3  conflict between the two statutes.  The reason it found 
4  no conflict between the two statutes is because it said 
that it is harder to get a utility patent, and for that 
5
6  reason, you get greater protections -- under the Patent 
7  Act, you get greater rights of exclusion under the 
8  Patent Act than you do under the PVPA. 
9
10
11  exemption in the Patent Act.  The consequence of 
12  Petitioner's argument would be that this Court would not 
13  only be reading a seed-saving exemption into the Patent 
14  Act, and a research exemption, it would be doing much, 
much, much more under the guise of patent exhaustion. 
15
16
17  Exhaustion Doctrine really has nothing to do with this 
18  case, and that's because the Exhaustion Doctrine has 
19  always been limited to the particular article that was 
sold, and we are talking about a different article here. 
20
21  And it's never extended to the making of a new article. 
22
23  this -- the reason it's never is because this is an 
24  entirely different case.  It's the reason it's here 
because you have the intersection of the Exhaustion 
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but I mean, 

 Justice Breyer, as you pointed out, the 

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

Doctrine to articles that reinvent themselves like plant 

talked about exhaustion it has always focused on the 
specific article that's sold and it has done that for a 
reason.  The concept underlying exhaustion is that when 
the patentholder controls that very first sale it gets 
the one royalty with respect to the actual article sold. 

1  Doctrine and the -- the normal protection of reinvented 
2  articles.  So I don't think it gets you very far to say 
3  that we've never applied the Exhaustion Doctrine that 
4  way either.  We have never applied the Reinvention 
5
6  seed. 
7
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  It's true that the Court 
8  hasn't had an exhaustion case specifically involving the 
9  sort of replicating technology, but when the Court has

12 
13 
14

17 
18 
19 
20
21
22  exhausts the patentholder's rights, not only with 
23  respect to that seed, but with respect to all the 
24  progeny seed, we would have to go all the way back to 
the very first Roundup Ready plant that was created as 
25

Petitioner's argument isn't limited to the 

commodity grain that we are talking about.  It's not 
even limited -- when you talk -- Justice Breyer, you 
mentioned the three different generations of seeds. 
There is actually quite a few more generations than 
those three.

 In order to encourage investment, the Patent 

1  part of the transformation event.  Every single Roundup 
2  Ready seed in existence today is the progeny of that one 
3  parent plant and, as Your Honor pointed out, that would 
4  eviscerate patent protections.  There would be no 
5
6  or not even agricultural technology, but it's quite a 
7  bit broader than that. 
8
9  Act provides 20 years of exclusivity.  This would be 
reducing the 20-year term to essentially one and only 
10
11 
sale.  It would be near impossible to recoup your 
investments with that first sale and so the more likely 
12 
13 
consequence is that research dollars would be put 
elsewhere. 
14 
15
16
17  result, but let me give you another horrible result, and 
18  that is if -- if we agree with you, farmers will not be 
19  able to do a second planting by simply getting the 
undifferentiated seeds from -- from a grain elevator 
20
21  because at least a few of those seeds will always be 
22  patented seeds, and no farmer could ever plant anything 
23  from a grain elevator, which means -- I gather they use 
24  it for second plantings where the risks are so high that 
it doesn't pay to buy expensive seed.  Now they can't do 
25

The other --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a pretty horrible 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And there is a number of reasons why that is 

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  And the answer to that is 

this is actually not a traditional farming practice. 

1  that anymore because there's practically no grain 
2  elevator that doesn't have at least one patented seed in 
3  it. 
4
5
6  Despite what Petitioner says, farmers do not generally 
7  go to grain elevators, buy commingled grain, plant it in 
8  the ground as seed.  If you look at the American Soybean 
9  Association brief submitted on behalf of soybean 
farmers, it says as much.  If you look at the CHS brief, 
10
11  which is submitted on behalf of grain elevators, it also 
12  explains that. 
13
14  the case.  They’re the reasons that Petitioner talked 
about, which is that they are an undifferentiated mix, 
15
16  but there are other reasons as well.  The business of 
17  grain elevators is not to sell commingled grain as seed. 
18  If that was their business they would have to comply with 
19  seed labeling laws.  They do not do so because it's not 
20
21
22  And that's why farmers --
 (Laughter.) 
23
24
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and that's why farmers 
25

their business model. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's why it's so cheap. 

want to use it, for a cheap planting. 

28
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

this practice. 

 And again, there is another reason.  Putting 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But correct me -- correct 

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  But farmers wouldn't be 
1
2  able to use it for another reason as well.  Even if you 
3  take patent law and you put it entirely to the side, 
4  there is still the Plant Variety Protection Act. 
5
6  me if I am wrong; I thought that is what Bowman did. 
7
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Bowman did, absolutely 
8  did it in this circumstance.  But Bowman also said that 
9  he is not aware of other farmers who are engaging in 
10
11
12  aside the labeling laws, there is the Plant Variety 
13  Protection Act and, as Pioneer points out in their 
14  amicus brief, it is quite likely that a large amount of 
15
16  but is actually protected by a Plant Variety Protection 
17  Certificate, and what Petitioner did here would infringe 
18  the Plant Variety Protection Certificate.  So even 
19  putting patent law to the side, this is not an 
economically viable source of seed for farmers, 
20
21  regardless. 
 And Petitioner's argument again isn't 
22
23  limited to the grain elevators.  It would apply to 
24  saving your own seed and planting it generation after 
25

the commingled grain is not only protected by patent, 

generation. 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  The patent rights are 

exhausted in the seed at the same time they are 

 Now to the extent --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So when -- when are 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sure, sure, I understand. 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  It would apply to selling 

1
2
3  seeds to your neighboring farmer, and it would allow 
4  seed companies to essentially compete with Monsanto upon 
5
6
7
8  the patent rights exhausted in the seed? 
9
10
11  exhausted with respect to any other product, upon an 
12  authorized sale.  And so, Justice Breyer, again you had 
13  it right when you were saying that you can do what you 
14  want.  In our view, once there is an authorized sale, 
you can do what you want with respect to the seed that 
15
16  you've actually purchased.  That is the tangible article 
17  that you paid for. 
18
19  patentholder in order to make a new generation of seed. 
If -- to the extent, you know, any middle ground is 
20
21  warranted, with all due respect, we would point to 
22  Congress as the appropriate body.  This Court said --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Just so I can follow 
23
24  your -- just so I can follow your answer, Monsanto sells 
25

 But you do need permission from the 

Official 

the first sale. 

the seed to the farmer.  And you are saying if the 

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

exactly what happened here. 

 If you look at the technology agreement --

all the contracts and stuff. 

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Right.  So if Monsanto 

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  If Monsanto authorizes --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm putting aside 

1  farmer grows the seed, he can sell it to anybody he 
2  wants, right? 
3
4
5
6
7  authorized that first sale and authorized the planting, 
8  they would also have to authorize the sale of the second 
9  generation seed because it's a new article.  And that's 
10
11
12  and it's not just because it's a contract because I 
13  think it's significant to the analysis -- Monsanto, upon 
14  the first sale of the bag of Roundup Ready seed, 
authorizes the planting for one commercial crop and it 
15
16  authorizes the farmer to sell that as a commercial crop 
17  or to use it for any purpose other than replanting. 
 That is an authorized sale.  So if you take 
18
19  that second generation seed -- "second generation" is a 
20
21  follow it through, all of the patent rights with respect 
22  to that particular seed have been exhausted.  But you 
23  cannot take that seed without separate authorization, 
24  plant it in the ground, and come up with the next 
25

bit of a misnomer, but if you take that seed and you

in the copyright --

1
2  patent rights haven't been exhausted then. 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  They have been exhausted 
3
4  with respect to the particular article sold.  When the 
Court's talked about patent exhaustion, you are not 
5
6  exhausting the rights with respect to the patented 
7  invention.  You're exhausting --

9  exhausted with respect to the one bean?

19  of software, for example, there are plenty of other 
products where one reasonable use is to make more.  I

21  can purchase software; one reasonable use would be to 
22  make a dozen other copies to give to my friends or sell 
23  on eBay.  It's a reasonable use, but it's an infringing 
24  one.

granted that was on a slightly different issue, but in 
5
6  that case the Court recognized -- that case, it was 
7  copies from a master disk, and it treated them as 
8  separate copies because they were actually separate 
9  articles, even though it was really easy to do, even 
though the actual copying is not done by human hands, 
10
11 
it's done by -- by mechanical processes.  In fact, in 
that case the Court talked and compared the making of 
12 
13 
software to the reproduction through biological 
processes, which is what we are talking about here. 
14 
And so all we are asking the Court to do 
15
today -- I recognize it's a new technology and to the 
16 
17 
extent new technologies require different rules, 
Congress is the body that should be making those

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

1  before launching into our doctrinal position. 
2
 First of all, Justice Kennedy, soybeans are 
3  soybeans.  They are harvested at a particular point in 
4  time, whatever use is going to be made for them.  It is 
not a plant like a flower, geranium for example, which 
5
6  has to be left to go to seed, or alfalfa.  The bean is 
7  the seed. 
 All soybeans have to be processed to be used 
8
9  in any way.  If they are going to be planted, they have 
to be cleaned before they are put in the ground at the 
10
11 
right time.  If they are being fed to either humans or 
animals, they have to be processed in a way that 
12 
13 
eliminates an enzyme that makes them indigestible by 
animals.

16 
17

farmers now just can't do second plantings because 
soybeans are put in huge grain elevators and different 
varieties are mingled, that is true in the sense that if 
one or more of those soybeans were protected by a 
patent, the actual growing of the use of those patented 
inventions without a license would be infringement, 
although, of course, if no glyphosate were put on top of 
it, neither the farmer nor Monsanto would ever know that 
there was an act of infringement.

6  question in the case, which is why would a company ever 
7  want to do this?  I think the answer is that without the 
8  ability -- let's talk about soybeans and then broaden it 
9  to other kinds of readily replicable technologies --
10
11  containing this patented trait, Monsanto could not have 
12  commercialized its invention, and never would have 
13  produced what is, by now, the most popular agricultural 
14  technology in America because, as Ms. Sherry was 
pointing out, the sale of the very first Roundup Ready 
15
16  soybean seed, from which all the trillions of Roundup 
17  Ready soybean seeds in existence now derive, would have, 
18  under Mr. Bowman's theory, fully exhausted not only 
19  Monsanto's rights in that seed that was sold, but in all 
20

of that variety. 

1  But the point is -- and the -- the Federal Register site 
2  for the transformation event with respect to Roundup

4  What happens then is that Monsanto uses those

Monsanto provides the soybeans that it has 
transformed to the seed companies, to the hundreds of 
seed companies for consideration.  Under Mr. Bowman's 
theory, that was it for all of Monsanto's rights with 
respect to this technology.  The very first time it took 
an original transformed seed and sold it to a seed 
company so that it could bulk up and cross-breed and 
produce different varieties, Monsanto had lost all of 
its patent rights.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Waxman, there is a

6  worrisome thing on the other side, though, too.  And 
7  that is that your position has the -- has the capacity

9  highlighted actually in this case by how successful this

14  Roundup seeds there and the person -- farmer is

21  this is probably the most rapidly adopted technological 
22  advance in history.  The very first Roundup Ready 
23  soybean seed was only made in 1996.  And it now is grown 
24  by more than 90 percent of the 275,000 soybean farms in

 But size -- that is, success -- has never 

breed -- breed true, unlike, for example, corn. 

 The point that there may be many farmers 

1
2  been thought and can't be thought to affect the contour 
3  of patent rights.  You may very -- with soybeans, the 
4  problem of blowing seed is not an issue for soybeans. 
Soybeans don't -- I mean, it would take Hurricane Sandy 
5
6  to blow a soybean into some other farmer's field.  And 
7  soybeans, in any event, are -- you know, have perfect 
8  flowers; that is, they contain both the pollen and the

13  some inadvertent Roundup Ready alfalfa in their fields

 MR. WAXMAN:  Of course.  I mean, take the

14  the Chief Justice, that even in the software context, we 
haven't had this case yet.  You did have this case in --
15
16  in Microsoft v. AT&T that involved, you know, 
17  Microsoft's golden disk that has the Windows Operating 
18  System on it, which is patented, and was being exported 
19  overseas for introduction into, you know, computers that 
20
21  was a method of compressing speech, was practiced by the

23
24  writing of the Windows Operating System into computers

1  and when Microsoft did that it did infringe AT&T's 
2  patent, the fact that the copies were made onto the hard 
3  drives of the computer overseas meant that the act of 
4  infringement occurred overseas and there was not an 
export of -- of an infringing product for the purposes 
5
6  of infringing overseas for purposes of Section 271(f). 
7
 So I think you have decided in the context 
8  of software, which of course replicates even more 
9  readily than soybeans do or vaccines or cell lines or 
plasmids, that the copies that are actually made when 
10
11 
a -- a software is written onto the hard drive of a 
computer is a different thing than the disk that was 
12 
13 
sent and is infringing, if it occurs within the United 
States.

16 
 MR. WAXMAN:  So the other one --
17
 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no, I want to go 
18
19  back to a different question that was asked, which was 
the question what do you think we should do about this 
20
21  other aspect of the case, the licensing aspect?  I mean, 
22  I would have thought it doesn't concern Monsanto's 
23  license of generation 1 because, insofar as it's 
24  relevant, here generation 1 carries the license that is 
25

JUSTICE BREYER:  What about -- what about 

the other question --

just permissive. 

46
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 It is to create generation 2.  But -- but 

 MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  Let me -- let me answer 

creating generation 3, namely you can't do that. 

 Now, they -- they thought, the circuit, that 

it's been sold.  And that would seem contrary to the 
First Sale Doctrine. 

1
2  they also said something in the circuit about a 
3  license -- about a restriction, implied perhaps, on --
4  on the use of generation 2 by the grain elevator for 
5
6
7  there's some restriction in a license and they have a 
8  doctrine that seems to say that you can restrict 
9  licenses -- through licenses the use of a product after 
10
11 
12
13  your question this way:  First of all, we don't think 
14  that there's any need whatsoever for this Court -- we 
agree with the government that there's no need for the 
15
16  Court to address the question of conditional sales and 
17  the extent to which patent law recognizes under some 
18  circumstances conditional sales because in this case the 
19  Federal Circuit did not address that ground which we 
20
21  I'm reading from 14a of the petition appendix. 
22
23  commodity seeds are exhausted, such a conclusion would 
24  be of no consequence because once a grower like Bowman 
25

advocated and we still advocate, but instead said -- and 

 "Even if Monsanto's patent rights in the 

plants the commodity seeds containing Monsanto's Roundup 

47
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 In other words, what the Federal Circuit 

decided, and it is entirely correct and it should be 

1  Ready technology and the next generation of seed 

2  develops, the grower has created a newly infringing 

3  article." 

4
5
6  affirmed on that basis, is what you're calling, I think 
7  generation 3, let's say that for simplicity's sake, 
8  since generation 1 is the original soybean sold by 
9  Monsanto to seed companies, let's just say that the bags 
of soybean seeds that farmers go to purchase from seed 
10
11  dealers is called generation N and they are licensed to 
12  produce generation N plus 1.  But then, what about N 
13  plus 2? 
14
 So what the Federal Circuit held is N plus 2 
has never been sold.  It was created, it exists without 
15
16  a sale, and because a sale is the sine qua non of patent 
17  exhaustion, which is also referred to as first sale, 
18  there is no exhaustion. 
19
20
21  privileges the using or selling of the article sold; as 
22  Your Honor's questions pointed out originally, it never 
23  privileges the making of a new infringing product. 
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could -- could you prevail 
in this case if we focused just on use rather than make? 

 Alternatively, the Federal Circuit said in 

any event, even when exhaustion applies, it only

a different question, with I think the same answer --

 MR. WAXMAN:  Okay. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- but I just want to 

1
2  generation N plus 2, the answer is yes, because those 
3  are newly infringing products with no exhaustion of 
4  Monsanto's rights, and as a consequence farmers have no 
authority to use, make, sell, or offer to sell without 
5
6  Monsanto's authorization.  That is a -- just a 
7  straightforward application of Section 271. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Waxman, I want to go 
8
9  back to Justice Breyer's question and reformulate it as 
10

14  page.

Both of you are suggesting, I think -- that 
was Ms. Sherry's last response -- that we were explicit 
enough in Quanta and we don't have to address whatever 
lingering confusion the Federal Circuit may have with 
respect to conditional sales at all in this case?

3
4
5
6
 MR. WAXMAN:  I think that -- I think that an 
7  appropriate case will come up where it will be important 
8  for you to determine that.  And our third argument, 
9  which wasn't addressed by the Federal Circuit and isn't 
necessary to affirm, is that conditional sales are not 
10
11 
ipso facto unenforceable; that is, a -- in an instant --
everybody understands that if instead of selling 
12 
13 
technology, you lease it, and you sign a license that 
imposes conditions on that lease, you know, unless they 
14 
are unreasonable, conditions that are reasonably related 
15
to exploitation of the invention are enforceable.  Mr. 
16 
17 
Bowman acknowledges that.  Everyone acknowledges that. 
 Our single submission here is that where you 
18
19  have a technology that cannot be leased because it will 
20
21  therefore has to be -- an article embodying the 
22  invention has to be sold and where the invention cannot 
23  be commercialized if it -- if the inventor has to 
24  realize its full costs of development and a reasonable 
25

consume itself in whatever use one makes of it, and 

rate of return on the first sale, the fact that there is

 MR. WAXMAN:  Yes, and I think the reason, if 

vaccines.  Because the Roundup Ready gene essentially 
immunizes soybean plants from the herbicide in the same 
way that a life-saving vaccine will immunize individuals 
that receive it from some external -- it wouldn't be a 
herbicide -- a life threat. 

1  this necessary sale in order to commercialize the 
2  invention cannot ipso facto make all such conditions 
3  unenforceable.  And that's all -- if you were to reach 
4  the conditional sale issue in this case, that is all we 
think this case stands for.  And the reason I think --

22  can't, I just can't think of one.

4  to commercialize it, but I want people to be able to

1 percent of the seeds? 

 MR. WAXMAN:  That would be true even if this 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You can't sell them if 

1  days.  But let's have some different commodity where 
2  there are three or four different patented items, but 1 
3  percent, 2 percent of the seeds are in the bin.  You 
4  can't -- you can't sell those.  That seems to me a very

6
 MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I mean, when you say you

9  they know they are going to be used for seeds, and you 
10
11 
12
13  case came out another way, Justice Kennedy.  First of 
14  all, because grain elevators are prohibited by State and 
Federal law from selling seed, period.  They sell --
15
16  they buy grain and they sell grain.  They can't sell 
17  seed. 
 Number 2, almost all varieties of soybeans 
18
19  or other crop plants are currently protected by the --
under the patent -- the Plant Variety Protection Act. 
20
21  As this Court and Congress recognized, the requisites 
22  for getting a certificate are -- I mean, it's like a 
23  registration requirement.

25

 And we know from J.E.M., and the relevant 
provision of the PVPA, that it is unlawful to divert

 That's why the solution for farmers like

conventional seed, multiply it, you know, 20, 30, 40, 
50, 80 times in a single generation and save 1/80th of

buy Roundup Ready technology for his second crop and use 
the glyphosate aerially. 

1  crops that are protected by a PVPA certificate for

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you agree that it's 

unlawful for grain elevators to sell it for replanting? 
 MR. WALTERS:  No.  I do not.  And what he is 

1  real desperate situation, or it may apply to 

2  Mr. Bowman's situation, where he wanted a very cheap 

3  source of seed for his second crop. 

4
places, he discusses how he's gone to the grain elevator 
5
6  over the years a number of times, and how other farmers 
7  have gone to the grain elevator for generations.  So a 
8  ruling in favor of Monsanto here would effectively 
9  eliminate that seed --
10
11 
12
13  referring to is State labeling laws that prevent grain 
14  elevators from actually scooping up grain, packaging it 
up and saying this is seed, because they all look alike 
15
16  to -- to the eye.  And so grain elevators are certainly 
17  not allowed to dupe seed purchasers, but those laws are 
18  there to protect the seed purchasers. 
19
20
21  laws, and it does not violate the PVPA.  I mean, 
22  Monsanto didn't assert a PVPA certificate.  Surely it 
23  has them.  Did not assert them in this case and could 
24  not assert them in this case because there's no single 
variety that Mr. Bowman planted.  So that's not a good

restrictions on how he could use it.  That broke no

6  Your Honor.  That had to do with 271(f), and actually 
7  came out on the side of more restrictive patent rights. 
8  And this is not like software.  This is an invention

computer chips, of course, that were asserted.  And the 
key was that those computer chips practiced the patent.

things that have been sold.

1  grain elevators are mostly people who take these

many -- we talked a bit about the N plus 2 generation,
