The European         Community.             Mr. Katsas.             ORAL ARGUMENT BY GREGORY G. KATSAS                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                 MR. KATSAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               The Second Circuit extended civil RICO to       claims involving foreign injuries, foreign enterprises,      and foreign patterns of racketeering. Its holding is         wrong for two reasons: First, RICO's private civil         cause of action does not provide redress for foreign         injuries; and second, RICO's substantive prohibitions do       not reach the infiltration and corruption of foreign        enterprises.             As to the first point, Respondents have now        abandoned any allegation of domestic injury. That is         fatal to their case because Section (c), the private         right of action in RICO, is limited to domestic         injuries. Two related and mutually ­­                  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If ­­ if the statute        isn't ­­ the statute doesn't say "domestic injury," does         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review it?             MR. KATSAS: The statute ­­ statute says        "injury," Justice Ginsburg, by application of the       presumption against extraterritoriality. Injury is the       focus of Section (c), and therefore, injury is        limited to domestic application absent a clear        indication to the contrary.                That is a straightforward application of       this Court's decision in Morrison, which says you        identify the focus of the provision before you, and you          limit it to domestic application unless Congress says        otherwise.             JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're making a       distinction between RICO when the government is using it         as a prosecutorial tool ­­ tool, and RICO ­­                     MR. KATSAS: Yes. Yes. We are making a           distinction between Section , which is the       underlying criminal prohibition, and Section (c),      which is the private civil right of action. Different          provisions and statutes can have different foci, as        Morrison itself made clear in separately analyzing       Section and Section (b) of the ' Securities Act.                      And ­­ and here the difference between the        substantive prohibition and the private right of action        is clear from this Court's private right of action         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review jurisprudence over the last or years which made          clear that the decision to prohibit certain underlying        conduct is fundamentally different from the decision to        provide a private right of action for violation of          substantive law.              That's why Section (c) has a different        focus. You don't automatically assume that because        Congress criminalized the conduct, it intended for the        private right of action to follow along to the same          extent.             JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Katsas, can I ask a          question that ­­ this is an analytical question, not         necessarily at all an argument that your result is         wrong, but I ­­ I guess I'm confused by what you said              now and what you say in the briefs that this is a matter              of looking to the focus of the statute, because my          understanding of Morrison is that this whole focus        inquiry came in at the second step of the analysis.                      In other words, once the Court had decided        that the presumption against extraterritoriality had not       been rebutted, then there was an additional argument        that had been made like, oh, this really does involve          domestic conduct. And so the Court used this focus test           to decide whether it was the domestic conduct or the          extraterritorial conduct that was the focus of the        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review statute. But that doesn't seem to answer the question          whether the presumption is rebutted at all, and it         doesn't seem to answer the question that I think you're           trying to get at, and it's an important question, as to           whether we look at that presumption question section by         section or for the statute as a whole.                     MR. KATSAS: I think the ­­ the rule that           emerges from Morrison is that what ­­ what has to be           domestic is the statutory focus. Morrison is Section         (b), and there were two choices. There's the element          of deception, and there's the element of the securities         transaction. And it's foreign transaction, domestic       deception. And the Court says no ­­ no clear          indication.             Congress can obviously provide for or      prohibit extraterritorial application if they do that       clearly. If they don't do that clearly and ­­ and the            presumption is going to operate, you have to figure out          whether the focus of the statute is one element or the           other. And they said the focus is the transaction and,           therefore, that is what has to be domestic, and because          the transaction in Morrison was foreign, the application        of the statute was impermissibly ­­                 JUSTICE KAGAN: I ­­ I guess I just would             have thought that the question is whether these are         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review discrete provisions in some way such that a conclusion          is to the extraterritoriality of one doesn't really        effect ­­ doesn't tell you anything about the        extraterritoriality of the other. And it seems much         less important as to what the focus of the statute as a            whole is even if, you know, one could ­­ if one could            answer that question.               MR. KATSAS: There ­­ there will always be a          question ­­ if you have related provisions, there will         always be a question of whether the ­­ the focus of one             element in a statute carries over to the other.                      This case on the ­­ on the question of         injury, the issue before you is whether Section (c),         the private right of action, has its own focus or          whether it just travels ­­                JUSTICE BREYER: Excuse me. Why ­­ why         did ­­ look ­­ look at the first example of what Justice            Kagan is talking about, Appendix B of the government's          brief, U.S.C. (b), jurisdiction over acts of        violence against a person at an international airport         outside the United States if the offender is found in          the United States.               Now, that ­­ I can understand why they would          make that a crime.                 MR. KATSAS: Sure.    Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             JUSTICE BREYER: Why would they put it in         RICO unless they wanted somebody who was hurt to be able           to get damages?               MR. KATSAS: Well, the person ­­ the person         who was hurt ­­ as to the injury part ­­                     JUSTICE BREYER: The injury is to somebody        at the foreign airport.                MR. KATSAS: The person ­­ the person who         suffers injury from violation of that Act can't recover         under RICO, because RICO is limited to recovery for         business or property. Pursuant ­­                 JUSTICE BREYER: Look, business is hurt.       They blew up an airport in ­­ in Tasmania. Okay? So ­­             so I guess that blowing up an airport there could hurt            somebody. But my question is, what was it doing in           RICO, if in fact Congress doesn't intend a foreign          person hurt to be able to get damages? It's already a            crime.                         MR. KATSAS: RICO ­­    JUSTICE BREYER: That's my ­­ and maybe this         is the wrong example. Think of ­­ they have a list of              about .                          MR. KATSAS: Right.    JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So some of them, I          can ask this question to: What's it doing in RICO           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review unless they want somebody to get damages?                   MR. KATSAS: It ­­ there are something on         the order of predicate statutes that are in RICO.          And the Solicitor General's appendix has ­­ cites about          of them, which have extraterritorial application.       All but seven of those statutes have domestic, as well          as extraterritorial application, including the one you       just read.              When you look at the government's appendix,       what many of those statutes do is they take a statute,            statute has domestic application, and then there's a        provision that extends it extraterritorially. And       what's quoted in the government's brief is the extension         for extraterritorial application.               So I think what your question goes to is,          well, what about the ­­ what about statutes that are          exclusively extraterritorial? There are seven of them.        Only ­­ only one of them out of the RICO predicates            was specifically mentioned in RICO as one statute that         it should apply.               JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So your point        granted is one word ­­ three words. Your answer to my            question is four words: It was an accident.            That's the answer.              MR. KATSAS: No. I'm not saying it was an           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review accident.             JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then, if it was not         an accident ­­ I mean, explain to me the same question.            I don't want to repeat the same question five times.                      majority ­­             MR. KATSAS: All ­­ all but ­­ the vast          JUSTICE BREYER: Listen, let's look at the        ones that were not, that are the seven, or if you want,            the three. Why would a human being ­­ now you've got my              question.                         MR. KATSAS: Yes.    JUSTICE BREYER: Why is it in RICO if they          don't want damages?               MR. KATSAS: Let's ­­ let's talk about the         one that I mentioned. It's U.S.C. , that that            addresses child ­­ child pornography offenses abroad       with an intent to import into the United States.                     That provision has perfectly meaningful     application for people who suffer ­­ people who suffer         domestic injuries, and for United States enterprises ­­       United States racketeers who could use domestic       enterprises to violate that provision.                 And even if I were wrong about that, Justice          Breyer, I don't think you would use the one provision           out of as the basis for saying that the ­­ the            Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review statute that on it ­­ in the heartland of its          application will do lots and lots and lots of meaningful          work when it's applied to domestic injuries.                   The related point, this isn't just the       presumption against extraterritoriality. We also have       the background common law rule that causes of action to          redress private injuries are governed by the law of the          place of the injury. Here we have only foreign          injuries. Congress legislates against the background       common law rule, and just as the cause of action in RICO            picks up background common law rules, approximate cause,        so too it picks up this lex loci delicti rule, again           absent some clear indication to the contrary.                   When you look for a clear indication with         respect to the question of injury, not only don't you          find a clear indication of the contrary, you find in the            statutory findings in RICO a ­­ a repeated and specific            and exclusive focus on the domestic effects of        racketeering.             Congress has identified its concern. It is        ­­ it is impact on the American economy from         racketeering. Certainly no clear indication to extend        the cause of action to foreign harms.                   JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that may have been        true, or largely true at the beginning, but how about          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review all these amendments that happened after / which        clearly seemed focus on foreign conduct, foreign       organization, foreign harm?               MR. KATSAS: There's ­­ there is one        amendment that is cited, it's the Patriot Act, which         does one thing to RICO. It expands the list of           predicate statutes to include one provision. It's         ­­ b(g)()(B). It's a reference to that statute.          When you go to that statute, it's a list. The list has               or so terrorism­related predicate crimes. of         those crimes have domestic application.                 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, possibly they have       some domestic application. But if you ask, but why did           Congress pass this amendment at this particular moment        in time, what was ­­ I mean, recognizing that it's           sometimes hard to figure out what was in people's heads,          I mean, don't you think that what was in Congress's          heads at that moment in time was foreign terrorist         organizations committing terrorist conduct on foreign      soil?             MR. KATSAS: We ­­ we don't know for sure.          I'll give you another possibility, which is what they         had in mind was the September attacks, which were          domestic acts of racketeering. When they incorporated        that list that I mentioned, the very first statute on           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review that list is destruction of a commercial aircraft.                                             JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, this just means ­­       MR. KATSAS: Which is the very offense ­­        JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ foreign organizations,      even as to that.                            MR. KATSAS: I'm sorry?     JUSTICE KAGAN: That at least suggests       foreign organizations.              MR. KATSAS: Well, that ­­ that at least         explains the incorporation of the ­­ of the predicates         relative to the events of September , but in any          event, with respect, I don't think that's the right          question because where the presumption applies, either       ­­ either on the question of injury, which I've been          discussing, or on the question of enterprise versus        pattern, again, the rule for Morrison is that you         identify the focus and then you need a clear indication           in the statute to the contrary.                  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you deal with        Judge Lynch's example? There's a foreign terrorist         organization. It operates only abroad, but it        repeatedly cuts off the heads of U.S. citizens.                    MR. KATSAS: That would ­­ that would be ­­         foreign terrorist organization ­­               JUSTICE GINSBURG: Operating only abroad but       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review its targets are all U.S. citizens.                  MR. KATSAS: I think the ­­ the underlying          acts would be criminally prosecuted and could be        punished very severely. RICO ­­ if I understand the           hypothetical, the organization is foreign. In our view,         RICO doesn't cover that. Here's ­­ here's why.                     JUSTICE KENNEDY: Either civilly or      criminally?             MR. KATSAS: Correct, because now if I'm ­­        I'm turning to Section . Our position is that the           focus is on the enterprise. And I understand the           hypothetical to be a foreign enterprise doing a lot of            very bad things.               JUSTICE GINSBURG: And doing bad things to        U.S. citizens. It's the example the ­­ the section that           makes that a crime is (a)().                   MR. KATSAS: And ­­ and (a)() would be         prosecutable by the government. And the people who did          those bad things probably would face the death        penalty ­­             JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it ­­ so you're        saying only the act itself you can't superimpose RICO,         because there has been a whole pattern of these.          They've cut of a hundred heads.                   MR. KATSAS: If it's ­­ if it's a foreign           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review enterprise, that's right, and here's why.         Because you  ­­ you have to evaluate that hypothetical in the context          of RICO. The hypothetical is designed to make it hard           for me to make it seem as though the enterprise is the            bad actor.              But under Section (c), the enterprise is       the victim of the corrupting conduct. Even in your          hypothetical, the enterprise is legally distinct from       the person ­­ person is the defendant ­­ the person          doing the corrupting. Moreover, the hypothetical you        described, the pattern itself is not actionable under        RICO.             JUSTICE GINSBURG: You ­­ Judge Lynch, in        that ­­ in his opinion on the en banc, he said, "Any            interpretation that suggests the operatives of a foreign         enterprise can't be held accountable under RICO for a         pattern of predicate" ­­ "a pattern of predicate crimes         that violate Federal statutes" ­­      "Federal statutes  that have an express extraterritorial reach would       astonish the Congress that made such violations RICO        predicates."             MR. KATSAS: Because the focus of       Section is the enterprise, and under Morrison the         enterprise has to be domestic, absent a clear indication          to the contrary.   Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             All of those predicate crimes are addressed       by the underlying criminal statutes. RICO doesn't        prohibit the pattern. What it prohibits is infiltration         and corruption of the enterprise.                 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the ­­                 MR. KATSAS: Think about ­­                 JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, the whole point of          RICO is that it does both. It says "a pattern of            conduct," and it links that pattern of conduct to the          enterprise. And it seems to be, you know, a little bit             of a fool's errand to decide which the focus is, when ­­            when RICO is clearly something that melds the two and          says there is a pattern of conduct and it relates in            various kinds of ways to an enterprise.                   MR. KATSAS: Perhaps, but you could have        said the same thing about Morrison, under which you need          both deception and a securities transaction in order to          have a Section (b) violation. So ­­                    JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the fact that some        things can be separated doesn't mean that everything can         be separated. And the question is, how is it possible           to understand RICO except as something in which these         things are intermelded, and at the very least that ­­         one is not prior to the other or more important than the            other. Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review               I mean, if we are going by our cases, we've         said about a hundred times that it's the predicate acts           that are ­­ that are the foundation of RICO.                     MR. KATSAS: Congress has ­­ Congress has        told you in the statutory findings what they are         concerned about. It is infiltration and corruption of         domestic enterprises. Consistent with that is the        structure of Section , three different provisions;       in each of them, the enterprise ­­ the enterprise is the           victim of the corruption. It's not the person doing the           corrupting.             It's particularly obvious with respect to      Sections (a) and (b), right? The racketeer uses         proceeds to invest in an enterprise. Enterprise is the          victim. That's the object of Congress's concern. Even          with regard to (c), the typical case they have in          mind is infiltration and corruption of a domestic         enterprise, straight out of the findings.                  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you would ­­ you would         say ­­ I mean, the ­­ another example doesn't say the             ­­ the ­­ the Sicilian Mafia commits a series of violent            crimes in the United States that would violate RICO if          committed by a New York­based Mafia family. But ­­ so            the New York­based Mafia family, RICO applies.       Sicilian­based does the very same act; doesn't apply.        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review                         right?             MR. KATSAS: The ­­    JUSTICE GINSBURG: That is your position,       MR. KATSAS: That's right. The ­­ the         concern about the crimes is addressed by other statutes         which criminalize the conduct. When the Sicilian Mafia         commits ­­             JUSTICE GINSBURG: And not the pattern.       It's just that the statute gets at after the individual          instance. RICO says when you have a pattern, things are            a lot tougher for you.                 MR. KATSAS: So it says ­­ says when you          have a pattern, that impacts an enterprise.                    And if I could just get on the table the           question about the (c) issue with regard to domestic         enterprises. The paradigmatic case that Congress has in         mind, the racketeers infiltrate the union, use       racketeering proceeds to take it over ­­ that's the         (a) violation ­­ and then they use the union to do           bad things, to extort money from its members or         whatever. That's a case in which the union is the            vehicle for racketeering, but it's not the racketeer.        It is the victim of criminal conduct. The conducting          the affairs of the union in that way is an example of            corrupting conduct.  Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             I'd ­­ I'd like to just get one more thought          on the table on the injury point before I sit down,            which is this Court's decision in Empagran, where you         applied the presumption and related principles of comity        to a case involving a ­­ foreign injuries caused by            primarily foreign conduct. And you said it would be so           unreasonable to do that as to violate customary        international law. That is exactly what we have here.          If you look at the complaint, the underlying conduct         that Respondents say injured them are a series of          foreign transactions, and you can resolve this case        based on Empagran alone if you wish to not write more           broadly.                         I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   Ms. Goldenberg.                      ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG      FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,                         SUPPORTING VACATUR              MS. GOLDENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may        it please the Court:                I'd like to talk about both the enterprise        and the injury points, but I'd like to start with the           enterprise point, because Section most directly       affects the government's ability to bring RICO       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review prosecutions and RICO civil actions.                   And as some of those questions have pointed      out, there are a number of predicates that are          incorporated into RICO, into the definition of       racketeering activity, that have extraterritorial     applications. Some of them have solely extraterritorial        applications. And that is a clear indication that RICO           itself extends extraterritorially to the extent that the        predicates that are alleged in the case do. And that is            true both of the pattern itself, the conduct of the          crimes, and also of the enterprise. And you can see           that, if you look at the kinds of predicates that we are            talking about here.               As was observed earlier, many of them were        incorporated into RICO after /. Many of them         involved terrorist conduct. And the natural way in         which the provisions would operate and Congress would        have understood this is that they would have swept in          activities by foreign enterprises as well as the foreign         conduct itself. We've given a number of examples of           those kinds of provisions in our brief: The killing of           the U.S. national abroad, taking U.S. hostages abroad,        shooting at aircraft with U.S. citizens abroad with        missile systems.              There is another example that is, I think, a          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review very clear one, that is Section D, which is         receiving military­type training from a foreign       terrorist organization. Although I suppose it is         possible that somebody could go and receive that        training in connection with their activities with a        domestic enterprise, the very natural operation of that        provision is going to be that they are going to be           carrying out the affairs of a foreign enterprise ­­ in           fact, a very foreign terrorist organization ­­ that is          holding the military­type training and has those       training camps.              And so we think that it's clear that the         provision has ­­ that Section has extraterritorial        applicability, both with respect to the foreign pattern        of conduct and with respect to the enterprise, to the          extent that a predicate with extraterritorial       applicability is implicated.               I've heard Petitioners talk about two      reasons why they think that might not be true, both of           which I think are incorrect. One is that the government            could just prosecute the underlying crimes themselves       and not use RICO, and the other is that ­­ well, in            situations in which you have some people in the United          States, you could kind of break them off and call them a            domestic enterprise. And I don't think either of those           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review is a workable approach to Section .                    With respect to just prosecuting the      underlying crimes, of course the very point of RICO was          that Congress thought, where there were patterns of        serious crimes, that just prosecuting the crime itself        was not a strong enough tool for the government, and           that it was important for the government to have these          special advantages that RICO confirms in order to root         out the things that are causing these patterns of         crimes.             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But RICO imposes, it        seems to me, as we've even observed in the domestic          context, far more significant ­­ the impact       internationally could be far more significant than       prosecution simply of the underlying offenses. It        obviously provides the government with extremely strong       prosecutorial reach and penalties, far beyond what the        substantive elements do. And I'm wondering why that         shouldn't cause us to be more concerned with respect to          the comity interests that are at stake when you're         talking about extraterritorial applicability.                MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, I think, as this         Court observed in Empagran, when you're talking about        Section or something like Section , where it is          the government that is choosing whether to prosecute or         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review whether to bring a civil action, the government has the           ability, it has the incentive, to take those kinds of          concerns into account and to regulate itself, either to         be constrained in bringing that kind of action where it          might cause some comity concerns, or to deal        government­to­government with another government, to try      to make sure that those comity concerns are smoothed         over. It's on the private side, under Section (c),          where you have private parties bringing treble damages        actions, that the concerns about comity, I think, are          much greater, because private parties don't have that        same ability or incentive to regulate. When they are          bringing actions, they are trying to get their treble         damages.             JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I thought this was         the same question, but I'm elaborating a bit because          it's both for you and Mr. Frederick's reading.                      I thought the answer to my first question       would be that the government just wanted the forfeiture         provisions ­­ that's why it put them in ­­ or the           criminal provisions ­­ that's why it put these other         things in ­­ and you say, that's right. You say, but            they didn't want the damages to extend abroad. That's          your position.              MS. GOLDENBERG: Yes. That's correct.       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review JUSTICE BREYER: You wrote it into your        MS. GOLDENBERG: Yes.    JUSTICE BREYER: And you're the State                   brief.                         Department for this purpose, and you ought to know.                     But then they're the EU, and moreover, not        only do they tell us that the nations of the EU don't             agree with you, but in fact, what's very confusing about          this is, in the Alien Tort Statute case ­­ which, after           all, involved torture, and not simply money       laundering ­­ the EU countries, at least three, were in          here with briefs ­­ I think it was Germany, the           Netherlands and Britain ­­ saying, stay out of this         stuff. Not completely, but basically. And you were on           the other side. Okay? So what's going on?                      (Laughter.)             JUSTICE BREYER: That is, I mean ­­ and it's           not just a ­­ that's not a criticism. We have to write               this. And I think what you think and what those            countries think is very important in matters like this.         And here they're taking what seem to be contradictory         positions. Who do you talk to? Who do they talk to?                         Is this the right hand not knowing what the         left hand is doing in Britain and in ­­ and in Germany?                        Is it that no one actually spoke to anybody         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review except the lawyer at the EU, and then the EU never spoke            to anybody in any of the relevant Ministries of Justice          or Embassy?              Is it that you actually went and talked to         the ambassadors of England, Germany, the Netherlands and        asked them why do you want us to take a different            position in this case than ­­ it seems to be ­­ than you             took in the other case?                   I mean, I have a few pages here. I can't             work with a few pages. I have no idea what the right               result is here in one important aspect unless I know           what afterthought and consideration you, the State       Department, and those other countries, and their       ambassadors, et cetera, actually think.                 Do I have enough here to deal with it? What            do I do?                MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, I think you do have          enough here to show what we actually think.        Mr. Frederick ­­              JUSTICE BREYER: Did you consult with the        embassies? Did the State Department go out and ask them           to have their legal departments over in Germany look up          what the actual effect would be of the damages? Or was            it the EU that bore total responsibility for this matter          without even consulting from Brussels what happens in        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Germany or some other place? I mean, how did it work?                         MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, to my knowledge, we        didn't have those consultations, although I understand        that the EU informed the Justice Department before it         filed the ­­              JUSTICE BREYER: And did it consult with the         other three? You see where I'm going, and I'd like your            best answer ­­              MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, I think that this is          a very unusual case where you have foreign sovereigns as          the private RICO plaintiffs. I think that won't usually           be true. And the rule that we are coming in here to             advance is going to be the rule for the usual case, as            well as the unusual case.                 And so although it may be that, you know,         the EU has special views about comity concerns here         where it's the plaintiff, in the usual case the         plaintiff is going to be a private party, and it's going            to be a situation in which the conduct and the injury            took place somewhere else. And the country where that          conduct and that injury took place may very well have          its own interest in regulating, may not be appreciative         of plaintiffs being able to come to the United States to           get remedies here, particularly treble damages remedies,       which, as this Court pointed out in Empagran, is         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review something that often causes foreign countries a great         deal of consternation ­­               JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's ­­ why isn't forum        non conveniens the answer to that? If ­­ if ­­ the            question is, where should ­­ who should provide a remedy           to this conduct, and if it's ­­ really is centered in           that other state, a forum non conveniens motion should          be ­­ should be made to dismiss the action, because it's           a far more appropriate forum abroad.                  MS. GOLDENBERG: This Court suggested in       Empagran that going case­by­case with this kinds ­­       these kinds of comity concerns was too burdensome and         too difficult for courts, and it would be better to make           a blanket judgment about the comity concerns with        respect to the cause of action as a whole. And here, of              course, we're talking not only about what court you're         going to be in, but what law is going to apply.                       The courts in the United States are not        being closed to RICO plaintiffs if they can't bring a          private claim for treble damages under Section (c).        There may be other kinds of claims that they can bring.                       This is a question about whether, under this         particular Federal statute, there is a recovery that's         ­­ that's permissible. And ­­                 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. ­­ please. Sorry.        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             MS. GOLDENBERG: Well, all ­­ I was just          going to say that in addition to comity concerns, I          think there are other things that point in the         direction ­­             JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, then, can I interrupt         and talk about your comity concerns, because I        understand them. I mean, they seem very important. But            once you say that the presumption against       extraterritorial is rebutted, on both the pattern of        racketeering and the enterprise, once you say that, then         drawing the line where you draw it seems to be very           policyish. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of law             behind it. So I want to give you an opportunity to make              it as law­like as you can, drawing the line here.                      MS. GOLDENBERG: Sure. There are a number          of things, I think. One is that just on the face of the               provisions, you can see that Section (c) is not         co­extensive with ­­ with Section . Congress chose         to provide for recovery only for injury to business or          property, not for personal injury, even though many of         these predicates might be likely to cause personal        injury.             In addition to that, I think you have the          comity concerns, which are an important underpinning of        the presumption against extraterritoriality. And as       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Petitioner's counsel pointed out, you do have this        background common law rule that the place of injury is          going to be the place where ­­ that ­­ that's going to            have the law govern whatever injury you're talking about         rather than the law of some the other jurisdiction.                     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   Mr. Frederick.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief       Justice, and may it please the Court:                   The European Union and of its Member        States brought this case in the United States against a          United States corporation for the actions it committed        in the United States and from the United States, that          had effects in Europe. This was a completely logical           and natural place for this case to be brought ­­                     JUSTICE ALITO: Why is that? Why is that          so, Mr. Frederick? Isn't it rather strange that         countries in Europe, Member States of the European        Union, are suing in the courts of the United States for           injuries sustained to their business interests in       Europe? Why didn't they just sue in their own courts?                       MR. FREDERICK: Well, first, the fact that        RJR has no subsidiary in Europe raised a question of           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review personal jurisdiction that would have affected the       enforceability of judgments. And you had an issue where          you had Member States that were being affected, and          the logical place for them in working together would be          in the United States court.                 For precisely the reason that when the legal        advisor in testified after this Court's Pfizer        decision about the applicability and reciprocity of       having foreign countries come to United States courts,        the legal advisor testified that the United States had         brought cases in over jurisdictions around the world.                     JUSTICE ALITO: Well ­­ well, are you saying         that the ­­ the law of personal jurisdiction in the ­­          the Member States of the European Union is similar to          that in the United States, that they would not ­­ under           their laws, they would say they do not have personal          jurisdiction over RJR?               MR. FREDERICK: Justice Alito, what I'm       saying is that it varies among the Member States. But           what we do know is the defendant, the evidence, the          witnesses are here in the United States, and the         allegation is that they violated U.S. law. And it is           the same kind of action that the United States has          brought in European Member States for many, many        years ­­ Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review JUSTICE BREYER: Did you, in fact, ask them?         MR. FREDERICK: We did ­­ we ­­       JUSTICE BREYER: What happened there?                                          Because look, I'm faced with a situation where the State           Department is telling me one thing. And ­­ and I ­­            it's an area I don't know about. What will really            happen in international relations? That's their job.        And you are representing the EU, which seems to be          taking a position somewhat different than it took         previously, and I want to know who did you talk to.                                                MR. FREDERICK: Justice Breyer ­­     JUSTICE BREYER: How ­­ how did it work?         MR. FREDERICK: Thank you for asking me this         question. We presented information to the U.S.        officials before the suit was filed, and were told that          the U.S. would be neutral as to it.                    Furthermore, I can tell you that in years          of practicing before this Court, this is the single most          comprehensively vetted exercise on my brief that I have          ever had.              EU officials have gone over every single       line and compared with the positions taken by Member         States in other cases. And the reason why this isn't           important to the EU, and the consistency with which         those positions is made, rests on four very important         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review principles.             When Congress extended RICO    extraterritorially, there are one of four components       that is present in every single one of the ­some          statutes that the Solicitor General puts in Appendix B:         The victim is an American; the defendant is an American,          the perpetrator; there is effect on U.S. interests; or         there is conduct that occurs in the United States.                     Every one of those four components tracks       with an important principle of international law. The         extraterritoriality principle, the nationality    principle, the passive protective personality principle,      and the protective personality.                So these issues are things that Congress was        considering and was aware of when it made the decision          to extend these crimes extraterritorially ­­                 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if ­­ if ­­                   MR. FREDERICK: ­­ it posed a domestic         requirement. Sorry.               JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you prevail, and there        is a case with mostly foreign conduct and foreign          injuries, and if personal jurisdiction and forum non        conveniens are satisfied, then these actions could be        brought under RICO in foreign courts, correct?                   MR. FREDERICK: Sorry. In foreign courts,        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review or in the United States?                             JUSTICE KENNEDY: In foreign courts.      MR. FREDERICK: Well, not under RICO. I         don't think that a foreign government or foreign country          would be using the law ­­                 JUSTICE BREYER: Let's say a private person         is injured in England can bring a ­­ I take it bring a               suit in English court and invoke RICO.                                           MR. FREDERICK: Not that I'm aware of.        JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why not?     MR. FREDERICK: Because I'm not aware       that ­­ that the English courts would apply RICO in this           case. I have no brief to defend, Justice Kennedy, in            this respect.              JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're saying it       applies extraterritorially.              MR. FREDERICK: No, what ­­ what it does,         Justice Kennedy, and this is why it's actually important         to go through statute by statute all of the provisions          in the Solicitor General's appendix, and we've got a         binder that's got every single one of them, and you can           ask me about every one.                 Congress imposed a domestic proof      requirement as to every extension of extraterritoriality       for those crimes. The victim had to be an American.           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review The defendant had to be an American. Conduct had to           occur in the United States or there had to be some           important interest of the United States that was at         stake. If those four elements were not required or not           part of the statute, then it would not track with the           normal international law principles by which nations       respect through comity the regulations of conduct       emanating from the shores of that country.                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the victim         here was the European Community.                 MR. FREDERICK: It is, but the Defendant is         an American and conduct was occurring here in the United          States. And if you look at the money laundering          statute, Mr. Chief Justice ­­                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I just          thought earlier you were citing it. You said the victim           is the ­­              MR. FREDERICK: One of those four ­­                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, it's just one.                    MR. FREDERICK: All I'm saying is one of the          four. Here we have two of them. If you look at the              money laundering statute, conduct occurred in the United        States and the defendant was in the United States         national. And so international law is satisfied.        Comity principles are satisfied.    Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             In those cases, like the Alien Tort Statute        where you did not have a cause of action that had been             drafted by Congress and so, therefore, you did not have          a legislative determination of the effect on comity        interests internationally, you're left with a situation        where you had judge­made law, and this Court, I think           appropriately, followed the guidance and advice of       foreign nations which said, be careful how far you         extend judge­made law.               There is a different principle at stake when         there is a considered legislative judgment and the         limitation on that extraterritorial impact is one that        has a very clear tie to the United States.                      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You ­­ you can        easily ­­ you can easily envision situations where        private parties prosecuting RICO actions for ­­ against        European entities might implicate serious comity      concerns whether the racketeering enterprise is a       State­owned actor or an ­­ an entity that's strongly         supported by the ­­ the government. And in those          situations, how would comity concerns of the foreign        government be taken into account in the private treble         damages action?              MR. FREDERICK: So it's hard for me to see,          based on your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, which of         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review the predicate crimes would be asserted as the underlying         pattern of ­­ of racketeering. I've actually thought of          a lot of them.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So here we have        racketeering ­­             MR. FREDERICK: I haven't found one.                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah.                 MR. FREDERICK: I haven't found one.                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Here the ­­ you have         racketeering activity that goes to the illegal       trafficking and cigarettes, right?                MR. FREDERICK: Yes.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, I mean, what         if ­­ what if ­­ and you have a ­­ domestic crime             predicates, what ­­ what if the cigarettes were marketed         through, you know, I don't know, an enterprise very          important to the government of ­­ you know, some         government that sells cigarettes, the ­­ you can imagine         other products.              In other words, it's ­­ it's ­­ here you         have sort of an organized crime enterprise. But the way           the racketeering statute works, and we have a lot of           experience with this domestically, it reaches far beyond        what you would have thought Congress had in mind when it           used the word "racketeering" and certainly involves       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review otherwise legitimate enterprise.               MR. FREDERICK: But, Mr. Chief Justice, my        point is that if you look at each one of the acts that             is incorporated and has an extraterritorial component,       there is a direct tie to the United States, and the            crimes have to be unindictable under Federal or State         law.             So with respect, I think what you're        hypothesizing is a situation that would be a null set,            and that's where these crimes are occurring in Europe         under European member State laws, and somehow there is         going to be a tie in to RICO, that wouldn't be possible             under a plain reading of the RICO statute.                     JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because it's only the       statute that has the extraterritorial ­­ the       extraterritoriality built into them.                            MR. FREDERICK: That's correct.     JUSTICE GINSBURG: Most statutes that are ­­       crimes that are punishable under RICO will have ­­ will          not have the extraterritorial provision in the       underlying statute.              MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. There are        roughly three­quarters of the statutes that are       incorporated into RICO that do not have an        extraterritorial effect, and those would not be subject        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review to a RICO case that would have extraterritorial         consequences.             JUSTICE GINSBURG: Candidly, is ­­ why is        the EU suing here? Does it have something to do with no             one else having a treble damage provision like RICO?                      MR. FREDERICK: Actually, treble damages are       not at all the reason why this case was brought in the            United States. And, in fact, if you want me to           stipulate that we will not accept treble damages, I've         been authorized by my clients to say that that is not           what we are seeking here.                 What we are seeking here is a situation         where an American company is operating through largely        illegal cutouts and middlemen and organized criminal       operators in Europe and in the Mediterranean and        violating and affecting European enterprises.                 The complaint in this case, which is very        detailed with respect to the introduction of cigarettes        made and marketed in the United States are targeted to          foreign country audiences, but they are being sold        through illegal channels through Panama, through other       countries and into Europe through organized crime and        drug cartel operators.                 I have seen the evidence for this. I have          looked at the documents from RJR. I can tell you this             Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review is the most serious misconduct, and it involves very,         very serious allegations that have been proved by the         internal documents of the company itself.                  JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it ­­ isn't it strange         for a government to choose to sue in the courts of            another country?              MR. FREDERICK: Well, in fact ­­                  JUSTICE ALITO: Unless there is something to        your personal jurisdiction point, and I really ­­ my          understanding of ­­ of the law of a lot of the European             countries is that they have a very broad understanding          of personal jurisdiction. But putting ­­ putting that         aside, it would seem very strange to choose to sue in           the courts of another country.                 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Alito, if ­­ if the         European nations know that they are eventually going to         have to come to the United States to enforce the          judgment and there is no ­­ there are no assets to           attach in Europe by RJR, because it doesn't have         subsidiaries there, the simplest thing to do would be a          one­step process.              This suit was filed almost years ago, ,          years ago and we are still at the motion to dismiss            stage. You can imagine that from the perspective of          litigation efficiency coming into the home forum of the         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review defendant and saying, we believe you are violating U.S.         law and we seek redress for that, that is perfectly          appropriate.             If I could turn to the injury question, the          RICO statute incorporated language of the Clayton Act        which, before , had been construed to permit foreign         plaintiffs to come into the United States and obtain         foreign damages as a result of U.S. violations by the           company in the United States.                 The Continental Ore case, which was decided       by this Court in , is directly on point. That case            holds that injury suffered by Canadian entities could        come in and come into the United States and get damages           as a result of the violation of the Clayton Act.                       In Pfizer, the government of India, coupled       with governments in Iran and the Philippines, came to         the United States and alleged that Pfizer owned ­­                    JUSTICE BREYER: I'm ­­ just a moment. I           know this. You're absolutely right on that. The ­­ the            question that ­­ can you, when ­­ when you sue ­­ the EU             sues, A, an American company. Now, it's been in league           with six foreign countries, and they have agreements.        And what the crime is, is money laundering, and the          money laundering took place in Belgium, and you win.         Now, can you go to Belgium and get the damages? You            Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review see?             There are six Belgium banks. They are not         accused. They are unindicted co­conspirators.      And under this ­­ does this statute allow a ­­ the EU to              come to Philadelphia, find RJR, accuse them of money         laundering with unindicted co­conspirators in Brussels,      get damages, and then go to Brussels and collect them          from the other banks?                MR. FREDERICK: I ­­ I would assume that the            Belgium courts ­­ and I'm not going to profess to be an            expert on the enforceability of judgments in Belgium,        Justice Breyer, and so I give you that answer.                      JUSTICE BREYER: But do they get a judgment          against the foreign bank?                MR. FREDERICK: To get a ­­ well, presuming          that there was personal jurisdiction in the United        States, assume ­­              JUSTICE BREYER: The EU ­­ the jurisdiction        only against RJR unindicted co­conspirators or helpers,       whatever.             MR. FREDERICK: I ­­ I don't know the answer            to your question.               JUSTICE BREYER: I think they are worried         about something like this. I think that's what the           State Department is worried about.     Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             MR. FREDERICK: Here is the answer, though.        The answer is that if those Belgium banks are in a           conspiracy with RJR, it surely cannot be the case that          U.S. law does not cover RJR.                  If there is a question about the        enforceability of a judgment against the Belgium banks,         presumably the Belgium banks will make that argument,        and they will claim in Belgium that ­­ that somehow a           suit prosecuted in the United States in which they were          co­conspirators is somehow not going to cover their        activity.             Our point is that it can't be the case         where, for centuries, the United States courts have been         open to allow foreign plaintiffs to come in alleging         injury caused by U.S. actors under U.S. law, that         somehow we're going to read the Morrison principle as a          way of constricting the available remedies. Nothing in         Morrison suggests that you would do that kind of         extraterritorial slicing and dicing,     where  once you had   concluded that the underlying action      here  was one that   observed and respected international     norms  and went to   extraterritorial lengths provided in     this  case, that  there is a tie to the United States.           And  whatever remedies are available are available.                 And after Pfizer, a number of        U.S. companies  Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review were concerned about it, and they went to Congress and          they asked Congress to restrict it. And the hearings          that we have laid out in our brief ­­ and this is page             , note ­­ goes into the legislative history of          this. And the State Department, Justice Breyer, took         exactly the opposite position, because the State       Department said, reciprocity demands that we be allowed        to go into other nations' courts and the availability of          our courts for foreign nations to come in for violations          of the U.S. And if you look at footnote , which is on              page , the State Department testified to Congress that         the United States had brought more than actions in          nations around the world.                So the idea about comity is one that,        respectfully, is a decision that is made by Congress,          and it is not for the executive branch to change its           position for the purpose of trying to snuff out a remedy            that otherwise would be available to a foreign         plaintiff.             JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. ­­ Mr. Frederick,        I understand that argument with respect to what's the         ordinary remedial provision of a statute. But this is           something a little bit more than that, right? Because           this statute also ­­ this provision also includes        substantive elements that don't apply except in the        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review civil suit for damages. Isn't that right?                                difference?             MR. FREDERICK: That's true.     JUSTICE KAGAN: So why doesn't that make the         MR. FREDERICK: It could. And, Justice        Kagan, if you were to decide that the three verbs that           are in (a), (b) and (c), which are influencing,         buying, or investing in, had to have a domestic          component, we still would satisfy that, because our        allegations in the complaint are that RJR from its         corporate headquarters in New York and Winston­Salem was        engaging in those conducts to effect and corrupt the         foreign enterprise, or the domestic enterprise, as was        the case with Brown & Williamson.                   JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if we look just at         (c) and apply the Morrison analysis in a        straightforward way, would that analysis work in this        way? There isn't any reference in (c) to         extraterritorial application. And where would be the        focus of (c)? Would it be the injury to business or            property?             MR. FREDERICK: So, Justice Alito, I would         have two responses. ', , incorporates directly        . So there is a direct reference to the definition            of "racketeering" that has the some predicate acts         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review that have a clearly textual extraterritorial effect. So          I think that by incorporation, you would interpret it         that way.              And the second thing is that when Congress        used that language in , it was tracking the Clayton          Act. And the Clayton Act had a ­­ a predetermined and              pre­understood meaning as to what those words meant.                    JUSTICE ALITO: But at that time, RICO would         not have an extraterritorial application, would it?                   MR. FREDERICK: No. My position is that the          ­­ the extraterritorial application has gotten stronger       over time, but if you were to adopt the normal canon of            construction, which is that when Congress adopts words        in a statute, they carry with it the meaning that this            Court has given those words. The same words are in the            Clayton Act as they were adopted in , and as Justice           Kagan pointed out, the case has only become stronger         with the Money Laundering and post­PATRIOT Act additions        of those predicate acts.                But the third answer I would give you,         Justice Alito, is that even in Morrison itself, the         Court's opinion says once we have found there to be          extraterritorial application, it's not for us to be        deciding that there are different provisions that       shouldn't have that. And that's essentially the        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review argument that is being made as to take an extension of           Morrison beyond where the Court was ­­                  JUSTICE BREYER: But there is a problem with          the Clayton Act, even at this time. It's been a           nightmare for foreign countries, and there has always        been controversy around it. And there were cases called          Tamburlaine and others which, you know, led ­­ led to          the kind of thing that the SG has described in his           brief. So the Clayton Act is helpful in one respect,           but not helpful in the other respect.                   MR. FREDERICK: And my answer is, Congress        has addressed some of those concerns in the antitrust         area with various amendments that affect ­­ that ­­ that          only go to conduct.                And classically, what Congress is getting at       is conduct, not remedy. But in the conduct area, what           Congress has done in one of the antitrust amendments for          the Sherman Act was to say, we are only going to affect            foreign conduct if it has a domestic effect, but it is            still a focus on conduct and not on remedy. Congress is             very well­equipped to deal with this issue should it         proceed that ­­ there to be a concern, but Justice           Breyer, I would point out that it would be odd to            suppose that Congress is intending to turn the United         States into a place where criminal activities could         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review occur from the United States that was affecting our         closest allies and there was nothing those allies could         do about it by going into the United States and trying           to vindicate and ­­ and seek redress for those harms.          That would be a very, very stark departure from this           country's long history of having respect and ­­ and         provide a remedy for foreigners who are harmed by          actions of the United States and its citizens.                    If I could just address the ­­ I think I've            addressed the Empagran question, because that's the       statute that was affected. And if I could just note            that the PATRIOT Act ­­ footnote of our brief points           out that then­Senator John Kerry, now Secretary of        State, was very conscious of the effect that this would          have on foreign nations and foreign litigants. And when          the PATRIOT Act extended certain of these predicate acts         into RICO, he stated on the floor ­­ we cited the           provision in our brief ­­ the reason for doing that was           to give foreign nations that had been affected and who          were treaty allies an opportunity to come and seek         redress in our courts.                The last point is that Mr. Katsas noted the         choice­of­law principle, where there is a foreign injury         and there is a decision to apply foreign law, and he            says, why shouldn't that apply here? That only applies          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review where there is a conflict between the laws that would           apply here ­­ we are asserting that there is a U.S.            statutory violation by a U.S. company for actions that          it committed in part in the United States. There's no           reason to apply a choice of law, because you have a            foreign company that is ­­ or foreign interests that are          asserting a violation of U.S. domestic law.                    In every instance where Congress made the       decision to apply RICO extraterritorially, it imposed       important domestic proof requirements. That is the        limiting principle on which the Court ought to decide         this case.              Thank you.                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       Mr. Katsas, you have four minutes remaining.                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. KATSAS                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS                 MR. KATSAS: Justice Breyer, you asked about        government's positions.              The United States is the party that has to         live with the consequences of your decision one way or          the other. They are telling you here that there is a            comity problem with respect ­­ there is no inconsistency         with what they said before. In Empagran, they told you           the same thing: That providing remedies for foreign         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review injuries caused by largely foreign conduct would be a         problem.             The EU is here as a party in this case, but            take a look at what they said in many other cases where             they were in the more detached position: As an amicus           in OBB, in Kiobel, in Sosa, and most importantly, in          Empagran itself, which is the case involving foreign        injuries caused by largely foreign conduct. They said         in that case there would be a huge comity problem with            extending American law.               With regard to comity, Justice Kagan, you       asked is it ­­ is it too policy­ish. It's not because            you have all of these background presumptions and        principles. I spoke about the presumption against         extraterritoriality and about the common law background       rule of lex loci delicti.                   A third principle is the Charming Betsy      canon, that you construe Federal statutes not to violate         international law absent a very clear statement to the          contrary, and that's what we have here, because Empagran         says that applying U.S. law to provide redress for         foreign injuries caused by largely foreign conduct would        be unreasonable, and therefore, a violation of customary         international law.              You also ask why draw the line at injury?         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Once you established the underlying, the underlying       predicate applies extraterritorially.               First reason is that the decision to create        a private right of action is ­­ is different from the           decision to criminalize the conduct. The money        laundering statute applies extraterritorially, but     there's no private right of action for people injured by          money laundry.              The second reason is that Empagran applies       that principle to the question of injury, and        specifically does so with regard to the very antitrust         provisions that were in effect pre­, in effect when         RICO was enacted to say there's this category of cases          involving foreign injury where the government can       prosecute but the private party cannot bring an action         for civil redress.               And that's an important distinction     precisely because private parties are not constrained by        prosecutorial discretion. It is aggressive to apply        American criminal law, but at least the government ­­        the Justice Department has to talk to the State         Department and take into account any comity concerns,        any problems that particular prosecutions might bring.       That is not the case with respect to private plaintiffs.                      JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Go ahead.       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             MR. KATSAS: Mr. Frederick said that the        underlying predicates here track international law.      That is true to ­­ in the sense that they are written to             be consistent with Section of the third restatement         of Foreign Relations, but there is an independent        requirement that the application in a particular case         must be reasonable under Section . That is the          provision that you invoked in Empagran. That is the          position ­­ that is the problem with this case here.                      Finally, Mr. Frederick said this case      involves United States conduct. Petitioners are four        transactions removed from the original problem in       Europe, and two transactions removed from the cigarette        sales. All of ­­ all of those involve European          transactions. And Reynolds' alleged conduct involves       transactions in Europe, Central and South America.                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       The case is submitted.
