 (11:04 a.m.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

next in Case 09-571, Connick v. Thompson.

 Mr. Duncan.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART K. DUNCAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. DUNCAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case asks when a district attorney's 

office may be liable under section 1983 for inadequately 
training prosecutors.  The Petitioner, Orleans Parish 
District Attorney's Office, was found liable for the 
terrible injuries caused to Mr. Thompson by a Brady 
violation on the theory the office was deliberately 
indifferent to Brady training, this despite the fact 
that there was proved no pattern of previous misconduct 
by office prosecutors.

 The district court exempted this case from 

the ordinary pattern requirement by making a flawed 
analogy to a hypothetical in this Court's City of Canton 
opinion.  There, the Court suggested that a city may be 
liable, absent a pattern, if it fails to inform police 
officers of the basic constitutional standard for deadly 
force.

Extending that hypothetical to this case was 

error.  It misunderstood Canton's distinction between 
single-incident and pattern liability, nullifying 
Canton's stringent standards of fault and causation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't this something in 
between?  Because in Canton, the hypothetical was one 
rookie police officer.  Here, it wasn't one rogue 
prosecutor.  There were four prosecutors who knew of 
this blood evidence, and there were multiple 
opportunities for them to disclose it, but four of them 
apparently thought it was okay under Brady to keep this 
quiet.

 Now, if we were just talking about -- what 
was his name, Deegan? -- it would be a different case. 
But we have the three other prosecutors.  And so I think 
it's questionable to characterize this as a single 
incident.

 MR. DUNCAN:  I understand your question, 

Justice Ginsburg.  Our argument does not turn on whether 
it was one or three or four prosecutors.  What our 
argument does turn on is that the theory from the Canton 
hypothetical, which does not require a pattern, was 
clearly at issue in this case.  The district court 
analogized to Canton in order to allow the jury to find 
liability absent a pattern.

There is no question that, whether it was 

one or four prosecutors, this is a single incident of a 
Brady violation.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, this is a 

single incident, and Canton said if you know that a tort 
is likely to happen without training, then one incident 
is enough.

 Every prosecutor knows that there can be 
Brady violations if people are not taught what Brady 
means, because it's not self-evident in every situation, 
correct?

 MR. DUNCAN:  That's -- that's true, Justice 

Sotomayor.  Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So if you 
know that rookie prosecutors -- and most prosecutors' 
offices are filled with young ADAs who have just come 
out of law school.  If you know that they are going to 
meet some situations where the answer is not intuitively 
known, like that if you get a lab report, you should 
turn it over, don't you have an obligation, isn't that 
what the jury said, to train them to turn over lab 
reports?

 Now, I know you claim you had that policy.
 MR. DUNCAN:  Correct.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We can talk later about

whether or not there was sufficient evidence for the 
jury to disbelieve that you had that policy or not. 
That's a sufficiency of the evidence question.

 But if you know that lab reports have to be 
turned over, you've conceded it's a Brady violation not 
to do it, and there was sufficient -- and you had no 
policy -- I know you are disputing that -- and you had 
no policy of turning it over, why aren't you responsible 
for a Canton-like violation?

 MR. DUNCAN:  The question is under the Brady 
scenario, which side of the Canton line does it fall on? 
Does it fall on the single-incident line or the pattern 
line?  We say it falls on the pattern line.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Life doesn't always come 
in just two categories, and my suggestion to you is this 
doesn't fit into a single rookie.

 You have -- if you have four prosecutors who 

are not turning over this evidence, then it seems like 
there's kind of a culture in the office that we don't 
turn over -- either we don't understand Brady, because 
one suggestion was -- well, having the blood sample will 
show you -- you'd have to have the blood sample from 
Thompson to have it mean anything.

 So there was misunderstanding about that. 

But what struck me was that the -- to shoehorn this into

a single incident, it doesn't fit.  So we have a 
situation maybe that hasn't -- that we haven't directly 
confronted before.

 MR. DUNCAN:  I think the Court has in 

Canton, Your Honor.  Let me answer it this way:  If we 
pay close attention to the function of the 
single-incident hypothetical in Canton, I think it 
illuminates the kind of notice, the kind of fault, and 
the kind of causation that needs to arise out of a 
general situation.

 So looking carefully, what Canton said is: 

A policymaker who fails to give police officers the 
basic constitutional standard for deadly force, which 
they are not equipped to know in the beginning, and 
without which they --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you tell me -- I 

think I have a copy.

 MR. DUNCAN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  Yes. 

This is -- this is -- I'm referring to the -- the basic 
Canton standard is at 390, page 390 of the Canton 
opinion.  And specifically, the footnote is footnote 10, 
that discusses the two possibilities, the no-pattern and 
the pattern possibilities.

 So -- and I'm reading from Canton at 

footnote 10.  City policymakers know -- "For example,"

the Court said, "city policymakers know to a moral 
certainty that their police officers will be required to 
arrest fleeing felons.  The city has armed its officers 
with firearms, in part to allow them to accomplish this 
task.  Thus, the need to train officers in the 
constitutional limitations on the use of deadly force... 
can be said to be 'so obvious' that the failure to do 
so" is "deliberate indifference."

 Now, what we have there, as Justice 

O'Connor's concurrence in that case and then later the 
Court's opinion in Bryan County explain, you have a 
failure to inform city personnel of the basic standard 
without which they have no hope of doing their job in a 
constitutional manner.  So you put your employees in a 
situation of impossibility, and when a deadly force 
violation occurs, what you have --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  These are people who 

haven't gone to law school, right?

 MR. DUNCAN:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And do not know that you 

cannot apply deadly force in most circumstances?

 MR. DUNCAN:  They've got no background 

equipment to know what the constitutional standard is. 
And so that satisfies, in a general situation --

lawyers, it might have been different.

 (Laughter.)
 MR. DUNCAN:  It could be, Your Honor.
 Here, you're giving --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Depending on the law school 

they went to or what?

 {Laughter.)
 MR. DUNCAN:  It could be.
 However, what you are giving to lawyers here 
is the task of analyzing legal judgments.  Can lawyers' 
judgments go astray, Justice Sotomayor?  Absolutely. 
Absolutely.  But --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now what you're 
suggesting is that for certainty you know that a 
lawyer's judgment is going to go astray because a 
particular area of law is that complicated.

 Your people disagreed -- some of your people 

disagreed or didn't know whether turning over a lab 
report was a -- failure to turn over a lab report when 
you didn't know a defendant's blood type was a Brady 
violation.  That has been conceded in this case, so I 
accept as a working proposition that they should have 
known that.

 What you're suggesting is you get a pass 
because, even though you know that there's an area of

law that a young lawyer is not going to be able to 
figure out on their own, you fail to train them and 
you're okay.

 MR. DUNCAN:  Well, that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's not the Canton 

example.

 MR. DUNCAN:  That is not -- that's the 

Canton example, Your Honor.  What we have here --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what you're 

saying.

 MR. DUNCAN:  No, that's not what we're 

saying.  We're not saying that the policymaker 
inevitably knows my prosecutors are going to make this 
mistake, and so I need to train on it and I don't care 
about training on it.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, then why don't we 

just --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Can we just -- can we clear 

something up?

 MR. DUNCAN:  Yes, sir.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you -- are you accepting 

the proposition that Brady always requires that lab 
reports be turned over?

JUSTICE ALITO:  I know you concede that 

there was a Brady violation here --

MR. DUNCAN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  -- but in answer to some of 
the questions, it seems to me you were possibly -- or at 
least you did not express an opinion on the suggestion 
that it is always a violation of Brady to fail to turn 
over a lab report.

 MR. DUNCAN:  I'm not aware that it would 

always be a violation of Brady.  However, of course, we 
have evidence in this case that the -- uncontradicted 
evidence, that the office policy was to turn over all 
scientific reports.  But --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Duncan, could I give you 

a hypothetical -- -

MR. DUNCAN:  Sure.
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- just to test how strong 

your position is here.

 So let's say that there is a new DA comes to 
town, and he says, there's going to be one attorney per 
case from now on, and it will be a random assignment 
system.  So sometimes important cases will be tried by 
experienced attorneys, but sometimes they'll be tried by 
people right out of law school.  And there will be no 
Brady supervision at all, no Brady training.  And there

is a closed file system, that we only turn over what 
we're required to turn over and not anything else.

 And in addition to that, if I, the DA, find 

that you have turned over things that you're not 
required to turn over, that will be taken into account 
in your yearly review for promotion purposes, for salary 
purposes, et cetera.  That will be very severely frowned 
upon.

 So he, the new DA --
MR. DUNCAN:  I'm sorry -- repeat the last 

part again, the "severely frowned upon" part.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  If you turn over anything 

that you didn't have to.  Okay?

 MR. DUNCAN:  Exactly.  I understand.
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  If you give any material 

that you're not required to do by law.

 And so he puts into place this whole system 

and -- and says, okay, go to it.  And what happens is 
that there are Brady violations.  And there's a Brady 
violation in a capital case and the person sits on death 
row, or the person is executed, whichever, and there's a 
claim brought.

 Is that claim not a good claim?
 MR. DUNCAN:  If there is a pattern of 

demonstrated --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  There's not a pattern, 
because he just came to town and he just, you know, 
instituted all these policies, and this is the first 
Brady violation.

 MR. DUNCAN:  Not for the first Brady 

violation, Justice Kagan.  But in your hypothetical, you 
noted a policy of actually assigning inexperienced 
prosecutors randomly to perhaps high-profile cases.

 If that were the facts, the jury, as they 

could have in this case, could have found that an 
official policy actually caused the violation.  But they 
didn't find it in this case.  So the hypo leaves open 
that possibility.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the failure to train or 

supervise in any way and the setting up a structural 
system that's pretty much guaranteed to produce Brady 
violations, that would not be enough?

 In other words, even if the jury said yes, 

you are liable under that second theory -- not the 
policy theory, but the failure to train and supervise 
theory -- that -- that would have to be rejected?

 MR. DUNCAN:  No -- exactly, Your Honor.  No 
liability there, because it doesn't meet the stringent 
fault and causation standards of Canton.

 This goes back to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, how is that so?  The 
-- I've read the instruction that the court gave, and it 
seemed to me the instruction the Court gave was 
word-for-word taken from Canton.  And when I read the 
question that you presented in your Petitioner's brief 
-- in the petition for cert, I thought what this case 
was about was an instance where there was only -- it was 
conceded that there was only one such instance.

 But then when I read your second reiteration 

of the question, which is a little different, and read 
the briefs, I thought no, there are four other ones. 
And so what you're really asking us to do is to decide 
in the case of perfect instructions whether the evidence 
supports them.  I didn't think I was getting into that, 
and, frankly, as raised, the brief I think clearly 
supports it, but others could disagree.  But why are we 
getting into that business in this Court?

 MR. DUNCAN:  We're not asking you to.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Then what is it 

you're asking?  Is there something in the instructions 
that is wrong?  What?

 MR. DUNCAN:  Yes, the instructions --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What?
 MR. DUNCAN:  -- reflect that the single

incident theory --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Sorry.  Where -- I'm 

reading the instruction.  I have it here.  What is it? 
I'm not saying you're wrong.  I'm just saying, what in 
the words stated are wrong?  And where is the request 
that they be stated differently?  That I should look at 
that, and that they weren't.  Okay.

 MR. DUNCAN:  Yes, Justice Breyer.  Let me 

help you with that.  The -- the -- at the Joint Appendix 
page 828, we have the instructions on deliberate 
indifference.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  What's 

the page number.

 MR. DUNCAN:  828.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  828.
 MR. DUNCAN:  Joint Appendix 828.
 There are the instructions on deliberate 

indifference.  Let me start here, Justice Breyer.  These 
instructions are taken from the Second Circuit's Walker 
decision, which was the first court that I am aware of 
to allow for the possibility of single-incident 
liability in a Brady situation.

 The second instruction there allows a 

choice.  It allows a choice for the jury to find that a 
single-incident situation -- I'm sorry -- that a

situation involving a Brady decision could arise and be 
a basis --

JUSTICE BREYER:  What are the words -- I 
mean, it looked to me like the words on page 828 are 
pretty similar to my copy of what he actually said.  So 
what are the words on page 828 that you think he should 
have said that he didn't say?

 MR. DUNCAN:  "The situation involved a 

difficult choice or one that prosecutors had a history 
of mishandling."

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  What he says 
here is, "The situation involved a difficult choice or 
one that the prosecutors had a history of mishandling, 
such that additional training, supervision, or 
monitoring was clearly needed."

 So it looks to me like, unless I'm reading 

the wrong page, which I've sometimes done out of my memo 
here.  It looks to me like he gave those words.

 MR. DUNCAN:  That is the -- I'm sorry.  Then 

I misunderstood your question.  Those are the actual 
instructions.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm saying what is it that 
you asked the judge to do that he didn't do or that you 
asked him not to do that he did do?  That's what 
happens.  That's the way you object to an instruction.

MR. DUNCAN:  I understand, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So what is that?
 MR. DUNCAN:  I misunderstood.  I was reading 
where I thought the single-incident theory was posed in 
the jury instructions.  What the Petitioners --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought he asked that. 

So I was glad to see that.  Thank you.

 MR. DUNCAN:  The Petitioners specifically 

asked that an instruction be given that required a 
pattern of similar violations --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I want you to point out in 

the record the words that were said to the district 
court saying, Judge, I want you to say this, and then 
the judge didn't do it.

 MR. DUNCAN:  It is instruction number 14.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Which is where?

 MR. DUNCAN:  The proposed instruction.  I


regret to say I don't believe that's in the Joint 
Appendix, Your Honor.  And it is also --

MR. DUNCAN:  No, Your Honor.  The argument 
is not about the specific jury instruction.  It's about 
the legal theory.  What it's about --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Wait, wait.  If you don't 
object to the instruction, then we're back to what I'm 
saying, that what you're objecting to is you don't think 
the evidence was such that, given that instruction, the 
jury could find guilt.  And that's what I thought this 
case wasn't about to begin with, and there are three 
other instances.  So I don't see why, given this 
instruction, the jury couldn't find guilt.

 MR. DUNCAN:  What our main complaint is, is 

about the failure of the district court to grant a 
motion for summary judgment and a judgment as a matter 
of law on the basis that a failure-to-train theory under 
these circumstances does not permit the single -- the 
single-incident --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I understood -- and 

maybe I'm confused -- that you were arguing that there 
was no set of circumstances in which a prosecutor could 
be handled -- could be liable on a theory of failure to 
train for one incident.

 MR. DUNCAN:  Absent a pattern.  Correct.

MR. DUNCAN:  Correct.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it doesn't matter 

what the facts are.  The facts that Justice Kagan gave 
you would never constitute an actionable claim against a 
prosecutor; is that your position in this case?

 MR. DUNCAN:  That's -- under the Canton 

hypothetical, yes.  It would have to fall on the pattern 
side because the general Brady situation is unlike the 
single-incident --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what you --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I add to my 

hypothetical, then?

 MR. DUNCAN:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Suppose that this new 

district attorney said -- you know, every day he came 
into the office and he said:  I think Brady is just 
crazy, and I think it's just the worst decision that the 
Supreme Court has ever issued; and as long as you don't 
get caught, anything you do is okay by me.

 MR. DUNCAN:  That sounds like a policy to 

me, Your Honor.  That sounds like a policy, an 
actionable policy on the part of the policymaker.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's not a policy.  He's 

just, you know, making his views known around the 
office.

MR. DUNCAN:  Well, this Court has defined 

"policy" as a deliberate choice to embark on a course of 
action in Pembaur, which this Court accepted.  That 
sounds like a policy to me.  If it's not a policy --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Then the policy is just that 
you -- you have to turn over what you have to turn over, 
nothing else, and if you turn over anything else you'll 
get penalized for doing so.  That's the policy.

 MR. DUNCAN:  Well, then the policy is 
constitutional.  So what we would look to is, are 
prosecutors failing to exercise their judgment properly 
pursuant to that policy?  And that falls very squarely 
within the second part of the Canton choices, which 
requires a pattern.

 This case is about the alleged failure to 
remedy, to guide, to reinforce, the pre-existing legal 
judgment that a prosecutor has by virtue of being a 
legal professional.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that so?  I mean, you 
are assume that everyone who goes to law school takes a 
course in criminal procedure, and I think there are many 
law schools where they don't even have such a course and 
others where most -- I don't know anywhere it's 
compulsory to take a course in criminal procedure.  So 
you're assuming that.  And, of course, the time is

running.  There's something I wanted to ask you about 
Brady, which seems to me unlike others and why you would 
want special vigilance.  And that is, Miranda warnings, 
you know what was said; search and seizure, you know 
what the police did.  But the problem with Brady -- and 
this case illustrates it so well -- is you don't know. 
If the prosecutors don't do what they're supposed to do, 
there's a very high risk, as there was in this case, 
that it will never come to light.

 So, recognizing the legal obligation of the 
prosecutor and the temptation not to come out with Brady 
evidence because it doesn't help the State's case, 
shouldn't there be extra vigilance when we're talking 
about a Brady claim?

 MR. DUNCAN:  Well, of course, there should 

be vigilance, but the question you pose, 
Justice Ginsburg, is whether the latency, the 
hiddenness, that characterizes Brady violations should 
change where we locate the Canton violation.  Should it 
be enough to put it into the single-incident, so-obvious 
category, or still in the pattern category?  But Canton 
doesn't indicate that the latency of a particular 
violation should -- should turn on which category it 
goes into.  Instead, it's the nature of the employee 
duties and the employees themselves and how

that situation gives notice to a policymaker about when 
there are obvious training risks.  That's what we're 
talking about.

 So to go back to the hypothetical in Canton, 

whether or not a deadly force situation is secret or 
not -- of course, it's not.  But the office has failed 
not just to train, but to inform of the basic 
constitutional duty without which those officers have no 
chance of fulfilling their duties.  And when they do a 
deadly force violation under those circumstances, the 
causal link will be very strong.  It will be strong 
enough to meet Canton.

 And so there you have -- there you have a 
situation where deliberate indifference and causation 
are met without the pattern.  But what -- you do not 
have that in the situation of Brady compliance because, 
as -- as everyone agrees Brady involves gray areas.  It 
is -- it is impossible to determine beforehand exactly 
why a Brady violation will occur and what specific 
training measures would prevent it from occurring.

 And what that means is this falls plainly 
within what Canton said about the pattern situation. 
And here's what Canton said in the footnote 10 following 
onto the hypothetical.  "It could also be that the 
police, in exercising their discretion, so often violate

constitutional rights that the need for further training 
must have been plainly obvious...."

 That's the situation we have posed by the 

Brady situation in general.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  But, look -- I 

-- he read the instructions.  They came right out of 
Canton.  Seems perfect.

 Now you're saying, well, whether they did or 

not, you cannot have an incident -- you can't have 
liability if there's only one incident.  And at that 
point, I say, gee, I don't know.  I mean, maybe it 
depends on what the incident is.  Maybe the incident 
involved somebody saying, hey, Brady?  What's Brady?  Or 
somebody saying, what's a criminal trial?  I mean, that 
person needs training.

 And -- or -- but I don't even have to think 

of that here, because there were four incidents here. 
And, therefore, I don't have to try to make up weird 
hypotheticals.  So where we have four instances and we 
have correct instructions, what's the problem?

 MR. DUNCAN:  Your Honor, there weren't four 
instances.  There was one Brady violation that possibly 
could have involved one to four prosecutors.  That's 
one --

have -- all this case?  I thought that they had several 
instances in other cases.

 MR. DUNCAN:  No.  No, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All involved -- in other 
words, there has never in this office been an instance 
of a Brady violation outside of this case.

 MR. DUNCAN:  No, Your Honor.  That's not 

true.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not -- not before this 

case.  There was some --

JUSTICE BREYER:  After, that's what it was.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- later, as far as we 

know.

 MR. DUNCAN:  There were some -- there were 
four reported Brady violations before this case, in the 
decade leading up, involving this office, that had 
nothing to do with the circumstances involved here.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Ah.  There were four Brady 

violations involving this office, okay?

 MR. DUNCAN:  Correct, out of tens of 

thousands of prosecutions.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So now we're 

talking about not one; we are talking about four --
MR. DUNCAN:  We're -- but we're not --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- over many years, with 

24


Alderson Reporting Company

tens of thousands of violations, correct?

 MR. DUNCAN:  What was -- the Fifth Circuit 
panel in this case affirmatively said Thompson did not 
even try to prove a pattern, and he did not prove a 
pattern of violations.  The Fifth Circuit panel said 
that.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  This is helpful.  Thank 

you.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  On your instruction in --
MR. DUNCAN:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- at J.A. 28 second, 

would the instruction in your view have been proper, if 
the "or" had been replaced by an "and."  So:  "The 
situation involved a difficult choice and one that 
prosecutors had a history of mishandling."

 MR. DUNCAN:  That's closer to what it should 
be, Justice Kennedy, yes, because that begins to capture 
the pattern requirement.  It's not -- it's not the 
pattern instruction that was specifically put forth by 
the Petitioners in instruction number 15.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Has there been -- has 

there been any argument that you have waived your 
objection to the instructions?

 MR. DUNCAN:  Not by Petitioners -- not by 
the Respondent in this case.  There's no -- there's no

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did you -- did you object 

to it?  To this charge?

 MR. DUNCAN:  The -- the charge?
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  With the "or" --

difficult choice "or" one that prosecutors had a history 
of mishandling.

 MR. DUNCAN:  No, the Petitioners did not 

object to the -- the specific formulation of that 
charge.  Immediately after that charge, though, they --
they said, no, but we -- we have to have a pattern 
instruction here.  In other words --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In other words, the 
pattern instruction was -- it was -- was rejected?
 MR. DUNCAN:  It was rejected.  It was 

rejected twice, Your Honor, first in the formal jury 
instructions and then at the charge colloquy.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that wasn't the 

question presented to us.  You didn't present to us an 
issue of whether the jury instruction --
MR. DUNCAN:  No, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- was wrong or not.

that legal theory at all.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You see, what I'm trying 
to figure out is whether your position is that under no 
circumstance, even the hypothetical that Justice Kagan 
set forth, could you be charged with a single-incident 
Canton violation.  That is your -- your theory?

 MR. DUNCAN:  With respect to the Brady 

situation, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The Brady situation.
 MR. DUNCAN:  Let me answer it this way: 

What -- what the Canton single-incident hypo is talking 
about is failing to provide employees with basic tools, 
without which they absolutely have no chance of 
fulfilling their constitutional obligations.  If we --
it's difficult to imagine that situation for 
prosecutors.

 It is -- it's conceivable that a district 
attorney's office set up -- sets up a structure where 
prosecutors have no chance of even knowing whether 
there's Brady evidence in the file.  If you have that 
situation, then it's closer to the Canton 
single-incident hypothetical, but not involving the 
exercise of legal judgment in particular cases.  We say 
no.

exercise legal judgment if you don't even know what 
you're supposed to turn over?  That was Justice 
Ginsburg's question.

 MR. DUNCAN:  That's exactly -- that's my 

point.  That's my point.  If you don't -- if you don't 
even -- in other words, if you don't even have a police 
file, for instance, you can't exercise your legal 
judgment if you don't even know what -- what the 
subject of your legal -- the object of your legal 
judgment is.

 But that's not this case.  What we're 

talking about here is a failure to remedy, reinforce, 
refine existing legal judgment that prosecutors have.

 MR. DUNCAN:  If there are no further 

questions, thank you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. GORDON COONEY, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. COONEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Although the Petitioners' brief attempts to 

relitigate factual issues that were resolved against 
them by the jury, they have raised today only one 
question of law, and that is whether this Court should 

28


Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review 

write into section 1983 a per se rule that the only way, 
the only way, a civil rights victim can ever establish 
the deliberate indifference of a district attorney is if 
he can prove a prior significant history of assistant 
prosecutors violating other citizens' constitutional 
rights.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  For -- for Brady 
violations.  They limit the principle to Brady 
violations.

 MR. COONEY:  Yes, Your Honor.  And I would 

submit that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's a significant 

limitation, don't you think?

 MR. COONEY:  But I would submit, Your Honor, 
that this Court's -- that their requirement for proving 
deliberate indifference is, first, contrary to the 
teaching of this Court in Canton and subsequent cases. 
It finds no place in the language of section 1983 --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But at the -- but at the 
outset it seemed to me -- and correct me if I'm wrong --
that you misstate the theory on which you seek to -- to 
have a reversal, and that this is a failure-to-train 
case.  You didn't mention that.

 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor --

case; is it not?

 MR. COONEY:  It is absolutely a deliberate 

indifference to the need to train and provide other 
protections to the office.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I think that's very 

important.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes, if you could -- could 
you just say as succinctly as possible what you would 
tell assistant district attorneys if you were the 
district attorney for this jurisdiction, and you, with 
the benefit of hindsight, having seen this case, what 
kind of -- what would you tell them they should do with 
respect to Brady?

 MR. COONEY:  Yes, Your Honor.  First of all 

I think Canton says you have to look at the specific 
circumstances.  And so I don't think there's a 
one-size-fits-all way or message that has to be 
provided.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  No, but you are training 
them, so:  Now I want to tell you what you have to do 
under Brady.

 MR. COONEY:  Well, first --
JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you tell them?
 MR. COONEY:  In this office, Your Honor, I 

think the first thing one has to confront is Mr. 

30


Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review 

Connick's testimony and, in fact, the concession that 
the Petitioners made on pages 6 and 7 of their merits 
brief that the office started with what the brief 
described as "Connick's disclosure policies were no 
mystery" -- turn over what the law required and nothing 
more.  I mean, that would be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, 

Justice Alito's question was, what you would tell the 
assistant DAs?  What's your answer?

 MR. COONEY:  And Mr. Chief Justice, with --

if -- first of all, I wouldn't start with that rule. 
But if I started with that rule it would be incumbent 
upon me --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why wouldn't you start with 

that rule?  The rule is perfectly lawful, my goodness.

 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I'm not saying it's 
an unlawful rule.  However, it requires a countervailing 
message.  And if you're going to adopt --

JUSTICE ALITO:  I really would appreciate it 

if you'd get to my question.  Brady requires that 
exculpatory evidence be turned over.  Now, do you -- do 
you think the assistant prosecutors didn't even know 
that?

 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I don't know that. 
It seems from the record in this case they thought that

only something that screamed "exculpatory evidence" on 
its face needed to be turned over.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  Now, you phrase --

you are the instructor.  You phrase the lesson that you 
think is required by Brady that has to be given to them.
 MR. COONEY:  I think at a minimum it has two 
pieces, Your Honor.  It has basic instruction about how 
to go about fulfilling the Brady obligation, and how do 
you go about looking through the file to make sure you 
know what's there, making sure you have documents that 
are in the possession of the police.

 Thinking in advance, as this Court talked 

about in the Agurs case, about what the evidence is 
going to be at trial and looking thoughtfully at that 
evidence to determine whether or not the evidence was 
favorable to the accused and needs to be produced.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  That's your 
instruction on Brady.  Now, you're basing liability on 
-- on this incident of failing to comply with Brady.  So 
you say they should have instructed on Brady.

 What else should they have instructed on?
 MR. COONEY:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're the -- you're 
the new DA, and you're setting up -- I need to instruct 
my people.  What -- what do they instruct on?  I know

they instruct on Brady under your view.  What else?

 MR. COONEY:  I think the second thing that 

the -- that the office really should do is to -- to talk 
about the importance of safeguarding the innocent here, 
that our job is not just to secure convictions.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, I'm --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we're looking 
at -- we're looking at specifics where they're going to 
violate the Constitution.  I think that's a good thing, 
to tell them they have an obligation as well to protect 
the innocent.

 But we're worried about violations of our 

constitutional requirements.  We know Brady is one. 
What's the next one?  What's day 2 in the course?

 MR. COONEY:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I do 

think that there are other constitutional requirements 
involved.  Most of the hypotheticals, however, that have 
been brought before the Court as a parade of horribles 
aren't actions by the district attorney.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, with respect, I 
really don't think, as a young district -- assistant 
district attorney, that you have told me anything that's 
going to be really helpful to me other than, you know, 
follow the law, which you certainly should do, in 
dealing with my obligation to turn over physical

JUSTICE ALITO:  Or a lab report regarding 

physical evidence.

 Now, suppose I have -- I have several cases. 

I have this case, where I have got blood -- I have 
physical evidence, I have a blood test.  I have another 
case where all I have was physical evidence, but there 
has been no testing of it.

 Now, do I have to turn over that physical 

evidence?

 MR. COONEY:  In this case, there has been a 
stipulation by the district attorney's office that you 
do.  And I think if you think about the evidence in this 
case --

JUSTICE ALITO:  I have to turn over all 

physical evidence that's in my possession?

 MR. COONEY:  No, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how do I know that 

before the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, didn't they here? 

Didn't they make it available?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  How do I know that before 

the physical evidence is tested?

 Suppose I've got all sorts of items that 

were found at the -- at the scene, and they might have 
DNA on them.  They might have epithelial samples on 
them -- you know, all this fancy forensic testing that's 
done these days.  Do I have to turn over all of that?

 MR. COONEY:  No, Your Honor.  In this case, 

what we're talking about is a piece of evidence, a 
specific piece, several specific pieces of physical 
evidence, that it has been stipulated the prosecutors 
knew contained the blood of the perpetrator.

 It -- the rule and the training that should 
have been provided in this instance, particularly since 
the DA argues that it was perfectly clear that that 
should have been produced --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, you see what I'm 

getting at is that you're dealing with a very specific

you have a -- you have the result of the blood test, but 
you don't know whether -- you don't know the blood type 
of the accused, that -- that's Brady evidence, and that 
has to be turned over.

 And you're saying that the failure to 

provide training to every assistant district attorney on 
a question of that specificity gives rise to a -- a 
potential claim, gives rise to a claim?

 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, what I'm saying is 
I think there are at least three layers to the training 
that were missing here.  One was the clear message about 
the importance of Brady compliance.  The second was the 
basic ground rules about how you go about your Brady 
obligation.  And, third, if you have evidence that can 
conclusively establish to a scientific certainty the 
innocence of the person being charged, you have to turn 
it over or get it -- get it tested.  You can't just put 
it in your hip pocket and say, I know --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wait a minute.  Wait a 
minute.  What evidence is there that they put this in 
their hip pocket?

 There was a disclosure that the evidence 

existed.  Where is the evidence that the defense counsel 
didn't have access to asking for it?

 MR. COONEY:  Yes, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or asking for it to be 

tested?  Where was that suppressed?

 MR. COONEY:  The -- the only information --

there was a discovery response that was filed very 
shortly before trial, long after Mr. Thompson was 
charged with the crime, where in response to one of the 
questions, the response was:  "Inspection to be 
permitted."  If you look at the chronology --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And what -- where's the 
Brady violation for telling a defense attorney there was 
a blood sample there, you can test it?

 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, there was no 

information provided.  It was -- the simple response was 
that the request was for all scientific evidence, and it 
simply -- and physical evidence from the scene of the 
crime.  The answer was:  "Inspection to be permitted."

 Then the blood evidence, the very next day, 

after the response was provided, was removed from the 
crime lab by the prosecutors, never to be found again. 
And defense counsel testified without impeachment at 
trial that he went to the evidence locker, looked in the 
evidence locker, found certain pieces of physical 
evidence consistent with the discovery response, but not 
the blood evidence, neither the blood report nor the 
physical specimens that were involved in this case, Your

Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that you are claiming 

there was suppression of that evidence?

 MR. COONEY:  Absolutely, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if it is --

prosecutors can violate a defendant's constitutional 
rights by making improper statements in their closing 
arguments.

 Do you have to instruct new -- I suspect new 

prosecutors coming out of law school don't know what 
those rules are.  Do you have to give instruction on 
what they can say in closing arguments?

 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I think, first of 
all, the issue has to rise to a constitutional level in 
order to be talking about this for section 1983 
purposes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.  My 

understanding is -- I don't -- I'm not an expert in 
criminal law.  I need training in that.  But my 
understanding is that comments in a closing argument can 
give rise to a constitutional violation.

 So you should -- you should train those 

people.  You know that.  You know that that can happen, 
just as you know there can be Brady violations.  So they 
need training in exactly what they can say and can't say

in closing argument.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And Miranda and proper 

supervision of affidavits in support of search warrants, 
and proper instructions that tell the police not to 
exceed the scope of the warrant.  So this is -- our 
course is expanding.

 MR. COONEY:  Justice Kennedy --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The -- the point of 

concern here is that we're going to have to go through a 
list, case by case, of everything there has to be 
training on.

 MR. COONEY:  I think -- I think there are 
some important distinctions here.  And, first of all, 
when you're talking about search and seizure, when 
you're talking about Miranda, you're talking about those 
things, the actor that is committing the constitutional 
tort there is not the district attorney.  It's the 
police.  What we're talking about here, the 
constitutional tort --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When you're talking 
about improper comments in closing argument, it is the 
prosecuting attorney.

 MR. COONEY:  But the second important 

distinction, Your Honor -- and I do believe training 
should be given there.  But I think there's a

fundamental distinction between a Brady violation, which 
happens in private and may never be revealed and, if 
revealed, often happens long after trial and long after 
incarceration, and a situation where a prosecutor makes 
an improper comment during a closing jury, which is made 
in public.  Defense counsel has the opportunity right 
there to stand up and say, Your Honor, I object, and the 
court has the ability to address that issue then and 
there.

 With a Brady violation, you don't have any 

of that.  It's made in secret.  It's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you don't -- you 

don't have to train with respect to closing arguments?
 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I think they do. 

But I think there's -- there's a particular issue. 
There's particular force in this context because of the 
unique nature of Brady, because it's made in private, 
because it is -- by definition, if the information has 
been concealed, it has not been revealed prior to the 
time the defendant suffers constitutional harm.  He's --
he's found guilty, he's sentenced to death, et cetera.

 The Brady violation, unlike your situation, 
Mr. Chief Justice, doesn't come to light, perhaps ever. 
But in Mr. Thompson's case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So we have --

40


Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review 

MR. COONEY:  -- more than a decade after he 

was convicted.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And it's something like I 

was trying to get at before when I said Miranda is out 
there, you know what was said, you know what was seized, 
talking about -- but Brady is, if the prosecutor doesn't 
come out with it, high risk it will never come out.

 So we have use of force, plus -- that can 

kill people if you're not properly trained.  Brady, 
because if they don't come up with the information, it 
could have what almost happened in this case.

 Anything else on this special list?
 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The concern was that you 

don't want to have to give the prosecutors a clinical 
law school course before you let them do their job.

 MR. COONEY:  I agree with that concern, Your 

Honor.  And -- and I think it's important to remember 
that in this case, this was a no-training case.  The 
evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Thompson was 
there was zero Brady training in the office.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So what would have been 

enough?  I mean, is an hour a year enough?  Is an hour a 
month enough?

dependent on what its content was, Your Honor, and the 
other circumstances of the office.

 If you look at Canton, what Canton does is 

it asks the question:  Is there an obvious need for 
training based on the circumstances of this 
particular --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.  As I understand it, 

you -- you really have a need to train them, when you 
know defense counsel is coming over to look at the 
physical evidence, don't remove from the locker some of 
the physical evidence.
 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You want to give a course 

in that?

 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, what -- what 

happened is the physical evidence very conveniently was 
being sent to the crime lab when it was removed.  And so 
we don't know what the motivation was as to why that 
physical evidence was removed at that time.  What we 
know is for many, many months --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, then, you shouldn't 
have -- you shouldn't have mentioned it.  I thought you 
were -- you were asserting that it was intentionally 
removed in order to prevent defense counsel from seeing 
it.

MR. COONEY:  What we assert, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't know that.
 MR. COONEY:  It was certainly not -- it was 
intentionally not placed back in into evidence after it 
came back from the crime lab, and there was actual 
testimony from the grand jury that was handling this and 
looking into this situation for some period of time --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, of course, there's a 

--

MR. COONEY:  -- of not just that.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There is a causation 

problem here.  Even assuming training, if Deegan was 
going to destroy the evidence or remove it anyway, as he 
admitted later to Riehlmann, then the training or lack 
of training is just irrelevant.

 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I think there 

are --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I'm very concerned 

about that causation aspect.

 MR. COONEY:  First of all -- let me address 
that directly.  First of all, the causation question was 
put to the jury; the jury instruction very clearly said 
in order for there to be liability here, the fault must 
be in the training program, not in the individual 
prosecutor.  And the defense argued vehemently that

there was a lack of causation.  What's interesting here 
is --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But the judge actually, 
though, instructed the jury -- this is back on J.A. 
828 -- in order to find that the district attorney's 
failure to adequately train, monitor, or supervise 
amounted to -- deliberate indifference, et cetera.

 So liability could have been predicated not 
on the lack of adequate training, but the absence of a 
process by which superiors in the district attorney's 
office reviewed all of the Brady decisions that were 
made by more junior prosecutors; isn't that correct?
 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, the concept of 

monitoring or supervision was actually a concept that 
defendants injected into the case.  And so, to the 
extent that there is any concern that there's an 
expansion from training, it's been error that's invited. 
And I don't believe it's error, Your Honor, but it's not 
something that -- that was put into the case by the 
defense or the court.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't 

that be error?  That the -- the head of a very large 
office is personally liable under Canton for violations 
that are -- that are produced by actions taken by 
subordinates, unless there is an elaborate process to

review all of the decisions that are made by those 
subordinates?  Doesn't that go well beyond anything 
Canton permits?

 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, again, the clear 
thrust of this case was a failure-to-train case.  The 
concept of monitoring and supervision was introduced by 
the defense, not by the -- by the plaintiffs.  But to 
get back to Justice Kennedy's case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you please state 
in simple terms to me what exactly they failed to train 
these prosecutors to do, that the prosecutors didn't do? 
What training -- Justice Alito asked it generally; I'm 
asking specifically -- what is the exact training that 
was required in this situation that caused the violation 
in this case?

 MR. COONEY:  Number one, there was 

absolutely no Brady training at all.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Forget about no Brady 

training.  What -- I think Justice Alito asked this 
question.  What specifically would the training have 
said or done that would have avoided this Brady 
violation?

 MR. COONEY:  First of all, I think a broad 

statement in training about the importance of 
safeguarding the rights of the accused --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, that seems to 
suggest that you're claiming that if there was an 
intentional violation by the prosecutors, that that 
statement would have avoided the prosecutor from doing 
something he or she knew was illegal.  Is that what 
you're intending?

 MR. COONEY:  No, it isn't, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.  So tell me.
 MR. COONEY:  The -- the second aspect of --

of it, though, is what I said to Justice Alito, and that 
is that if you have physical evidence which, if tested, 
would establish either the guilt or the innocence of the 
-- of the defendant, it needs to be produced.  Or at 
least tested.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That goes to the 

sufficiency --

MR. COONEY:  Right.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- whether they had a 

policy to turn over or -- because it was tested, so 
there was no Brady violation from the failure to test 
here.

 MR. COONEY:  The Brady violation was for 

failure to produce; you're right.

right on this?  Here -- I read on page 4 of your brief

that it seemed what happened -- and I might not be 
right.  Correct me if I'm not.  What happened is a piece 
of paper called the lab report came to the -- one of the 
prosecutors' attention 2 days before the trial, and what 
it said was the blood that was the perpetrator's was 
type B.  And the person on trial has blood of type O. 
Is that what happened?

 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, certainly what the 
crime lab report said was that the blood that was tested 
of the perpetrator was type B.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And the -- and the 

prosecutor knew that the person on trial had type O?

 MR. COONEY:  We don't know that, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Ah, that's something --
MR. COONEY:  That's the unresolved factual 

question.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I see.
 MR. COONEY:  And I think that's where 

causation comes in, Your Honor, because I think there 
are two possibilities.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Did it turn out at the 

trial that eventually the prosecutor knew it was type O?
 MR. COONEY:  It turned out that Mr. Thompson 

was in fact type O.  But the evidence is --

that?

 MR. COONEY:  The evidence is unclear as to 

whether or not the assistants knew at the time that John 
Thompson had type O blood.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could I ask you what 

-- most law offices with which I'm familiar, the 
training is mentoring.  In other words, the young 
attorneys learn from the older attorneys, often by 
following them along -- around.

 Would it have been an adequate training 

program for this office simply to say, new prosecutors, 
you don't get to be first chair prosecutors until after 
a year, and you're going to follow one of the 
prosecutors around and learn from them?  Is that an 
adequate training program?

 MR. COONEY:  If, in fact, the senior 

prosecutors, Your Honor, have a good familiarity with 
the constitutional requirements --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.
 MR. COONEY:  -- absolutely.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even -- even if the 
violation that becomes the basis for the claim later on 
is one that, you know, didn't come up in that year?  We 
-- they didn't have a Brady issue in that first year. 
They went around; they sat in on a lot of trials; but

there wasn't a Brady issue and so they didn't learn 
about this type of question.  And --
MR. COONEY:  I think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does that give rise 

to a claim of the sort you're bringing here?

 MR. COONEY:  I think the failure here -- and 

I think we have to come back to the deliberate 
indifference piece because what would happen there in 
that instance, Your Honor, even if the training was not 
provided, I think as experience has shown under Canton, 
that claim would fail for failure to show the deliberate 
indifference of the policymaker.

 But here you had substantial evidence about 

Mr. Connick's indifference.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Cooney, when you -- when 
you gave the specific instruction that you think should 
be provided to assistant district attorneys, what you 
stated was a questionable understanding of Brady, I 
think.  You -- did I understand you correctly?

 You said that Brady means that if the 

prosecutor has physical evidence which, if tested, might 
establish the defendant's innocence, that is exculpatory 
evidence that must be turned over.

 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, that certainly has 

been the position taken by the district attorney's

office in this case --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that consistent with 

Arizona v. Youngblood?

 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I believe it -- it 
is consistent with Brady that if -- if one has a piece 
of evidence that can conclusively establish that the 
defendant is innocent, that it can't be the law that the 
prosecutor can just put it in his hip pocket, not get it 
tested, and not turn it over to the defense, and not 
worry about whether they're prosecuting an innocent man.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But, you see, it was 

tested.  And it was made available to the defense. 
Turning over -- using the word "turning over" is 
ridiculous, because they're not going to physically give 
it to the defense attorney to go off and do what he 
wants.  They're going to give it to a lab that will 
establish a chain of custody, et cetera, et cetera.

 So it was made available.  He went to look 

at it, but the looking at it wouldn't have told the 
defense attorney anything.  They had to make it 
available for testing.  He never asked for testing. 
They did the lab reports.  So now we come down to the 
only failure is in the turning over of this report. 
Correct?

there is -- there is a stipulation, stipulation L at 
J.A.  14:  Prior to the armed robbery trial, Mr. 
Thompson and his attorneys were not advised of the 
existence of the blood evidence, that the evidence had 
been tested, that a blood type was determined 
definitively --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, what did I just 

say?  The failure to turn over the report, correct?

 MR. COONEY:  But -- but -- yes, Your Honor. 
But what also is present here is the defense never had 
the chance to -- never saw the physical blood evidence 
itself.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Never knew it existed?
 MR. COONEY:  Never knew it existed, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's --
MR. COONEY:  There is testimony, 

clear testimony to that effect.  If you look at Mr. 
Williams's testimony in this case, there is a section of 
the cross-examination where John Thompson's defense 
counsel at the original criminal trial said just that. 
He didn't know it existed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it isn't -- it isn't 
clear from what -- according to what you said earlier, 
it isn't clear that it was intentionally withheld from

the defense.  It might have just been -- you said it was 
sent to the lab when -- when he came to look for it.

 MR. COONEY:  But --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So would training have --

have gone into that detail?  Don't send something to the 
lab when defense counsel is coming over to look for it. 
I mean, you know, that -- that's pretty detailed.

 MR. COONEY:  Yes, Justice Scalia, but here 

there's a stipulation that the crime lab report with the 
conclusive evidence about the perpetrator's blood 
type was never --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay, but -- but that --
MR. COONEY:  -- ever provided.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the lab report. 

That -- that's what Justice --

MR. COONEY:  And the physical evidence was 

never seen, Your Honor, by defense counsel.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  For all we know, by 
accident, right?  And the training would -- would 
probably not have remedied that -- that difficulty.

 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, four prosecutors --

it is clear that four prosecutors knew about the 
existence of blood evidence for months, and it was never 
produced to the defense.  And that blood evidence would 
have conclusively established John Thompson's innocence.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The defense was told to 

come over and look for it -- to look at it.  And when he 
came over to look at it -- for all we know, by 
accident -- it was -- it had been sent to the lab.

 MR. COONEY:  But -- but Your Honor, the "it" 
was not come over and see the blood evidence.  It was --
there was a broad request for -- for --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, I understand, but --

yes.  Okay.

 MR. COONEY:  -- physical evidence at the 
crime scene, including things that had nothing to do 
with the blood.  So there's nothing that the defense 
lawyer would have known by going to the evidence room to 
say:  I know there is nothing here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But isn't that --
isn't that best practice?  In other words, I thought 
that was the good thing, when what the prosecutor does 
is say look at everything we've got.  And as my brother 
has suggested, what is important may not be there for 
either deliberate misconduct or by happenstance.

 MR. COONEY:  But the point here, Your 

Honor -- and I think this goes to the causation point,

the carjacking case.  And Mr. Williams conceded that. 
So this idea that this was an innocent error on the part 
of the prosecutors does not find support in the record.

 The question is --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if it was willful --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that dooms your 
case.  If it wasn't an innocent error, if it was an 
intentional violation of Brady, there is no training 
that was going to stop him from doing that.

 MR. COONEY:  No, Your Honor, I think there 

is a difference between a tactical choice to do 
something sharp, on the one hand, and a knowing Brady 
violation, on the other hand.

 And the jury could clearly conclude --

particularly because the 30(b)(6) witness in this office 
testified that, in his view, it wasn't Brady material 
unless the -- unless the prosecutors knew John 
Thompson's blood type -- the jury could clearly conclude 
that what happened here was these four prosecutors 
didn't understand and never got a clear message about --
about what Brady required, and they -- they did not 
produce this evidence.

 There is nothing that clearly showed that 
they committed knowing Brady violations in this case.

confused as to sort of how much is enough by way of 
training and how you would ask a court or a jury to 
decide that.

 You suggested to the Chief Justice formal 

training wasn't -- isn't necessary if there's some 
supervision, if there's some mentoring.  But, you know, 
this seems to give cities no sense of what they have to 
do.  No safe harbors.  Is that your position?

 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I think that Canton 

articulates a very flexible test.  And I don't think 
Canton says there is one size that fits all.  And I 
think the protection that district attorney's offices 
get from Canton is from the standard of deliberate 
indifference.

 And if one looks at the 21 years of 

experience under Canton, there have been between 6 and 8 
cases against prosecutors' offices under this kind of 
theory, in total, where there was some payout from the 
prosecutors' offices to the defense.  Total.  In the 21 
years.

 So -- and the Court said -- this Court said 
in Canton, judge and jury doing their job are adequate 
to the test.  I think we have been spending a lot of 
time focusing on how much training.  The fact is, this 
is a no-training case, where evidence that the -- that

the defendants now concede should have been produced 
wasn't produced, and four people knew about it and 
failed to produce it.

 In addition, there were multiple additional 
pieces of Brady material in the murder case that weren't 
produced.  And this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would this have been 
-- would this be a no-training case if the rule was you 
have to be in the office for 3 years as a second chair 
prosecutor before we let you have a case, and, in fact, 
you have to be here 10 years before we let you have a 
capital case?  That's all it says.  Is that sufficient 
training?

 MR. COONEY:  I think, again, you would have 

to look at the circumstances of the office.  I think 
with this -- this presumption against disclosure that 
was present in Connick's office, that takes this case 
out of the realm of the typical prosecutor's case, 
because it is a bare minimum disclosure rule.

 I think there needs to be -- if you're going 

to have that bare minimum disclosure rule, there needs 
to be something to counterbalance it.  If you look at 
what the assistants testified to in this case, they all 
knew what not to produce.  What they didn't know was 
what to produce.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what do you do with 
the Dubelier testimony?  Didn't he testify that it was 
standard operating procedure to turn over all lab 
reports?

 MR. COONEY:  Your Honor, I think there are 
two very quick answers to that.  If one looks at J.A. 
550 to 551, which was Mr. Glas, the grand jury 
prosecutor's, testimony.

 What he clearly said was, during the grand 
jury, when Mr. Connick decided to terminate the grand 
jury, Mr. Connick and his first assistant were actually 
arguing with Glas that if the prosecutors didn't know 
John Thompson's blood type, they didn't need to turn 
over the blood report.

 So that's number one.  I think there is an 

issue of fact that has to be resolved in our favor 
solely from J.A. 550 and 551.

 And the second is, Your Honor, the -- the 
rule, the bare minimum discovery rule.  Louisiana law 
did not require the production of crime lab reports in 
1985.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.
 Mr. Duncan, have you 3 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STUART K. DUNCAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

57


Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review 

MR. DUNCAN:  Justice Alito and Justice 

Kagan, you asked repeatedly questions designed to elicit 
a response from my colleague:  What would you tell a 
ADAs with respect to training -- and I believe Justice 
Sotomayor as well -- that would have prevented such a 
thing?  And I didn't hear a clear answer.

 The legal issue in this case turns on the 

fact that, in the deadly force scenario that Canton 
marks out as the paradigm single-incident case, it is 
very clear what a police office needs to tell a police 
officer.  Here's the deadly force standard under 
Tennessee v. Garner:  Don't shoot people unless there's 
a reasonable probability of physical danger to yourself 
or to others.  You've got to tell them that.

 With respect to the Brady scenario, it's not 
clear at all.  Yes, of course, training is useful.  Yes, 
of course, training is important.  But how do you 
connect up a lack of specific training with a particular 
violation that occurs?

 And having heard the argument, I'm -- I'm no 

longer clear as to what the theory of the case of my 
colleague's is about what caused the violation. 
Whatever caused the violation, I haven't heard about a 
specific training measure that would have actually 
prevented what happened in this case.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How do you train 
your new hires?  First day, somebody right out of law 
school shows up and says, I want to be an assistant 
district attorney.  How do you train them?

 MR. COONEY:  I think the first thing you do 

is you have a hiring process that emphasizes the 
important of -- the importance of Brady, as this office 
did.  Brady was important.  One witness said --
McElroy -- from the moment you walked in the door, you 
had to write an essay on Brady.  Brady was emphasized as 
being very important.  And then --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Duncan, that I think you 
can't say, because that's just overturning what the jury 
found.

 MR. DUNCAN:  I -- I don't think -- the jury 
couldn't have found that that didn't occur, Your Honor. 
The jury found that that was inadequate.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  The jury found that there 

was inadequate training.

 MR. DUNCAN:  Correct, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  In fact, the jury found -- I 
think, if you look at the record -- the jury could have 
found, a reasonable jury could have found, that there 
was no training here.

found -- well, Your Honor, we don't contest the finding 
of inadequate training.  What we contest is the 
ingredients that lead -- that can lead to a deliberate 
indifference finding on the basis of inadequate 
training.

 And what we say is that this case, that is a 

general case about you failed to train on Brady, it 
doesn't fit within the single-incident hypothetical. 
And what I was trying to get at with -- with response to 
your questions and Justice Alito's question was that, if 
you can't say with any specificity, well, what training 
do you give?

 You asked repeatedly, Your Honor, how much 
training is enough?  So is an hour a year?  I thought I 
heard my colleague say that an hour a year may make this 
not a no-training case, and so what you have there is a 
pattern --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So we have to overturn the 

jury finding?

 MR. DUNCAN:  No, Your Honor.  Absolutely 

not.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  We don't?
 MR. DUNCAN:  No, you do not.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Because they found that the 

failure to adequately train amounted to deliberate

indifference to the fact that inaction would obviously 
result in a constitutional violation.  That's what they 
found.

 Now, how can we -- assuming that's true and 
accepting it and not overturning it -- find that there 
was something unlawful?  Because you're arguing --
you're all arguing about whether the training program 
really was adequate or not.  They found it was not. 
What do we do?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can answer.
 MR. DUNCAN:  Thank you, Your Honor, Mr. 

Chief Justice.

 The correct resolution is the lower court 

should dismiss the failure-to-train claim as a matter of 
law because there was no demonstration of a pattern of 
violations, and this situation does not fall within the 
narrow range of circumstances that Canton foresees for 
single-incident liability.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 The case is submitted.
 (Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
