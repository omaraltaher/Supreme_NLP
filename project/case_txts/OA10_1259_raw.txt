 MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Jones. 

 Mr. Dreeben. 

 Since this Court's decision in Katz v. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

1
2
3
4  first this morning in Case 10-1259, United States v. 
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12  United States, the Court has recognized a basic 
13  dichotomy under the Fourth Amendment.  What a person 
14  seeks to preserve as private in the enclave of his own 
home or in a private letter or inside of his vehicle 
15
16  when he is traveling is a subject of Fourth Amendment 
17  protection.  But what he reveals to the world, such as 
18  his movements in a car on a public roadway, is not. 
 In Knotts v. United States, this Court 
19
20
21  surveillance of a vehicle traveling on the public 
22  roadways infringed no Fourth Amendment expectation of 
23  privacy. 
24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Knotts, though, 
seems to me much more like traditional surveillance. 

applied that principle to hold that visual and beeper

1  You're following the car, and the beeper just helps you 
2  follow it from a -- from a slightly greater distance. 
3  That was 30 years ago.  The technology is very 
4  different, and you get a lot more information from the 
GPS surveillance than you do from following a beeper. 
5
6
 MR. DREEBEN:  The technology is different, 
7  Mr. Chief Justice, but a crucial fact in Knotts that 
8  shows that this was not simply amplified visual 
9  surveillance is that the officers actually feared 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's a good 
18  example of the change in technology.  That's a lot of 
19  work to follow the car.  They've got to listen to the 
beeper; when they lose it, they've got to call in the 
20
21  helicopter.  Here they just sit back in the station, and 
22  they -- they push a button whenever they want to find 
23  out where the car is.  They look at data from a month 
24  and find out everywhere it's been in the past month. 
25

detection in Knotts as the car crossed from Minnesota to 
Wisconsin.  The driver began to do certain U-turns and, 
the police broke off visual surveillance.  They lost 
track of the car for a full hour.  They only were able 
to discover it by having a beeper receiver in a 
helicopter that detected the beeps from the radio 
transmitter in the can of chloroform. 

That -- that seems to me dramatically different.

 MR. DREEBEN:  But it doesn't expose 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, under that 

 MR. DREEBEN:  Probably not, Justice Kennedy; 

States -- United States v. Karo -- specifically 
distinguished the possibility of following a car on a 
public roadways from determining the location of an 
object in a place where a person has a reasonable 
expectation of privacy.

1
2  anything, Mr. Chief Justice, that isn't already exposed 
3  to public view for anyone who wanted to watch, and that 
4  was the crucial principle that the Court applied --
5
6  rationale, could you put a beeper surreptitiously on the 
7  man's overcoat or sport coat? 
8
9  and the reason is that this Court in Karo v. United 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  device.  It measures only streets and public elevators 
17  and public buildings. 
18
19  Kennedy, there is a serious question about whether the 
installation of such a device would implicate either a 
20
21  search or a seizure.  But if it did not, the public 
22  movements of somebody do not implicate a seizure. 
23
24  point, you might just be aware that I have serious 
25

reservations that there wasn't -- that there -- about 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Oh, no.  This is a special

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Dreeben, I'd like to 

 (Laughter.) 
 MR. DREEBEN:  Happy to, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I have to give a little 

violation of the Fourth Amendment because the Fourth 
Amendment says that the -- the people shall be secure in 
their persons, houses, papers, and effects against 
unreasonable searches and seizures.  And wiretapping 
just picked up conversations.  That's not persons, 
houses, papers, and effects. 

1  the way in which this beeper was installed.  But you can 
2  get to that at -- at your convenience. 
3
4  get to it now.
5
6
7
8  prologue to my question.  When -- when wiretapping first 
9  came before this Court, we held that it was not a 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 Later on, we reversed ourselves, and, as you 
17  mentioned, Katz established the new criterion, which is, 
18  is there an invasion of privacy?  Does -- are you 
19  obtaining information that a person had a reasonable 
20
21  I don't think that was the original meaning of the 
22  Fourth Amendment.  But, nonetheless, it's been around 
23  for so long, we're not going to overrule that. 
24
25

expectation to be kept private?  I think that was wrong. 

 However, it is one thing to add that privacy 

concept to the Fourth Amendment as it originally 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company

car on the car, that is unquestionably a trespass and 

1  existed, and it is quite something else to use that 
2  concept to narrow the Fourth Amendment from what it 
3  originally meant.  And it seems to me that when that 
4  device is installed against the will of the owner of the 
5
6  thereby rendering the owner of the car not secure in his 
7  effects -- the car is one of his effects -- against an 
8  unreasonable search and seizure.  It is attached to the 
9  car against his will, and it is a search because what it 
obtains is the location of that car from there forward. 
10
11  Now, why -- why isn't that correct?  Do you deny that 
12  it's a trespass? 
13
14  trespass, but it was equally a technical trespass in the 
15
16  transferred to somebody that had -- and it had a radio 
17  transmitter --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but the owner of the 
18
19  can at the time it was installed consented, and that is 
not this case.  There is no consent by the owner of the 
20
21  property to which this device was affixed.  In fact, it 
22  was done, as Justice Scalia indicated, surreptitiously. 
23
24  the owner of the can once he acquired it to have it 
contain a foreign item installed by the government. 
25

 MR. DREEBEN:  But there was no consent to 

 MR. DREEBEN:  It may be a technical 

United States v. Karo, when a can of ether was

it --

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, this Court thought that 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It may be a sneaky thing to 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's too bad.  That 

no difference because the purpose of the Fourth 
Amendment is to protect privacy interests and meaningful 
interferences with possessory interests, not to cover 
all technical trespasses.  And the case that I --

1  And --
2
3  doesn't make it a trespass.  I mean --
4
5
6
7  do, but -- but every sneaky thing is not a trespass. 
 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, this Court thought that 
8
9  it was a technical trespass in Karo and said that made 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16
 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think the Court --
17
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, the -- the privacy 
18  rationale doesn't expand it but narrows it in some 
19  respects.
20
21  And I think the case that most clearly illustrates the 
22  distinction between trespass and Fourth Amendment 
23  protection is Oliver v. United States, the case that 
24  reaffirmed the open fields doctrine.  In that case, 
25

there was absolutely no doubt that the police committed 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, we've narrowed the 

Fourth Amendment? 

 MR. DREEBEN:  It changes it, Justice Scalia. 

8

by the Fourth Amendment. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Undoubtedly, but the 

 MR. DREEBEN:  No, the rationale was that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- it was not an 

1  a trespass under local law.  They entered, they crossed 
2  fences, they ignored big "no trespassing" signs; and 
3  this Court held that the interests that are protected by 
4  trespass law are distinct from the interests protected 
5
6
7  rationale of that case was that it was not an 
8  unreasonable --
9
10
11  unreasonable search. 
12
13  Justice Scalia.  The rationale of that case was that 
14  open fields are not among the things that are protected 
15
16  specifically focused on the distinction between trespass 
17  law and Fourth Amendment law. 
18
19  would also not be a search if you put a GPS device on 
all of our cars, monitored our movements for a month? 
20
21  You think you're entitled to do that under your theory? 
22
23

 MR. DREEBEN:  The Justices of this Court? 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes. 
 (Laughter.)
 MR. DREEBEN:  Under our theory and under

by the Fourth Amendment.  And the Court was very

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, equally, Mr. Chief

1  this Court's cases, the Justices of this Court when 
2  driving on public roadways have no greater expectation 
3  of --
4
5
6  on every one of our cars, follow us for a month; no 
7  problem under the Constitution? 
8
9  Justice, if the FBI wanted to, it could put a team of 
surveillance agents around the clock on any individual 
10
11 
and follow that individual's movements as they went 
around on the public streets, and they would thereby 
12 
13 
gather --
14
15
16  of whether there's a technical trespass or not is 
17  potentially a ground for deciding this particular case, 
18  but it seems to me the heart of the problem that's 
19  presented by this case and will be presented by other 
20
21  pre-computer, pre-Internet age, much of the privacy -- I 
22  would say most of the privacy -- that people enjoyed was 
23  not the result of legal protections or constitutional 
24  protections; it was the result simply of the difficulty 
25

of traveling around and gathering up information. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that seems to get --

to me to get to what's really involved here.  The issue 

cases involving new technology is that in the 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

public.  If -- if this case is decided on the ground 

 So, how do we deal with this?  Do we just 

public streets without committing a technical trespass. 

 But with computers, it's now so simple to 
1
2  amass an enormous amount of information about people 
3  that consists of things that could have been observed on 
4  the streets, information that was made available to the 
5
6  that there was a technical trespass, I don't have much 
7  doubt that in the near future, it will be possible -- I 
8  think it's possible now in many instances -- for law 
9  enforcement to monitor people's movements on -- on 
10
11
12  say, well, nothing is changed, so that all the 
13  information that people expose to the public is -- is 
14  fair game?  There's no -- there's no search or seizure 
when that is -- when that is obtained because there 
15
16  isn't a reasonable expectation of privacy, but isn't 
17  there a real change in -- in this regard? 
 MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think, Justice Alito, 
18
19  that there's a particularly dramatic change in this case 
20
21
 It is possible to envision broader advances 
22  in technology that would allow more public information 
23  to be amassed and put into computer systems.  But I 
24  think that the remedy for that -- if this Court agrees 
with the principles in Knotts and Karo and applies them 
25

from what went on in the Karo and the Knotts cases. 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

confronted in that case with Justice Stewart's view in 

1  to this case, the remedy is through legislation, just as 
2  when the Court held that amassing pen register data, all 
3  of the numbers that you dial on your telephone, the 
4  lengths of the times of the calls.  The Court was 
5
6  dissent, that --
7
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There was a third party 
8  involved in the telephone -- in the pen register case. 
9  And, here, it's the police.  Essentially, I think you 
answered the question that the government's position 
10
11 
would mean that any of us could be monitored whenever we 
leave our homes.  So, the only thing secure is the home. 
12 
13 
Is -- I mean, that is -- that is the end point of your 
argument, that an electronic device, as long as it's not 
14 
used inside the house, is okay. 
15
16
17  monitoring somebody's movements in public.  We're not 
18  talking about monitoring their conversations, their 
19  telephone calls, the interior of their cars, their 
20
21  Fourth Amendment protection that this Court has 
22  recognized. 
23
24  question that I think people are driving at, at least as 
25

private letters or packages.  So, there are enclaves of 

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, we're talking here about 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What -- what is the 

I understand them and certainly share the concern, is 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And no one, or at least very rarely, sends 

monitoring and what happened in the past is memories are 

1  that if you win this case, then there is nothing to 
2  prevent the police or the government from monitoring 24 
3  hours a day the public movement of every citizen of the 
4  United States.  And -- and the difference between the 
5
6  fallible; computers aren't. 
7
8  human beings to follow people 24 hours a day.  That 
9  occasionally happens.  But with the machines, you can. 
So, if you win, you suddenly produce what sounds like 
10
11 
1984 from their brief.  I understand they have an 
interest in perhaps dramatizing that, but -- but maybe 
12 
13 
overly.  But it still sounds like it. 
14
15
16  futuristic scenario that's just been painted and is done 
17  more so in their briefs? 
 MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer, first of all, 
18
19  this is exactly the argument that was presented to the 
20
21  technology in that case seemed extraordinarily advanced, 
22  and there was a potential for it to be used.  The 
23  Respondent --
24
25

 And so, what protection is there, if any, 
once we accept your view of the case, from this slight 

Court in Knotts.  If you go back to 1983, the beeper 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Of course, that's true. 

And they do have a limit.  In this case, they say Knotts 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company

us, it's short of every journey in a month. 

1  involved a single journey, or let's say it involved four 
2  journeys.  And let's say it involved four journeys in 
3  2 days.  This involves every journey for a month.  So, 
4  they say whatever the line is that's going to protect 
5
6
 So, I'm not asking -- I'm saying I accept 
7  your point there.  And what do you say is the limit? 
 MR. DREEBEN:  I first want to address the 
8
9  suggestion that you could draw a line somewhere between 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19
20
21  that uses the technique which is used sometimes, and I 
22  think it's used for example in the bribing the judge 
23  case, you know, with campaign contributions.  You draw 
24  an outer limit, you say you can't go beyond that.  We 
25

a month and a trip and have a workable standard for 
police officers to use.  Police officers use a variety 
of investigative techniques which in the aggregate 
produce an enormous amount of information.  Pen 
registers, trash pulls.  They look at financial records. 
They conduct visual surveillance.  And under a principle 
of law that says 1 trip is okay but 30 trips is not, 
there is absolutely no guidance for law enforcement in 
how they are --

know within that, there is no standard.  We'll leave it 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, there is the same 

kind of guidance that you have in any case of this Court 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 That's not necessarily desirable, but that 

1  for the lower courts to work out, and we'll review it 
2  over time. 
3
4  is a method this Court has sometimes used.
 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I --
5
6
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But even if it's wrong, I 
7  want to know, are you saying there is no limit or are 
8  you suggesting one? 
 MR. DREEBEN:  I'm suggesting that the Court 
9
do the same thing that it did in Knotts.  This case does 
10
11  not involve 24-hour surveillance of every citizen of the 
12  United States.  It involves following one suspected drug 
13  dealer as to whom there was very strong suspicion, for a 
14  period of time that actually is less than a month, 
15
16
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then you're --
17  you're moving away from your argument.  Your argument is 
18  it doesn't depend how much suspicion you have; it 
19  doesn't depend on how urgent it is.  Your argument is 
you can do it, period.  You don't have to give any 
20
21  reason.  It doesn't have to be limited in any way, 
22  right?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you're talking 

1  normal way in these situations that we draw these limits 
2  how intrusive the search can be, how long it can be, is 
3  by having a magistrate spell it out in a warrant? 
4
movements of a car on a public roadway, which even 
5
6  Justice Breyer's question seems to concede could be 
7  monitored for a day or perhaps 4 days, there is no 
8  Fourth Amendment search, unless --
9
about the difference between seeing a little tile and 
10
11  seeing a mosaic.  The one gives you information; the 
12  other doesn't. 
13
 MR. DREEBEN:  So does a pen register.  So 
14  does a garbage pull.  So does looking at everybody's 
15
16  this Court has held are not searches.  And the --
17
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Dreeben, this case 
18  started out with a warrant.  There was a warrant, and 
19  the limits weren't followed.  The warrant said 10 days, 
do this in 10 days, and the police took 11.  They were 
20
21  supposed to do it in D.C.  Instead, they did it in 
22  Maryland. 
 So, the police could have gotten permission 
23
24  to conduct this search.  In fact, they had received it. 
Now, I take it that the practice had been, because it's 
25

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company

warrants? 

 MR. DREEBEN:  In this case, there would not 

1  in the electronic surveillance manual, better get a 
2  warrant.  Was there any problem about -- when this kind 
3  of surveillance is wanted by the government, to get a 
4  warrant?  Were they encountering difficulty getting 
5
6
7  have been any difficulty getting a warrant, Justice 
8  Ginsburg.  And the warrant authorized things beyond just 
9  monitoring the car.  It authorized entering the car in 
order to install it, which wasn't necessary here.  It 
10
11 
also authorized monitoring the car in a location where 
there was a reasonable expectation of privacy.  This 
12 
13 
case is only about monitoring a car on public streets. 
 But I think it's very important to keep in 
14
15
16  surveillance is when the police have not yet acquired 
17  probable cause but have a situation that does call for 
18  monitoring.  And I'd like to give an example.

3
4  anonymous tip that there's the same bomb in somebody's 
house, do you get a warrant or do -- do you just go in? 
5
6
 MR. DREEBEN:  You do neither, because 
7  without probable cause you cannot enter the house. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  Well, why 
8
9  are you asking for a different rule in this situation?
 MR. DREEBEN:  Because the -- the police in 
10
11  this situation have the traditional means available to 
12  investigate these sorts of tips.  They could put teams 
13  of agents on all the individuals who are within the pool 
14  of suspicion and follow them 24/7.  And that would

16
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're -- you're now 
17  suggesting an answer to Justice Kennedy's question, 
18  which is it would be okay to take the computer chip, put 
19  it on somebody's overcoat, and follow every citizen 
everywhere they go indefinitely.  So -- under your 
20
21  theory and the theory espoused in your brief, you could

2  of a person, they have no reasonable expectation that 
3  their possessions will not be used by you.  That's 
4  really the bottom line --

7  invade their sense of integrity in their choices about 
8  who they want to see or use their things.  That's really 
9  argument you're making.
10
11  think that that goes considerably farther than our 
12  position in this case, because our position is not that 
13  the Court should overrule United States v. Karo and 
14  permit monitoring within a private residence.  That is 
15
16  plus probable cause.  And monitoring an individual 
17  through their clothing poses an extremely high 
18  likelihood that they will enter a place where they have

3  which this Court said in Knotts that no individual has a 
4  reasonable expectation of privacy because when they go

7  to avert their eyes from anything that any member of the

violate your privacy to be followed by a beeper, the

 MR. DREEBEN:  They probably would also feel

1  v. United States that when the police have probable 
2  cause to stop someone for a traffic violation, they can 
3  do that.  There are protections --
4
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was -- that is when 
the police came upon the violator.  But this is -- it's 
5
6  all in a computer.  The police can say we want to find 
7  out more about X, so consult the database, see if 
8  there's an indication that he was ever speeding in the 
9  last 28 days.
10
11  very hard for police to follow somebody and find a 
12  traffic violation if they want to do that.  But to 
13  answer in part Justice Breyer's earlier concern about 
14  limiting principles, this Court recognized in the Whren 
15
16  restriction on discriminatory or arbitrary or oppressive 
17  stops that are based on invidious characteristics, the 
18  Equal Protection Clause is.  The First Amendment also 
19  stands as a protection.  If this Court believes that

2  Fourth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment says -- or it has 
3  been interpreted to mean that if I'm on a public bus and 
4  the police want to feel my luggage, that's a violation; 
and yet, this kind of monitoring, installing the GPS and

7  outside their house in the car, is not?  I mean, it just 
8  -- something about it that -- just doesn't parse.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I'm quite sure, Justice 
Ginsburg, that if you ask citizens whether the police 
10
11  could freely pick up their trash for a month and paw 
12  through it, looking for evidence of a crime, or keep a 
13  record of every telephone call that they made for the 
14  duration and the number that it went through, or conduct 
intense visual surveillance of them, that citizens would

22  of people did think that the government was tracking

6  is accomplished no matter what you put on somebody's car

of all kinds of things ranging from kidnappings of lost

children to terrorism to all kinds of crimes.

 They're willing to go as far as reasonable

14  you will avoid the 1984 scenario, and you will in fact

that if somebody goes to London, almost every place that

the police can put together snapshots of where everybody 
is all the time.  So, why is this different from that?

21  You don't want us to do that.  So, now we ask you about 
22  Karo, and you say, oh, well, there was a trespass.  So, 
23  that's -- that's not -- that's not a responsive answer.

4  satellites that look down and can hone in on your home 
on a block in a neighborhood.  I don't see that far in 
5

7  show you the entire world and let you track somebody on 
8  the camera from place to place. 
9
 MR. LECKAR:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, if -- give us a 
10
theory.  Is that okay for the police to access those 
11 
cameras and look at you moving from place to place?  And 
12 
13 
if that's okay, then why is this not okay?  What is your 
theory of your case?
14 
15
16  with respect to video camera, if they're targeting an 
17  individual -- this presents a grave question.  It's a 
18  question that need not be resolved given this case.  But 
19  if the Court wanted to address that question, once the 
20
21  individualized targeting for use of a pervasive network 
22  of cameras, and GPS is like a million cameras.  That's 
23  the -- the New York Court of Appeals pointed that out, 
24  and this --

police target somebody, they want to engage in

questioning leads you into it -- it seems to me leaps 
over the difficult part of your case.  The issue before 
us is not -- not in the abstract whether this police 
conduct is unreasonable.  The unreasonableness 
requirement or the unreasonableness prohibition does not 
take effect unless there has been a search.  And our 
cases have said that there's no search when -- when you 
are in public and where everything that you do is open 
to -- to the view of people.  That's the hard question 
in the case, not whether this is unreasonable.  That's 
not what the Fourth Amendment says, the police can't do 
anything that's unreasonable.  They can do a lot of 
stuff that's unreasonable without violating the Fourth 
Amendment, and the -- the protection against that is the 
legislature.

3  where the car is going on the public streets, where the

3  in Bond v. United States.  A GPS in your car is like --
4  or anybody's car, is like -- without a warrant, is like 
5
6  uninvited stranger.  That's what it is.  Now, what --
7
8  when the police surveil -- surveil you for -- for a 
9  month.
10
11  in this case, Justice Scalia, is this:  A tail -- if 
12  they can -- if they want a tail, if they want to commit 
13  the resources, that's fine.  But what a GPS does, it 
14  involves -- it allows the government to engage in

17  it.  The record in this case showed that many times the

19

3  police be allowed surreptitiously to put these machines 
4  on people's cars and either -- call it a seizure, call 
it a search, call it a search and seizure in the words 
5
6  of Katz, or call it a Fourth Amendment violation.

9  Mr. Jones or anybody else be really upset if they found 
that the police had sneaked up to their car and put an

of the car?  What would they say about that, other than 
12

the fact that the police are wasting money doing this? 
 MR. LECKAR:  If it were nothing more than a

2  Amendment problem.

4  about is not this little thing that's put on your car. 
It's not this invasion of your property interest.  It's 
5
6  the monitoring that takes place. 
7
 MR. LECKAR:  The monitoring makes it 
8  meaningful.  Putting it on enables them to make --
9
question in a different way, suppose that the police 
10
11  could do this without ever committing the trespass. 
12  Suppose that in the future all cars are going to have 
13  GPS tracking systems, and the police could essentially 
14  hack into such a system without committing the trespass. 
Would the constitutional issue we face be any different? 
15
16
 MR. LECKAR:  If, as I assume, that's because 
17  of manufacturers doing it, or because Congress has 
18  legislated it, Justice Kagan?  Under either 
19  circumstance, people would know.  They would know that 
their privacy rights had been taken away.  Whether that 
20
21  would be possible to be -- to go through Congress, I 
22  seriously doubt, but people would know.

13  including Washington, cameras on -- at intersections on

 MR. LECKAR:  No, Justice Sotomayor.  I think 
3  the workable rule and the simplest rule that should be

law enforcement agency you came here looking for a rule; 
5
6  we're going to give you a rule.  If you want to use GPS 
7  devices, get a warrant, absent exigent circumstances or

of the case to me, and maybe there -- it's irrelevant

10
11  advances can make the police more efficient at what they 
12  do through some of the examples that were discussed 
13  today:  Cameras, airplanes, beepers, GPS.  At the same 
14  time, technology and how it's used can change our 
expectations of privacy in the ways that Justice Alito 
15
16  was alluding to.  Today perhaps GPS can be portrayed as 
17  a 1984-type invasion, but as people use GPS in their 
18  lives and for other purposes, our expectations of 
19  privacy surrounding our location may also change.  For 
20
21
22  seems too much to me.  I mean, if you think about this,

3  that we don't think that our privacy interests would be 
4  violated by this robotic device, I'm -- I'm not sure how

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You probably haven't had 
14  the opportunity to go into the cases.  A hypothetical. 
Suppose exactly these facts, only the police aren't 
15
16  involved.  A neighbor does it to another neighbor in 
17  order to see where that neighbor is going, and when he 
18  finds out, he tells his wife and other neighbors.  Do 
19  you think that in most States, that would be an invasion 
20

 MR. DREEBEN:  I'm willing to assume that it 
22  might be, Justice Kennedy, but I don't think that this

24  Amendment by State law invasions of privacy.  The Court

 MR. DREEBEN:  No, I don't think so.  And --
18
19  and the fact that something may be a tort for a private 
person doesn't mean that it's a problem for the police 
20
21  to do it.  For example, in the Dow Chemical case, where 
22  the police used -- EPA in that case actually used 
23  cameras to surveil an industrial plant.  There was a 
24  claim that it would have violated trade secret law for 
anybody else to do that.  And the Court accepted that

 MR. DREEBEN:  The Federal Government I can 
14  speak to, and it's in the low thousands annually.  It's 
not a massive universal use of an investigative 
15
16  technique.  The FBI requires that there be some 
17  reasonable basis for using GPS before it installs it. 
18  And as a result, this is a technique that basically 
19  supplements visual surveillance rather than supplanting 
20
21
22  directed at Respondent.  The GPS allowed it to be more 
23  effective.  As Justice Kennedy and, I think, Justice 
24  Scalia's hypotheticals illustrated, Respondent is 
essentially conceding that around-the-clock visual 
25

it all together.
