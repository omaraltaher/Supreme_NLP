 (10:05 a.m.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 
first this morning in case 05-380, Gonzales v. Carhart. 
General Clement.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Congress held six hearings over four 

different Congresses and heard from dozens of witnesses 
in determining that partial-birth abortions are never 
medically necessary, pose health risks, and should be 
banned.  Under familiar principles of deference to 
congressional factfinding, those determinations should 
be upheld as long as they represent reasonable 
inferences based on substantial evidence in the 
congressional record.

 That standard is amply satisfied here.  The 

evidence before Congress was clear that partial-birth 
abortions were never medically necessary, and that safe 
alternatives were always available such that no woman 
would be prevented from terminating her pregnancy.  As a 
result, Congress was entitled to make a judgment in 
furthering its legitimate interests that they were going

to ban a particularly gruesome procedure that blurred 
the line between abortion and infanticide.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Clement, couldn't 

a similar record be made with respect to what is the 
more common procedure, the D&E, that involves 
dismemberment of a fetus inside the womb.  So assuming 
you're right that it is constitutional for Congress to 
ban the D&X proceeding, wouldn't the same reasoning 
apply, couldn't Congress make similar findings with 
respect to what is the most common method for second 
trimester abortions?

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  I don't think so, Justice 
Ginsburg, and I think that this Court's precedence, in 
particular the Danforth case, would stand as an obstacle 
to that piece of legislation, because in Danforth, this 
Court struck down an effort to ban what was then the 
majority method of inducing a second-term abortion.

 And I think in the same way, there is quite 
a different situation when Congress comes in and tries 
to deal with the primary abortion method in the second 
trimester.  Here, though, Congress didn't go after the 
dog, so to speak, it went after the tail.  This very 
aberrant procedure, atypical procedure.  And the numbers 
are hard to come by, but I don't think anybody suggests 
that the D&X procedure is anything more than a very

small minority of second trimester abortions.  And so I 
do think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even though we are told 
by some of the medical briefs that the procedures are 
basically the same, they start out in the same way and 
that the difference -- the differences are not large in 
particular cases.

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, 
let me make a couple of points in response to that.  I 
think -- taken at the broader level first, I think there 
is one very important difference between these two 
procedures that led Congress to ban one and allow the 
other to stand.  And that is whether fetal demise takes 
place in utero, which is, of course, the hallmark of all 
abortions, or whether fetal demise, the lethal act takes 
place when the fetus is more than halfway out of the 
mother.

 Now, as to their suggestion, I think most 
particularly by Respondents in the second case, that 
there really is no meaningful difference between those 
two procedures.  And with respect, I just don't think 
the record supports that.  If you look at the record in 
this case, it's very clear in the district court opinion 
that you have some doctors, and examples would be 
Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Creinin, or one of the Nebraska

Plaintiffs, Dr. Vibhakar.  They go in, in each and every 
case, and try to perform a dismemberment, or D&E, 
procedure.

 And because they're trying to perform the 

D&E procedure, they need to dilate the cervix only 
modestly.  And so Dr. Creinin, for example, his 
testimony is he only dilates the cervix two centimeters 
or two and a half centimeters.

 Now, in contrast, you have other doctors, 
and here the examples I would point to are two of the 
Plaintiff's experts, Dr. Chasen and Dr. Frederickson, 
they, in every single case, set out to perform the D&X 
procedure.  And that has material differences.  For 
example, the dilation regimen that they use.  And so 
Dr. Frederickson, for example, uses multiple sets of 
laminaria to dilate the cervix, and she gets a much 
greater degree of dilation, 5 to 6 centimeters of 
dilation.

 And of course, not only do they set out to 

perform different procedures, but they, in fact, perform 
different procedures.  So the evidence here again 
reflects that Dr. Vibhakar, for example, in 100 percent 
of the cases, ends up performing a dismemberment 
procedure, or a D&E procedure.  For Dr. Creinin, it's 99 
percent.

Now, by contrast, Dr. Chasen and 

Dr. Frederickson, when they set out to perform a D&X 
procedure, they are successful in their objective less 
often.  There are different numbers for different 
doctors, but it seems that, at most, they can achieve 
their objective about a third of the time.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, those doctors 

testified in the congressional hearings or in the Eighth 
Circuit or Ninth Circuit or the Second Circuit?  There 
are so many doctors here.  Which are the two that you're 
referring to that do not dilate the cervix fully?  Did 
they testify in any of the district court cases?

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  They did, Justice Kennedy, 

and in particular, Dr. Creinin is an expert.  I think 
his deposition was taken, or his testimony was taken 
principally in the California case, but it was 
introduced in all three cases as part of the evidentiary 
record.  Dr. Vibhakar is one of the Plaintiffs in this 
particular case.  And Dr. Chasen and Dr. Frederickson 
would also -- their testimony was in the record, I 
think, in all three cases.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Just from my going through 
this record, I compare it with Stenhart, with what's in 
Congress.  We have two cases here.  And it's a fair 
conclusion that there are, in each case, before Congress

and in here, there are some doctors who think this is 
safe and some doctors who think it isn't safe.

 And if you look at the -- sort of by 

counting, by numbers, I guess if you look by lines of 
testimony or by different doctors, interestingly enough, 
it seems to me there are more doctors in these two cases 
and in front of Congress who said it is not safe than 
there were when we considered the other case.  And there 
are fewer doctors who say it is safe even with the other 
case.  So I don't know if you're supposed to count 
doctors or what.

 My question would be, if this -- do we owe 

more deference to a congressional finding or to Congress 
than we owe to a State legislature?  What is -- I mean, 
I take it a State legislature is democratically elected, 
and don't we owe similar deference to both?

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Breyer, I 
think you certainly owe deference to both.  I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, if we owe deference 
to both, and I would have thought that we did, then I 
think in the Nebraska case, despite the deference that 
was owed, the Court came to the conclusion that the 
statute of Nebraska was unconstitutional because it 
lacked an exception for the health of the mother, 
something that came from preceding cases.  So if giving

deference to Nebraska, we reach that conclusion there, 
and if the deference that is owed is the same, and if 
the evidence is about the same on both sides, how can we 
reach a different conclusion here?

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Breyer, I 

mean, obviously I'm at a certain deficit to you in 
discussing what this Court held in the Stenberg opinion, 
which you wrote.  But my reading of that opinion is that 
this Court did not focus on what was before the Nebraska 
legislature.  But this Court focused on what the 
district court found.  And in particular, in the 
critical part of the opinion, which would be Section 
2(A) of the opinion, as I read the opinion, what this 
Court did is it confronted Nebraska's argument that the 
D&X procedure was not, in fact, safer.

 And the first thing this Court did is said, 

well, that argument faces quite a burden, because the 
district court made a contrary finding.  And then this 
Court in 2(A)(1) of the opinion referenced that finding, 
and four different times cited the district court 
record, and then so on and so forth.  It then noted the 
various eight arguments were made by the State in its 
amici to the contrary.  And as I read the opinion, it 
basically said the latter, the objections don't 
outweigh the former, the findings.

Now, I think if you compare the record 

before the courts and before Congress, compare that to 
what was before the district court in Stenberg, I think 
there is a much more robust factual record here.  If you 
look at the Stenberg case --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  General Clement, are not 

some of the findings by Congress clearly erroneous?  For 
example, there is a statement that no current medical 
schools provide instruction in the procedure.  Now 
that's clearly wrong, isn't it?

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, I mean, specifically 

what Congress found in that finding was that none of 
them provided it as part of a curriculum.  And I think 
what the record here clearly reflects -- you know, I 
don't know that the idea of a curriculum -- I don't know 
exactly what Congress had in mind.  But clearly, is a 
matter of sort of what you teach residents --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you think that finding 

is correct?

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  I don't know if it's 

correct, based on the curriculum.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Supposing there was a lot 
of evidence introduced in the district court that there 
were schools like Yale and New York University that did 
include this as part of a curriculum, could the district

court disregard that finding and make a contrary 
finding?

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  I think if the evidence in 
the district court were overwhelmingly to the contrary, 
I think that the district court could effectively 
undermine that one finding.  I don't think in this case 
anything turned --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, on other findings, 

is there a different standard of review of what the 
district court found as opposed to what Congress found?
 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Stevens, I 

would answer you this way.  You might first want to 
isolate those situations where, if the district court 
was addressing something, an issue that just wasn't 
before Congress at all, but it's somehow relevant, and 
makes factual findings, I suppose the district court is 
entitled to the normal kind of deference on review.

 But I think if you have situations, which 
you have in this case, where the district court heard 
some of the same witnesses who testified before Congress 
and before the district court, and the district court 
makes a different credibility finding than the Congress 
made, I don't think that's a basis for the district 
court to be able to overcome the contrary findings of 
Congress.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Well, I don't understand 
Congress to have made credibility findings.  As I read 
the -- I read the whole finding.  There were six or 
seven pages of findings, and I don't find a single 
reference in those findings to the performance of an 
abortion on a nonviable fetus.  All of the language in 
the findings seem to be referring to viable fetuses just 
inches away from becoming a person.  And I don't think 
you can even find the word fetus in those findings.  The 
findings as opposed to the text of the statute.

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Sure, Justice Stevens, I 
think I need to clarify an important point there, which 
is to say, the statute didn't focus on viable versus 
nonviable, because it applies to both sides of the 
viability line.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'm talking about the 

findings.  Is there a single word in the findings that 
refers to a viable fetus?  It maybe refers to a 
nonviable fetus.

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  I don't think there is, 

Justice Stevens, but I wouldn't find that at all 
remarkable in a statute that applies and bans certain 
procedures without regard to whether the procedure is 
applied to a viable or nonviable fetus and when 
Congress does make specific findings that the procedure

it's banning would have the effect of preventing a 
lethal act on a fetus just inches from being born.  It's 
not --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I interrupt?
 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Sure.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  It's not preventing the 

lethal act, it is requiring that the lethal act be 
performed prior to any part of the delivery, because 
there is no doubt there will be a lethal act.  The only 
issue is when it may be performed.

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  The issue is whether --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.
 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Yes.  Because the issue is 

to whether it's going to be performed in utero, or when the 
child is more than halfway outside the womb, and that of 
course --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Whether the fetus is more 
than halfway out, and some of these fetuses I understand 
in the procedure, are only four or five inches long. 
They are very different from fully formed babies.

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Justice Stevens, again, 

you're right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  When it's halfway out, I 
guess you can call it either a child or a fetus.  It's 
sort of half and half isn't it?

GENERAL CLEMENT:  I think you could use 

either terminology, Justice Scalia.  My point is, 
nothing turns on the terminology.  I mean, the 
terminology that Congress chose to use is a living 
fetus.  I think the point, though, is that when fetal 
demise is induced in utero, whatever else you think 
about that procedure that is classically an abortion, as 
it has been always understood.  But when fetal demise is 
induced when the, when the living fetus is over halfway 
outside of the womb, then I think Congress --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Wouldn't the fetus be -- I 

think it suffer a demise in seconds anyway.

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well it may be seconds, it 

may be hours; it depends on -- because even a pre --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you not agree that it 

has no chance of survival, in most cases?

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  If we are talking about 
previability then by definition chances are it won't 
survive.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, that's right.
 GENERAL CLEMENT:  But again, I don't think 

that, you know, that anything in this act --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Congress has made the 

judgment that it is far preferable to ensure that fetal 
demise takes place before any delivery begins.  That's

Official 

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, I'm not sure if it's 
whether, that's a fair, that's a fair summary.  I mean, 
you know, the line isn't that fetal demise has to be 
done before any delivery begins, but the basic point of 
this statute is to draw a bright line between a 
procedure that induces fetal demise in utero and one 
where the lethal act occurs when the child or the fetus, 
whichever you want to call it, is more than halfway 
outside of the mother's womb.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would it, would it be 

lawful or would it be infanticide to deliver the fetus 
entirely and just let it expire without any attempt to 
keep it alive?

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, in the 

postviability context it would clearly be, it would 
clearly be infanticide.  I think in the previability 
context, if you have a complete delivery but the child 
isn't going to survive, I don't think it would be 
infanticide to necessarily let the child expire --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. --
GENERAL CLEMENT:  But I do think by contrast 

if somebody tried to, with the fetus, you know, 
perfectly alive and in the hours that it might have to 
live, if somebody came in and ripped its head open, I

think we'd call that murder, and in fact Congress passed 
another statute --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Clement, that's 
not what this case is about, because I think you have 
recognized, quite appropriately, that we're not talking 
about whether any fetus will be preserved by this 
legislation.  The only question that you are raising is 
whether Congress can ban a certain method of performing 
an abortion.  So anything about infanticide, babies, all 
that, is just beside the point because what this bans is 
a method of abortion.  It doesn't preserve any fetus 
because you just do it inside the womb instead of 
outside.

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Justice Ginsberg, that's 

right, but I don't think that's to trivialize Congress's 
interest in maintaining a bright line between abortion 
and infanticide.  And the way I would illustrate it is 
that line, even if you might think it has a temporal 
line, in the sense that viability versus previability is 
relevant, it clearly has a spatial dimension as well and 
the best illustration of that I think is think about a 
lawful postviability abortion.  There is a problem with 
the mother's health, there is a problem with her life so 
it's a lawful postviability abortion.  I don't think 
anybody thinks that the law is or should be

indifferent to whether in that case fetal demise takes 
place in utero or outside the mother's womb.  The one is 
abortion, the other is murder.

 And I think that just recognizes that even 
in the postviability context you have a very important 
line which is a spatial line, and that line is basically 
in womb, outside of womb, and what Congress tried to do 
in this statute is to draw that line and differentiate 
between one procedure where fetal demise takes place in 
utero --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if this case were 

limited to postviability abortions it would be a 
different matter.  But isn't it so that the vast 
majority of these abortions are going to be performed 
previability?

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  I think that's probably 
right, Justice Ginsburg, but I think the point I would 
make is that Congress has an interest in maintaining the 
spatial line between infanticide and abortion, even with 
respect to previability fetuses and that's true for at 
least two reasons.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If -- I see what you're 

driving at in terms of the procedure.  We are focusing 
on a universe where the fetus is not going to survive no 
matter what, right?

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, with the caveat that 

the statute does apply both --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's the area of 

focus.

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, Congress has said that --
the doctor, you can achieve that result through method A, 
but not through method B, and you're saying Congress had 
good reason for doing that.  I take it Congress also 
agrees that if method B, which they don't want, were to 
be necessary for the safety or health of the mother, the 
Constitution would require it being done.  I didn't see 
anything here about Congress disagreeing with that.

that, we don't think it's ever necessary for the health 
or safety of the mother.  That's where we are.  Now as I 
look at the record, I see many, many, many doctors 
telling Congress and everybody else that it is 
necessary, and safe.  And I see other doctors telling 
Congress primarily, but in court, too, that it isn't 
necessary, ever for safety.

 And so if medical opinion is divided, and 

I'm not advocating what I'm about to say, I just want to 
know your reaction.  If medical opinion is divided, why 
wouldn't it be up to this Court or could this Court say 
this use of this procedure, we enjoin the statute to 
permit its use but only where appropriate medical 
opinion finds it necessary for the safety or health of 
the mother?

 Now, if Congress is right, there will be no 
such case so it's no problem.  But if Congress is wrong, 
then the doctor will be able to perform the procedure 
and Congress couldn't object to that because the 
Congress isn't worried about, I mean Congress, then 
Congress was wrong.  They agreed that we had a health or 
safety exception.

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  With respect, Justice 

Breyer, here is the problem with that way of approaching 
the statute.  That might be a permissible way of

approaching it if what the evidence on the other side 
was, that well you know there are cause-specific reasons 
why you need this procedure.  There are particular 
conditions where you need this procedure.  But that's 
not the evidence on the other side.  What their doctors 
say, the doctors who perform this D&X procedure, the 
Dr. Chasens, the Dr. Fredericksons, what they will tell 
you is that every single case the D&X procedure is 
better and safer and they want to do it.  And so it 
doesn't make, I mean Congress can't pass a statute that 
bans procedure A, and that ban doesn't apply any time a 
doctor prefers procedure A.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  It just wouldn't be a 
question of the doctor's preference.  You would have to 
refer back to prior cases, and what the prior cases talk 
about including Stenberg is not that that the doctor 
simply has a preference, but rather that there has to be 
a significant body of medical opinion that says that 
this is safer procedure and necessary for the safety of 
the mother.

 Now, where that's true, the Court has 
previously said that the Constitution protects the 
right.  And I don't see anything in what Congress says 
that wants to change that law.  They simply have a 
different view of the facts.

GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, they do have a 

different view of the facts.  And I guess the question 
--

JUSTICE BREYER:  So if they have a different 
view of the facts, why can't we leave it up to whatever 
facts develop?  If there is an appropriate body of 
medical opinion that does in fact believe this is 
necessary for the health of the mother, so be it, and 
the abortion could be performed and the injunction would 
say that.

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And otherwise not.
 GENERAL CLEMENT:  If this Court rejects the 
facial challenge to this statute it is still going to be 
open for litigants in the future to try to identify 
specific conditions where this procedure is the safer 
alternative.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you tell me a 

hypothetical instance in which where an as applied 
challenge could be brought if we sustain the statutue 
on its face?  The procedure has to take place within 24, 
48, 72 hours.  How would as applied challenge take place? 
You know, I read all the doctors' testimony 
in this case, hundreds of pages, and I'm familiar with 
the area generally.  But it takes a while to get up to

speed.  I don't know if you could just go to a district 
judge and say I need an order, the judge would take --
would have to take many hours to understand that.

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Justice Kennedy, what I 

think I have in mind principally would be a 
preenforcement challenge that was an as applied 
challenge.  And what I have in mind, you know that's 
something that there is in other areas of the law, 
Steffl against Thompson is an example.  But what you 
would have in mind is a doctor who had standing under 
this Court's abortion jurisprudence would come in and 
say, look, in my practice I've seen that this procedure 
would be particularly useful in dealing with 
preeclampsia or placental previa or some condition.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why isn't that already in 
the record in the Ninth Circuit, in the Second Circuit 
and in the Eighth Circuit, in the district courts, 
proceedings in those circuits?

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, there is an effort 
to make that showing.  I don't think that it's been a 
successful effort to make that showing.  In fact I think 
if you look at the findings of the district courts in 
these cases, two of the three district courts found that 
there was no particular condition where the D&X abortion 
was medically necessary or had marginal safe benefits --

safety benefits.  In this case, the Nebraska case, the 
district court identified only two conditions, 
preeclampsia combined with maternal cancer, and placenta 
previa.  And as to those particular findings as we point 
out in our reply brief, there are problems with each of 
those findings.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  General Clement, I'm just 
thinking, trying to imagine how an as applied challenge 
would be really much different from what we have seen 
already.

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, I don't think, I 
mean, they've challenged everything including every 
application of the statute and they've tried to pick off 
some particular conditions.  What I'm imagining is in 
the future you might have, you might have additional 
evidence, you might have additional experience with 
doctors, and they might come in and target their 
challenge to particular conditions and try to say --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But General -- General 

Clement, conditions don't show up in the abstract. 
Wouldn't it often be the case that it depends on the 
vulnerability of the particular patient and you couldn't 
bring a preenforcement challenge as to that.  Maybe 
it's a question of hemorrhaging, that -- it's a 
combination of what the condition is and the

vulnerability of the particular patient and I don't see 
how that could be tested in advance.

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Ginsburg my 

understanding is even when you talk about an 
idiosyncratic condition, I mean, the doctors who perform 
these abortions perform, you know, hundreds of them a 
year and they can identify those conditions and they 
have names for those conditions and I think it would be 
amenable to bringing a more as applied challenge.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  General, do you 
understand the scope of this statute to be different 
than the scope of the statute at issue in Stenberg, 
focusing in particular on the deliberate and intentional 
language?

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  I certainly do, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and I think that this statute, unlike the 
Nebraska statute, clearly uses an anatomical landmark 
approach that is based in the text of the statute and 
clearly distinguishes between the D&E procedure on the 
one hand and the D&X on the other hand.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But isn't it quite 

independent of the anatomical approach that the health 
exception is denied?  I mean that's an -- that does not 
depend on the anatomical approach.  The anatomical 
approach may well be an answer at the facial

challenge stage, to problems of vagueness, for example. 
But the health excepton problem is not affected by that. 
And the difficulty that I have with your argument that 
somehow the health exception issue should be left to an 
as applied challenge is the statement in Stenberg, and 
it's on 938.

 I'm quoting:  "But where substantial medical 

authority supports the proposition that banning a 
particular abortion procedure could endanger women's 
health, Casey requires the statute to include a health 
exception where the procedure is necessary in 
appropriate medical judgment for the preservation --" 
-- excuse me -- "of the life or health of the mother."

 Now, your position, it seems to me, requires 

us to do one of three things.  Either we, we overrule 
Stenberg in that respect, or we, we find -- I don't know 
how but we might find, well, in this case, there is no 
substantial medical authority, and therefore on the face 
of the statute there seems to be no impediment in the 
Stenberg statement.  Or three, we say well, there seems 
to be a tension between the showing of substantial 
medical authority which occurred in the litigation in 
these cases and the findings made by Congress, and under 
those circumstances in effect we are required to ignore 
the record in the cases and go with Congress's

 Which of the three do we take?
 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Well, we would urge you to 

take any one of them.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Take all three.
 (Laughter.)
 JUDGE SOUTER:  No, but seriously --
GENERAL CLEMENT:  But in fairness, I mean, 
you know, we have an obligation to defend the statute. 
So our first, you know, our first effort would be to say 
we distinguish the --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay, but the problem, I 

guess -- focus the problem this way.  The, the Stenberg 
opinion talks about substantial medical authority as 
triggering this requirement for a statutory element. 
That problem is not focused simply by saying Congress 
made some findings and the district court made other 
findings and Congress should prevail.

 The fact is the substantial medical judgment 

finding I would suppose is satisfied by the, by the 
record in the district courts in these cases.  This is 
not one doctor's idiosyncratic judgment and a court can 
reasonably find, it seems to me, that there is 
substantial medical judgment.  If we are going to defer, 
as you say we should defer to Congress, haven't we got

Official 

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  I don't think so, Justice 
Souter.  Let me just -- I'd like to save some time for 
rebuttal, but let me try to answer it this way, which is 
our way of looking at Stenberg is Stenberg really 
doesn't address what you do when there are congressional 
findings.  And there is some tension between Stenberg 
and Turner on this, because Stenberg seems to suggest, 
well, when there is a doubt, the kind of doubt that 
would normally get you past a summary judgment, you 
defer to the doctors, and Turner seems to suggest when 
you have a doubt, conflicting evidence, the kind of 
doubt that might get you past summary judgment normally, 
you defer to Congress.  And it has to be one or the 
other.  It can't go both ways, can't go opposite ways, 
and we would say resolve that tension, but when there is 
congressional findings, something that you obviously 
didn't have to confront in Stenberg, defer to the 
congressional approach.

 If Stenberg means something contrary, that 

even in the face of congressional findings that you have 
to defer to a minority opinion of doctors and, you know, 
kind of invert what would normally be the way of 
approaching it, we think then that would be inconsistent 
with this Court's decision in Casey, among others, and

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRISCILLA SMITH

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MS. SMITH:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 The Government throughout this case has 

quarreled with the plaintiff's statement of Stenberg and 
Congress quarreled clearly with the district court 
findings, but their real argument here is with this 
Court in the Court's ruling in Stenberg, particularly in 
light of the congressional findings that are, that are 
frankly unsupported by either the congressional record 
or the additional evidence presented to the district 
courts.  The only course here that preserves the 
independence of the judiciary, that exemplifies the 
importance of stare decisis, not to mention the only 
course that will protect women from needless risks of 
uterine perforation, infertility, sepsis and hemorrhage, 
is to hold this act unconstitutional.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you tell me -- I 

didn't find it in the materials.  Maybe the statistics

aren't available.  In the cases where intact D&E or D&X 
are performed in the period I guess, what, 16 through 
20, 21st, 22nd weeks, in how many of those instances, do 
you have any idea, in how many of those instances is 
there serious health risk to the mother that requires 
the procedure as opposed to simply being an elective 
procedure?  Are there any statistics on that?

 MS. SMITH:  No.  In terms of the underlying 
medical conditions there really aren't, Your Honor, and 
it varies dramatically according to the practice of the 
physician.  If a physician is in a high risk OBGYN 
practice, he or she is much more likely to encounter 
patients with serious underlying medical conditions such 
as the ones that the doctors have testified about in 
this case, the liver disease, kidney disease, heart, 
cardiovascular disease, cancer of the placenta, bleeding 
placenta previa, all of these issues and underlying 
conditions that makes the impact and the risks that are 
reduced by the intact D&E particularly important.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We have no evidence 
either in the record before the Court or Congress as to 
how often that situation arises?

 MS. SMITH:  No, we don't, Your Honor.  We 

know that in some practices it's quite frequent, in some 
practices it's not as frequent because those are mostly

hospital-based practices.  But on the other hand, 
there's extensive evidence in this case, much more 
evidence frankly, Your Honor, Justice Breyer, than there 
was in the Stenberg case, of the, of the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I have just one other 
question that, it's generally related to the first. 
If there is substantial evidence that other procedures 
or alternate procedures are available, alternate to D&X, 
alternate to intact D&E, is your response that, although 
they're available as a matter of science, as a matter of, 
of medical expertise, they are not available because 
hospitals don't allow the patients to be admitted?  I 
was going to ask that same question to the Government, 
because there is some indication in the record that 
certain hospitals just don't admit patients for this 
purpose, which is -- goes back to my earlier question. 
I was wondering if that's because it's surely elective.

 MS. SMITH:  Because it's what sir?
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because it's purely 

elective and not medically necessary.

 MS. SMITH:  No, Your Honor.  Hospitals, 

many, many hospitals throughout the United States refuse 
to provide any abortions whatsoever as just a blanket 
rule.  There are some that will provide abortions in 
certain, in certain circumstances where the woman is

obtaining the abortion because of a certain medical 
condition.  Then there are women who are obtaining an 
abortion because they have chosen that that's the best 
course for them who also have underlying medical 
conditions.  So if you're a woman who has chosen to 
obtain an abortion and you have an underlying cardiac 
disease, for example -- we had a case like this in 
Louisiana.  The hospital refused to do the abortion 
because her chance of dying from the underlying medical 
condition was not over 50 percent.  So the availability 
of hospital services is somewhat unrelated to this case, 
but it is, it is quite limited in some circumstances.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it might be related 
in the sense that the Government's argument that there 
are alternate mechanisms is not a practical alternative. 
I was going to ask the Government about that.  On the 
other hand, the fact that any number of hospitals don't 
allow the procedure is also indicated, indication that 
there is a medical opinion against it.

 MS. SMITH:  No, not at all, Your Honor.  The 

medical opinion in those cases is against abortion 
whatsoever and a refusal to use one's facilities to 
provide any abortion --

 I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I didn't like your 

characterization and the Government's of the state of 
the record.  I asked my law clerk basically to go look 
up every statement that was made in four forums.  The 
first was the first Stenberg case.  Second was Congress. 
Third is this, one of the cases here; and the fourth is 
the other case here.  Now, my own impression of that is 
if you're talking about the medical need for such a 
case, that is for intact D&E, that there is a risk 
attached if you don't use it in some instances.  The 
fewest number of statements for that proposition was in 
the first Stenberg.

 MS. SMITH:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  More statements in 

Congress, more statements that you -- doctors who say, I 
need this procedure for safety.

 MS. SMITH:  There are many more in this --
JUSTICE BREYER:  There are many more in this 

case than there were -- in these two cases there are 
many more than there were in Congress and in Congress 
there are many more than they were in first Stenberg.

other side of the coin, the doctors who say, no, it 
isn't safe, there I'd have to say there are probably 
many more in Congress than there are -- who say it isn't 
safe, there are probably many more in Congress; and then 
there are some in these cases, too; and there are hardly 
any in Stenberg, not too many.

 MS. SMITH:  Well, there is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It was against you, in 

other words.

 MS. SMITH:  There are many letters written 
to Congress that are in the record.  In terms of live 
witnesses, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
 MS. SMITH:  -- there were in Congress eight 

live witnesses that testified.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right, so I'm left with 

a record where I guess you have a subjective 
characterization that there is at least as much evidence 
in these cases supporting you and as much in Congress 
supporting you as there was in the first Stenberg case. 
But Congress made this finding, so what am I to do with 
the finding?

 MS. SMITH:  Right.  Well, the important 

point, Your Honor, is that even if the Court applied the 
highest level of deference under Turner, the findings

would be rejected and must be rejected, as all three 
district courts held, because they're simply 
unreasonable even under a Turner standard.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Smith, was the 

statement of the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists before Congress?

 MS. SMITH:  Yes, Your Honor, it was, as was 

the brief that was filed, the amicus brief that was 
filed in this case in Stenberg was before Congress, and 
also testimony from numerous physicians in the form of 
letter.  In terms of live witnesses, there were simply 
not that many.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll give you an 

extra 30 seconds.  Proceed.

 MS. SMITH:  That's fine, Your Honor.  I've 

lost track of my train of thought, though, I think.

eight witnesses who testified live.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  My question basically I 

think you might have been going after is, I was saying

finding in Congress and there wasn't a finding in the 
Nebraska legislature, and so does that fact of the 
finding being in Congress and not in the Nebraska 
legislature -- what kind of legal difference does that 
make?

 MS. SMITH:  And Your Honor, what I would say 

in this case, it makes none.  While it's an extremely 
interesting academic question about the level of 
deference that should be applied in this kind of 
circumstance, here it really is academic because under, 
even under the Turner standard, if applied in a way that 
Turner actually applied deference, to carefully review 
the findings in light of the evidence in Congress and 
again in light of the evidence in the district court --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you this 
question about what you think we should do.  If I 
thought the evidence did support the conclusion that 
it's never medically necessary, it merely -- the 
evidence merely supports the proposition that a doctor 
has to be a lot more careful if he goes one way rather 
than the other because there are more risks involved in 
one procedure rather than the other, would that be 
sufficient to support the -- I can see the argument that 
the intact delivery may have less risk of complications 
and so forth without it not necessarily being absolutely

 MS. SMITH:  Well, I think there is, there's 
been some confusion about the word "necessary" and it's 
been used sometimes to talk about whether there are 
other procedures that could be used, as opposed to the 
determination that it is the safest procedure that 
reduces significantly the risk of very serious 
complications, not the risks of minor complications.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess that gets 
back to the point earlier.  I mean, do you agree with 
the discussion earlier that this act is not going to 
prevent abortions?

 MS. SMITH:  No, not at all, Your Honor.  I 

-- the issue of the scope and breadth of the law is -- I 
think the evidence clearly shows that this is a very 
broad law that applies to D&E abortions and, contrary to 
what the Solicitor General said about the intent of 
abortions, abortion providers like Dr. Vibhakar and 
others, they actually, their intent is always to remove 
the fetus as intact as possible, and the district courts 
have recognized that as an intent that's covered under 
the terms of the act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What degree of 

marginal impact on safety do you think is necessary to 
override the State's interest?  I mean, if you have

complications under the D&E procedure in say 10 percent 
of the cases, complications under D&X in 9.99 percent of 
the cases, is that marginal benefit in safety enough to 
override the State's articulated interest?

 MS. SMITH:  I don't believe a marginal 

benefit in safety is enough and I don't believe that's 
what we have here.  The testimony from over, from at 
least 11 board-certified OBGYNs, from the American 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, is that the 
reduction in risk is significant and that it reduces the 
risk of serious complications, such as uterine 
perforation, which can lead to hysterectomy and 
infertility.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I thought your 

submission earlier was that we don't have any record 
evidence about how often the complications arise, so 
it's hard to get a handle on exactly what the difference 
is in terms of safety under your submission.

 MS. SMITH:  We don't have a quantification 

of the safety.  What we what we have is the clinical 
experience of major leading physicians in the field, 
who've testified that they've used both procedures.  In 
fact, many of them have testified that they perforated 
uteruses in non-intact D&Es and they've never perforated 
a uterus in an intact D&E.  And that in fact is borne

out by the Chasen study, a very small study with very 
small numbers, but it shows all the serious 
complications are in the non-intact group.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If we could go back to 
the first question that the Chief asked you, you said 
yes, it will prevent abortions because of this uncertain 
line between the D&X and the D&E.  Is there a way that 
Congress could have written the statute that would have 
insulated the physician who's performing a D&E?

 MS. SMITH:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  I think 

that the blueprint that this Court laid out, that 
certainly is suggested in Justice O'Connor's concurrence 
in Stenberg, was rejected by Congress.  She references 
three statutes, that if they had included a health 
exception, she thinks would have been constitutional. 
They all include the word intact.

 I think there's another narrower 

construction of the act too that is possible.  Adding in 
the word intact, reading in the word intact, it seems to 
me, is not a reasonable interpretation of the statute as 
it is, but certainly Congress could have done that and 
other States have done it, but Congress set out not to 
do that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  May I ask you to focus on 

one particular problem that I think is implicated by

Justice Ginsburg's question.  If I understood you 
correctly a moment ago, and I think this is in your 
briefs too, you said that the definitional problem is 
that doctors always set out to do an intact procedure if 
they can, because it involves less risk to the mother 
from, from acts performed inside.  And if that's the 
case, then it would be, I guess in the real world, very 
difficult for Congress to define a difference between 
D&E and D&X, because the intention is always, as you 
understand it, to have an intact result.

 Your brother on the other side, the 

Solicitor General says there certainly is testimony to 
the effect that that is not so.  That doctors who intend 
to perform a D&E simply intend at the beginning to have 
a lesser degree of dilation which will force them to do 
the D&E and not have a totally intact procedure.

 Would you comment on what I think is the 

factual difference between you and the Solicitor General 
there?

 MS. SMITH:  Yes, Your Honor.  The -- the 

problem with the law is that because it's not limited to 
intact, it would in fact cover the procedures that are 
performed by physicians who intend to perform a 
procedure as intact as possible but simply don't expect 
that.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I understand that.
 MS. SMITH:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But could you start simply 

with the factual predicate for your argument and his 
argument.  You seem to be starting from, if I understand 
the two of you correctly, you seem to be starting from 
basically different factual assumptions.  Could you, 
could you start by commenting on that?

 MS. SMITH:  Yes.  The doctors perform the 

same dilation protocols whether they are going to 
perform a D&E or an intact D&E, and that's true for 
Dr. Chasen and Dr. Westhoff, who performed both intact 
and non-intact procedures.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought the 

evidence was that you're looking for a different degree 
of dilation if you're intending to perform D&E than if 
-- and you're looking for a greater degree if you're 
intending to perform a D&X.

 MS. SMITH:  It doesn't play out that way. 
Doctors do have different dilation protocols, but they 
are often looking for as much dilation as they can get. 
On the other hand --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is your submission 

that there aren't different dilation protocols if you're 
intending a D&E and if you're intending a D&X, they're

Official 

 MS. SMITH:  It varies by doctor.  For 

example, Dr. Carhart uses the same dilation protocol 
whether he's going to do an intact or a non-intact. 
Other doctors might try to do more dilation.  And the 
doctors, importantly, can't control the amount of 
dilation they get, so a decision happens.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, they may not be able 

to control it in an absolute sense, but can't they go 
about it in a way that would tend to produce less rather 
than more dilation?

 MS. SMITH:  Not --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  It can't guarantee results, 

but couldn't they at least start with a, I don't know 
how you put it, a procedure that would be likely to 
produce less rather than more, and hence come within the 
safe harbor, if you will, of the statute?

 MS. SMITH:  Well, they are always looking 

for a minimal amount of dilation.  Then people who chose 
to do another day of dilation, for example, that could 
add additional dilation.  But for the first day of 
dilation, no, Your Honor.  They don't seek more or less 
over one day.  They might do a second day or --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, you say they don't, 
but my question is, can they?  And the record may not

show this.  I'm not asking you to answer the impossible, 
but do we have evidence that would indicate that they 
can or that they can't?

 MS. SMITH:  Not in the first day of 

dilation, no.  They can't control how much dilation is 
going to occur.  They need a minimal amount and they are 
not going to shoot for less than that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Can you tell us where to 

look in the record for the evidence on that?

 MS. SMITH:  Each doctor testifies about 

their own dilation protocols, Your Honor, and I believe 
that's in the Eighth Circuit appendix.  Those -- those 
-- portions of that testimony, and are cited more 
specifically in the Eighth Circuit briefs, which goes 
more into the factual detail, Your Honor, but I don't 
have the cites right now.  I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If there were a health 

exception --

MS. SMITH:  Yes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The health of the woman, 

would that obviate the vagueness and overbreadth 
problems that you bring up?  Because then after we say 
to the doctor, you put the health of your patients first 
and if you think that it's riskier for her health to do 
it one way than another way, then you pick the safer way.

If you had that, then wouldn't the concerns about 
overbreadth fade?

 MS. SMITH:  Not if this is not limited to 
intact, Your Honor, because then you would be limiting 
D&E abortions, which is 95 percent of all abortions, to 
circumstances where the doctor could prove that it was 
in fact the safest procedure.  And we've had doctors 
testify in trial, for example, that they refused to 
describe even intact -- regular D&Es to their patients 
because they believe induction is always safer.  So 
those doctors, I think would still be at risk, and it 
would put 95 percent of second trimester abortions at 
risk in that case, to prosecution for performing a D&E 
when you should have been performing an induction 
procedure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you think the, on 

the same issue I think, that the addition of the 
deliberately and intentionally language in the 
congressional act addresses that concern?

 MS. SMITH:  No, Your Honor, because actually 

that same language is in the Stenberg, the Nebraska 
statute.  It also was targeted at deliberately 
intentionally.  I do think that if there is a 
construction that would narrow the law to a limited 
amount of intact D&Es, if you read the "for the purpose

of" language in the statute, to be performing an overt 
act for the sole purpose of completing delivery, then --
or rather -- I'm sorry.  For the purpose of performing 
an overt act that causes fetal demise, that does not 
facilitate delivery of the statute -- of the fetus.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's what I was 

wondering, because --

MS. SMITH:  I'm sorry.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose, this might help, 

suppose the physician testifies that I wanted to do a 
non-intact, an in utero D&E, that that's, that was my 
intent, that's what I wanted to do, that's what I always 
want to do.  In this case I had an intact delivery and 
had no other choice.  Are you saying that we could 
interpret the statute to say that that is not the 
prohibited criminal intent, he is immune from 
prosecution in that case?

 MS. SMITH:  No.  I don't believe that's the 
line that could be drawn, Your Honor, because anyone who 
does a D&E is intending to remove the fetus as intact as 
possible, and always can have the intent to go to the 
anatomical landmark that's here.  I'm suggesting a 
different interpretation that uses the "for the purpose 
of" language where it says for the purpose of performing 
an overt act that the person knows will kill the

partially delivered living fetus.  If that language was 
interpreted to be for the sole purpose of performing 
fetal demise at that point, rather than what the doctors 
do, which is perform the action that causes fetal demise 
in order to facilitate delivery of the fetus.  So if 
it's not to facilitate delivery of the fetus --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, give me one instance 
in which your proposed interpretation would work in the 
real world.

 MS. SMITH:  Well, there are allegations in 
the Congressional Record, for example, in reference --
in Justice Thomas' dissent by Nurse Schaffer, Dr. Pamela 
Smith, about circumstances where the physician actually 
holds the fetus in the woman's body in order to cause 
fetal demise, rather than causing fetal demise because 
it's an integral part of removal of the fetus from the 
woman's uterus.  And those circumstances would be banned 
under that interpretation.

 But I want to get back to the Turner point, 

if I may for a minute, the issue of deference to 
congressional finding.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, just on that last 

point, I mean, we are interested of course in different 
interpretations, but it just seems to me that your 
interpretation would have very little practical effect.

MS. SMITH:  Well, it would -- it would ban 
certainly a certain type of intact procedure that was 
discussed, and I think is the image many people have of 
"partial-birth abortion" frankly, that this is something 
that's done gratuitously, not as an integral part of 
making this procedure the safest for the woman, and 
avoiding instrumentation and avoiding perforation and 
hysterectomies, which are serious complications that 
though rare, when they occur, they are catastrophic and 
life changing and disastrous.  So the numbers are not 
high of any complications, but the complications when 
they occur are, are devastating.  And this is what the 
doctors are experiencing when they perform intact D&Es, 
that they are not having these types of complications.

 So -- if I can move to the deference point, 

I would like to talk a little bit about deference to 
congressional findings because there is significant 
authority from this Court of course, saying that where 
there are danger signs of constitutional risks, as the 
Court recently said in Randall versus Sorrell, that the 
Court must independently and carefully review 
congressional findings.  And the Court has rejected 
findings that attempted to change either by findings of 
fact or legal findings, that attempted to change a 
constitutional standard.

But in any case, the findings in this case 

are simply unreasonable and not supported by the 
evidence.  If you go to the findings themselves, the 
ultimate finding in 14o, which claims that it is 
actually relying on the preceding findings, it says, 
"for these reasons, Congress finds that partial birth 
abortion is never medically indicated," and then you go 
backwards and look at the reasons.  The reasons are the 
findings that are not defended by the Government, that 
were not defended by the Government witnesses and that 
are blatantly false, except for perhaps one of them.

 There are findings of, that partial-birth 

abortion poses serious risks.  The Government witnesses 
agreed that this was not true.

 Their findings that partial-birth abortion 
is not taught in medical schools.  Of course, we know 
that is simply not true, it's an integral part of 
abortion training at major medical institutions like 
Cornell, Columbia, Yale, NYU, Northwestern, etc.
 It says that abortion, partial-birth 
abortion is a disfavored practice among abortion 
providers.  That is absolutely not true.

 And it says that there are no comparative 

studies.  We know now that is not true because the 
Chasen study has come out, and is the first study of its

kind to try to evaluate the differences between intact 
and non-intact.  It is still true that there are no 
controlled studies, there is no randomized clinical 
trial, but if that were the standard, no new and safer 
abortion procedures could ever be developed.

 Turning back, Your Honors, to the health issue.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could I ask you just 

one thing?

 MS. SMITH:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The statute, of 

course, refers to both feet first and vertex deliveries. 
How common is the vertex delivery in the D&X?

 MS. SMITH:  Not very common.  Not very 

common, Your Honor.  It would occur in circumstances 
where there is a significant fetal anomaly and some kind 
of a, something called a sides, or another type of fetal 
anomaly where there is a distension of the abdomen, but 
it's very rare.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And in giving your 

arguments toward the safety benefits of the D&X, I 
couldn't understand why they wouldn't also apply to the 
total delivery of the fetus in a vertex delivery 
situation.

 MS. SMITH:  I'm sorry.  I don't know if I 

understand.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, my 

understanding is that the vertex, the skull and head are 
already outside the mother.
 MS. SMITH:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And the objection in 

the feet first is that you want fewer instrument 
passes and so on.

 MS. SMITH:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But in that case, 

it's not the skull itself that is preventing the 
delivery of the fetus.

 MS. SMITH:  Right.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So your arguments 
about why the D&X is safer than feet first, wouldn't 
that apply in the case of total delivery of the fetus as 
well?  In other words, if you want as much of the fetus 
intact and out as possible, why wait, stop it halfway? 
Wouldn't the safety argument suggest delivery of the 
fetus?

 MS. SMITH:  Yes, but these are circumstances 

where the fetus can't be delivered.  That's the point, 
Your Honor, is that the fetus is obstructed and so the 
overt act that takes place is --

vertex delivery, where is the obstruction?

MS. SMITH:  The obstruction would come from 
a distension of the abdomen, usually from a significant 
fetal anomaly like a sides, which is, this is a serious 
anomaly.  It's lethal anomalies that I was talking 
about.  And in those circumstances, an overt act would 
need to be performed that would in fact cause fetal 
demise before the fetus could be, the delivery could be 
continued.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me that your 
argument is that there is always a constitutional right 
to use what the physician thinks is the safest 
procedure.

 MS. SMITH:  No, Your Honor.  I think the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I inferred that from your 

comments.

 MS. SMITH:  I don't think so, Your Honor. 
What, what the Court held in Stenberg in applying the 
appropriate medical judgment standard of Casey, was that 
there had to be a substantial body of medical opinion, 
an objective standard that in fact supports the use of 
that procedure.  And that both, that balances concerns 
against protecting a woman's health with a concern of 
unfettered discretion, which the Court has rejected.

procedure?

 MS. SMITH:  I'm sorry.  I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So then, the --
MS. SMITH:  Yeah.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The obverse of the 

proposition I put at first, it must be true that there 
are some instances in which the State can prohibit a 
procedure even if it is the safest procedure.

 MS. SMITH:  That's true, Your Honor, as long 

as it doesn't pose an undue burden on the woman, which 
as you know, certainly the circumstance with the D&E, 
which is 95 percent of abortions, under the Stenberg 
ruling.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can I just follow up 

on that?

MS. SMITH:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't understand 

that.  In other words, the fact that it's not the safest 
procedure does not itself constitute an undue burden? 
In other words, under Justice Kennedy's hypothetical --

procedure, and your answer was so long as it doesn't --

MS. SMITH:  No.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- pose an undue 

burden.  And I was just following up to say that so, in 
some circumstances, prohibiting what you regard is the 
safest procedure does not itself constitute an undue 
burden.

 MS. SMITH:  No.  I understood Justice 

Kennedy's question to be, could the State prohibit what 
it thinks is not the safest.  And under the Stenberg 
ruling, although the Court hasn't addressed that 
question directly, under Stenberg what the Court has 
said is, the Court can ban procedures only where there 
is not significant medical authority supporting their 
use as the safest procedure in some circumstances.  So 
perhaps I misunderstood your question.

 But the Court has not ever addressed the 

question, can we ban a procedure that's not the safest. 
I think the ruling in Stenberg would say well, there has 
to be significant medical authority that in some 
circumstances it is the safest.  The alternative 
argument would be, but, if it is the procedure that's 
used in 95 percent of the cases, or a vast majority of 
the cases, and banning it would thereby deny women the 
right to get an abortion and be a substantial obstacle

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 GENERAL CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Let me make just a couple of points in rebuttal.

 I'd like to start with Justice Kennedy's 
question, about whether or not there are going to be 
alternative methods available to end the pregnancy as a 
practical matter.  And the answer to that is there will 
always be an alternative available as a practical matter. 
The alternative will always be the D&E procedure, which 
the district court in this case called the gold standard. 
And the best evidence of that, Justice Kennedy, is that 
their own witnesses like Dr. Chasen, for example, when 
they set out to perform the D&X procedure, they are only 
successful about 33 percent of the time.  What happens 
in the other 67 percent of the cases is they actually, 
even though they tried to perform a D&X, will perform a 
D&E. And so all of the clinics that provide D&X also

necessarily provide D&E, because the D&E is what they 
end up with if they are not able to remove the fetus 
intact.  So in every single case, there are some, you 
know, the induction procedure has to be done in a 
hospital, but the D&X and D&E procedures are both 
equally available in clinics, so no woman as either a 
theoretical matter or a practical matter, is going to be 
denied a safe alternative to end her pregnancy.

 I wanted to pick up on Justice Souter's 

question as well.  You asked for factual citations in 
the record on this dispute between us.  I think the 
record is really overwhelmingly in our favor.  I point 
you to Dr. Fitzhugh, who's one of the plaintiffs on this 
side, 135a.  He says he doesn't try for intact delivery 
in every case because it would necessitate a second 
round of dilation, a second round of laminarias, so he 
doesn't do the second round, he gets dismemberment. 
Dr. Knorr, another one of the plaintiffs, at page 142a, 
he says the procedure would require greater dilation.

 And if I could just finish on the citations, 
Dr. Vibhakar, who does dismemberment 100 percent of the 
time, 148a -- all of these are in the petition appendix 
of the district court opinion -- Dr. Cranen explains his 
procedure at 174a to 177a. Thank you

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, General.
