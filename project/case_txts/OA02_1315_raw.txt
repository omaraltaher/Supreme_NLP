CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear 


argument now in No. 02-1315, Gary Locke v. Joshua 


Davey.


Ms. Pierce.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF NARDA PIERCE


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MS. PIERCE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 


please the Court:


To preserve freedom of conscience for all 


its citizens in matters of religious faith and 


belief, Washington's constitution limits the 


involvement of government.  It limits both the 


ability to regulate religious activities and to fund 


religious activities.


QUESTION:  Do you think the fact that that 


provision is in Washington's constitution makes it 


different than, say, if it were in a -- simply in a 


statute?


MS. PIERCE:  Mr. Chief Justice, the 


recognition that this Court has given to a state 


constitution, as opposed to a statute, is that it is 


adopted by all of the voters of the state.  However, 


both the constitution and the state laws are subject

to Federal constitutional provisions.  At issue today 


is our --


QUESTION:  Is -- is it a program at issue 


here that provides basically money to the student to 


be spent as the student wishes?  Is it like a voucher 


program in that sense?


MS. PIERCE:  Justice O'Connor, the Promise 


Scholarship is to be provided to the student for 


purposes of educational expenses and they're required 


to use it for certain educational expenses.  The 


purpose of the Promise Scholarship established by the 


legislature is to strengthen the length between --


the link between K-12 education and higher education, 


and in a recognition --


QUESTION:  Well, I'm just trying to find 


out how it works, whether it's like a voucher 


program, you give the money to the student and the 


student decides how to use it.


MS. PIERCE:  It -- it works like a voucher 


program to the extent that it's for educational 


expenses.  I'm not familiar with the specifics of 


voucher programs, but the student is required to use 


it for those educational expenses. 


It is not, for example, like a paycheck, 


where a person has those funds as their private funds

and can dedicate those to any uses that they choose. 


And that's a key point under the Washington 


constitution, because article I, section 11 says that 


public funds shall not be applied to religious 


worship, exercise, or instruction --


QUESTION:  How -- how many states have 


similar provisions in their constitutions or laws?


MS. PIERCE:  It varies, Justice O'Connor, 


according to the particular provisions.  This 


provision refers to not using public funds for 


religious instruction.  We also have a provision that 


no public funds shall be spent at schools under 


sectarian influence.  I - I believe it's something in 


the neighborhood of 36 states who have some 


provisions relating to use of public funds for 


religious instruction, but those vary.


QUESTION:  They were all adopted at about 


the same time, weren't these so-called Blaine 


Amendments?


MS. PIERCE:  Your Honor, this is not the 


Blaine Amendment.  The so-called Blaine Amendment are 


those that refer to use of public funds in schools 


under sectarian control.  That's a different 


provision of the Washington constitution.  That's 


article IX, section 4, and that was required by the

enabling act that provided for our statehood, but 


this is a different provision.  It's a provision that 


was separate and apart, that was debated, that was 


added to Washington's constitution as a separate 


provision.


QUESTION:  And was that --


QUESTION:  So this was add -- this was 


added after Washington was admitted in 1889?


MS. PIERCE:  No, Your -- Mr. Chief 


Justice, I'm sorry -- it was at the same time of 


adoption, but it was not the provision that was 


required by the --


QUESTION:  The enabling.


MS. PIERCE:  -- enabling act.  It was not 


in the original proposed constitution set before the 


framers.  And during the course of that 


constitutional convention, that's where this language 


was added. 


And I know, referring to the Blaine 


Amendments, there's been much made in the briefs of 


whether or not those amendments stemmed from 


anti-Catholic motivation.  There's certainly no 


evidence in Washington that there was any discussion, 


any evidence of anti-Catholic motive. 


In Washington, both article I, section 11

and article IX, section 4, which is -- more directly 


stems from the Blaine Amendment, Federal level, 


they've always been implemented in a 


non-discriminatory manner, prohibiting both the 


practice of any religion of any sort in our public 


schools, as well as any funding for private sectarian 


schools.


QUESTION:  But what if -- what if a state 


prohibited only the study of theology from a Catholic 


perspective?  Would that survive?


MS. PIERCE:  No, Your Honor, we don't 


believe it would.  But what the state has done here 


is prohibited public funds for religious instruction 


wherever it occurs, including in a college --

QUESTION:  Wait.  How -- how do you 


reconcile that?  That's what I don't understand.  It 


seems to me that if you say it does not violate the 


religion clauses to prohibit the use for any 


religious instruction whatever, you would also have 


to say that it does not violate the religion clauses 


to say no public funds shall be spent for Jewish 


theology studies. 


Why -- why -- I mean, the state is not 


permitted to discriminate between religious sects, 


but it's just as much not permitted to discriminate

between religion in general and non-religion.  So how 


can you possibly -- I mean, if we say that -- that 


you can do this, it seems to me, we have to say you 


-- you can also prohibit Jewish studies.


MS. PIERCE:  No, Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  Why not?


MS. PIERCE: -- I don't believe that 


follows.  The line between funds for secular purposes 


and for religious purposes is a line that's been 


recognized by this Court in various funding cases and 


in reviewing government activities.  It's a line that 


recognizes both the values of the Establishment 


Clause and the values of the Free Exercise Clause. 


Here, simply because the State of 

Washington is extending those values of the 


Establishment Clause beyond direct funding into 


indirect funding does not convert those values into 


hostility.  There's still the values --


QUESTION:  It's -- it's treating --


MS. PIERCE:  -- of protecting religious 


freedom.


QUESTION:  -- it's treating religion 


differently from non-religion.  You can study 


anything you like and get it subsidized except 


religion.  Why is that not violating the principle of

neutrality?


MS. PIERCE:  It is treating religion 


different from a realm in which religion -- religious 


belief or non-belief does not enter what we refer to 


as secular studies.  It's --


QUESTION:  You're making the -- are you --


are you making the -- or is Washington making the 


distinction between training in how to be religious, 


training as it were in the practice of some -- of a 


religion that leads to the truth, on the one hand, 


and study about what people believe on the other 


hand.  I thought that was the distinction, how to be 


religious versus what religions believe.  Is that the 


distinction?


MS. PIERCE:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MS. PIERCE:  And that was the distinction 


I meant to articulate.


QUESTION:  So, I take it, then, if it 


that's the distinction, you would -- you would agree 


that if Washington funded a school of atheism, but 


wouldn't fund a school like this one, that there 


would be a violation of one or both of the clauses?


MS. PIERCE:  Yes, Justice Souter, because 


whenever you enter into the realm of faith or belief,

whenever you try to affect someone's belief in that 


realm, that has been a particularly protected realm 


of individual conscience, that becomes religious, 


whether it's non-belief or belief.  It's when you --


QUESTION:  But it's the difference between 


being religious and studying religion.  That's your 


line, isn't it?


MS. PIERCE:  Yes, Your Honor, and I 


believe that's the Court's line.  It's the line 


that's been drawn in many of the direct funding cases 


of this Court, to teach about religion --


QUESTION:  Can -- can you not study 


atheism under this statute?  Suppose there is a 


course debunking, debunking all religious belief. 

Would that be prohibited?  Would that be funded under 


this statute?  I don't see any -- any prohibition of 


the funding of that?


MS. PIERCE:  Justice Scalia, I think when 


the statute is read in conjunction with Washington 


case law, and particularly the Calvary Bible 


Presbyterian Church case, that the definition --


QUESTION:  What does the statute say?  I 


don't see how it can possibly apply to that.  What 


does it say?


MS. PIERCE:  Well, the statute says that

no aid shall be awarded to any student pursuing a

QUESTION:  In theology.


MS. PIERCE:  But --


QUESTION:  Now, is -- is a degree in 


atheism a degree in theology?


MS. PIERCE:  I believe it would be under 


the interpretation --


QUESTION:  That would be a question, would 


it not, for the state supreme court to decide?  It 


may decide it needs to carry that limitation in order 


to be compatible with the Free Exercise Clause.


MS. PIERCE:  I --


QUESTION: 


And I think that certainly the 

Free Exercise Clause answers the question, can you 


give it to the Catholics but not to the Jews.  So 


that's -- that's not an issue.


MS. PIERCE:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and I 


think that the Washington Supreme Court would 


interpret it that way, not only to be consistent with 


the Free Exercise Clause, but to be consistent with 


its own state constitutional provision and its 


purposes, which is to not use public funds for 


instruction in the realm of faith and belief and --


QUESTION:  What cases do you cite for the

proposition that you're asserting that the -- that 


the Free Exercise Clause or the Establishment Clause 


applies differently to discrimination between 


different religions than it does to discrimination 


between religion in general and non-religion?  What 


-- what cases do you cite for that distinction?


MS. PIERCE:  What we cite, Your Honor, is 


that line between the secular and the religious 


activity.  I believe it's the line that was drawn in 


the Schempp case, referring to the study about 


religion versus the study of religion, which is not, 


in our view, discrimination in the classic sense of 


that word.


QUESTION: 


No, but that doesn't -- that --

the issue there was whether you were discriminating 


against religion or not.  And since you are not 


prohibiting study about religion, that isn't the 


question here. 


The question is, assuming you are 


discriminating between religion and non-religion, you 


can't study theology but you can study anything else, 


what is there in our cases that says that is okay, 


although it would not be okay to distinguish between 


Jewish studies or Catholic studies or Protestant 


studies and other studies?

 I don't know a single case that says the 


principle of neutrality somehow applies differently 


so long as you're discriminating against all religion 


than it does when you're just discriminating against 


one denomination.  Did you have a case?


MS. PIERCE:  Well, Your Honor, in the 


context of this Court's aid to education under the 


Establishment Clause, and Mitchell v. Helms is a 


classic example, there's a distinction between 


providing materials, educational materials that are 


to be used in secular education, as opposed to those 


materials that might be diverted to religious, 


ideological education and --


QUESTION:  But that's -- that's the 


Establishment Clause, isn't it, in Mitchell against 


Helms?


MS. PIERCE:  Yes, it is, Your Honor, and 


-- and we believe the same -- many of the same values 


underlie the Washington constitution.  And we don't 


believe that the distinction is made invalid because 


it is extended to indirect funding and doesn't apply 


only to direct funding.


QUESTION:  Well, I wanted to ask you about 


these values.  As I understand, this student could 


have done exactly what he in fact did if only he did

not declare a double major.  He could have taken all 


of these religious perspective courses, if only he'd 


called his major business administration, which in 


fact it was because he had the credits for that, too. 


That would have been permissible.  Is that correct, 


or am I incorrect?


MS. PIERCE:  Well, the statute focuses on 


whether a student is pursuing a degree in theology 


and -- and --


QUESTION:  If -- suppose that he pursued a 


degree in business administration and yet, ancillary 


to that or as options, took all of these other 


courses.  Could he have had the aid that he seeks?


MS. PIERCE: 


Yes, Your Honor, we think 

that could have happened, but it's an unlikely --


QUESTION:  All right.  What is the state's 


interest in denying him aid simply because he 


declares a double major?


MS. PIERCE:  I believe the reason the 


legislature has focused on the nature of the degree 


program is because it's an inherently religious 


program, and if they were to --


QUESTION:  What is the state's interest in 


denying him funds simply because of the way he labels 


the major he chooses, if all the other instructions,

all the other elements of the case are the same?  He 


takes all the same courses, he has all the same 


commitment as a Christian, and yet he's denied the 


relief in one case and given it -- the subsidy in one 


case, and given it in the other.  What is the state's 


interest in doing that?


MS. PIERCE:  Justice Kennedy, I think the 


state's interest is not in that particular student, 


but in how you administer it overall.  And the way 


the state administers it overall, in order to avoid a 


class-by-class, student-by-student determination, is 


to look at the degree programs that are inherently 


religious that have, or ask the universities actually 


to do that --


QUESTION:  Ms. Pierce, I thought that the 


--

QUESTION:  Well, what is the state's 


interest in -- in denying aid for programs that are 


inherently religious?  What is that interest?  Is it 


a compelling interest?


MS. PIERCE:  Yes, Your Honor, we believe 


it is.  The interest is --


QUESTION:  May I ask you just to clarify 


what I thought was the purpose of this, was that the 


state has decided it does not want to fund the

training of clergymen, and it cites a long history of 


that.  And it's tried to be as accommodating as it 


can with that limitation. 


I mean, certainly if what you're doing is 


vulnerable, it would be no less vulnerable if the 


state said, well, we won't fund that school at all 


because it's an evangelical school.


MS. PIERCE:  Justice Ginsburg -- excuse me 


-- the focus is on the religious nature of the 


instruction.  If someone had a career goal to enter 


the clergy and yet took a secular course of 


education, they would not be denied funding. 


Certainly one of the underlying values of 


our Freedom of Religion Clauses at the Federal and 

state level is not to require people to support the 


promotion of a doctrine or religious belief with 


which they may not agree, and that, returning to 


Justice Kennedy's question, is -- is the interest.


The way it's implemented by Washington, 


and it has been by Congress and by other states in 


other contexts, is to look at that core course of 


study because --


QUESTION:  But we've decided in Witters 


that it's unnecessary to do that to conform to the 


Establishment Clause.

QUESTION:  So, after -- after that, then 


what is the state's interest at this point?


MS. PIERCE:  Well, the state's --


QUESTION:  Is the state's interest in 


redefining the Establishment Clause?


MS. PIERCE:  No, Your Honor, but the state 


has a different, although somewhat concurrent, scheme 


for religious freedom, and that involves not just 


avoiding a government endorsement of religion, which 


is what the Establishment Clause primarily turns and 


focuses on --


QUESTION:  But Witters said there is no 


endorsement.


MS. PIERCE:  And -- and --


QUESTION:  So you can't use that.


MS. PIERCE:  No, and I'm not trying to.


QUESTION:  I still don't see what your 


interest is, and once you do define it, I want you to 


tell me if it's compelling, rational basis.


MS. PIERCE:  Okay.  Washington's interest 


expressed in 1889 was to protect the freedom of 


conscience of all its citizens, and that included not 


compelling its citizens to provide enforced public 


funds to support the promotion of religious beliefs

MS. PIERCE:  No, Your Honor, and that 


distinction has been made.


QUESTION:  And Washington doesn't do that, 


does it?


there's --


MS. PIERCE:  It does not decline that, and 


QUESTION:  So that -- that general public 


benefit is extended to both religious and 


non-religious institutions equivalently, and people 


don't get upset about that, do they?


MS. PIERCE:  No, Your Honor.  I think 


providing the essential services that include people 


as part of our civilized community has been 


distinguished from other kind of funding when these 


questions are asked.


QUESTION:  Well, Washington's position, I 


take it, is that, although it -- it will certainly 


put out the fire in the church, it won't spend money 


for the purpose of persuading people that they ought 


to be inside the church.  Is that the -- the point 


you're making?

 MS. PIERCE:  Yes, Justice Souter.  There 


is a distinction there and it's a distinction that's 


been made in a variety of contexts, but --


QUESTION:  And you're saying that even 


though it would not offend the Establishment Clause 


if the state did provide this sort of funding, there 


is still, I think your point is, there is still an 


area within which it has a choice, even though that 


choice may not be determined by the Establishment 


Clause?


MS. PIERCE:  Yes, Your Honor, because the 


purpose of the state constitution, which of course, 


when it was adopted in 1889, was not viewed as 


greater than the Establishment Clause, it was viewed 

as the only protection for religious freedom at the 


state level, since it wasn't until 1947 that the 


Establishment Clause was held to apply to the states. 


And to return to your question, Justice 


Souter, the distinction between providing police and 


fire services to an organization and providing 


funding to assist in the educational purpose of that 


organization was made in Norwood v. Harrison in this 


Court.  In the very different circumstance, but for 


-- for similar reasons, this Court held that 


textbooks could not be provided to segregated schools

because that would aid the discrimination of those 


schools in violation of --


QUESTION:  Well, isn't that an 


Establishment Clause issue?


MS. PIERCE:  In that particular --


QUESTION:  It's been litigated under the 


Establishment Clause, right?


MS. PIERCE:  The provision of the -- the 


aid --


QUESTION:  Providing textbooks or other 


aid to religious schools.  Those have been 


Establishment Clause challenges, and we had a -- the 


Witters case from your state, and determined that the 


Establishment Clause is not violated by giving aid to 

the blind, which is used then to study for the 


ministry, right?


MS. PIERCE: Yes, Justice O'Connor, and 


that's because under the Establishment Clause, the 


question is, is the government endorsing religion? 


Under Washington's article I, section 11, the 


question is, is -- are public funds being used for 


the promotion or -- of religious belief or disbelief 


and --


--

QUESTION:  But do you -- do you think that

 QUESTION:  Ms. Pierce, may I ask you a 


question there on how you draw the line?  Because I 


want to get clear on one thing, and it was raised in 


effect by the questions earlier about the Blaine 


Amendment, I guess, but is my understanding correct 


that the State of -- that this clause that we are 


dealing with here, and nothing else for that matter 


in the Washington law, forbids the state from paying 


-- we'll call it a tuition voucher here -- that is 


going to a sectarian school like this one, so long as 


it's not being used for theological education?


MS. PIERCE:  Justice Souter, there's a 


distinction in our state constitution --


QUESTION: 


No, but isn't the answer, there 

is nothing that forbids that?  In other words, going 


back to Justice Kennedy's question, if this same 


student said, I want to study business and I want to 


study it at this sectarian school, there would be no 


impediment in Washington law to paying him the -- or 


giving him the voucher or whatever you call it and 


letting him spend it at this sectarian school?  Is 


that correct?


MS. PIERCE:  That's true at the higher 


education level.


QUESTION:  Okay.

 QUESTION:  But isn't it also true he could 


even take the same courses and get it as long as he 


didn't declare his major until he was a junior?


MS. PIERCE:  Your Honor, we -- the statute 


says pursuing a degree in theology, so I think it 


should be properly read and is properly read by 


Northwest College as a student who is, during the 


academic terms that are funded, working toward that 


degree in theology.


QUESTION:  But I -- I just want to be sure 


I understand how it works in response to Justice 


Kennedy's inquiry.  Is it not true that he could have 


taken all or most of the religious courses he did 


take if he'd only declared a different major or 

postponed the time when he declared his major?


MS. PIERCE:  I believe he --


QUESTION:  Which has a double aspect.  In 


one hand, as Justice Kennedy points out, the state 


interest doesn't seem all that compelling there, but 


on the other hand, the burden on him is also pretty 


slight, because all he had to was take a -- just 


manage his curriculum a little differently.


MS. PIERCE:  Yes, Your Honor.  I --


QUESTION:  And -- and I just want to know, 


am I correct that he could have taken either all or

substantially all of the religion -- religious 


courses and qualified for the scholarship if he just 


declared a different major?


MS. PIERCE:  You're partially correct, 


Justice Stevens.  I think he could have taken some of 


the same religion courses.  I don't think just simply 


declaring your major later is what meets the purpose 


of the statute.  The statute says are you pursuing --


QUESTION:  Wasn't he counseled -- wasn't 


he counseled specifically by the school to be honest?


MS. PIERCE:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.


QUESTION:  And not try to hide what his 


purpose was, which he was perfectly open about?


MS. PIERCE: 


Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 

QUESTION:  And, of course, if -- if you 


take a whole bunch of religious courses, it may be 


they can't be counted for some other major other than 


the -- the theology.


MS. PIERCE:  Well, the theology degree, 


Your Honor, does require, I believe at Northwest, 125 


credits, and 79 of those credits are required to be 


in various Bible and theological courses, so I think 


it is -- it would be possible, but unusual, for 


another student to have those same courses and not 


being pursuing a degree in theology.

 QUESTION:  Could we go back to Justice 


Kennedy's second part of what he was asking, because 


it's bothering me, too.  I think it's absolutely 


well-established, whether there's a case or not, that 


people have thought it's different when what the 


Federal government or state government says is, what 


we have here is a secular program, we're paying for 


secular programs, whether it's schools or social 


services or any one of a million things, or if it 


were to say, well, it's a Baptist program, but not a 


Catholic program.


I think if they said the second, they'd 


have to pass something like strict scrutiny as far as 


their reasons are concerned. 


I think if they said 

the first, so far I don't think they would have to 


pass anything like that kind of test, but that's the 


question. 


And I think that Justice Kennedy was 


saying, very well, what is the test?  What kind of 


scrutiny should you give under the Equal Protection 


Clause, where what the state has done is said we have 


a secular spending program.  Now, leave the atheist, 


because if the atheist is a program which concerns 


principles that in the mind of the atheist are 


similar to those that are religious in the mind of a

religious person, I'm willing to call that a 


religious program.  That's not what I'm talking 


about. 


I'm talking about just a regular secular 


aid program.  What do we judge that distinction on 


the basis of?  What kind of a test?


MS. PIERCE:  Justice Breyer, I believe it 


is a rational basis test, that is, it is a neutral 


line, it's a recognized line between the secular that 


does not involve the realm of belief and faith, and a 


religious that does.


QUESTION:  I didn't think this was an 


Equal Protection Clause case at all.  I thought it 


was -- the challenge was freedom of religion. 

MS. PIERCE:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it 


is, and --


QUESTION:  The Free Exercise Clause of the 


First Amendment?


MS. PIERCE:  That is the question on which 


cert was granted, and --


QUESTION:  Right.


MS. PIERCE: -- because it is a neutral 


line --


QUESTION:  Well, I'm thinking of free 


exercise, but I'm thinking this is a discrimination

case, so maybe it's totally different under free 


exercise, but you see the question.


MS. PIERCE:  Yes, and Justice Breyer --


QUESTION:  And your answer's rational 


basis.


MS. PIERCE:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Rational -- you -- you think 


there's a difference in free exercise if what the 


state says is, we are burdening the free exercise of 


all religions, as opposed to, we are burdening the 


free exercise of one particular religion.  You think 


there's a different -- a different standard?  Again, 


I would ask for the case that -- that suggests that.


MS. PIERCE: 


Justice Scalia, in the first 

instance, this case involves application of public 


funds in a funding program, and we believe that the 


principle that a state's decision not to fund the 


exercise of a fundamental right is not a burden on 


that right, it's not an infringement on that right. 


All that the State of Washington has done here is 


decline to fund theology studies --


QUESTION:  Certainly in our -- in our 


Rosenberger case there was a rational basis for what 


the University of Virginia did, but we held it 


violated the Free Exercise Clause.

 MS. PIERCE:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and 


the purpose of the public forum principles that were 


applied in Rosenberger are to protect the open public 


forum.  There the Court specifically acknowledged 


that that was a forum for the publication, for the 


expression of ideas, and that the expression of those 


ideas in that open public forum would be incomplete 


if certain viewpoints were excluded. 


But certainly the purpose of the Promise 


Scholarship is not to open a public forum.  It's more 


akin to the American Library Association case, where 


Internet access was provided, not to provide a forum 


for the Web publishers, but to promote education and 


learning.


QUESTION:  You think there is a -- a 


rational basis suffices for the state to prohibit 


this student from declaring one of his legitimate 


majors?


MS. PIERCE:  We believe -- yes, Your 


Honor, we believe there is a rational basis to not 


fund religious instruction wherever it occurs, 


including a theology course.


QUESTION:  Is it essentially your position 


that not everything that is compatible with the 


Establishment Clause, not everything that the state

could do under the Establishment Clause, it must do 


under the Free Exercise?  And if that's your 


position, how do you define the space in between 


those two where the state has a choice?


MS. PIERCE:  That is our position.  We 


don't think states should be in constitutional 


pincers where whatever they're allowed to do under 


the Establishment Clause or required to do, 


particularly given the history that states have come 


to their own path to religious freedom. 


And I think applying the various 


principles on when you burden the exercise of 


religious freedom leads you to the latitude in this 


area. 


Here, not providing funding does not infringe 

or burden a fundamental right, and that's all that 


the state has done.  Mr. Chief Justice, I'd --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Pierce.  You're 


reserving your time.


Mr. Sekulow.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY A. SEKULOW


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. SEKULOW:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 


it please the Court:


In the free exercise context, this Court 


has held that the minimum requirement of neutrality

is that a law not discriminate on its face.  That's 


clearly what is taking place here, and I'd like to 


put in context exactly how the implementation of the 


statutory program works.  Washington, when they 


adopted the Promise Scholarship program and how it's 


applied, works this way. 


A student applies for this general grant. 


In this particular case, Josh Davey applied for the 


grant when he was aware of it in the summer, was 


notified by the state that he was qualified and 


accepted in the program in August.  At that point he 


enrolled at Northwest College, which is an accredited 


and eligible institution.  It was not until -- and he 


declared his major, the dual major, at that point in 

business administration and the pastoral ministries 


degree. 


Two months later, it was two months until 


he was notified by the financial aid office through a 


memorandum that the state circulated that after 


reviewing the Promise Scholarship program, the state 


then decided that in fact there would be a 


prohibition put in place on pursuing a degree in 


theology and that state has interpreted that to mean 


pursuing a degree in theology from a religious 


perspective.

 The check, Justice O'Connor, is sent 


directly to the student.  The school is the -- in the 


sense the school gets the check and hands it to the 


student.  It's not written to the school.  The school 


cannot use it for -- to -- a private institution 


cannot use it at all for any expenditure.  They can't 


credit, they can't debit the account.  The school 


merely verifies that the student's enrolled.  The 


check then goes to the student.  It can be used for 


any --


QUESTION:  So it wouldn't violate the 


Establishment Clause, but I guess what we're 


addressing is whether there's a free exercise 


violation. 


MR. SEKULOW:  Right. 


QUESTION:  How does this violate the 


student's right to free exercise of religion?  Maybe 


it's more expensive to go to school, but why does 


that violate his free exercise of religion right? 


MR. SEKULOW:  Joshua Davey, and the state 


has acknowledged this, of course, has the free 


exercise right to pursue a degree in theology.  The 


question here is the burden that's placed on it.  Of 


course, two responses.  With regard to the actual 


burden, here a general benefit was available to a

student and a religious classification was utilized 


to deny the student access to those funds.  He met 


the criteria. 


QUESTION:  Well, let me ask you this. 


MR. SEKULOW:  Sure. 


QUESTION:  Suppose a state has a school 


voucher program such as the Court indicated could be 


upheld in the Zelman case.  Now, if the state decides 


not to give school vouchers for use in religious or 


parochial schools, do you take the position it must, 


that it has to do one or the other?  It can have a 


voucher program, but if it does, it has to fund all 


private and religious schools with a voucher program?


MR. SEKULOW:  No, I think --


QUESTION:  Is that your position? 


MR. SEKULOW:  No.  The state --


QUESTION:  Well, why not?  I mean, why 


wouldn't it follow from what you are saying today? 


MR. SEKULOW:  For this reason.  The state 


can set neutral and eligible criteria for admission 


as an eligible institution.  Here it was 


accreditation.  Now, if the religious school, the 


school that was affiliated with the religious 


denomination met the general neutral eligibility 


requirement, and there was no countervailing

Establishment Clause problems, yes, then it should --


QUESTION:  I -- I don't know what you 


mean.  The state says all schools were going to have 


a program to give vouchers for use in all schools of 


a certain grade level, assuming the teachers are 


qualified to be teachers. 


MR. SEKULOW:  That --


QUESTION:  Can they refrain from making 


that program available for use in religious schools? 


MR. SEKULOW:  I -- I would think not.  I 


think once it would go towards the private schools, 


as long as the eligibility --


QUESTION:  So what you're urging here 


would have a major impact, then, would it not, on --

on voucher programs? 


MR. SEKULOW:  Well, it would.  I think a 


voucher program could be established that has a 


neutral criteria and if the private schools meet that 


criteria, including the private religious schools and 


there is no countervailing Establishment Clause 


problem, I wouldn't see any reason --


QUESTION:  Well, but the only criteria 


that they have --


QUESTION:  Sure -- surely, the state can 


decide to fund only public schools.

religious question. 


MR. SEKULOW:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  But I'm -- I'm concerned --


QUESTION:  But you say if they publish any 


private school they must publish -- they must support 


all religious schools as well. 


MR. SEKULOW:  No.  Again, I think if they 


meet the accreditation standard, if the program were 


to --


QUESTION:  But they could not just say we 


-- we will publish all private schools except 

sectarian schools. 


MR. SEKULOW:  I don't think they could do 


that.  No, I think it would be --


QUESTION:  That's the issue here, yeah. 


QUESTION:  Even though there -- there are 


quite a few state laws and constitutional provisions 


around the country that -- that provide just that, 


aren't there? 


MR. SEKULOW:  There are.  Thirty-seven

MR. SEKULOW:  Interesting, Justice 


O'Connor, and admittedly, this is a bit of a moving 


target because state policies change, but there are 


approximately 37 states that have this type of 


amendment.  Twenty-five of those states have programs 


of aid that do not have a discriminatory basis upon 


religion.  It's given to any accredited --


QUESTION:  Mr. Sekulow?


MR. SEKULOW:  Yes.


QUESTION:  May I ask you the question that 


I asked Ms. Pierce, because I think this is really 


what the case turns on.  Is there any space between 


what one, what a state is permitted to do, what it's 

permitted to fund under the Establishment Clause and 


what it must fund under the Free Exercise Clause, and 


if so, what fills that space?  You've been candid in 


saying voucher, no.  If you -- going to give to any 


private school, you can't leave out the parochial 


schools.  You certainly said that about this program. 


MR. SEKULOW:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Suppose the -- the state would 


say, we are going to fund professional education, 


lawyers, doctors, architects, engineers, but we're

divinity program.  Would that qualify or would that 


fall also? 


MR. SEKULOW:  Well, I think a program that 


were to just limit it to specific professions would 


not necessarily have to go towards theology.  For 


instance, in a lot of states using that example, 


Justice Ginsburg, there is a shortage of nurses right 


now.  And if the state were to adopt a program to 


fund education for nurses that included public and 


private schools, they don't have to bring theology --


QUESTION:  No, but it would include -- my 


program includes all professions, save one, and --


and that is ministry. 


MR. SEKULOW: 


Well, if it was as you 

described it, I would be here arguing the same point 


in this context.  The idea that you would list all of 


the professions and then say we are going to fund 


everything but those students studying theology would 


be again that religious classification, and I would 


think unless the state could establish its compelling 


governmental interest --


QUESTION:  As I -- as I understand your 


answer to Justice O'Connor, if we decide in your 


favor, we necessarily commit ourselves to the 


proposition that an elementary and secondary school

voucher program must include religious schools if it 


includes any other private schools.  It -- it seems 


to me that your case can be resolved on a much 


narrower issue than that.  Here we have a -- a 


college student who is being required to surrender 


his -- his conscientious beliefs by declaring a major 


which otherwise would have been completely funded by 


the school, and I -- I just don't see any interest in 


doing that.  It seems to me a -- a very severe 


violation of -- of religious conscience.  I think 


that's quite different from an overall neutrality 


principle, which would foreclose this Court on the 


voucher issue. 


MR. SEKULOW: 


Well, I don't think -- I 

agree, Justice Kennedy.  I don't think the Court has 


to go that far here.


QUESTION:  But why isn't --


QUESTION:  But certainly that's what 


you're arguing.  I mean, your -- your brief and your 


presentation certainly urges us to go that route. 


MR. SEKULOW:  If --


QUESTION:  Now, have we -- have we, in 


looking at funding issues, have we dealt differently 


with the requirement of funding something out of 


public funds than for other purposes?

 MR. SEKULOW:  Well -- well, certainly in 


the -- in the direct aid cases and in the 


Establishment Clause context, but this is very 


similar to the Witters program, so there is not the 


countervailing Establishment Clause issue, and that's 


what I was going to address, Justice Kennedy. 


Depending on how the voucher program is established 


would depend on whether the religious institutions 


would be included.  For instance, again I go to the 


eligibility issue.  Here, Northwest College was an 


accredited institution --


QUESTION:  Okay.  Let's assume that all 


the public schools and all the private schools, 


including all religious private schools are -- are 

accredited in whatever way the state accredits them, 


and that the criterion, apart from religious 


education, is simply that the ultimate recipient of 


the voucher has to be an accredited school.  It seems 


to me, following Justice O'Connor's question, that 


the argument that would be made in any case in which 


a state says we will -- we will allow a voucher to be 


spent in a private school, but not a private 


religious school is the same argument that Justice 


Kennedy was suggesting a moment ago, and that is that 


the religious student must somehow surrender a

conscientious belief and go from a religious school 


and seek to be enrolled in a non-religious private 


school or a public one to get the voucher.  And I 


don't see why that argument would not be just as 


applicable there as the argument that you are making 


here. 


MR. SEKULOW:  Justice Souter, in this 


particular -- using that example, here the school is 


a qualified school.  The Northwest College, which 


admittedly has a religious affiliation, it isn't --


QUESTION:  Sure.  That's a wash. 


Everybody agrees. 


MR. SEKULOW:  It's their major. 


QUESTION: 


Everybody -- the only criterion 

is, will we fund religious training in how to be 


religion -- religious -- or will we not?  And in 


fact, a -- a similar argument would be made as 


between the -- the religious school that teaches 


religion, and the private school that doesn't teach 


religion. 


MR. SEKULOW:  In this context, the way the 


program is implemented within that hypothetical and 


within the facts here, here students can take these 


very same courses in religion that Josh Davey --


QUESTION:  Well, that may show that the

state draws a kind of a funny line.  Maybe it was a 


-- a bad job of line drawing, and I -- I have to 


admit, I'm not quite sure why they draw it the way 


they do, but on -- on the -- on the basic proposition 


that the state raises as -- as its position here, 


that it will not fund ministerial education or 


education in how to be religious versus funding other 


kinds of training, the argument, it seems to me, from 


the Free Exercise Clause would be the same in the 


voucher case as the argument that you are making 


here. 


MR. SEKULOW:  If in fact the programs were 


put forward this way with the accreditation as you 


suggested, and there is no countervailing 


Establishment Clause issue and the eligibility issue 


of the school is met, yes, I wouldn't see the --


QUESTION:  All right.


MR. SEKULOW: -- justification to exclude a 


particular major here in this particular case, a 


submajor from a religious viewpoint. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Sekulow --


QUESTION:  Well, how many states do that, 


do you know?  You're knowledgeable on these things. 


How many states have voucher programs which -- which 


would allow students to go to any private school, you

know, an elite academy, but not allow them to go to 


religious schools? 


MR. SEKULOW:  Twenty-five states have 


voucher-type programs that have no restrictions at 


all as long as it's an accredited institution, so 


that's the -- usually the standard.  They can go to 


any school that's accredited.  There are some states, 


and it's about a half-dozen, as I said, Justice 


Scalia, it's a little bit of a moving target because 


policies change, that actually have this prohibition 


for religious education, and even within some of 


those states, the programs are inconsistent.  They'll 


have different type of financial aid programs here. 


In this particular situation, and the way 

this particular program is implemented, though, 


Joshua Davey had already made, Justice Stevens, his 


declaration of a major before he was notified he was 


disqualified.  The state didn't do the formal 


notification until October, some two months after he 


rolled -- enrolled. 


QUESTION:  But I suppose he could have 


changed his mind and taken another major in most of 


the courses and then postponed that decision.  As a 


matter of conscience, he didn't do it. 


MR. SEKULOW:  It -- it was a matter of

conscience.  There were some students at the school 


that did change their mind.  There were two that did 


not.  Joshua Davey was one that -- and the counselor, 


the financial aid counselor, did state in the joint 


appendix that she cautioned them if they are in fact 


going to major in a degree that would be pursuing a 


theology to tell the truth, which he clearly did 


here.  So his implementation of the decision was 


already made in the sense that the state came back 


afterwards and said oh, by the way, these group of 


students don't qualify for this. 


QUESTION:  But wouldn't it be --


QUESTION:  Am I -- am I correct or 


incorrect that the state would fund a student who 


majored in literature at a institution which was 


sectarian and had instructors who taught literature 


from a religious perspective or -- am I correct about 


that? 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Well, but the state is saying, 


I don't know if we can escape the broader ground, the 


state's saying, look, we understand that, you know, 


applying our standard there'll be all kinds of 


anomalies that you can get.  Maybe this case is one. 


But what we're doing by and large is to say, we don't

want to spend too much of our state money in this 


program, we'll do it subsidiary, you know, the odd 


example doesn't matter, but people who major in 


philosophy are likely to become priests or at least 


spend a lot of time studying theology.  If they major 


in theology, or they spend a lot of time studying 


theology, that's going too far.  So this is, like 


many administrative lines, a very crude effort to 


identify those people who are taking too much of 


their time in totally religiously-oriented matters. 


Now, of course that's unconstitutional if 


we accept your argument that the state must treat the 


religious study the same way as any other.  That's 


your broad ground. 


But if we reject the broad 

ground, I don't quite see at the moment how we can 


accept the narrow one, which turns on these details 


of the administrability of the line. 


MR. SEKULOW:  Well, the reason that I want 


-- let me address the latter, if I might, Justice 


Breyer.  The reason those details matter because the 


line drawing albeit may be crude on the State of 


Washington, here is within the context of the Free 


Exercise Clause, because here the school is an 


eligible institution, so that's not even at issue. 


There is no countervailing Establishment Clause issue

here.  Witters foreclosed that.  So all we are 


dealing with is a statute which on its face states 


that a student who qualifies based on academic 


excellence and economic need makes the decision for 


him or herself where they're going to go to school 


and what they're going to major in, and they can 


major in literally the universe of courses.  There is 


only one exclusion.  It's not even, Justice Ginsburg, 


a situation with a number of majors.  It's one.


QUESTION:  Mr. Sekulow, I think that 


Justice Breyer is getting at the same point I tried 


to get at, and it's in part the other flip side of 


what Justice Kennedy asked you.  Certainly, you are 


not standing here to tell us that, oh, if they were 

more restrictive, if they said we're simply not going 


to fund scholarships to students who go to sectarian 


schools, that that might be all right.  I mean, you 


don't want to win on the ground of the school was too 


generous in what it did fund. 


MR. SEKULOW:  Well, two responses.  First, 


the -- on the issue of the state and their 


obligation, to recast this as a -- the state is being 


required to fund Joshua Davey's education, I think is 


-- is a miscast of the issue.  The state has decided 


to employ, to develop a scholarship program that's

very broad-based and in that program they have given 


the student the ultimate choice of where they could 


go to school as long as it's within Washington state 


and accredited and literally they can major in any 


major except for one, and that is a theology 


exclusion. 


QUESTION:  Wouldn't be any better if they 


said, you can go to any school except a -- a church 


school. 


MR. SEKULOW:  No.  I think it would raise, 


if it's accredited I think it would raise the same 


problem.  But it's not to say that the state 


universities don't teach courses in theology and 


religion. 


On pages 66 and 74 of the joint appendix, 

there's a listing of the courses offered at the 


University of Washington, and it covers a broad array 


of religious courses, albeit from --


QUESTION:  You -- you don't know of any 


case that says that the less significant the interest 


the state has is the more latitude it has in 


discriminating against religion.  You don't know of 


any case that said that?


MR. SEKULOW:  No.  That -- that would --


QUESTION:  I hope you don't, yeah. 


MR. SEKULOW:  No.  And hopefully this

won't be that one.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  May I ask -- ask you a broader 


question?  A number of the briefs discussed the 


breathing space between the Establishment Clause and 


the Free Exercise Clause.  Do you take the position, 


or just what is your position on whether or not there 


is such a breathing space? 


MR. SEKULOW:  The play in the joints as 


it's referred to. 


QUESTION:  Yeah. 


MR. SEKULOW:  I -- I think the play in the 


joints gives the state broad flexibility in 


establishing the programs and -- or not establishing 

a program at all, but to use the play in the joints 


to not accommodate religion but rather to target 


religion as an exclusion I think is a misuse in my 


view of what the Court has at this point --


QUESTION:  Give me an example, any 


example.


QUESTION:  But do you go so far as to 


contend that any violation, any time there is no 


violation of the Establishment Clause that then the 


Free Exercise Clause would necessarily kick in? 


MR. SEKULOW:  No, absolutely not.  And let

QUESTION:  Do you want to reserve the rest 


of your time, Mr. Sekulow? 


MR. SEKULOW:  I don't have -- I only have 


20 minutes, so I cannot reserve any more time. 


That's okay.  But I would normally be happy to.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  If -- if you can give me an 


example of a case where the state can say we know we 


can give this funding to religious schools if we want 


to, but we don't want to?  Can you give any example 


where that would be legitimate on your view of free 

exercise? 


MR. SEKULOW:  Sure.  There's -- I don't 


think there is any affirmative obligation, Justice 


Ginsburg, for the state, even if the Establishment 


Clause -- I'll give an example.  The Center Moriches 


School District in Lamb's Chapel, while this Court 


held that the Establishment Clause did not --


required them that they open their facilities to 


comply with the First Amendment viewpoint neutrality 


issues, they're not -- they were not required to open 


their facilities up.  The State of Washington could

develop programs for specific majors. 


QUESTION:  No, but if they opened it up at 


all, there was no play in the joints between the 


religion clauses that said you can't open it up to 


this particular religious presentation.  Isn't that 


correct? 


MR. SEKULOW:  No, I think that --


QUESTION:  So I think -- let me just --


MR. SEKULOW:  Please. 


QUESTION:  -- say what I think your 


position is and then you -- I think your position is 


that, although certain religious funding may not 


violate the Establishment Clause, it does not follow 


that the state must fund it.  But if the state has a 


general program for funding instruction, and this is 


religious instruction, it's got to fund religious 


instruction and there's no middle ground, there's no 


play in the joints there.  Is that correct? 


MR. SEKULOW:  Under the latter 


hypothetical, that -- that would be our position, 


that once you have gone into the private schools and 


the school meets the neutral secular criteria, our 


view would be at that point the state should be equal 


and not target out religion for an exclusion, which 


is precisely the viewpoint neutrality issue that we

think should apply and, of course, within the free 


exercise context, the minimum requirement of 


neutrality is law not discriminate on its face.  This 


one does.  If there are no further questions, thank 


you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Sekulow. 


General Olson, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE


SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT


MR. OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 


please the Court:


The Promise Scholarship program practices 


the plainest form of religious discrimination.  It 


disqualifies the one course of study that is taught 


from a religious perspective.  The clear and 


unmistakable message is that religion and preparation 


for a career in the ministry is disfavored and 


discouraged. 


QUESTION:  Well, but of course, there's 


been a couple of centuries of practice in this 


country of not funding religious instruction by tax 


money.  I mean, that's -- that's as old as the 


country itself, isn't it? 


MR. OLSON:  Well, yes, it is.  But there

is the other tradition that is as old as the country 


itself, is the free exercise component of the 


religion clauses, which this Court has said 


repeatedly mandates neutrality. 


QUESTION:  But how is his free exercise 


chilled at all?  Can't he practice his religion just 


as he always would and become a minister?


MR. OLSON:  Well, it's --


QUESTION:  He just has to pay for it. 


MR. OLSON:  Justice -- well, Justice 


Stevens, the individual that was disqualified in 


Tennessee from being a member of a delegate to the 


Constitutional Convention because he was a minister 


--

QUESTION:  He was prohibited from doing 


something every other citizen can do. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, the same -- the Court 


would have come out the same way, I submit, if it 


said that ministers will not have their expenses 


paid, but everybody else will.  The language of the 


decision and the language of Sherbert v. Verner and 


Fowler v. Rhode Island is that to the extent that a 


religion --


QUESTION:  But you're still not addressing 


the question of how his -- his freedom to practice

subsidy. 


QUESTION:  He practices it without a 


MR. OLSON:  He practices it without the 


same subsidy that is made available to every other 


citizen except someone who wants to study to be a 


minister.  If it was discrimination against a 


minister in -- in the -- in the case involving 


Tennessee, this is a discrimination against a person 


who aspires to be a minister.  He is given less of an 


advantage than all --


QUESTION:  If it -- if it -- if it isn't 


coercion of -- of his religion, I suppose it would be 


okay to limit this -- this exclusion to Jewish 


theology or to Catholic theology, because the 


response would be it doesn't -- it doesn't coerce his 


religion at all. 


MR. OLSON:  We submit that the teachings 


of the decision of this Court --


QUESTION:  But isn't the difference that 


that would plainly violate the Establishment Clause, 


and here we have a Free Exercise Clause issue.

 MR. OLSON:  What this Court has said, 


Justice Stevens, is that in -- in many respects the 


Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause are 


components of the same principle that is --


QUESTION:  So you take the position 


there's no breathing space between the two? 


MR. OLSON:  Well, there is -- there may be 


breathing space, especially with respect to the 


Establishment Clause area, where this Court will not 


find entanglement or endorsement under certain 


programs that may not be required, but what this 


Court has said is that distinguishing -- that 


discriminating against Catholics and discriminating 


against people who are religious generally and even 

people who are anti-religious generally violates the 


twin components of equality and neutrality that are 


-- that are mandated by the religion clauses. 


QUESTION:  What -- what is your response 


to the following concern that's been brought up a few 


times but I'd like you to address it directly.  This 


case is perhaps a small matter of a distinction that 


doesn't make all that much sense, but makes some. 


But the implications of this case are breathtaking, 


that it would mean if your side wins, that every 


program, not just educational programs, but nursing

programs, hospital programs, social welfare programs, 


contracting programs throughout the governments would 


go over, you'd have to go over each of them and 


there'd be a claim in each instance that they cannot 


be purely secular, that they must fund all religions 


who want to do the same thing, and that those 


religions, by the way, though it may be an excellent 


principle, may get into fights with each other about 


billions and billions of dollars, so -- which is 


something about which I have written about, which you 


know.  All right.  So, I'd like you to address that. 


MR. OLSON:  Yes, Justice Breyer.  It is 


not a major step at all in this Court's jurisprudence 


to say that those funding programs for medicine, 

doctors, nurses, cannot distinguish and not 


discriminate against a person who decides to go to a 


Catholic nurse or to a Catholic doctor.  If money is 


made available for individuals in the Medicare 


program to exclude people that want to go to 


religious hospitals for their heart surgery, that 


would violate the Free Exercise Clause. 


QUESTION:  So do you agree, do you take 


the position that if we affirm the court of appeals 


and accept your position, that the Court is committed 


on the school voucher issue if, say, a school voucher

program excludes parochial schools? 


MR. OLSON:  It would depend, I suppose, on 


how the program was structured, what the inquiry 


involving a compelling government -- strict scrutiny 


would entail.  There may be a difference, for 


example, with respect to funding that's associated 


with institutions, as opposed to individual 


conscience.  This is the plainest form of religious 


discrimination because the person who wants to 


believe in God or wants to have a position of 


religious leadership is the one that's singled out 


for discriminatory treatment. 


The Court has said before that 


distinction, religious tests for governmental 

benefits violate the Free Exercise Clause.  This is a 


religious test.  If the person wants to take a 


program in theology, he's disqualified. 


QUESTION:  What are the practical 


implications? 


QUESTION:  May I ask you --


QUESTION:  Just want a sentence on the 


practical implication.  Is it as far-reaching as my 


tone of voice suggested? 


MR. OLSON:  I would say that the -- it is 


not as far-reaching as the -- the sense of doom that

your question suggested.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Maybe a good thing I'm not --


don't --


MR. OLSON:  The idea that this country 


when it -- when it provides tax exemptions or cash to 


citizens to educate their children, cannot single out 


for discriminatory treatment the Catholic or the 


religious person is not a far-reaching -- well, it 


may have been far-reaching at the time, and thank 


heavens that it is, that this principle as the -- I 


think one of the questions, I think it was Justice 


O'Connor's question, asked with respect to the 


funding cases and this Court dealt specifically with 

that in the Maher v. Roe case when it said the 


funding cases do not control the significantly 


different context in which a funding decision 


impinges upon the constitutionally-imposed government 


obligation of neutrality required by the religion 


clauses.  So those funding cases are completely 


distinguishable --


QUESTION:  General, may I ask you this 


question?  I mean, the whole argument for neutrality 


comes down to an argument, I think, about the 


following.

 MR. OLSON:  About --


QUESTION:  About the following 


distinction.  The other side says, Washington says, 


look, there is a line to be drawn, not between 


funding Catholics and Protestants or atheists or 


what-not.  The line to be drawn is the line between 


funding education about a religion, education that 


says this is what Catholics believe, this is what 


atheists believe, and on the other hand, education 


that says, this belief is valid, and you ought to go 


out and persuade other people to hold this belief. 


They say, that is the distinction we are trying to 


draw.  Why is that distinction invalid under a 


neutrality criteria? 


MR. OLSON:  For the reason that the same 


argument was rejected in the Rosenberger case, that 


the notion of --


QUESTION:  But Rosenberger was not said --


the opinion in Rosenberger said these people are not 


proselytizing.  And -- and the distinction that they 


are drawing is a distinction between believing in 


proselytizing on the one hand, how to do it, why it's 


valid, and instruction on what people believe as a 


fact on the other.  And I -- Rosenberger is an 


authority for -- for the rejection of that

distinction. 


MR. OLSON:  I -- I respectfully submit 


that it is, that the students in the Rosenberger that 


were publishing those articles were publishing 


articles that advocated belief in God. 


QUESTION:  Oh, look, you're writing my 


dissent.  I -- I agree, but my -- my --


(Laughter.)


MR. OLSON:  That was --


QUESTION:  I -- I couldn't -- I couldn't 


get four colleagues to agree with me on that, and 


they went off on -- on another -- another course. 


MR. OLSON:  Yeah, but the Court went on to 


say that this was a free exercise violation as well 

as a First Amendment violation. 


The other point that I think is very, very 


important with respect to that, if the state starts 


to distinguishing between discussion of a subject and 


proselytizing, the entanglement problem is going to 


be enormous.  The program will have to be looked at 


to see how persuasive it is.  We know today that --


QUESTION:  If that argument is good, why 


do we even bother with the -- the criterion of direct 


funding of religion?


MR. OLSON:  Well, because --

 QUESTION:  Because we -- we could have 


drawn the line there. 


MR. OLSON:  No, because the line has been 


drawn by individuals, individuals making genuinely 


free, independent choices to make a dispensation. 


It's like the Court's example in those cases of an 


individual receiving a check and then deciding 


exactly how to spend it so there's a great difference 


between those kind of cases.  This is no different 


than the example that Justice Scalia raised as 


providing fire protection or -- or providing tax 


deductions.  Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, General Olson. 


Ms. Pierce, you have three minutes 

remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NARDA PIERCE


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MS. PIERCE:  I would like to return to 


three points.  One, on the statute that says no aid 


shall be awarded to a student pursuing a degree in 


theology.  A question was asked saying that for 


administrative ease the state uses this legislative 


approach, their constitutional command.  But it's not 


just administrative ease.  I think it's a question of 


entanglement.  Should the state be involved in a

class-by-class assessment of whether it -- it 


individually, it should be categorized as religious 


instruction or not. 


QUESTION:  But we've held in Witters that 


there is no problem with that -- with that kind --


with that kind of subsidy. 


MS. PIERCE:  For purposes of the 


Establishment Clause.  And I just wanted to point out 


that our state supreme court has questioned in a 


dissent in the Gallway v. Grimm case, some justices 


of our state supreme court have asked, is focusing on 


the degree program sufficient for our state 


constitution?  But we believe there are good reasons 


for it that's not yet been addressed by our court, 

and that's to avoid that kind of class-by-class 


determination, not necessary in Witters because there 


the focus is, does the Establishment Clause -- is it 


violated by government endorsement?


But Washington does take a different 


approach to both prongs, both twin prongs of 


religious freedom, and this is my second point. For 


purposes of funding, it looks beyond government 


endorsement and looks to the freedom of conscience in 


religious matters of a broader range of citizens, 


including citizens who may not want to have their

compelled tax payments used for religious 


instruction.


So it's the same principle.  It doesn't 


become hostility to religion just because it extends 


that one principle beyond what the Establishment 


Clause requires.  On the other hand, the State of 


Washington also puts greater restrictions on 


government where their regulations may impact 


someone's free exercise of their religion so that 


unless a state -- the state can show a substantial 


need, certain regulatory laws cannot be applied in a 


fashion that burdened the free exercise.


The Munns v. Martin case is a classic 


example that we have cited to the Court.  It's a case 


where historic landmark laws could not prevent a 


church from building a pastoral center because the 


historic landmark laws were deemed not to be 


substantially needed by the state to protect the 


public. 


So we do think there is wide latitude, and 


my final point, Mr. Chief Justice, is that this Court 


has accorded the states wide latitude in funding 


decisions for the states to make their own policy 


judgments.  Here, all the state has done has been to 


decline to fund religious instruction wherever it

occurs, including in a theology degree program.  We 


have not overstepped our bounds by imposing an 


unconstitutional condition on Mr. Davey as a 


recipient.  In the overall picture, we're not 


suppressing --


QUESTION:  It -- it -- it will fund 


religious instruction.  So long as he doesn't major 


in theology, he can take the same courses and get --


get instructed in religion, can't he? 


MS. PIERCE:  Yes, Scalia, that --


QUESTION:  So what you say is just not 


true? 


MS. PIERCE:  Yes, Justice -- well, that 


can happen in a rare circumstance.  We believe that 


there's a good reason to use that --


QUESTION:  Everybody who takes a theology 


course has to major in theology?  I don't think it's 


rare at all.  Probably most of the students at 


Northwest College take theology courses.  It's --


it's a religious institution, and that's perfectly 


okay, and the state is willing to fund that. 


MS. PIERCE:  That's what the statute 


permits now.  Some justices of our state supreme 


court have expressed the same question whether that 


is possible.  Thank you, Mr. --
