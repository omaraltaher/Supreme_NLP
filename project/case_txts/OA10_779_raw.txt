 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

 (10:06 a.m.)

argument first this morning -- this morning in Case 

10-779, William Sorrell, Attorney General of Vermont, v. 

IMS Health Incorporated.

 Ms. Asay.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIDGET C. ASAY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MS. ASAY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Under State and Federal law, doctors write 

prescriptions for their patients to allow them access to 

drugs that the government deems too dangerous for 

unrestricted sale.  Vermont's law allow doctors to 

decide whether this information that they're compelled 

to provide to pharmacies may be used in marketing that 

is directed at them.

 Drug companies would certainly like to have 

this information for marketing, but they have no First 

Amendment right to demand it, just as they have no right 

to demand access to the doctor's tax returns, his 

patient files, or to their competitors' business 

records.

 Vermont's law does not regulate the content

of the marketing pitches and the advertising that drug 

companies provide about their products or their 

competitors' products.  It regulates access to this 

information that's created in a highly regulated regime 

of prescription drugs and in the context of the 

doctor-patient relationship.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The purpose -- the 

purpose is to prevent sales representatives from 

contacting particular physicians, right?

 MS. ASAY:  I disagree, Your Honor.  The 

purpose of the statute is to let doctors decide whether 

sales representatives will have access to this inside 

information about what they have been prescribing to 

their patients.  And what -- what the record shows is 

that what drug companies do is track and monitor doctors 

very closely to watch when they switch drugs, to watch 

the trends by which they -- doctors prescribe, by 

gender, by age.  And all that information is used to 

target and to direct the marketing projects -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But they could use it for 

other purposes, right?

 MS. ASAY:  The pharmaceutical manufacturers?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

 MS. ASAY:  Under this statute they may use 

it for some limited purposes for clinical trials.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So what the Chief Justice 

suggested is right, that the purpose is to stop them 

from using it in order to market their drugs?

 MS. ASAY:  The purpose is to allow doctors 

to decide whether the -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's right.

 MS. ASAY:  -- the information should be 

available.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's right, but 

that -- that is an impediment to their using it for the 

marketing of drugs.  You're -- you're placing that 

impediment on it.  Isn't that the obvious purpose of it? 

I mean, it doesn't necessarily make it bad, but -- but 

let's not quibble over what the purpose is.

 MS. ASAY:  As with any information that 

the -- that might inform a marketing campaign, not 

having the information may be -- make their marketing 

less effective or make it different.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the purpose.  That's 

the purpose of it, to prevent them from using this 

information to market their drugs.

 MS. ASAY:  Again, Your Honor, the purpose is 

to allow doctors to make the decision, and doctors may 

want to allow its use or not allow its use.  But the 

law -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it's only for that use 

that you interpose the requirement that the doctor 

consent.  For all other uses you don't require the 

doctor's consent, right?

 MS. ASAY:  The only -- the consent 

requirement in this statute goes to the use for 

marketing and also to the sale by the pharmacy, and that 

sale may be for other purposes as well, so there -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Asay, are any of the 

other purposes, like for insurance purposes, cases where 

the pharmacist is paid for giving out the prescriber 

information?  Here what they call data miners are paying 

the pharmacists to get this information.  In the case of 

other, others who have access, do any of them also pay 

the pharmacists?

 MS. ASAY:  Your Honor, there's two sort of 

answers to that.  The first is that, with respect to 

pharmacies, the record shows here that the only place 

that the pharmacies disseminate their information is to 

the data vendors, and that is a commercial sale, and it 

is primarily intended for the marketing purpose. 

Insurers do have information about doctors' prescribing 

practices and patient information.  They have that 

internally from their own claims and their relationships 

with doctors and patients.  So insurers are not -- do

not need to buy the data from pharmacies.  They have it 

without purchasing it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So -- so the data is not 

private in the sense that the physician who prescribes 

knows that nobody will know what he is prescribing and 

how much he prescribes and how often, because there are 

a lot of people who do know that, right?

 MS. ASAY:  That's correct, Your Honor, there 

are people who know what the doctor prescribes and what 

the patient has received.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the only thing it 

assures the physician, the physician who prescribes, is 

that he won't be bothered by drug companies who, on the 

basis of their knowledge of information which other 

people have, approach him in order to market their 

drugs?  That's basically all it assures the prescribing 

physician, right?

 MS. ASAY:  It assures the prescribing 

physician that his information about prescribing 

practices will not be used for marketing without his 

consent.  It's like the difference -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And, and he could achieve 

the same objective, could he not, by simply refusing to 

talk to the marketer.  When the marketer says, you know, 

I want to talk to you about a new drug, he says:  I

don't talk to drug manufacturers and marketers.

 MS. ASAY:  He could not achieve the same 

result, Your Honor.  What the record shows is that 

doctors are particularly concerned about having access 

to the best information and the most complete 

information to make decisions for their patients.  And 

this data, as was discussed by Dr. Granday below, by 

Kesselheim, by Mr. Erhari, the former sales 

representative -- they all discussed how the data ends 

up being used to filter the information that doctors 

receive.  So they receive less -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  One of the Respondents 

argues that the statute would permit, does permit, the 

use of this information for what they call a counter­

detailing effort.  Is that correct?

 MS. ASAY:  It is not correct, Your Honor, to 

the extent that Respondents have suggested that 

Vermont's academic detailing program, which is called 

the evidence-based education program, uses this data.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  That wasn't really my 

question.  My question was does the statute permit it. 

If Vermont wanted to do that, the University of Vermont 

or some other entity wanted to do that, would the 

statute permit it?

 MS. ASAY:  Well, the statute would not

question of whether the information would be available

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could that data be sold to 

a university for research purposes?  The university 

says:  We really want this information to do some 

research.  Could the data be sold to the university for 

that purpose?

 MS. ASAY:  Yes, Your Honor, the statute does 

permit it to be sold for health care research -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could the researcher then 

have a profile, a data bank, that is very helpful to the 

general public, and sell that to the general public, to 

the newspapers and so forth?

 MS. ASAY:  We do not believe so, Your Honor, 

because of the background regulations that govern this 

information, including Pharmacy Board Rule 20, which we 

cited at page 4 of our brief, which also places 

restrictions on disclosure of patient and practitioner

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no.  It's sold to the 

researcher.  The researcher then comes up with a design

or database that is very fascinating for a number of 

reasons.  Can that researcher sell it to the New England 

Journal of Medicine?

 MS. ASAY:  I'm not sure if I understand 

whether the question is about the data itself or results 

drawn from the data.  But to the extent that the statute 

allows the sale of the data for research, the 

restriction on the other uses would accompany the sale,

results that are very fascinating.  The researcher then 

wants to sell that to the New England Journal of 

Medicine.  What result under the statute?

 MS. ASAY:  The statute would have required 

the pharmacy to prevent the further dissemination of the 

data except for health care research.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You answered my question 

earlier that they don't sell it to anyone else.  That's 

why I was trying to clarify your answer to Justice 

Kennedy, because you told me the only sale -- the 

pharmacists, they sell this to the data miners, they do 

not sell it to the other people.  But now you're 

answering Justice Kennedy's question, yes, they sell it 

to universities.

 MS. ASAY:  I apologize, Your Honor, if I was 

not clear.  As a factual matter, we know absolutely that 

the pharmacies do not sell it to researchers.  I had 

understood this to be a hypothetical, if they did.  But 

as a factual matter, they do not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  How does it increase the 

prescribing physician's right of privacy that the data 

about his prescribing can only be given away but can't 

be sold?  Does that make him feel happier about his 

privacy?

 MS. ASAY:  What it allows the doctor to do 

is to avoid an intrusive and invasive marketing 

practice.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  He can do that by saying: 

I don't want to talk to you.

 MS. ASAY:  The doctor cannot -- can shut off 

any communication and any information from the

pharmaceutical companies by slamming the door on the 

detailers, but that's not necessarily in the interest of 

doctors or patients.  And what this -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That may well be, but then 

just don't tell me that the purpose is to protect their 

privacy.  Now you're arguing a totally different 

purpose:  It makes it easier for the physician to cut 

off approaches by drug companies that want to sell 

drugs.  If that's the purpose of this statute, it's 

quite different from protecting his privacy.  His 

privacy isn't protected by saying you can't sell it but 

you can give it away.

 MS. ASAY:  Your Honor, I think the 

legislature here was using privacy to refer to the 

autonomy interest that everyone has to some degree in 

controlling the flow or the use of information about 

them.  This Court recognized in the Reporters Committee 

case in the FOIA context that there was a privacy 

interest in the aggregation of information on an FBI rap 

sheet.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, that -­

assuming there's some form of privacy that relates to 

not being harassed because there's certainly legislative 

record of doctors or groups of doctors testifying to 

feeling harassed by detailers, if Thompson requires a

less restrictive method, why does this have to be an 

opt-in rather than an opt-out?  Because isn't an opt-out 

I call up and say I, don't want you to have this 

information?  So isn't an opt-out less restrictive?

 MS. ASAY:  An opt-out would not protect the 

privacy interests as much because it would assume that 

doctors want to consent.  I would like to say that here 

the statute is -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but, given the 

restrictions on speech, why is that a bad thing? 

Meaning you don't really intend to tell us that the 

State couldn't and wouldn't -- just like we got all of 

that advertising relating to the opt-out on telephone 

solicitations, virtually every American knew they could 

do it if they chose.  Maybe some didn't, but a vast 

majority did.  You can't really say Vermont's incapable 

of telling doctors in a mailing or in some public 

professional magazine, if you want to opt out, here's 

the number?

 MS. ASAY:  Well, in fact, Your Honor, that's 

exactly what the State does.  Every time that the 

doctors relicense, which is every 2 years, they get a 

form and they can make a decision one way or the other 

on the form that they receive.  So it's perfectly 

tailored to allow the doctors to decide and to not

restrict any marketing between a willing listener and a 

willing speaker.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There's another -­

there's another purpose that I would like you to comment 

on, and that is the, the State is interested in 

promoting the sale of generic drugs and correspondingly 

to reduce the sale of brand name drugs.  And if that's 

the purpose, why doesn't that run up against what this 

Court has said that you can't, you can't lower the 

decibel level of one speaker so that another speaker, in 

this case the generics, can be heard better?

 MS. ASAY:  The State does have an interest 

in reducing health care costs here.  What's important 

about this statute is the mechanism by which it allows 

doctors to decide what information and what kind of 

marketing they want, and it's different because what 

it's about is access to information in this highly 

regulated area.  It's the difference between a doctor 

who prescribes a nonprescription drug and a patient who 

can take that information, walk into the pharmacy with a 

$20 bill and leave with their medication, and no one has 

learned anything about what the doctor prescribed for 

the patient, about the patient's concerns, or the 

doctor's concerns.

you want to lower your health care costs, not by direct 

regulation, but by restricting the flow of information 

to the doctors, by, to use a pejorative word, but by 

censoring what they can hear to make sure they don't 

have full information, so they will do what you want 

them to do when it comes to prescribing drugs, because 

you can't take, I gather, direct action and tell them, 

you must prescribe generics, right?

 MS. ASAY:  I disagree, Your Honor, for -­

for two reasons.  The statute does not limit any of the 

information that doctors receive.  So the State has not 

in any way intervened in the information that the 

pharmaceutical manufacturers can provide to the doctors. 

They are free -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're restricting

for the manufacturers to reach their intended audience, 

right?  It's as if I want -- there's a demonstration in 

town, all right?  They need a permit to hold the 

demonstration.  They get the permit.  I want to hold a 

counter-demonstration, and you're saying it doesn't make 

any difference whether I know where their demonstration 

is going to be or not?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I think maybe you're 

being -- you were the one that made the argument that 

the State has an interest in reducing health care costs. 

I assume that is by selling generics.  And the Chief 

Justice asked you a question:  In effect, aren't you 

doing this by regulating speech?  And you say no, you 

disagree.  I don't understand that answer that you gave 

to the Chief Justice.

 MS. ASAY:  It's not a restriction on speech 

because it's a restriction only on the access to the 

information that the pharmaceutical manufacturers would 

like to use to inform their advertising, and it's only 

in play if the doctors have objected to the use.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The information necessary 

for effective speech is what you're saying, right?

 MS. ASAY:  Your Honor, it's -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It only restricts the 

information necessary for really effective speech?

say, you know, our product is much better than the 

generic; our quality control is -- you know, whatever. 

There are arguments on both sides of those things.  And 

you are making it more difficult for them to speak by 

restricting access to information that would enable 

their speech to be most effective.

 MS. ASAY:  And -- their speech would be more 

effective if they had access to patient information, if 

they had access to their competitors' trade secrets. 

There's certainly other information available that they 

would like to use in marketing, but is not available to 

them by law, and it -- it's our position that in the 

same way they do not have a right to demand access to 

information about the doctor's prescribing practices 

without his consent.

 If there are no further questions -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we'll -- we'll 

give you -- we seem to have questions.  We'll give you 

additional time for rebuttal, so you don't -- don't 

worry that we're cutting into that.

 But you're making a judgment about how 

their -- whether or not their speech will be as 

effective or not.  Don't you think they're the ones who 

are entitled to make that judgment?  It doesn't mean 

that you're right or wrong.  It just means that we would

not rely on your determination that it is -- their 

speech is just as effective.  They're the ones doing the 

speaking and they think it's not.

 MS. ASAY:  Again, Your Honor, I don't think 

we disagree that the -- the pharmaceutical manufacturers 

consider this information useful and helpful in 

targeting their marketing campaigns.  The issue in this 

case is whether their right trumps the right of the 

doctor.

 And if you go back to -- to the source of 

this information, to the underlying transaction, the 

doctor prescribing the drug for a patient and the 

pharmacy dispensing it, the doctor and the pharmacy have 

the same stake in that transaction.  And until this 

point the pharmacy has had complete control over whether 

the information gets sold into this commercial stream 

for marketing use.  And all the statute does is put the 

doctor on the same -- in the same place as the pharmacy 

in terms of deciding what further use can be made of the 

information.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask you this question? 

Do you agree with the Solicitor General's interpretation 

of the statute?

 MS. ASAY:  Yes, we do, Your Honor.

below?  Is that a change in your position?

 MS. ASAY:  It is not a change in our 

position.  It is not an issue that was pressed below, 

because of the facts on the ground.  There is only one 

transaction here.  There's a sale from the pharmacies to 

the data vendors for these commercial purposes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But isn't this 

inconsistent with what you told the court of appeals?

 MS. ASAY:  In our court of appeals brief, 

for example, at page 29 to 30, we describe that sentence 

of the statute as restricting both the sale of the 

information and the use for marketing.  And on page -­

that we did not say anything contrary to that, Your 

Honor; and that it really was not pressed below.  So I 

would not say that we, in our briefs below, fully laid 

out the position as the SG has, but we did not disagree 

with it, either.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's an important 

position.  If you -- if that indeed was the meaning of 

the statute, you should have told the court of appeals,

You should have said yes.  You should have said this is 

what it means.

 MS. ASAY:  And again, Your Honor, if I could 

point also to pages 47 to 48 of our -- of our Second 

Circuit brief, we did frame the issue as whether there 

was a right to buy and sell prescription records.  The 

issue has always been in the case.  But again the facts 

on the ground, there has only been this one transaction, 

and that -- that really was what we were litigating 

about.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the court of appeals 

on page 22a of the petition, summarizing what it 

understood you to be arguing, says:  "The statute only 

imposes restrictions on the sale or use of such data for 

marketing or promoting a prescription drug."  That was 

an inaccurate characterization of your -- the Second 

Circuit did not understand your argument?

interpretation of its own statute, I would think you 

would at least bring that out in the petition for 

rehearing.

 MS. ASAY:  We did not.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And could you explain how 

you're going to interpret your statute going forward and 

apply your statute going forward?

 MS. ASAY:  Yes, Your Honor.  We interpret 

the first clause of the statute to be a restriction on 

sale, except for sale for the exemptions that are set 

forth in the statute.  And the other provisions of the 

statute:  The second provision is a restriction on the 

use for marketing; and the third provision is a 

restriction that would apply to pharmaceutical 

manufacturers who have obtained the data for permissible 

purposes and -- and need to abide by the continuing 

restriction on the use.  And the consent provision would 

apply to each of those parts of the statute.

 Thank you.

minutes for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING the PETITIONERS

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Vermont statute protects important 

interests that the Vermont legislature could recognize 

in physician autonomy and control over information that 

concerns them.  When a patient brings a prescription to 

a pharmacy, after that point the patient information is 

protected under HIPAA and under State law.  That leaves 

two primary actors in that transaction -- the physician 

and the pharmacy.  Both are professionals, both are 

subject to regulation under a comprehensive, closed 

system for the distribution of drugs.

 Prior to the time this statute was enacted, 

the pharmacy had complete control over the disposition 

of that information.  What this statute does is put the 

physician, the prescriber, on an equal footing with 

respect to the pharmacy -- with the pharmacy, with 

respect to the use of the information about that 

prescriber, but only with respect to the use of the 

information in marketing to that prescriber.  It is a 

narrowly drawn statute that enables the physician, not 

the State, enables the physician to determine whether

the information that he was required to furnish in 

connection with the prescribing of a drug will be used 

in the marketing of products to that -- to that 

physician.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So he's required to 

provide it, but he would be required to provide it quite 

apart from the government regulation, right?  I mean, 

the pharmacy needs to know who to make the prescription 

out to.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it's because it's a 

prescription drug.  Federal and State law require a 

prescription for a prescription drug.  But if this was 

not a prescription drug, a person can go into a drug 

store and purchase a nonprescription drug just like any 

other item in a drug store, not have to furnish the 

name, not have to furnish any of this information.  So 

the information is furnished because of the requirement 

of a prescription which is of long standing.

 So this statute is really of a piece with a 

-- with a number of other types of regulations to 

protect -- protect privacy, for example, the Driver's 

Privacy Protection Act, where a person is required to 

furnish certain information in order to get a driver's 

license.  That statute prohibits the commercial 

exploitation of that information.

doesn't care about that, right.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm talking about what this 

law protects.  It does not protect his privacy in that 

sense.  It protects his privacy in the sense that it 

enables him to avoid having to say go away when a 

salesman for the -- for the -- for the drug company 

comes, right?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, well -- it -- it -- it's 

a lesser version of that, a less restrictive version of 

that, because it doesn't put either the pharmaceutical 

company or the physician in the position of an 

all-or-nothing situation.

 What -- what the law allows is the physician 

to -- to say, you can -- you can come visit me, but I 

don't want you to use this information that has 

otherwise been kept confidential under pharmacy rules to 

market to me.  That enables the physician to choose to

that's -- that's common in -- in -- in confidentiality 

statutes.  For example, HIPAA, which protects the 

personal information of -- of persons in the health care 

system, that information can be used and frankly would 

have to be used, for example, for paying insurance 

claims.  The insurer needs to know what prescriptions or

what other medical services might have been provided.

 The same thing with respect to insurers 

controlling their costs, because there are formularies 

and preferred drug lists.  And so, people in that 

position necessarily have to be able to use prescriber 

information in order to find out whether -- whether 

something was suitably prescribed under the preferred 

drug list.  So, it -- it's -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought our 

precedents made -- indicated that it's problematic for 

the State to make a determination about what uses 

information can be -- to what uses information can be 

put, particularly when it's an interested party as it is 

here.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, what the statute does 

is allow the physician -- or the prescriber to make that 

choice.  It's information about the prescriber that the 

prescriber was required to furnish in connection with 

issuing a prescription.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought you told 

me that -- I thought you told me that this doesn't 

protect physician privacy to the extent of saying this 

information can't be used for academic purposes even if 

you, the physician, don't want it to be used for those 

purposes?

connection with how -- how he will be approached.

 It's also important to recognize that this 

is very different from the general advertising cases 

this Court has had under the commercial speech doctrine. 

This is not public advertising.  This I think falls into 

the camp of Dun and Bradstreet, where you have a -- a 

targeted limited business audience, a -- a -- really 

one-on-one.  It's not -- it's not radio or television 

advertising.  It's one-on-one advertising in which the 

public interest is -- is much more limited, and it's 

one-on-one with respect to the very person whose 

information was first furnished by the physician to the 

pharmacy, so -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's because the 

pharmaceutical company deems this to be the most 

efficient.  What you're saying is that the State can 

prohibit the most efficient sort of speech, whereas if 

it just had general dissemination which didn't serve any 

particular purpose, that would be all right.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  But it -­

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court, good morning:

 You will want to have available you to the 

red brief of IMS Health, Incorporated, which in its 

appendix reproduces the statutes and findings.  And the 

reason we have to look at the statutes and findings in 

this argument is because the case can't be decided as a 

matter of absolutes.

 We know that statutes like HIPAA do protect 

private information in third parties' hands and they are

constitutional.  On the other hand, we also know that a 

governmental restriction on the use of information could 

be used to distort the marketplace of ideas.  So the 

case is going to have to be decided somewhere in the 

middle.  And in order to do that, we're going to have to 

figure out where in the middle Vermont ended up.

 Now, in doing that I want to clarify I think 

three things in the questioning of the first half hour. 

They are about what the practice are -- practices are at 

issue here; what this statute does, actually what's the 

rule; and why is it that Vermont did it.

 So as to Justice Ginsburg's question, are 

there other sales, the State gave you the correct answer 

that the pharmacy companies don't sell to researchers, 

but that's somewhat misleading.  They sell to us, and we 

sell to the researchers, we sell to the government, the 

intermediaries like IMS Health.  That's because we're 

the aggregator.  So it is not correct to say that the 

only sale is for pharmaceutical marketing.

 Second, on the important question of what 

this statute -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I asked whether there are 

sales to any other entities.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, and I said the State 

gave you the accurate answer.  But the implication of

the answer I think was not quite correct, because there 

are sales for purposes other than for marketing.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if this was a general 

sale provision, then that would include those sales that 

you're talking about?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It would not, because the 

point would then -- and I'll come to the statute in a 

minute, because all the exemptions -- right?  So 

there's -- there's a debate that Justice Alito focused 

on about what does the statute mean, and I do want to 

turn to that in a second.

 But to jump ahead to your question, Justice 

Kagan, assume that it's a general sale prohibition. 

Then there are all the exemptions and the exemptions 

take all of these other uses out from the sale 

prohibition:  for academic research, to go to the 

government, and for clinical trials, for health care 

research.  Those are all exempted from the general sale 

prohibition.

 So let's do turn, if you don't mind, to what 

it is the statute actually does.  It is an important 

point.  First, I am going to come to our brief, but I 

just want to read something.  For your later reference 

I'm going to have been reading from page 42 of PhRMA's 

brief, and this is what -- what the State told the

Second Circuit, quote:  "Data vendors may continue to 

acquire, edit, and sell this information to whomever 

they choose so long as that person does not use the 

information for detailing."

 In turn, the Second Circuit -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What was your page again?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sorry.  That's going to be 

from the PhRMA brief, the other red brief at page 42, at 

the top of the page.

 So, to whomever they choose, so long as that 

person does not use the information for detailing.  The 

Second Circuit said:  Okay, you're the State; here's how 

we understand the statute.  The statute only imposed -­

quoting again, this is from 22A, it's the language that 

Justice Alito quoted -- the statute only imposes 

"restrictions on the sale or use of such data for 

marketing or promoting a prescription drug."  So that's 

what they understood the statute to do.

 Now, then the question becomes why did they 

do it?  This was -- Justice Scalia, you tried really 

hard to get them just to admit, let's just acknowledge 

what the point is here.  And the State tries to deny 

that the purpose here is to limit the information 

getting into the hands of the doctor.  We don't have to 

rely on the State's lawyers.  The State legislature was

very helpful here.

 So if we go to the appendix of the IMS brief 

now, page 1a, okay.  Right at the top, the State says 

their goal is -- this is finding number 1 at the bottom 

of it -- containing health care costs.

 Then in finding number 2 they explain why 

they did it:  "There is a strong link between 

pharmaceutical marketing activities, health care 

spending and the health of Vermonters."

 Then finding number 3:  "The goals of 

marketing programs are often in conflict with the goals 

of the State."

 And my favorite, obviously, is number 4: 

"The marketplace for ideas on medicine safety, the State 

determined, was operating in conflict with the goals of 

the State."  They didn't like the marketplace of ideas.

 Now, it is true, we acknowledge, that 

another thing the State wanted to do was to give the 

doctors some more control.  It's in -- it's in -- there 

is an opt-out option.

 But can I just take you to how the State 

explained what it was doing?  That's just going to be on 

page 7.  Now, the State's lawyer and the Solicitor 

General have explained to you that they believe that 

doctors were concerned only with marketing and only with

marketing to them.  That's not true.  Finding 29.  We 

have to go all the way to number 29 to get to this goal 

of the State:  "Health care professionals in Vermont" -­

I'm on page 7:  "Health care professionals in Vermont 

who write prescriptions for their patients have a 

reasonable expectation that the information in that 

prescription, including their own identity and that of 

the patient, will not be used for purposes other than 

the filling and processing of the payment for that 

prescription."

 It's not just about pharmaceutical 

marketing.  The doctors say -- we all love this; there's 

stuff about us in our daily lives that we wish was 

entirely private.  The doctors here said:  Hey, it would 

be great for us if this information, we had complete 

control over it.  Doctors also would love if medical 

malpractice judgments weren't broadly known.  There are 

all kinds of government records they would prefer not to 

be out into the public sphere.

 But then we ask ourselves, all right -- and 

that's why I asked you to have this brief available -­

what did the State do?  Did the State in fact enact a 

general privacy provision?  Is it like HIPAA or instead 

is all that the State did here target the use for 

marketing, while it allows the use of the same data for

the opposite message by insurers and also by the 

government?

 So here's the statute.  It appears on page 9 

of the appendix.  I want to start with subsection A 

because the State helpfully reiterates its goals here. 

The second half of this paragraph:  "The State sought to 

ensure costs are contained in the private health care 

sector, as well as for State purchasers of prescription 

drugs, through the promotion of less costly drugs and 

ensuring prescribers received unbiased information." 

That's what they're trying to do.  They're trying to 

say:  We would like the drug companies to have a harder 

time finding the doctors while the insurance companies 

and the State have an easy time finding the doctors.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But there is another 

interest here besides the State's concern about health 

care costs, and that is the physician's privacy 

interests.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can sell this 

information to whomever you want, right?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You could sell to it 

a journalist who wants to expose physicians in a 

particular area who prescribe a lot of a particular

medication.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the public can 

discern well, this is the guy who is treating these 

people; we don't like these people, so we're going to 

Pickett outside his clinic.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, nothing 

prevents you from doing that, right?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, don't you 

think that's protecting physicians' privacy, to prevent 

that from happening?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Oh, I apologize.  We're 

allowed to do it before and after the statute, is my 

point.  Remember, what the statute does is -- and this 

was the debate that Justice Alito tried to point us to 

about what the statute actually does and the Second 

Circuit, what it understood the statute to mean.  And I 

should also say the cert petition didn't say that there 

was a problem with that.

 Vermont picked out one thing.  It said: 

Look, when drug companies can find the doctors easily, 

they can persuade the doctors to use more expensive 

drugs.  We pay a lot for drugs.  We would prefer that

not happen, so we're going to make it harder.  And the 

State will have its counter-detailing program, it will 

have its drug utilization review program, and insurers 

will advocate for less expensive drugs.  All the other 

uses are still permitted.

 If Vermont were serious about protecting the 

doctors' privacy, as opposed to kind of a, a right of 

publicity, a control over information about them, it 

wouldn't have all these exemptions; it would have a 

provision that says this is private information.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right, suppose -­

suppose that the Federal Trade Commission after a 3-year 

study of pharmaceutical manufacturing practices, decides 

-- finds the following.  They say:  We have found that 

when drugs are sold to doctors it is very important that 

the doctor find out what's curable, what the drug does, 

how much it costs; and by the way, all those things 

apply no matter who the doctor is.  Who the doctor is, 

is irrelevant.  And therefore marketing that focuses 

upon who the doctor is and what his previous practices 

were is irrelevant and harmful and false; and therefore 

we find that it is a false and deceptive practice under 

section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to use the 

following prior practices of the doctor in selling him 

new drugs, because it's irrelevant and because it's

false and because it's harmful.  And they enact that as 

a -- as a rule of the Federal Trade Commission.

 Does the Constitution of the United States 

forbid them, having made those findings in detail, from 

controlling advertising to prevent what they have 

determined is a false and misleading practice?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I do know -- I don't know, 

but I do know the First Amendment applies to the rule.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, nobody says it doesn't 

apply.  The question -­

they're saying for the present purposes.  I'm 

interested, surprisingly enough, in what I'm saying.

to know the answer.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.

industry.

doing that?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I am, but I'm also going to

And what we like -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You state the true facts 

only on one side and not the other.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  This case has not been 

argued as a case restricting false advertising, has it?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, it's a case about 

restricting true advertising.

 Justice Breyer, can I just make one point 

really quick?  And that is, you dissented in Thompson v. 

Western States and your dissent in that case says these 

are drugs, the compounded drugs that have not been 

approved by the FDA, and I'm very concerned that you're 

evading the FDA regulatory requirements about truthful 

advertising.

 These are the opposite drugs.  These are the 

drugs that all the messages that are being conveyed here 

have been preapproved by the FDA.  This is truthful and 

accurate speech, and the State only wants one side of 

the debate to get out.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's where I was going.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.

beyond your case.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's why it's called a

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But that's why I wondered 

how you would respond to that.  So -- I thought that was 

one that was going to be obviously constitutional, but 

you're going to stop me there.  So -- so what I want to 

say -­

different?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- is how is this 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And I suppose I don't know 

the extent to which this does or does not promote 

unbiased information from going to the doctors, and 

isn't that a matter for the doctors themselves and the 

Vermont legislature rather than this Court to decide?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.  A couple of things 

about that.  First, as I said, these are messages that 

have been cleared by the experts.  The FDA has to review 

all the detailing communications.

 Second, the doctors do get to say:  I don't 

want you to come visit me.  They do that all the time. 

My dad's a doctor; he doesn't visit with detailers.

This is instead a rule about whether you can talk 

about -- about someone, not talk to someone.

 The drug companies and the intermediaries 

are talking about drug -- about prescriber practices, 

and you can decide who you want to try and approach. 

There's nothing alleged to be false or misleading.

 Third, the way the First Amendment works in 

the marketplace of ideas that so upsets Vermont is that 

both sides get to tell their story, right?  The thing 

that is supposed to be biased here is that the drug 

companies have too much money.  That is not a basis for 

restricting speech.

 The way it works is if the message is 

accurate, as the FDA has determined it to be, the drug 

companies can go make their pitch.  Vermont can come 

along and make the opposite pitch.  Terrific.  So can 

insurance companies.

 But what you can't do is have a rule that 

says one side is going to have a much harder time 

getting to their audience.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Goldstein, I -- I 

understand your argument and I have a difficulty.  Today 

with the Internet and with computers, there's virtually 

no privacy individuals have.  Any transaction you do 

could be spread across the world instantaneously, and

for the longest time catalogs would sell your name and 

address to other catalogers, and if you bought one 

product from one company, you would get a thousand 

catalogs from 50 million others.

 Today the industry is policing that, in part 

to get the State not to intercede, by giving you an 

opt-out option.  And so, if you're a consumer who 

doesn't want a million catalogs, the industry is giving 

you the right to opt out, so they don't sell your 

address.

 If there is, as I see, some interest that 

the State legitimately has in protecting that part of 

the public who says, I entered into this transaction, I 

didn't really want you to sell my name, I didn't want 

you to do other things with it, all I did was this 

transaction, why can't the State say -- there is a 

difference in my mind between an opt-in and opt-out? 

Why can't the State say, your desire to enter a 

transaction in which you're doing just that transaction 

and not others is something we can protect?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It can.  And let me explain 

why it is that that rule -- and let me typify it for 

you.  There is a pending bill in the Congress called the 

McCain-Kerry Consumer Protection Act and it does what 

you're talking about.  It says we're not just going to

leave it to the industry; we're going to have a set of 

governmental rules.

 Let me distinguish that bill from what goes 

on under Act 80.  What that says is that if you are a 

consumer and you engage in a transaction, you have the 

right to opt out of any unauthorized uses, because it's 

just between you and the business, right?

 So there are three differences between that 

and this.  The first is the structure of the statute. 

That's not what this statute does.  This statute says 

every use of the information is just fine, except this 

one, this one that allows one speaker who we don't 

really like to go out and convey its message.

 The second difference is the public 

importance of the speech involved.  What that consumer 

information would be used for is to make some random 

consumer pitch to you or about you.  This is information 

about lifesaving medications where the detailer goes in 

and talks about double blind scientific studies that are 

responsible for the development of drugs that have 

caused 40 percent of the increase in the lifespan of the 

American public.  So there's a tremendous difference in 

the public importance.

 The third is the fundamentally different 

nature of the privacy interest.  Unlike your consumer

transaction over the Internet, this is a doctor.  You 

can call up any doctor's office and find out what their 

prescribing practice is.  It's part of their business.

 Imagine the following conversation, if you 

will, and that is, and -- and if you want to look for a 

place in the common law where this comes from, it would 

be section 652D of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, 

what things are private and what aren't.  It asks 

whether a reasonable person would be outraged.

 If one doctor were to say to another one, 

you know what, Dr. Smith told people that three out of 

four times I prescribe Aciphex for -- as a proton pump 

inhibitor, would anybody be outraged about that?  No. 

But if you knew that the -- the company that you bought 

from on the Internet was selling that information or if 

they were giving away private medical information, you 

would genuinely be outraged.

 So, Justice Sotomayor, the reason I started 

this argument about it has to end up in the middle is we 

know that statutes like that have to be constitutional. 

At the same time, we know that the government can use 

controls over information to really distort speech.  So 

the question is, what happens in this statute?  And this 

statute has a structure that's not intended to protect 

privacy.  It would look totally different.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I read in one of the 

briefs that pharmacies were not permitting either 

patients and/or doctors to opt out; that if a patient 

came in and said I don't want my doctor's information 

sold, or a doctor has called the pharmacy and said, I 

don't want you to sell my information, the pharmacies 

are not respecting those limitations.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why don't I read this 

statute as simply doing what the consumer statutes are 

doing, which is giving people some control outside of 

the limited transaction that they're engaged in?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.  A couple of things. 

Remember, the patients have nothing to do with this. 

The State doesn't give any control to the patient.  That 

would be true before or after.  So we're talking about 

the doctors.

 I -- I did concede, when I read you finding 

29 at page 7 of the appendix, that this does give a 

little bit more control to the doctor.  I mean, it just 

does.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I stop you?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.

doesn't give the patient any control.  But the patient

is already taken care of by the Federal law.  You can't 

-- I mean, the patient is protected.  The question is 

whether the physician should be as well.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I agree, Justice Ginsburg. 

Justice Sotomayor in her question to me said, why don't 

I read this as giving -- she said that they aren't 

giving patients options about what happens with this 

prescription information.  My only point was this 

statute doesn't change it.

 You're quite right that our -- our position 

is no threat to the protection of private health 

information, which is reasonably regarded as extremely 

confidential.  So, on the question of whether it give 

some greater control, it does.  But what -- the thing 

you have to focus on here is the line that it draws in 

when it gives greater control is a line that's intended 

to discriminate against a speaker.

 You have to look, take -- I'll give you an 

example of this, Cincinnati v. Discovery Network.  The 

City of Cincinnati came to you and said, look, we've 

eliminated the commercial news racks, and these people 

who want to sell their commercial stuff should use 

something other than news racks.  We're targeting the 

blight that comes from commercial news racks.  This

(Laughter.)

it out right now, but for later.  The brief of the 

National Association of Chain Drugstores, if you just 

make a reference, on pages 10 to 11 collects the history 

of how this information has been gathered.  And they 

make the point that the Court did in the first 30 

minutes, that of course the doctor is going to put his 

name on the prescription.  We have to be able to call 

the doctor and say:  I can't read your handwriting.

sell the information to anybody; it must remain with the 

pharmacy.

must be given to the State of Vermont.  The State of 

Vermont then has the same restrictions that this statute

the -- it would be almost LAPD.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And what -- and I want to 

know what your answer would be.  If LAPD is correct -­

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then what ruling would we 

have to make in my hypothetical case?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.  If it's in the hands 

of the -- so let me just make sure I am on the same 

page.  I am going to answer your question directly.

 The pharmacy can't disclose it directly to 

anyone else.  The government gets a copy of it.  That 

does not make it LAPD.  If the pharmacy was government­

owned, that would be LAPD.  Now, let me answer your 

hypothetical.  Right?  LAPD, it was an arrest record, it 

was in the hands only of the State.  The Court said: 

Look, this is the State's information.  Justice 

Ginsburg's concurrence says:  It's like a subsidy, the 

decision whether to give it out or not.

 Now, in your hypothetical, which is it is in 

a private hand, but it is banned for any other use -­

that would be a real privacy statute.  I think that it 

would still be unconstitutional, but it would be much 

closer.

 The reason it might be unconstitutional is 

twofold.  First, that the privacy interest in it I think

is not very significant, because it's how the doctor 

runs his or her business, and second it would still 

allow the discrimination.  If you were convinced in your 

hypothetical that what Vermont was trying to do is what 

it said it was doing here in its findings, and that is, 

to make it harder for the drug companies to reach the 

audience and make it easier for the insurance company 

and the government to reach their audience, Greater New 

Orleans Broadcasting, which involves a ban on private 

casino speech but not tribal and governmental speech, 

says discriminating against speakers like that is very 

troubling.  So that's I think how your hypothetical -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what you're saying I 

think to Justice Kennedy is answering my earlier 

question by saying the State cannot constitutionally 

stop the spread of information.  So if the State said to 

the pharmacy, all you can do is fill the prescription, 

that's what doctors think pharmacies are doing, and 

that's all you can do, you're saying that's 

unconstitutional?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I am saying that that's 

unconstitutional.  I am also saying that the reason is 

very specific to this kind of information, that is that 

it would allow speaker discrimination, and I am also 

saying most emphatically that is not this case.  That

would be a much closer case.  It would look much more 

like a real privacy statute.

 What I would take from the hypothetical is 

not the lesson we should lose -- and you should never 

take that lesson -­

(Laughter.)

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  -- but the -- but instead 

the lesson that that's what's so different about this 

statute.  This statute, as in all the language quoted 

earlier, says Katie bar the door, do whatever you want 

to do with this stuff, just don't do something we 

disagree with when it comes to the message.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you're really -- you 

are really hinging your argument on the discrimination 

aspect -­

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I am -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that --that drug 

companies or detailers are being treated differently 

than any other user of this information?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That is a principal part of 

our argument.  I did say before in describing the 

Kerry-McCain bill, that there were three things, not 

just the discrimination, but the greater public interest 

of the -- the detailer speech and the lower privacy 

interest, so I wouldn't throw those out.

Now can I just preempt an argument that my 

friend from the Vermont -- State of Vermont is going to 

say in her rebuttal?  And that, is she's going to come 

and say that, look, the insurance companies are actually 

paying for the drugs.  All their -- this exception is 

not one that's about advocacy, and I just want to make 

sure we all know ahead of time because I don't get a 

surrebuttal, that that's not accurate.

 So if -- if you still have the IMS brief 

with you at page 53 this time, so at page 53 the first 

paragraph is about the State's own use of this 

information for a variety of purposes.  There is -- the 

reply brief for the State introduces a debate about 

today whether they are using the NPI data for 

counter-detailing.  There is no dispute that they use it 

for other State programs, like the drug utilization 

program -- that's the quotes in the first paragraph. 

But the better paragraph is going to be -- it's the 

second paragraph, it starts, the State -- "the statute's 

parallel formulary compliance exemption."  And this 

paragraph talks about advocacy by the insurance 

companies.  So it's not just that the drug -- insurance 

company says to the doctor, I'll pay for -- $5 for this 

drug, but the insurance companies take PI data under the 

exemption in the statute, go to doctors and say we

really think this cheaper drug would be better.  That is 

straight-out speaker discrimination.

 So we quote Kolassa:  "Insurance companies 

are using physician-identifiable information to call 

physicians to try to get them to comply with 

formularies, to try to get them to change their 

prescribing in a way that may or may not be in the 

patient's best interests.  In just" -- this is a further 

quote -- "In just the last couple of years there has 

been an amazing increase in the amount of information 

provided by payers, insurers that will send scientific 

documents to physicians" -- I've rolled over to page 

53 -- "will call when physicians are prescribing too 

much or too little of a product and provide them with 

information."  It goes on and on -- "virtually several 

times a day."

 So that is the message that I would take 

away from the argument, and that is we are emphatically 

in favor of the constitutionality of HIPAA, of the 

McCain-Kerry bill, the things that concerned you.  You 

have to decide this case in the middle about what 

Vermont actually did, and it was unbelievably candid 

about what it was trying to do.  It said the marketplace 

of ideas doesn't work for us, and so it designed a 

statute -- and you can decide this case very narrowly on

the ground that what Vermont did is it went too far is 

in just saying we're not actually trying to protect 

privacy; what we're trying to do is give the doctors 

control when it suits our own best interests.

 I do want to preempt one other last 

argument, and that is the suggestion that this isn't 

paternalistic at all.  Right?  We just let the doctors 

decide.  But the State's goal, what the State is trying 

to do, is paternalistic.  The reason the State picked 

this one exemption, the reason it picked between these 

speakers, is because it doesn't want this message to get 

to the doctors.  And if you can keep -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  It used to be true there 

was something called a regulated industry.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And selling was within 

activity among many.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.

regulations that could be imposed upon selling.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure, right.

those should be reexamined?

argument that was made and rejected in Virginia Board of 

Pharmacy which was about a pharmacy rule.  They said 

that it would be unprofessional.  Then the Solicitor 

General in the person of Mr. Kneedler came you to in 

Thompson v. Western States and said we need to stop this 

compounded drug marketing because this is heavily 

regulated; this is a closed market, and the Court said, 

I'm sorry, no.  The nature of a marketplace of ideas is 

you get to say your piece and the other side gets to say 

their piece.  The FDA heavily regulates this area, the 

information is perfectly accurate and it's incredibly 

valuable.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You would have no 

objection I take it, if there were not the academic 

exception and if the State didn't -- didn't push its own 

contrary program?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We would have much less of 

an objection, and that's no accident.  Let me just say 

this is not a flaw in the drafting.  The State really 

wanted to push its counter message, and thankfully so. 

This government has a real interest here.  Insurers have 

a real interest here, but so does the other side of the 

debate, and what the State doesn't get to do is just 

pick sides and prevent the debate from happening.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  Yes.

more often because it tells you a lot about his 

practice -­

Kennedy's hypothetical, and I don't think the Court has 

to confront whether such a statute would be 

constitutional because it would be very different.

what Justice Kennedy said?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.  He said the rule is 

the pharmacy can't give it to anybody.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Who's -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  How about the pharmacy can't

government has nearly as much interest in 

commercialization as it does in actual privacy.  Section 

652D of the restatement of torts doesn't talk about the 

outrage of being able to use -- we have a capitalist 

economy, and we sell newspapers and books and that sort 

of thing.  Commercialization isn't a bad thing.  It's a 

question of whether privacy is genuinely protected.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you do it -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's not exactly not this 

case but just in the abstract, do we have a rule that if 

there are two statutes, A, the statute is passed for a 

bad purpose, B, the statute is not passed for a bad 

purpose, if the statute is otherwise the same, are they 

both unconstitutional or just one and why?  And what 

case do I look to other than maybe Church of Lukumi?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  You look to -- yes, we 

win -- Thompson v. Western States.  Remember what the 

government's argument there was:  If you allow the 

marketing of compounded drugs that are not FDA approved 

you will evade the very important FDA regulatory 

program.  That was a perfectly important rationale, and 

the Court said but it also has the purpose of keeping 

information out of the hands of doctors.  It's 

unconstitutional.

Minneapolis Star and -- Raglan -- those are cases about 

taxing the instruments of communication.  So a tax on 

newsprint, a tax on ink; and the Court said we're not 

worried about your bad motive, you have a very important 

rationale in trying to raise revenue, that's a perfectly 

valid purpose; but what you're also doing is you're 

picking out the press and you're making it harder to 

speak; it's unconstitutional.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This -- this is, Mr. 

Kneedler explained this is the government's information. 

Why can't -- you wouldn't have to have it if it weren't 

prescription.  It was the fact that it has to be 

prescribed that requires this information.  The 

government frequently controls the use to which 

information can be put.  It makes me file a tax return, 

and it doesn't allow, you know, dissemination of that. 

It restricts it.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.

could say that if an accountant prepares my tax return, 

that accountant can't sell it, either.

puzzle.  The first is why can't I demand it from the 

IRS?  Okay?  And second is going to be why can't the 

accountant give it away?  The first one is LAPD, and 

it's the same true -- the same thing is true of campaign 

finance reports.  The government has plenary authority; 

when you give information to the government, what the 

government then does with the information.

 The important lesson to be derived from LAPD 

is that nine members of the Court seemingly agreed -­

and I defended the statute in that case -- nine members 

of the court in that case agreed that if this had been 

private reports rather than the government's reports, 

then the statute would have been unconstitutional.

 The reason your tax preparer can't give it 

away, the reason I can't give away attorney-client 

secrets, the reason that the government is going to be 

able to tell Internet companies that they can't give 

await the consumer information is that it's really 

private.  But what if, instead, the government had a 

rule that says tax preparers can't give out tax 

information when it will encourage people to protest 

against their taxes?  But if it will encourage people to 

comply with their taxes, it's perfectly fine.  You can't 

draw lines that are intended to discriminate against 

speakers.  That's the main principle of our case.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIDGET C. ASAY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MS. ASAY:  I would like to begin with the 

point that my friend was making about the use of the 

information by insurance companies.  Insurers are not 

similarly situated to pharmaceutical manufacturers. 

Insurers receive information directly from doctors and 

parents in the ordinary course of their business and 

they use it as part of providing and paying for care to 

patients.

 And when my friend described the fact that 

insurers do that with doctors' information as speaker 

discrimination, I would like to point out that -- the -­

not only the record but the examples, for example, that 

PhRMA points to on page 126 their brief show that 

insurers have patient information for that purpose as 

well.  HIPAA allows those uses of both patient and 

prescriber information to manage benefits.

 So, to argue that pharmaceutical 

manufacturers are being discriminated against if they 

don't have access to the same health care information 

that we provide to our insurance companies would -­

would begin to raise serious questions about a statute 

like HIPAA.  And that -- that just highlights that in 

this area of -- of private information and information 

control that many of these statutes are structured in 

such a way that there are expected and intended and 

permissible uses of information, and other uses for 

which people are allowed to have control over the 

further use of their information.  And here we're 

talking about the control allotted to doctors.

 We place an enormous amount of trust in 

doctors to make the right treatment decisions for their 

patients.  Part of their ability to make that, those 

decisions depends on the information that they receive. 

And what doctors have said to the Vermont legislature 

and to the Court in this case is that many of them find 

this practice objectionable and that it is not helpful 

to them or to their patients to have their information 

monitored for this marketing purpose.  And all that they 

have asked for is the right to object.  And I would like 

to -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Asay, I want to 

give you the chance to respond to a point that was 

highlighted by your friend, which is the fourth 

legislative finding, which does seem to say that the 

State is doing this because it doesn't like an imbalance

in the marketplace of ideas.

 MS. ASAY:  Thank you, Your Honor.

 The findings, first of all, have to be taken 

as they were adopted, which was in support of not this 

statute even as it was written, but as a much larger 

bill that contained many sections, including a provision 

that created the evidence based education program which 

is a -- a clinical -- a -- a program to provide 

voluntary education to doctors, and to the statute as it 

used to be written, which -- which not only had this 

provision for the doctors' choice and the use of the 

information, but also mandated that pharmaceutical 

detailers provide information affirmatively as part of 

the marketing process.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do we have -- were 

there -- were there findings with respect to the statute 

as enacted?

 MS. ASAY:  There are no findings that 

accompany the amendment that resulted in this statute.

 And to -- to return to, I think Justice 

Kennedy's point from earlier, the statute, I think, has 

to stand or fall on the restriction that it -- that it 

allows for doctors.  The Court, for example, in O'Brien 

discussed the fact that striking down a statute because 

the court disagreed with the record would -- would

simply mean that the legislature could adopt the same 

statute again on a different record.

 We would say here that what -- what's -- the 

question before the Court really is, may doctors have 

this opportunity to control the use of their information 

about -- their nonpublic information about their 

prescribing practices as a marketing tool or not, and 

that -- that -- that should be the -- the focus of the 

Court's inquiry.

 I would also like to just return to the 

point that -- that I believe I was making earlier that 

this statute is so different from the cases in which the 

Court has considered restrictions on the direct 

commercial advertising and the provision of information 

to the public.

 This is an entirely nonpublic commercial 

transmission of data.  It -- it starts with a private 

commercial transaction, it's a private commercial 

exchange between the data vendors and the pharmacies. 

It's used in a way that it is never disclosed publicly, 

never included in the advertising message.  There's no 

restriction here on the information that's provided to 

doctors.  The truthful information that the FDA permits 

to be provided about prescription drugs.  And there's no 

restriction on any exchange between a willing listener

and a willing speaker.

 I believe my friend suggested that -- that 

anyone could call a doctor's office and find out by 

asking what the doctor prescribed.  Pharmaceutical 

manufacturers can do that as well.  And if the doctor 

volunteers that information, there can be that exchange 

of information.  The statute does not restrict it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I take it there's -­

there's -- it's against the law for a physician to say I 

want you to fill this prescription in a particular 

place, a particular pharmacy because I know that 

pharmacy doesn't sell the information.  They can't do 

that, can they?

 MS. ASAY:  I don't believe they can, Your 

Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

Counsel.  The case is submitted.
