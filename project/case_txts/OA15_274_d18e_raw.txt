CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

this  morning  in  Case  15­274,  Whole  Woman's  Health  v.

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  STEPHANIE  TOTI 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  Texas  requirements  undermine  the  careful 

 

 

 

 

 

balance  struck  in  Casey  between  States'  legitimate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interests  in  regulating  abortion  and  women's  fundamental 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liberty  to  make  personal  decisions  about  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pregnancies.  They  are  unnecessary  health  regulations 

  

 

 

 

 

that  create  substantial  obstacles  to  abortion  access. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Ms.  Toti,  there  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

preliminary  question  ­­ would  you  address  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  claim  is  precluded.  And  let's  take  first  the  claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  in  the  prior  litigation.  Let's  assume  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  separate  claims,  or  let's  take  the  admitting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

privileges.  That  was  argued  and  decided.  Why  isn't  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

precluded? 

            

MS.  TOTI:  Your  Honor,  it's  not  precluded 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because  material  facts  relevant  to  the  claim  developed

subsequent  to  entry  of  judgment  in  the  Abbott  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  you  could  have 

  

 

 

 

 

amended  ­­ you  could  have  asked  for  supplemental 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefing.  I  mean,  the  new  action  is  filed  six  days 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  the  Supreme  Court  issues  its  decision  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  You  could  have  asked  for  supplemental  briefing? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  In  Abbott  the  plaintiffs  brought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  new  facts  to  the  attention  of  the  court  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals.  The  court  of  appeals  said  that  it  would  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider  evidence  in  the  trial  record  in  rendering  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision,  and  it  held  that  the  evidence  in  the  trial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  was  speculative,  that  there  wasn't  a  sufficient 

   

 

 

 

 

 

basis  to  conclude  that  any  doctor  would  be  unable  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtain  admitting  privileges,  or  that  any  clinic  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forced  to  close  as  a  result  of  the  admitting  privileges 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  But  you're  asking  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  made  allegations  concerning  those  same  claims.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  is  your  argument  that  when  you  have  allegations  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  facial  challenge  and  a  facial  challenge  is  resolved 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  you,  that  all  you  have  to  do  is  come  up  with  new 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  and  then  you  can  start  over  again? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  No,  Your  Honor.  The  ­­ the  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  evidence  must  be  material,  and  it  must  be  newly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

developed.  So  newly  discovered  evidence  wouldn't  be

sufficient.  If  it  was  evidence  that  was  available  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  time  of  the  first  suit,  but  the  plaintiffs  merely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hadn't  discovered  the  evidence  or  didn't  bring  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forward,  that  wouldn't  provide  the  basis  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsequent  suit.  But  evidence  that  develops  after 

  

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  in  the  first  suit  that  is  material  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  does  provide  sufficient  basis  for  a  ­­ a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

second  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  what's  this  key  new 

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidence? 

            

MS.  TOTI:  The  ­­ the  evidence  is  the  clinic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closures  that  resulted  from  enforcement  ­­ actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  of  the  admitting­privileges  requirement.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  first  suit  was  a  pre­enforcement  challenge. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  was  before  the  law  took  effect,  and  the  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concluded  that  there  was  not  sufficient  evidence  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  doctor  would  actually  be  unable  to  obtain  admitting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

privileges,  or  that  any  clinic  would  actually  close. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  there  is  very  little 

  

 

 

 

 

 

specific  evidence  in  the  record  in  this  case  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  why  any  particular  clinic  closed.  Basically, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  argument  is  that  the  law  took  effect,  and  after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  point,  there  was  a  decrease  in  the  number  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinics. 

            

So  suppose  you  win  here,  and  the  State  then

examines  what  happened  in  each  of  these  clinics  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  up  with  evidence  showing  that  in  quite  a  few 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instances,  the  closure  was  due  to  other  factors.  And  so

they  would  be  able  to  make  the  same  argument  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making  now.  Is  that  correct? 

  

 

 

 

            

            

            

MS.  TOTI:  No,  Your  Honor.  And  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What's  the  difference? 

  

 

 

 

MS.  TOTI:  Well,  first  of  all,  the  State  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  opportunity  to  bring  forward  evidence  in  this  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  reasons  why  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Was  it  that  ­­ was  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  burden? 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  No,  Your  Honor.  Not  in  the  first 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance,  but  the  plaintiffs  came  forward  with  evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  ­­ and  the  State  did  not  offer  anything  to  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rebut  the  evidence,  which  was  more  than  sufficient  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

support  the  district  court's  finding  that  HB2  was  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cause  of  the  clinic  closures. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  ­­ what 

  

 

 

 

 

evidence  is  that? 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  There  are  a  couple  of  things,

Your  Honor.  Prior  to  HB2,  in  ­­ in  the  five  years  prior 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  HB2,  the  number  of  clinics  in  the  State  remained 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fairly  stable.  In  any  given  year,  there  may  have  been  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one­ to  two­clinic  variance.  Following  the  enactment  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

HB2,  more  than  20  clinics  closed  within  a  very  short 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period  of  time.  The  timing  of  the  closures  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What? 

  

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  ­­ alone  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I'm  sorry.  Yeah. 

  

  

 

 

 

What  is  the  evidence  in  the  record  that  the  closures  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

related  to  the  legislation? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  The  ­­ the  ­­ the  timing  is  part 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  evidence,  Your  Honor,  and  the  testimony  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  about  the  reasons  why  their  clinics  closed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  that  the  plaintiffs  testified  that  clinics  closed  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anticipation  of  enforcement  in  some  cases,  and  in  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  because  of  actual  enforcement  of  the  requirements. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Can  we  go  on  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

second  piece;  that  is,  the  ambulatory  surgical  centers? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  was  not  part  of  the  last  case.  And  your  position 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  that  is  that  that  is  a  discrete  claim,  so  it's  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

barred  by  a  claim  preclusion. 

   

 

 

            

Is  that  ­­ is  that  your  position? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  Yes.  That's  correct.  And  the 

  

  

  

 

 

 

claims  against  the  ASC  requirement  weren't  ripe  at  the

time  that  the  Abbott  case  was  filed,  because  the  final 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implementing  regulations  for  that  statutory  requirement 

 

 

 

 

 

hadn't  yet  been  adopted. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  certainly  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

Federal  system,  and  I  assume  in  many  States  as  well, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  sometimes  take  years  to  promulgate.  I  don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

know  of  any  rule  that  says  we  have  to  wait  for  regular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ regulations  to  be  promulgated  unless  it's  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unanticipated.  And  the  key  objections  you're  making 

  

 

 

 

 

 

were  clear  in  the  statute,  anyway. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  I  would  disagree  that  ­­ that  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent  of  the  burden  that  the  law  would  impose  was  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  face  of  the  statute.  Until  those  implementing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulations  were  adopted  ­­ and  the  statute  provided  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deadline  for  the  adoption  of  those  regulations  ­­ until 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  adopted,  the  plaintiffs  couldn't  have  known 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  waivers  or  grandfathering  would  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permitted.  And  if  waivers  or  grandfathering  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

permitted,  as  they  have  been  in  every  other  ASC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  that's  been  adopted  for  abortion  providers, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  burdens  would  have  been  much  less,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  would  have  first  attempted  to  get  licensed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  seek  appropriate  waivers  before  filing  their  suit.

separately  challenge  the  admitting­privilege  provision 

 

 

 

 

and  the  ASC  provision? 

 

 

 

            

those  ­­

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  Because 

  

  

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  if  you  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

separately  challenge  them,  if  you  challenge  just  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitting­privileges  provision,  how  would  you  factor 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ presumably,  you  would  have  to  assume  that  the  ASC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  was  not  under  challenge.  So  in  assessing  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden,  you  would  look  at  just  the  admission  privilege. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  vice  versa,  if  you're  challenging  just  the  ASC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separately,  you'd  have  to  assume  you'd  assess  the  burden 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solely  caused  by  that  provision. 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

 

It  seems  to  me  the  separation  of  the  two 

 

 

 

 

provisions  makes  ­­ would  make  your  case  much  harder. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  I  ­­ I  would  disagree  with  that, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor,  because  each  of  these  requirements  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extremely  burdensome  on  its  own.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

admitting­privileges  requirement,  which  is  partially  in 

 

 

 

 

 

effect,  has  been  responsible  for  the  closure  of  nearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

half  of  all  the  abortion  facilities  in  Texas  to  date. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  ASC  requirement,  if  it  took  effect,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondents  have  stipulated  that  it  would  close  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remaining  licensed  abortion  facility  that  was  able  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comply  with  the  admitting­privileges  requirement.

So  independently,  each  requirement  is 

 

 

 

 

extremely  burdensome;  and  ­­ and  collectively,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one­two  punch  of  these  requirements  would  be  responsible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  ­­ the  closure  of  nearly  30  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  I  think  the  Chief 

   

  

 

 

 

Justice  asked  ­­ I  don't  want  to  take  words  out  of  his 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mouth  ­­ but  I  think  the  question  was,  one  of  the  two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lines  that's  been  asked,  is  that  in  the  district  opinion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  page  7,  the  district  court  has  said  that  if  the  ASC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulation  goes  into  effect,  there  will  be  one  facility 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left  in  Austin,  two  in  Dallas,  one  in  Fort  Worth,  two  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Houston,  and  either  one  or  two  in  San  Antonio.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  that,  he  said  that  the  enforcement  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appointment  privileges,  the  privileges  of  admission, 

 

 

 

 

 

would  reduce  the  number  from  20  down  to  about  ­­ from  40 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down  to  about  20. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  I  think  the  question  was,  what  evidence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

did  those  findings  rest  upon?  As  you've  heard,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  side,  I  think,  say  there  is  no  such  evidence,  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  of  appeals  said  there  is  no  such  evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  can  you  give  a  brief  account  or  page 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

numbers  that  will  show  that  those  findings,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diminishment  of  the  number  from  about  40  to  about  eight, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  what  the  district  court  found,  rested  upon  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence?  What  was  that  evidence?

MS.  TOTI:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  So  initially, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

20  clinics  closed  in  the  wake  of  HB2.  Eight  closed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prior  to  initial  enforcement  of  the  admitting­privileges 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement,  and  11  closed  on  the  day  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitting­privileges  requirement  first  took  effect. 

 

 

 

 

            

Respondents  quibble  with  the  evidence 

 

 

 

 

concerning  the  first  eight.  Even  if  we  ­­ and  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  basis  in  the  record  for  the  district  court  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infer  that  those  eight  closed  for  the  same  reasons  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  the  others,  but  even  if  we  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Where  ­­ I'm  sorry 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  interrupt  you.  Where  in  the  record  is  that  evidence? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  Your  Honor,  I  can  provide 

   

  

 

 

 

specific  pin  sites  during  my  rebuttal,  but  the  evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  in  the  plaintiffs'  testimony  about  the  reasons  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  clinics  closed. 

 

 

            

Each  of  the  plaintiffs'  class  testified  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  clinics  closed  either  in  anticipation  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforcement  of  these  requirements,  knowing  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  clinic  would  not  be  able  to  continue  operating  once 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  requirements  took  effect,  and  as  a  result  of  that, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

either  they  needed  to  move  resources  to  remaining 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinics  to  ensure  that  some  clinics  would  continue  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operate  in  the  State  ­­

JUSTICE  ALITO:  As  to  how  many,  of  the  total 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  claim  closed,  do  you  have  direct  evidence  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reason  for  the  closure? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  Well,  11  of  them,  Your  Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

closed  on  the  day  that  the  admitting  privileges  took 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Yeah.  And  as  to  how  many  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  many  are  you  claiming  total  closed  as  a  result  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  law? 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  To  ­­ to  date,  roughly  20  clinics 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  closed. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  And  of  the  20,  how  ­­ as  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how  many  do  you  have  direct  evidence? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  I  ­­ approximately  12,  Your 

    

 

 

 

 

Honor,  direct  evidence. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Because  if  ­­ if  you  go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  this  ­­ now  we're  not  talking  about  a  huge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  facilities.  I  really  don't  understand  why  you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  not  have  put  in  evidence  about  each  particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinic  and  to  show  why  the  clinic  closed.  And  as  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  of  them,  there  is  ­­ there's  information  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closed  for  reasons  that  had  nothing  to  do  with  this  law.

there  still  would  be  a  substantial  number,  and  enough  to

Parenthood  Center  for  Choice,  Bryan,  Texas.  Is  that  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  ones  you're  talking  about? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  TOTI:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Okay.  There's  a  news 

   

  

  

 

report.  Planned  Parenthood  and  ­­ and  the  Huffington 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Post  reported  that  this  was  closed  as  a  result  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2011  Texas  Women's  Health  Program  bill,  which  cut 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

funding  for  family  planning  services.  It's  not  the  law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we're  talking  about  here. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  Well,  Your  Honor,  that  evidence 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  in  the  record. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  I  understand  that. 

   

  

 

 

And  you  put  quite  a  bit  of  evidence  that's  not  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  in  your  brief.  But  my  point  is  why  is  there  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct  evidence  about  particular  clinics? 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  said  you  had  direct 

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  for  12  clinics  and  you  were  going  to  supply  us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  that  ­­ those  record  citations  later.  That's  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood  you  to  say?

keep  in  mind  here  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Ms.  Toti,  could  I  ­­ could  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

just  make  sure  I  understand  it,  because  you  said  11  were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closed  on  the  day  that  the  admitting­privileges 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  took  effect;  is  that  correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  TOTI:  That's  correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  is  it  right  that  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two­week  period  that  the  ASC  requirement  was  in  effect, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  over  a  dozen  facilities  shut  their  doors,  and  then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  that  was  stayed,  when  that  was  lifted,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reopened  again  immediately;  is  that  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  That  ­­ that  is  correct,  Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  And  ­­ and  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  It's  almost  like  the  perfect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

controlled  experiment  as  to  the  effect  of  the  law,  isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it?  It's  like  you  put  the  law  into  effect,  12  clinics 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closed.  You  take  the  law  out  of  effect,  they  reopen. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  That's  absolutely  correct.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

as  the  State  had  stipulated,  that's  exactly  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  stipulated  would  ­­ would  happen.  And  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  stipulation  is  certainly  direct  evidence  of  ­­ of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  impact  of  the  ASC  requirement. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  The  ­­ the  State,  I  think, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is  going  to  talk  about  the  capacity  of  the  remaining

this  Court  to  remand  for  further  findings  on  clinic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capacity? 

            

MS.  TOTI:  I  don't  think  that's  necessary, 

    

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor.  I  think  there  is  sufficient  evidence  in  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  that  we  have  to  support  the  district  court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finding  that  the  remaining  clinics,  which  would  number 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fewer  than  ten,  don't  have  capacity  to  meet  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statewide  demand  that  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  There  ­­ there  have  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

some  changes,  like  a  ­­ a  major  clinic  ­­ I  don't  quite 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

know  the  adjective  they  use  for  it  ­­ in  San  Antonio. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  there  ­­ suppose  there  were  evidence  that  there  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ a  capacity  and  a  ­­ and  a  capability  to  ­­ to  build 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  kinds  of  clinics,  would  that  be  of  importance? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  then  it  would  show  that  this  law  has  an  effect,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  beneficial  effect  so  far  as  the  legislature  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned. 

            

MS.  TOTI:  If  the  Court  had  any  doubts  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  capacity  of  the  remaining  clinics,  a  remand  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  provide  the  Petitioners  with  ­­ with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opportunity  to  supplement  the  evidence  already  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record.  But  the  evidence  in  the  record  shows  that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supports  the  district  court's  finding  that  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ the  ASC  requirement,  the  costs  of  it  are  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibitive,  it  will  deter  new  clinics  from  opening  to

number  of  ambulatory  surgical  centers  performing 

 

 

 

 

 

abortion  has  increased  by  50  percent  since  this  law  went 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  effect? 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  There  have  ­­ since  this  law  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taken  effect,  three  new  ambulatory  surgery  centers  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opened.  And  there  is  evidence  about  that  at  the  trial, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  trial  court  knew  that  that  was  going  to  happen. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  ­­ the  trial  court  took  that  into  account  in  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making  its  finding.  But  nevertheless,  there  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

substantial  evidence,  including  Texas's  experience  in 

 

 

 

 

 

2003  following  enactment  of  the  ASC  law  for  later 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abortions,  for  post­16­week  abortions,  that  shows  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  market  never  adjusted  and  the  ­­ the  rate  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  those  procedures  occurred  in  Texas  was  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drastically  diminished  following  that  enforcement  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  one  ­­ one  quick

that  I'm  getting  into  my  rebuttal  time,  Your  Honor,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  evidence  in  the  record  about  the  ­­ the  number 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  abortions  that  were  performed  on  an  annual  basis,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

geographic  distribution  of  ­­ of  those  abortions.  Texas 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

collects  those  statistics,  and  those  ­­ those  statistics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  ­­ are  part  of  the  record  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  You  ­­ you  had  ­­ we  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absorbed  so  much  of  your  time  with  the  threshold 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  Perhaps  you  can  ­­ can  she  have  some  time  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

address  the  merits? 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Why  don't  ­­ why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't  you  take  an  extra  five  minutes,  and  we'll  be  sure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  afford  you  rebuttal  time  after  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  fundamentally,  these  laws  impose  heavy 

 

 

 

 

 

burdens  on  abortion  access  that  are  not  medically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justified.  And  for  that  reason,  they  impose  an  undue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden  on  the  right  to  abortion. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Do  you  think  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  rational  basis  for  the  law  based  on  the  benefits  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  legislature  saw? 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  I  do  not,  Your  Honor,  because  ­­

that  claim,  and  ­­ and  we  haven't  preserved  it  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Here  we're  focusing  on  ­­ on  the  undue  burden.  The  ­­

MS.  TOTI:  Because  the  law  actually 

  

 

 

 

 

undermines  the  State's  interest  in  health  rather  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

advancing  it  by  causing  an  increase  in  later  abortions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  self­induced  abortions,  we  wouldn't  concede  that

Honor.  And  in  order  to  determine  whether  a  law  imposes

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  don't  ­­ how  is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that  logical?  I  mean,  the  question  is  whether  there's 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  undue  burden  or  a  substantial  obstacle.  What  ­­ what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  does  it  make  what  the  purpose  behind  the  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  in  assessing  whether  the  burden  is  substantial  or  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  undue?  It  seems  once  you  get  past  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumption  that  the  law  has  a  rational  basis  and  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't  challenged  that,  then  you  look  at  the  burden  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  obstacle.  And  the  purpose  that  the  law  is  directed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to,  I  would  think,  doesn't  make  a  difference.  It's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

either  a  substantial  obstacle  or  an  undue  burden  or  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not. 

            

MS.  TOTI:  In  order  to  determine  whether  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden  is  undue,  Your  Honor,  we  ­­ we  have  to  consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  burden  is  in  relation  to.  In  ­­ in  Casey,  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  in  upholding  the  informed­consent  requirements, 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  first  looked  to  the  ­­ the  State  interests 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  being  served  by  those  requirements  in  ­­ in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  case,  the  State's  interest  in  potential  life,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concluded  that  the  requirements  were  reasonably  designed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  serve  that  purpose  by  making  the  abortion  decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  informed  and  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  thought  the  undue 

    

 

 

 

 

burden  and  substantial  obstacle  went  to  whether  it  was

interest  that's  asserted. 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  Well,  Your  Honor,  it's  ­­ it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

both.  Casey  sought  to  balance  the  State's  legitimate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  in  regulating  abortion  with  the  woman's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental  right  with  her  ­­ her  liberty  to  access  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure,  and  it  ­­ it  concluded  that  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  impose  unwarranted  burdens.  So  where  the  State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  a  good  reason  to  impose  a  restriction  and  that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

restriction  didn't  impose  burdens  that  were  undue,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  restriction  could  stand.  But  where  a  ­­ a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

restriction  is  unreasonable  or,  in  ­­ in  the  language  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Casey,  "medically  unnecessary,"  and  it's  going  to  impose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burdens  on  access  to  abortion,  then  ­­ then  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restriction  cannot  be  sustained  under  the  Fourteenth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Can  I  walk  through  the 

   

  

 

 

 

burden  a  moment?  There's  two  types  of  early  abortion 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

at  ­­ at  play  here.  The  medical  abortion,  that  doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involve  any  hospital  procedure.  A  doctor  prescribes  two 

    

 

 

 

 

 

pills,  and  the  women  take  the  pills  at  home,  correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  Under  Texas  law,  she  must  take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  at  the  facility,  but  ­­ but  that  is  otherwise

MS.  TOTI:  That's  correct,  Your  Honor.

that  travel  time.  How  many  other  States  and  how  many 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  recognized  medical  people  have  testified  or  shown 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  is  any  benefit  from  taking  pills  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facility  as  opposed  to  taking  the  pills  at  home,  as  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case? 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  There  ­­ there  is  ­­ there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely  no  testimony  in  ­­ in  the  record  and  ­­ and

abortion,  and  that  these  burdens  are  also  imposed  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

early  surgical  abortion,  procedures  prior  to  16  weeks. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  as  a  result,  women  are  going  to  be  delayed  later  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pregnancy.  And  there  is  evidence  in  the  record  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following  implementation  of  the  admitting­privileges 

 

 

 

 

requirement,  in  the  six­month  period  following,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  an  increase  in  both  the  number  and  the  proportion  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abortions  being  performed  in  the  second  trimester. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  by  delaying  women's  access  to  abortion, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  requirements  are  actually  increasing  the  risks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  women  face.

lots  of  other  conditions  besides  abortion. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is  there  any  evidence  in  the  record  that

risky  than  the  regular  D&C? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  No,  Your  Honor.  The  evidence  in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  record  shows  that  the  procedures  are  virtually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identical,  particularly  when  D&C  is  performed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complete  a  spontaneous  miscarriage.  So  when  a  woman 

   

   

  

 

 

miscarries  and  then  follows  up  with  her  doctor,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctor  will  typically  perform  a  D&C.  And  that's  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's  virtually  identical  to  an  abortion,  but  it's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  to  the  ­­ the  requirements  of  HB2. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  your  point,  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

taking,  is  that  the  two  main  health  reasons  show  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  law  was  targeted  at  abortion  only?

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  DONALD  B.  VERRILLI,  JR. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

          

FOR  UNITED  STATES,  AS  AMICUS  CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

 

               

SUPPORTING  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

            

The  effects  of  the  Texas  law  at  issue  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case  are  much  more  extreme  than  those  of  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abortion  law  that  this  Court  has  considered  since  Casey. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  law  closes  most  abortion  facilities  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State,  puts  extreme  stress  on  the  few  facilities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  remain  open,  and  exponentially  increases  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obstacles  confronting  women  who  seek  abortions  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State.  And  it  does  all  of  that  on  the  basis  of  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medical  justification  that  cannot  withstand  any 

 

 

 

 

 

meaningful  scrutiny  that  the  American  Medical 

 

 

 

 

 

Association  has  told  you  is  groundless  and  that  the

to  increase  health  risks  to  women  and  not  decrease. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Is  this  true  of  every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

provision  of  the  ­­ of  the  ASC  law?

is  true  about  every  provision  in  the  regulations, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Alito. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Not  the  regulations  ­­ yes, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  regulations. 

 

 

            

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Every  single  provision. 

  

 

 

 

Then  why  was  the  whole  thing  held  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional? 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  I  ­­ I  agree  with  the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

premise  of  Your  Honor's  question.  There  are  some  parts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  regulation  that  I  think,  operating  alone, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't  have  the  substantial  obstacle  effect.  In  fact, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  parts  of  the  regulation  actually  restate  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reauthorize  regulations  that  were  already  on  the  books. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  I  suppose  one  could  say  that  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  that  set  of  regulations,  that  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  could  have  severed  them  under  the  severability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause.  One  could  say  that.  Of  course,  they're  already 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  preexisting  regulations  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  there  are  ­­ there  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  that  go  ­­ that  go  ­­ I  haven't  checked 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everything  as  compared  the  abortion  ­­ the  prior

Under  the  ­­ under  the  ­­ the  old  ­­ the  old 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  there  had  to  be  a  nurse,  but  not  necessarily  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registered  nurse.  Under  the  new  law,  there  has  to  be  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registered  nurse  who  has  a  CPR  certificate.  So  do  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that's  unreasonable  to  say  that  there  has  to  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registered  nurse  who  knows  how  to  do  CPR? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  So  I  ­­ I  don't  want  to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

state  an  opinion  one  way  or  the  other  about  that.  But  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  want  to  ­­ what  I  ­­ but  I  think  ­­ getting  to  the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  of  Your  Honor's  question,  I  think  the  problem  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  confronted  here,  and  I  think  the  reason 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  district  court  acted  reasonably,  despite  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presence  of  the  severability  clause  ­­ and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

severability  clause  provides  an  instruction  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  provision,  every  clause,  every  word,  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application,  every  individual  should  be  severed. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

And  the  problem  is  ­­ the  problem  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  that  the  Court  noted,  I  think,  in  the  Ayotte  case, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  a  court  trying  to  apply  that,  the  court's  got  to  go 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  and  decide  which  collection  of  the  many,  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements  there  ought  to  stand  and  which  shouldn't, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it's  ­­ it's  going  to  be  invading  ­­

problems. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  It's  work,  but  maybe  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  should  have  done  that  work. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  I  read  through  this,  and  I  was 

   

   

 

 

 

surprised.  I  read  through  these  regulations.  I  was 

    

    

 

 

 

surprised  by  how  many  are  completely  innocuous.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  of  them  have  nothing  to  do  ­­ they  have  to  do  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic  safety.  They  don't  even  have  anything  to  do,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular,  with  abortion.  So  the  entrances  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinic  have  to  be  at  grade  level.  You  have  to  have  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elevator.  The  ­­ the  corridors  have  to  be  wide  enough 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  that  you  could  bring  in  a  stretcher  if  somebody  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  taken  to  the  hospital.  And  ­­ and  things  of  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature  ­­

couldn't  have  been  severed  out,  if  there  were  some  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  ­­

in  the  way  that  the  Court  did  in  the  Ayotte  case.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  would  be  appropriate.  But  we  do  think  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  basic  point  remains  that  this  is  a  substantial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

obstacle.

And  I  would  like  to  address  two  points  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

arose  during  Petitioners'  argument.  First,  closures, 

  

 

 

 

 

and  then,  capacity. 

 

 

            

With  respect  to  closures,  here's  where  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  record  will  show  you  taking  the  ASC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  first.  The  13  ­­ there's  a  stipulation,  JA 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

183,  that  all  ­­ all  clinics  that  weren't  already  closed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  result  of  the  admitting­privilege  requirement 

   

 

 

 

 

would  ­­ would  not  be  able  to  meet  the  ASC  requirements; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  therefore,  could  not  ­­ would  have  to  cease 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operations.  Justice  Kagan  noted  they  did  cease 

  

 

 

 

 

 

operation  during  the  period  in  which  the  law  was  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State.  There's  evidence  in  the  record  with  respect  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  seven  clinics  that  are  operated  by  Whole  Woman's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Health  that  they  ­­ that  it  was  physically  impossible  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meet  the  ASC  construction  requirements  because  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  fit  on  the  real  estate  footprint  that  they  had; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  couldn't  meet  them.  There's  expert  testimony  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  record  from  Dr.  Layne­Farrar,  the  economist,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  cost  of  retrofitting  these  clinics  to  meet  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements  would  be  between  1.6  and  2.3  million 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollars,  which  would  be  prohibitive;  that  the  cost  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

building  a  new  facility  would  be  at  least  3.5  million 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dollars,  which  would  be  prohibitive;  and  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional  operating  cost  of  an  ASC  would  be  between

600,00  and  a  million  dollars  a  year  more.  So  I  think 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

with  respect  to  those,  there's  ample  evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

With  respect  to  the  ­­ with  respect  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitting­privileges  requirement,  we  know  that  11  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  clinics  that  closed  between  the  date  when  the  law  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted  and  the  effective  date  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitting­privileges  requirement  closed  on  the  date  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  requirement  became  effective.  Seems  to  me  the  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  inference  you  can  draw  with  respect  to  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  is  that  that  law  caused  the  closure.  With  respect  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  others,  I  don't  think  there's  evidence  with  respect 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  each  one,  but  with  respect  to  several,  there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  they  closed  in  advance  of  the  effective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

date,  because  they  were  otherwise  going  to  have  to  pay  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

licensing  fee  to  stay  open  for  another  year,  which  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knew  they  were  not.  And  they  knew  they  weren't  going  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  able  to  stay  open,  and  they  didn't  want  to  flush  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  away.  So  I  think  there's  ample  evidence  in  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  with  respect  to  causation. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  with  respect  to  capacity,  I  really 

   

 

 

 

 

think  this  is  key,  because  I  do  think  this  is  the  locus 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  substantial  obstacle  problem  here.  With  respect 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  capacity,  before  this  law  took  ­­ took  effect,  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  approximately  65  to  70,000  abortions  a  year 

   

 

 

 

 

 

annually.  The  ASC  clinics  that  will  be  able  to  remain

open  ­­ the  ASC  facilities  that  will  be  able  to  remain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

open  performed  about  14,000  a  year.  That's  what  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

record  tells  you.  It's  Dr.  Grossman's  expert  testimony. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  in  the  JA  from  pages  225  to  259. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  About  20  percent. 

  

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  20  percent.  So  they'd 

  

 

 

 

 

have  to  increase  four­ or  five­fold  in  a  very  short 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period  of  time  with  the  ­­ against  the  backdrop  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having  to  meet  the  problems  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitting­privileges  requirement  causes. 

 

 

            

Now,  I  understand  that  the  Fifth  Circuit 

   

 

 

 

 

said  that  was  ipse  dixit,  but  with  all  due  respect, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  not  binding  on  you  and  it's  just  wrong.  And  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  look  at  the  expert  testimony  at  the  JA  pages  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified,  you'll  see  that  what  Dr.  Grossman  said  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  something  that  is  just  common  sense,  that  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinics  aren't  going  to  be  ­­ these  facilities  aren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  be  able  to  increase  by  four  or  five  times. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  second,  he  didn't  just  rely  on  common 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense.  He  looked  at  the  period  of  time  between  when  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitting­privileges  requirement  resulted  in  the  closure 

 

 

 

 

 

of  20  clinics.  He  looked  at  that  period  of  time,  and  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

studied  the  number  of  abortions  that  occurred  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remaining  ASC  facilities  during  that  period  of  time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  one  would  expect,  given  that  half  the  facilities  in

There's  one  ­­ a  doctor  there  performed  3,000  abortions 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  year. 

   

            

So  we  don't  really  know  what  the  capacity  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  ­­ of  these  ASC  clinics  ­­

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  ­­ I  think  you  have  expert 

   

 

 

 

 

 

testimony  in  that  regard. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Yeah.  But  what  is  it  based 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

on?  It's  based  ­­ you  know,  he  ­­ it's  not  based  on  any

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  common  sense  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  But  beyond  that,  as  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  Justice  Alito,  they  studied  the  period  of  time  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  half  the  clinics  in  the  State  were  closed.  And

additional  ASCs  can  handle  the  ­­ the  capacity,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have,  and  they  didn't. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  He  said  that  ­­ that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  ­­ the  percentage  of  abortions  at  the  ASCs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went  down  by  4.4  percent,  and  there  was  an  increased 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demand  for  abortion.  But  there's  no  statistic  showing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  actually  was  an  increased  demand  for  abortion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Texas. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  thought  that  the  Grossman 

    

 

 

 

 

affidavit,  which  I  have  ­­ I  grant  you,  it's  going  on 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  briefs  ­­ but  it  said  at  Table  ­­ affidavit  page  9, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Table  2,  says  that  the  number  of  abortions  that  are,  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

average,  performed  annually  at  the  remaining  clinics  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2,000.  So  let's  multiply  by  2,  and  you  get  16.  Let's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiply  by  3;  you  get  24.  There  were  70,000, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approximately,  women  who  needed  these  procedures. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

accurate? 

            

            

            

So  I  ­­ I  had  taken  that.  Is  it  that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yes. 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  In  ­­ in  the  short  time  I

could.

substance,  and  whether  the  balance  ­­ whether  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balance  struck  in  Casey  still  holds. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  that  right  still  does  retain  real 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substance,  then  this  law  cannot  stand.  The  burdens  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imposes,  the  obstacles,  are  far  beyond  anything  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  has  countenanced.  And  the  justification  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  far  weaker  than  anything  that  this  Court  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

countenanced.  It  is  an  undue  burden.  It  is  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  an  undue  burden. 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

And,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  you  ­­ in  response 

 

 

 

 

 

to  your  question,  undue  means  excessive  or  unwarranted. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Could  be  excessive  or  unwarranted  as  compared  to  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  obstacle  it  imposes,  certainly.  But  also,  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

compared  to  its  need. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  would  have 

    

 

 

 

thought  ­­ Casey  and  Gonzales  also  said  substantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obstacle.  And  I  would  have  thought  that's  something  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

could  look  at  in  an  objective  manner.  Why  ­­ and  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually,  I  don't  understand  why  you're  arguing  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

opposite.  I  think  whether  it's  an  obstacle  or  a  burden 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

would  exist  without  regard  to  the  strength  of  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest.  The  strength  of  the  State  interest,  it  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem  to  me,  is  evaluated  on  whatever  test  there  is  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  that  legislation,  and  then  you'd  look  at  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  impact  was.

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  I  think  it's 

   

 

 

 

actually  in  the  interest  of  government  to  look  at  it  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  that  we're  suggesting  it  ought  to  be  looked  at.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ if  I  ­­ you  know,  if  could  take  two  minutes  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explain  why. 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  And  I  think,  Mr.  Chief 

   

 

 

 

 

Justice,  that  is  because,  you  know,  it  is  one  thing  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  you're  going  to  impose  a  requirement  that  does 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work  as  much  as  to  be  the  kind  of  obstacle  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  ­­ that  these  requirements  do,  when  you  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justification  that's  frankly  flimsy  and  the  American 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Medical  Association  has  told  you  was  groundless.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  ­­ if  the  government  were  able  to  come  in  ­­ if  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  us  or  if  it  were  State  ­­ were  able  to  come  in  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  well,  actually,  this  requirement  is  going  to  make  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  in  saving  hundreds  of  lives,  that  might  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden  that  you  would  think  would  be  acceptable,  given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  medical  benefit.  That's  why  we  think  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  that  makes  sense,  the  best  understanding  of  undue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden,  the  understanding  of  undue  burden  that  works 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

best  for  the  government  is  the  one  we're  suggesting. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  whichever  way  you  look  at  that, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  you  look  at  it  our  way  or  whether  you  look  at  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  two  separate  inquiries,  this  law,  HB2,  can't  pass  it,

MR.  KELLER:  An  extra  thank  you,  Mr.  Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice,  and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Res  judicata  bars  the  facial  challenges.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

any  event,  Texas  acted  to  improve  abortion  safety,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Planned  Parenthood  provides  this  increased  standard  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

care  and  has  opened  new  ASCs.  Abortion  is  legal  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accessible  in  Texas.  All  the  Texas  metropolitan  areas 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  have  abortion  clinics  today  will  have  open  clinics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  the  Court  affirms,  and  that  includes  the  six  most

located  over  100  miles  from  the  nearest  clinic? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Justice  Ginsburg,  JA  242 

  

 

 

 

 

provides  that  25  percent  of  Texas  women  of  reproductive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

age  are  not  within  100  miles  of  an  ASC.  But  that  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  include  McAllen  that  got  as­applied  relief,  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  not  include  El  Paso,  where  the  Santa  Teresa,  New 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mexico  facility  is. 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  includes  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  That's  ­­ that's  odd  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  point  to  the  New  Mexico  facility.  New  Mexico 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  have  any  surgical  ­­ ASC  requirement,  and  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  have  any  admitting  requirement.  So  if  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  is  right,  then  New  Mexico  is  not  an  available 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  out  for  Texas  because  Texas  says  to  protect  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

women,  we  need  these  things.  But  send  them  off  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mexico  ­­ New  Mexico  ­­ New  Mexico  where  they  don't  get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  either,  no  admitting  privileges,  no  ASC.  And  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfectly  all  right. 

 

 

            

Well,  if  that's  all  right  for  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

women  in  the  El  Paso  area,  why  isn't  it  right  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rest  of  the  women  in  Texas? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  The  policy  set  by  Texas  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  standard  of  care  for  abortion  clinics  should  rise  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  level  of  ASCs  for  clinics,  and  admitting  privileges 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  doctors.  Texas  obviously  can't  tell  New  Mexico  how

to  regulate,  but  the  substantial  obstacle  inquiry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

examines  whether  there  is  the  ability  to  make  the

there's  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Then  why  should  it  count 

  

 

 

 

 

 

those  clinics? 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  here,  the  evidence  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  showed  that  this  particular  clinic  was  1  mile 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

across  the  border  that  was  still  in  the  El  Paso 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

metroplex,  and  women  in  El  Paso  often  used  that  facility 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  obtain  abortions. 

 

 

            

 

 

 

So  that  would  go  into  the  contextual 

 

 

 

analysis  of  this  particular  as­applied  challenge.  This 

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  go  to  the  facial  challenge,  but  the  as­applied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  and  whether  women  in  El  Paso  do  have  access  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abortion. 

            

In  any  event,  over  90  percent  of  Texas  women 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  reproductive  age  live  within  150  miles  of  an  open 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinic  as  of  today. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Keller,  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statistics  that  I  gleaned  from  the  record  were  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

900,000  women  live  further  than  150  miles  from  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provider;  750,000,  three­quarters  of  a  million,  further 

   

 

 

 

 

than  200  miles.  Now,  that's  as  compared  to  just  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2012,  where  fewer  than  100,000  lived  over  150  miles,  and

only  10,000  lived  more  than  200  miles  away.  So  we're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  from,  like,  10,000  to  three­quarters  of  a  million 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

living  more  than  200  miles  away. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  Justice  Kagan,  first  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

all,  I  believe  the  statistics  at  JA  242,  which  is  their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert  testimony,  would  not  account  for  McAllen  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

El  Paso,  but  in  looking  at  the  fraction  of  women 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affected.  And  that  would  be  the  facial  challenge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard,  that  at  a  minimum,  a  large  fraction  of  cases, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

there  would  have  to  be  invalidity  even  if  there  was  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undue  burden. 

 

            

The  travel  distance  of  ­­ even  in  Casey,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  found  over  40  percent  of  Pennsylvania 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

women  were  going  to  have  to  travel  at  least  one  hour, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes  over  three  hours,  and  there  was  a  24­hour 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

waiting  period.  Texas  reduces  that  waiting  period  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  hours  for  traveling  over  100  miles.  And  in  Casey, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  not  a  facial  substantial  obstacle. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Here,  that  relevant  fraction  is  ­­ is  lower. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  under  Casey,  then  the  facial  challenge  would  not

being  imposed?  Meaning,  even  if  I  grant  you  that  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  circumstances  travel  time  is  necessary  because  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  can't  get  any  kind  of  abortion  clinic  to  go  into  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  area,  so  you  might  have  to  impose  a  burden 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  might  be  undue  in  other  circumstances.  Where  do  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evaluate  the  benefit  of  this  burden?  What  ­­ what's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need? 

            

You  ­­ you  seem  ­­ your  brief  seemed  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

telling  us  that  there's  no  role  for  the  Court  to  judge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  there's  really  a  health  benefit  to  what  you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing. 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  there  would  be  three 

  

 

 

 

 

 

elements  of  the  doctrine.  There's  the  rational  basis 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  not  talking  about 

  

 

 

 

 

the  doctrine.  I'm  talking  about  the  question  I  asked, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

which  is,  according  to  you,  the  slightest  health 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

improvement  is  enough  to  impose  on  hundreds  of  thousands 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  women  ­­ even  assuming  I  accept  your  argument,  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  don't,  necessarily,  because  it's  being  challenged  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  the  slightest  benefit  is  enough  to  burden  the  lives 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  million  women.  That's  your  point? 

   

  

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  And  what  ­­ and  what  Casey  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  substantial  obstacle  test  examines  access  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abortion.  Now,  if  a  law  had  no  health  benefits,

presumably  it  would  be  irrational.  But  even  their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

expert  ­­ and  this  is  at  JA  256  and  258  ­­ acknowledged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  some  doctors  do  believe  that  there  are  benefits  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ASC  and  admitting­privileges  requirement  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  ­­ what  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  of  the  medical,  the  two  pills  that  you  take, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  is  the  benefit  of  having  an  ambulatory  surgical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

center  to  take  two  pills  when  there's  no  ­­ no  surgical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure  at  all  involved? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Two  responses,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

Ginsburg.  First,  the  complication  rates  are  greater. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

When  there's  a  complication  rate  from  a  drug­induced 

   

   

 

 

 

abortion,  then  a  surgical  abortion  is  needed  as  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow­up. 

            

            

And  the  first  lawsuit  ­­

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  On  that  complication, 

  

 

 

 

that  complication  is  likely  to  arise  near  the  women's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

home,  much  more  likely  to  arise  near  her  home,  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30  miles  has  nothing  to  do  with. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  first  of  all,  the  two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

travel  distances,  that  was  about  the  drug  protocol. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  a  different  part  of  the  bill.  That  was  in  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners'  first  lawsuit,  and  they  have  not  raised  any

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I'm  not  ­­ I'm  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  the  prior  lawsuit;  I'm  talking  about  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit.  You  need  to  have  access  to  a  hospital  within 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

30  miles.  30  miles  of  what?  30  miles  of  the  surgical 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

center  when  the  woman  lives  at  a  much  greater  distance? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  if  she's  going  to  go  to  any  hospital,  it  will  be  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her  local  community,  not  near  the  surgical  center. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Of  course,  most  abortions  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

surgical  abortions  in  the  State. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well,  I'm  asking  just 

  

 

 

 

 

about  the  medical. 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  That's  right.  And  also  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  ­­ and  just  it's  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't  imagine.  What  is  the  benefit  of  having  a  woman 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  those  pills  in  an  ambulatory  surgical  center  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  surgery  involved? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  there  would  be  surgery  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  complication.  And  all  abortion  clinics  in  Texas 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

perform  surgical  abortions,  and  that's  why  Petitioners 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably  didn't  defend  that  aspect  of  the  judgment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  If  it  is  a  complication, 

   

  

 

 

 

it  is  not  going  to  occur  on  the  spot.  I  mean,  you  have 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  concede  that  in  ­­ in  the  case  of  the  medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abortion,  the  complication  generally  arises  after  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

woman  is  back  at  home.  And  then  the  nearest  hospital

has  nothing  to  do  with  the  surgical  center. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Although  when  the  significant 

  

 

 

 

 

majority  of  women  are  living  within  50  miles  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinic,  in  most  situations  they  are  going  to  be  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facility.  And  it  is  beneficial  to  have  continuity  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

care,  to  check  for  clinical  competence,  to  prevent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

miscommunication  and  patient  abandonment  to  have  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitting­privileges  requirement. 

 

            

In  any  event,  the  facial  challenge  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  barred  by  res  judicata.  It  was  litigated  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Before  you  get  ­­ is  it  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  underlying  premise  of  ­­ of  your  argument, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Keller,  and  of  the  State's  position,  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thrust,  the  impetus,  the  effect  of  this  law  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

increase  surgical  abortions  as  distinct  from  medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abortions,  and  that  that  is  within  the  State's  authority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do?  Because  my  reading  indicated  that  medical 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

abortions  are  up  nationwide  but  down  significantly  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas. 

            

MR.  KELLER:  It  would  certainly  be 

  

 

 

 

 

permissible  to  regulate  both  surgical  and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drug­induced  abortions,  and  in  drug­induced  abortions, 

 

 

 

 

 

since  there  are  greater  complications.

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  I  thought  an 

   

  

 

 

underlying  theme,  or  at  least  an  underlying  factual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstration,  is  that  this  law  has  really  increased  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  surgical  procedures  as  opposed  to  medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures,  and  that  this  may  not  be  medically  wise. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Yeah.  Insofar  as  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  You  might  say  that  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  authority  of  the  State  to  do,  but  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Given  the  higher  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  I  want  to  know  what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

your  position  is  on  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  And  Justice  Kennedy,  given  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

greater  complication  rates  from  drug­induced  abortions, 

 

 

 

 

 

the  legislature  would  be  permitted  to  act  in  that  way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  in  any  event,  Petitioners  have  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenged  that  particular  part  of  the  district  court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holding  that  gave  them  as­applied  relief  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drug­induced  abortion  part.  In  the  Fifth  Circuit,  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't  raised  that. 

 

 

            

What  they're  trying  to  do  on  the  effects 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prong  is  say  that  the  remaining  clinics  will  lack 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capacity.  But  the  Fifth  Circuit  correctly  noted  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  capacity  evidence  in  the  record.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  even  try  to  take  discovery  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non­Petitioner  clinics.

And  indeed,  Grossman's  ipse  dixit  was  in 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  ipse  dixit.  What  he  did  is  he  looked  at  the  number 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  abortions  and  percentages  that  were  being  performed.

abortions,  and  so  the  inference  that  they  were  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capacity  cannot  be  drawn.  And  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  ­­ what 

  

 

 

 

 

evidence  would  you  have  put  in  on  the  capacity  issue  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  had  been  afforded  that  opportunity? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Evidence  that  would 

  

 

 

 

 

rebut  the  statistically  significant  showing  on  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side  about  capacity,  and  also  the  circumstantial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  about  the  timing  of  the  ­­ of  the  closures. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  this  is  not  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

record,  but  in  Petitioners'  first  lawsuit  ­­ this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Exhibit  K  ­­ to  their  application  to  vacate  the  stay  in

they  went  clinic  by  clinic  in  a  chart  ­­ excuse  me  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  they  tried  to  estimate  the  number  of  abortions  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  performed  in  those  facilities.  The  district 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  didn't  even  make  a  fact­finding  there. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  Houston  Planned  Parenthood  ASC  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estimated  could  perform  9,000  abortions  annually. 

 

 

 

 

 

9,000.  That's  175  a  week  is  what  their  chart  says.

Houston  Planned  ­­ Planned  Parenthood  operates  five  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  nine  ASCs.  Planned  Parenthood  is  ­­ is  not  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit.  They  were  in  the  first  lawsuit.  They  have 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

complied  with  the  law.  They  have  doctors  with  admitting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

privileges,  and  they  have  facilities  in  each  of  the  five 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most  populous  Texas  cities. 

 

 

 

            

And  so  if  one  ASC  can  perform  9,000 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abortions  annually,  and  there  are  going  to  be  at  least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eight  other  ASCs  in  Texas,  plus  the  tenth  facility,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

McCallen  facility,  that  obtained  as­applied  relief,  it

remaining  facilities  would  suffice  to  meet  the  demand

I'd  like  to  go  back  to  the  ­­ the  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Justice  Ginsburg  was  asking,  which  is  about  what  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  benefit  of  this  procedure. 

 

 

 

 

            

There  are  two  laws.  I  am  focusing  on  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  law.  The  first  law  says  that  a  doctor  at  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abortion  clinic  must  have  admitting  privileges  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hospital  30  miles  within  that  ­­ nearby,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KELLER:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  Prior  to  that  law, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the  law  was  that  the  clinic  had  to  have  a  working 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrangement  to  transfer  such  a  patient,  correct?  I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

just  reading  it  from  this. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  KELLER:  That's  correct. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  So  I  want  to  know, 

   

  

  

 

 

 

go  back  in  time  to  the  period  before  the  new  law  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passed,  where  in  the  record  will  I  find  evidence  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

women  who  had  complications,  who  could  not  get  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hospital,  even  though  there  was  a  working  arrangement 

   

 

 

 

 

 

for  admission,  but  now  they  could  get  to  a  hospital 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  doctor  himself  has  to  have  admitting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

privileges?  Which  were  the  women?  On  what  page  does  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell  me  their  names,  what  the  complications  were,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  that  happened? 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Justice  Breyer,  that  is  not  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  record.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  so  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  KELLER:  What  I'm  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ Judge  Posner  then  seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

to  be  correct  where  he  says  he  could  find  in  the  entire 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nation,  in  his  opinion,  only  one  arguable  example  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  a  thing,  and  he's  not  certain  that  even  that  one  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct. 

            

 

So  what  is  the  benefit  to  the  woman  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure  that  is  going  to  cure  a  problem  of  which  there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  one  single  instance  in  the  nation,  though  perhaps 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  one,  but  not  in  Texas. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Justice  Breyer,  the  National 

  

 

 

 

 

Abortion  Federation  previously  recommended  that  women 

 

 

 

 

 

use  abortion  doctors  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  didn't  ask  that.  I'm 

    

  

 

 

 

sure  there  are  people  who  had  all  kinds  of  reasons  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  like  to  have  this  and  so  forth.  And  I'm  not  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  just  asking  you,  where  we  have  a  judicial  duty  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  whether  this  is  an  undue  burden  upon  the  woman  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants  the  abortion,  there  are  two  parts:  Is  she 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burdened  and  what  is  the  benefit? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  now  on  the  first  one,  I've  asked  you  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  a  single  example  of  an  instance  where  there  was  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit,  and  you  say,  I  think  quite  honestly,  there  is

no  such  burden. 

 

 

            

So  let's  turn  to  the  second.  The  second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one,  according  to  the  amicus  briefs  here,  which  I  guess 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  could  validate,  that  even  without  the  surgical  center, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leave  it  out,  there  are  risks  quite  correct.  Those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risks  are  roughly  the  same  as  the  risks  that  you  have  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  dentist  office  when  you  have  some  surgery,  where  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  have  an  ambulatory  surgical  center.  There  are  28 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

times  less  than  a  risk  of  a  colonoscopy,  where  you  don't 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  ambulatory  surgical  center.  There  are  like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hundreds  of  times  less  ­­ you've  seen  these  briefs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Okay.  So  I  read  them,  and  you  read  them. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  what  is  the  benefit  here  to  giving,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  the  woman,  her  risk,  I  can't  say  it's  zero  here, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ambulatory  surgical  center  when  the  risk  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minuscule  compared  to  common  procedures  that  women  run 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  day  in  other  areas  without  ambulatory  surgical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

centers? 

            

MR.  KELLER:  That  has  never  been  the  test 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Casey  about  substantial  obstacle.  And  this  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Simopoulos,  even  before  Casey  upheld  an  ASC 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement,  and  there  ­­ Virginia  did  not  require  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brain  surgery  be  performed  in  a  hospital  or  an  ASC. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  at  5043  of  the  Simopoulos  oral  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transcript.  It's  because  in  looking  at  the  laws,  it's

acting.  Legislatures  react  ­­

  

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  interesting. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  can  the  legislature 

  

 

 

 

 

say  anything,  General?  I  mean,  if  the  legislature  says 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  a  ­­ a  health­related  abortion  regulation  here, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

we've  looked  around  the  country  and  we  think  that  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  ten  great  hospitals  in  the  country,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Massachusetts  General,  Brigham  and  Women's,  and  we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  make  all  our  abortion  facilities  conform  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards  of  those  hospitals,  and  that  will  ­­ you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  will  increase  medical  care.  Now,  it's  true  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  make  anybody  else  doing  any  kind  ­­ other  kind  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure  conform  to  those  standards,  but  we  think  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  increase  health  benefits  if  abortion  facilities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conform  to  them.  Would  that  be  all  right? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Under  this  Court's  precedent, 

  

 

 

 

 

abortion  can  be  treated  differently.  That's  Simopoulos. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

That's  Mazurek.  And  let's  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  wait  a  minute  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  every  abortion  facility 

  

 

 

 

 

has  to  hit  the  standards  of  MGH.  That  would  be  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  there  would  have  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

medical  evidence.  It  is  at  a  minimum  disputed.  In

here,  their  experts  have  conceded  that  doctors  believe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ this  is  precisely  where  there's  a  medical 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

disagreement,  even  if  you  don't  accept  our  medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony,  although  it  was  admitted  into  the  record. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I'm  sure  that  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

medical  evidence  that  if  every  hospital,  if  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facility  was  as  good  as  Massachusetts  General,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  better  facilities.  I'm  sure  that  you  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find  doctors  to  say  that,  because  MGH,  it's  a  great 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hospital.  But  that  would  be  okay,  even  though  it's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied  to  any  other  kind  of  facility  doing  any  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  procedure,  even  though  we  know  that  liposuction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  30  times  more  dangerous,  yet  doesn't  have  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kinds  of  requirements. 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  And  that  was  the  holding  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Simopoulos.  And  in  Mazurek,  the  Court  ­­

a  burden  on  the  women,  well,  that  would  be  a  benefit  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them.  Would  there  be  anything  unconstitutional  about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that? 

            

MR.  KELLER:  No.  Provided  that  women  do  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

are  able  to  make  the  ultimate  decision  to  elect  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  doesn't  that  show  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  undue­burden  test  is  weighed  against  what  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State's  interest  is? 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Justice  Kennedy  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  mean,  are  they  ­­ are 

    

 

 

 

 

 

they  ­­ are  these  two  completely  discrete  analytical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories,  undue  burden,  and  we  don't  look  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State's  interest? 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  What  Casey  noted  was  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

undue­burden  test  is,  is  there  a  purpose  or  an  effect  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  substantial  obstacle  to  access?  And  that's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  about  access.  As  to  whether  what  the  State's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest  would  be,  that  would  be  going  to  a  rational 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  review  or  maybe  a  purpose­based  analysis.  But  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

need  the  clearest  proof  under  the  Court's  general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine  about  unconstitutional  purpose.  To  infer  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  an  unconstitutional  purpose  when  there  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate  interest  in  promoting  patient  health,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  what  Texas  did  here  ­­ even  Roe  v.  Wade  said  that

States  can  ensure  maximum  safety  for  patients. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  what  is  the 

  

 

 

 

 

legitimate  interest  in  protecting  their  health?  What 

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  is  there  that  under  the  prior  law,  the  prior 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  was  not  sufficiently  protective  of  the  women's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health?  As  I  understand  it,  this  is  one  of  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lowest­risk  procedures,  and  you  give  a  horrible  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Pennsylvania,  but  absolutely  nothing  from  Texas.  As  far 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  we  know,  this  is  among  the  most  safe,  the  least  risk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures,  an  early­stage  abortion. 

 

 

 

            

So  what  was  ­­ what  was  the  problem  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislature  was  responding  to  that  it  needed  to  improve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  facilities  for  women's  health? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  In  Petitioner's  first  lawsuit, 

  

 

 

 

 

Planned  Parenthood  admitted  that  over  210  women  annually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  hospitalized  because  of  abortion  complications. 

 

 

 

 

 

Here  at  JA  266  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  As  compared  to 

  

 

 

 

childbirth,  many,  many  ­­ much  riskier  procedure,  is  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not? 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  the  American  Center  for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Law  and  Justice  and  Former  Abortion  Providers'  amicus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs  dispute  that.  But  regardless,  there  is

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ is  a  much  riskier 

   

  

 

 

 

procedure  than  an  early  stage  abortion? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Justice  Ginsburg,  those  amicus 

  

 

 

 

 

briefs  point  out  what  when  you  look  at  record  linkage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statistic,  instead  of  complication  reporting,  there  may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  a  difference.  And  the  reason  why  reporting  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

important  is  there's  evidence  in  the  record  here  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abortion  complications  are  underreported.  That's  at  JA 

  

 

 

 

 

 

844  and  870  to  72.  In  fact,  Petitioner. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  By  hospitals? 

  

 

 

Underreported  ­­ most  of  the  complications  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking  about  were  reported  at  hospitals,  correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Yes,  there  is  some  evidence  of  not  reporting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  things  outside  the  hospital,  but  you  know  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number  of  ­­ hospitals  are  accurately  reporting. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well,  abortion  clinics  are  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  report  complications  in  Texas.  And  Petitioner

Petitioners  are  trying  to  upset  the  balance  that  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

struck  in  Casey. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  don't  see  where  this  fits 

    

 

 

 

 

 

in,  I  mean,  to  the  argument.  I  ­­ I  don't  question

Breyer.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  the  ­­ the  ­­ what

You  said  there  aren't  very  many

I  mean,  you  read  the  briefs,  and  you've  read 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  articles  I  have.  And  of  course  the  argument  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  lead  to  self­induced  abortion,  you  will  find  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  women  dying.  So  if  the  concern  is  this  tiny  risk 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  dying  through  a  complication  in  a  clinic,  is  this  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy  that  will  in  fact  achieve  the  legislature's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

health­saving  purpose? 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Justice  Breyer,  about 

  

 

 

 

self­induced  abortion,  the  evidence  in  the  record  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  were  two  points  of  testimony,  both  from  McAllen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  Petitioners  prevailed,  as­applied  challenges  could 

 

 

 

 

 

be  brought  in  areas  ­­ for  instance,  if  there  could  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shown  a  substantial  obstacle  based  on  travel  distance, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  four  clinics  that  closed  in  West  Texas  between  El 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Paso  and  San  Antonio,  all  those  closed  before  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitting­privileges  requirement  took  effect.  They  were 

  

 

 

 

 

all  Planned  Parenthood  facilities.

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  As­applied  challenge  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

real  problem  with  that,  because  suppose  you  bring  in

can't  have  a  creation  of  an  ambulatory  surgical  center 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  the  spot. 

 

 

              

I  mean,  these  ­­ these  ­­ once  ­­ once  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facilities  are  closed,  they're  closed,  and  they  can't

challenge  ­­ I  mean,  the  woman's  problem  would  be  long 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  before  this  clinic,  the  kind  of  clinic  they  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before,  could  be  restarted. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Justice  Ginsburg,  the  McAllen 

  

 

 

 

 

clinic  reopened,  and  as  Justice  Kagan  mentioned,  clinics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  reopen.  The  Lubbock  facility,  though,  which  is  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  facilities  in  West  Texas,  in  Petitioners'  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit  they  told  this  Court  in  their  application  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  clinic  was  going  to  close  regardless. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  seven  of  the  eight  clinics  that  closed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  the  admitting­privileges  requirement  took  effect, 

 

 

 

 

 

and  went  from  41  to  33,  seven  of  those  eight  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Planned  Parenthood  clinics.  Planned  Parenthood  is 

  

 

 

 

 

complying  with  the  law  and  providing  that  increased 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  of  care. 

 

 

            

And  also,  the  eleven  clinics  that  closed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day  that  the  admitting­privileges  requirement  took 

 

 

 

 

 

effect,  when  it  went  from  33  to  22,  I  don't  believe  six 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  those  clinics  can  be  deemed  to  have  ceased  performing

facility  was  going  to  close  anyway.  Killeen  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitting  privileges.  That's  JA  401. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  There  was  a 

  

 

 

 

stipulation  ­­ there  was  a  stipulation  that  is  "No 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

currently­licensed  abortion  facility  meets  the  ASC 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements.  Each  will  be  prohibited  from  performing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

abortions  after  the  day  the  law  goes  into  effect." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  a  stipulation,  not  a  question  of  what  evidence 

   

   

 

 

 

 

there  was  for. 

 

 

            

Texas  stipulated  that  no  currently­licensed 

 

 

 

 

facility  meets  ASC  requirements,  and  each  will  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibited  from  performing  abortions. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  And  that  would  go  to  the  ASC 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  as  opposed  to  the  facial  challenge  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitting­privileges  requirement.  But  four  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

facilities  that  reopened  ­­ four  facilities  reopened  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  eleven  when  the  admitting­privileges  requirement 

 

 

 

 

 

went  into  effect.  That  was  Dallas,  two  at  Ft.  Worth, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  in  Austin.  That's  JA  131,  715,  1111  and  1436.  Two 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  those  were  ASCs. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  when  it  comes  to  the  count  of  ASCs, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  nine  ASCs  performing  abortion  today  in  Texas. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Three  opened  up  after  House  Bill  2  was  passed.  So  in

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Can  I  ask:  Were  they 

   

  

  

 

 

opened  as  a  result  of  the  law,  or  were  they  planned  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  opened  before  the  law  went  into  effect?  Because  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  makes  a  difference  to  me  if  they  were  planned 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  opened.  It  takes  quite  a  while  to  dig  up  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money,  get  the  investors,  buy  the  land,  do  the  building. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  seems  to  me  that  they  must  have  been  planned  for  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

while.  And  if  they  were,  it  was  because  there  was  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need  independent  of  the  number  of  abortions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  In  other  words,  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

fortuitous  that  they've  come  into  existence,  but  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ their  need  was  not  there  ­­ was  independent  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reduced  number  of  facilities  elsewhere. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Legislature  provided  13  months 

  

 

 

 

 

to  come  into  compliance.  In  addition,  you  could  lease 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

space.  Texas  has  over  430  ­­ there  are  433  general  ASCs 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Texas  at  the  time  of  trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  most  of  them  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

choose  to  provide  abortions. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  That's  correct.  Of  course, 

  

  

 

 

 

space  could  be  leased  in  those. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  what  you  don't  know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is  what  ­­ do  you  have  enough  resources  to  open  up  an

MR.  KELLER:  Yeah.  The  point  being  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

there  are  going  to  be  at  least  ten  clinics  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Can  I  ask  about  McAllen? 

   

  

 

 

 

There  was  testimony  in  the  record  that  at  least  four 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctors  had  ­­ from  that  spot  had  asked  for  admitting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

privileges.  Well,  the  Fifth  Circuit's  remedy  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

provided  for  one  doctor,  Dr.  Lynn,  who's  past  retirement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

age,  to  be  the  only  doctor  performing  abortions  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinic. 

            

Now,  if  the  clinic  had  ­­ I  don't  know  how 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many  it  had,  but  it  had  at  least  four  people  before  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  seems  rather  callous  to  say  as  a  remedy  that  we're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  make  that  one  doctor  do  the  work  of  four,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe  more  doctors  who  didn't  get  admitting  privileges. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why  is  even  the  Fifth  Circuit's  remedy  reasonable? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Because,  Justice  Sotomayor, 

  

 

 

 

that  was  the  only  named  plaintiff  for  the  as­applied  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  that  ­­ but  ­­ if  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes.  As  applied,  the  A  ­­ ASC  law  is  affecting  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinic  because  it  can't  get  its  doctors  certified.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why  does  it  require  a  named  plaintiff  to  relieve  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinic  of  the  obligation  of  going  without  admitting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

privileges?

most  of  the  doctors  and  clinics  in  Texas  are  not  part  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  lawsuit  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  you  just  lift  the

in  the  area. 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  if  any  doctor  who's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

licensed  appropriately  can  get  admitting  privileges, 

 

 

 

 

 

they  should  be  permitted  to  work  in  that  clinic.

personnel  or  procedures  or  the  facilities  themselves, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

higher  medical  standards,  including  much  higher  medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standards  for  abortion  facilities  than  for  facilities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  do  any  other  kind  of  medical  work,  even  much  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risky  medical  work.  And  you  said  that  that  was  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding  of  the  law;  am  I  right? 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Correct,  in  this  Court's  ­­ in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Simopoulos. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  I  guess  I  just  want  to 

   

   

  

 

 

 

know  why  would  Texas  do  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  KELLER:  When  there  are  complications 

  

 

 

 

 

from  abortion  that's  in  the  record,  Texas  can  enact  laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  promote  safety. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No,  I  know,  but  ­­ but  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

assumption  of  the  question,  and  I  think  you  haven't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenged  this  assumption,  is  that  there  are  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures  that  are  much  higher  risk:  Colonoscopies, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

liposuctions,  we  could  go  on  and  on.  And  ­­ and  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  that's  okay,  we  get  to  set  much  higher  standards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  abortion.  And  I  just  want  to  know  why  that  is. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Justice  Kagan,  this  bill  was

passed  in  the  wake  of  the  Kermit  Gosnell  scandal  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prompted  Texas  and  many  other  States  to  reexamine  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abortion  regulations. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But,  of  course,  the  ­­ I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  Texas's  own  regulations  actually  have  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abortion  facilities  such  that  that  can  never  happen, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  you  have  continual  inspections,  I  mean,  to  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

credit.  So  that  was  really  not  a  problem  in  Texas, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

having  a  kind  of  rogue  outfit  there.  Texas  has  taken 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions  to  prevent  that. 

 

 

 

            

So,  again,  I  just  sort  of  ­­ I'm  left 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

wondering,  given  this  baseline  of  regulation  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevents  rogue  outfits  of  ­­ like  that,  why  it  is  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas  would  make  this  choice.  And  you  say  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allowed  to  make  this  choice,  and  we  can  argue  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  I  just  want  to  know  why  Texas  would  make  it. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  I  think  the  amicus  brief  for 

    

 

 

 

 

 

the  121  Texas  legislators  that  canvasses  the  medical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  and  canvasses  statements  confirms  that  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  were  complications  that  these  laws  do  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefits.  And  even  the  bill  opponents  said  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Isn't  it  true  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Are  you  ­­ are  you  in  ­­

one  of  the  amicus  briefs  cites  instance  after  instance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  Whole  Woman's  facilities  have  been  cited  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  appalling  violations  when  they  were  inspected: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Holes  in  the  floor  where  ­­ where  rats  could  come  in, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  lack  of  any  equipment  to  adequately  sterilize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instruments.  Is  that  not  the  case? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Stories  similar  to  that  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

also  raised  in  the  121  Texas  legislators'  amicus  briefs.

that,  and  the  complications  from  Whole  Woman's  Health

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Random  ­­ Texas,  under 

  

 

 

 

 

the  prior  law,  has  the  right  to  make  random  inspections. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Was  ­­ the  problem  in  Pennsylvania  was  this  filthy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinic  hadn't  been  looked  at  by  anyone  from  the  State  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  years.  But  Texas  can  go  into  any  one  of  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinics  and  immediate  ­­ immediately  spots  a  violation? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

It  says  you  can't  operate  till  you  come  up  to  speed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

So  Texas  has  had,  as  Justice  Kagan  pointed 

 

 

 

 

 

out,  its  own  mechanism  for  preventing  that  kind  of  thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from  happening. 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Texas  did  have  existing 

  

 

 

 

 

regulations,  but  increasing  the  standard  of  care  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

valid,  particularly  not  only  in  light  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It's  valid  only  if  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

taking  care  of  a  real  problem. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  And  there  were  ­­ the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

abortion  complications  and  underreported  questions  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  no,  no,  no.  A 

  

  

 

 

 

 

real  problem,  meaning,  Gosnell,  the  governor  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pennsylvania,  said  was  a  regulatory  failure.  And  only 

   

  

 

 

 

 

in  that,  not  ­­ this  clinic  had  not  been  inspected  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  years.  He  ­­ the  doctor  was  fabricating  his  reports. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  could  happen  almost  in  any  setting.  Anyone  who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intends  to  break  the  law  is  going  to  break  the  law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever  the  regulatory  rules  are.

You're  going  to  have  doctors,  as  happened 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pre  our  laws,  who  were  performing  abortions  without 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permission  in  their  offices  or  without  licenses.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  want  to  suggest  that  we  should  presume  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  happen,  but  it  will  happen. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  The  constitutional  standard  for 

  

 

 

 

 

whether  a  State  can  make  abortion  safer  can't  be  that  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  only  prevent  the  Gosnell  situation,  and  there  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complications. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  but  ­­ yeah, 

  

 

 

 

 

but  ­­ but  you  have  to  see,  as  Justice  Breyer  asked  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier,  why  are  the  problems?  Isn't  this  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­created  problem?  What  happened  in  Texas

greater  risk  in  abortions,  as  opposed  to  all  the  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedures  that  are  performed  in  non­ASC  facilities?

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  28  percent  higher.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

mean  ­­

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  But  legislatures  react  to 

  

 

 

 

 

topics  that  are  of  public  concern.  In  Gonzales,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  noted  after  Dr.  Haskell's  procedure  for  partial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

birth  abortion  became  more  of  a  nationwide  concern, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

States  reacted.  When  the  legislature  sees  that  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  problem,  and  maybe  that  there  wouldn't  rise  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  level  of  a  Gosnell  problem,  but  the  legislature  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

still  act  to  make  abortion  safer,  which  is  precisely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  Texas  did  here. 

 

 

 

            

If  I  can  address  my  friend's  contention  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  record  as  to  what  clinics  closed  preemptively. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  is  evidence  in  the  record  that  Killeen,  McCallen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  El  Paso,  three  clinics,  closed  preemptively.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  as­applied  challenges  in  McCallen  and  prevailed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  brought  their  as­applied  challenge  in  El  Paso  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  not  prevail.  And  the  Killeen  clinic  did  not  seek 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as­applied  relief. 

 

            

Indeed,  if  there  are  any  future  concerns, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as­applied  challenges  can  be  raised.  For  instance,  the

turn  out  that  there  were  going  to  be  an  issue  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

area,  a  future  as­applied  challenge  could  address  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

concern. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Well,  that's  the  problem. 

  

 

 

 

 

Once  a  clinic  closes  ­­ you  said  McCallen  reopened,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  was  very  swift.  Once  a  clinic  closes,  equipment 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

are  gone,  the  doctors  are  gone,  you  can't  reinstate  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tomorrow.  It  won't  be  there.  There  will  be  no  remedy 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  that  woman  who  succeeds  in  the  as­applied  challenge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  my  time  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

expired,  if  may  address  it. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

MR.  KELLER:  Except  even  there,  the  clinic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

was  not  just  closed  for  a  single  day.  It  was  closed  for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  longer  period  of  time.  And  there  was  an  El  Paso 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinic  that  actually  reopened  also  months  later.  So  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as­applied  challenge  could  allow  a  clinic,  if  an  undue 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden,  if  a  substantial  obstacle  were  shown  because  of

MR.  KELLER:  Planned  Parenthood  had  four 

  

 

 

 

 

clinics  in  West  Texas.  They  all  closed  before  any  part 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  HB2  was  actually  put  into  effect.  They  could  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought  an  as­applied  challenge.  They  didn't.  Planned 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Parenthood  did  not  join  this  lawsuit.  They  were  part  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  first  lawsuit.  And  indeed,  the  facial  challenges 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  are  barred  by  res  judicata  and  there  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  record  gaps. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  May  I  ask  you  one 

   

  

 

 

 

question?  You  earlier  in  your  argument,  you  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

quoting  how  many  women  are  within  a  reasonable  range  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  clinic.  But  don't  we  know  from  Casey  that  the  focus 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must  be  on  the  ones  who  are  burdened  and  not  the  ones 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  aren't  burdened?  There  ­­ there  is  ­­ and  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  said,  you  know,  this  is  not  a  problem  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

women  who  have  means  to  travel,  that  those  women  will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  access  to  abortion,  anyway.  So  ­­ in  Texas  or  out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Texas. 

 

            

So  Casey  was  quite  precise  in  this,  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  talking  about  husbands  and  notification.  You  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  to  all  the  women  who  are  getting  abortions.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  only  to  the  ­­ to  the  ­­ the  women  for  whom  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  problem.  And  so  the  only  women  we  would  be  looking  at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  all  of  the  women  who  are  ­­ who  live  in  Austin  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Dallas,  but  the  women  who  have  the  problem  who  don't

MR.  KELLER:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Isn't  that  the  clear 

  

 

 

 

 

message  of  Casey  and  the  husband  notification  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  KELLER:  When  a  law  ­­

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ exception? 

  

 

 

MR.  KELLER:  When  a  law  is  regulating  women, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

as  it  would  in  the  spousal­notification  provision,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  be  different.  But  when  we're  talking  about  doctor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  clinic  regulations,  when  the  law  is  going  to  have  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant  effect,  is  going  to  be  for  every  doctor  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  clinic,  which  is  precisely  why  the  Fifth  Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

noted  that  that  was  the  proper  denominator,  all  women  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas  reproductive  age.  And  Petitioners  have  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

challenged  that  denominator  holding  in  their  opening 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  this  is  about  ­­ what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  about  is  that  a  woman  has  a  fundamental  right  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  this  choice  for  herself.  That's  what  we  sought  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  starting  premise.  And  then  this  is  certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  ­­ Casey  ­­ Casey  made  that  plain,  that  it  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focus  is  on  the  woman,  and  it  has  to  be  on  the  segment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  women  who  are  affected. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  KELLER:  Yes.  And  ­­ and  the  right  held 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  women  to  make  that  ultimate  decision  is  not  burdened

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  STEPHANIE  TOTI 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  Thank  you. 

  

 

 

              

A  few  brief  points.  First,  the  record  cites 

  

 

 

 

 

 

from  earlier  evidence  that  HB2  caused  clinics  to  close 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Texas.  The  plaintiffs  testified  that  HB2  caused 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinics  in  Killeen,  Austin,  Beaumont,  McAllen,  and  El 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Paso  to  close,  and  that  testimony  is  at  JA  339,  715,  722 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  731. 

 

            

Respondents  stipulated  at  JA  183  and  184 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ASC  requirement  would  cause  any  licensed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abortion  facility  still  operating  on  the  day  it  took 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  to  close. 

 

 

            

Plaintiffs'  Exhibit  28  at  page  2,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  in  the  Joint  Appendix  but  was  admitted  in  the  record 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  2808  and  09,  demonstrates  that  for  the  five  years

prior  to  the  enactment  of  HB2,  the  number  of  abortion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clinics  in  Texas  remained  fairly  constant. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  finally,  at  JA  229  and  1430,  there  is  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  229,  testimony  from  Dr.  Grossman,  and  at  439,  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

response  to  the  Fifth  Circuit's  directive  showing  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  clinics  closed  on  the  day  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

admitting­privileges  requirement  was  ­­

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  that  ­­ that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  last  evidence  was  from  Dr.  Grossman? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  JA  229  is  from  Dr.  Grossman's. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  At  page  232,  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said,  "I  am  not  here  offering  any  opinion  on  the  cause 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  decline  in  the  number  of  abortion  facilities." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  That's  correct.  Dr.  Grossman  did 

  

  

 

 

 

 

not  offer  an  opinion  on  that.  But  his  testimony 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supplies  the  fact,  from  which  the  district  court  drew 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  inference,  that  11  clinics  closed  on  the  day  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  first  enforced  the  admitting­privileges 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement.  The  district  court  referred  from  that  fact 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  enforcement  was  the  cause  of  the  closure,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondents  offered  no  alternative  explanation  for  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  would  be  such  a  precipitous  drop  in  the  number  of

says  that  Planned  Parenthood  ­­ that  ASC  and  the  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  admitting  privileges  had  nothing  to  do  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closures  in  the  western  area  of  Texas. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  Well,  the  ­­ the  two  clinics  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

El  Paso,  which  is  in  ­­ in  ­­ in  that  western  region  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas  that  would  be  forced  to  close  as  a  result  of  these 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements,  are  not  operated  by  Planned  Parenthood. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Planned  Parenthood  doesn't  have  any  clinics  in  Texas. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  plaintiff  in  this  case  and  another  independent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provider  operate  those  clinics. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  And  as  to  the  ­­ the  clinics 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  there  is  direct  evidence,  does  the  direct  evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  whether  the  cause  was  the  admitting­privileges 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  or  the  ASC  requirement  or  both? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  It  ­­ it  ­­ with  respect  to  ­­ it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  specify.  And  some  specify  the  admitting­privileges 

  

 

 

 

 

 

requirement,  and  some  specify  the  ASC  requirement.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  specify  both. 

 

 

            

So  with  respect  to  whether  abortion  can  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulated  differently  than  other  medical  procedures, 

 

 

 

 

 

abortion  can  certainly  be  treated  differently,  if  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  reason  to  treat  it  differently.  But  Texas  may  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impose  unnecessary  medical  regulations  that  burden 

 

 

 

 

 

women's  access  to  abortion.

court's  decision. 

 

            

That  is  not  the  case  here.  There  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

extensive  testimony  in  the  record  that  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirements  are  not  medically  justified.  They  are  not

amicus  briefs  from  leading  medical  associations, 

 

 

 

 

 

including  the  AMA  and  ACOG,  confirming  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Do  you  think  that  Federal

may  or  may  not  have  to  be  performed  in  an  ­­ in  an  ASC? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  TOTI:  Your  Honor,  district  courts  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

quite  competent  to  determine  the  credibility  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliability  of  expert  testimony.  That's  something 

  

 

 

 

 

that's  within  the  core  competence  of  a  trial  court.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  trial  court  in  this  case  determined  that  there  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  credible  or  reliable  evidence  supporting  Texas's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contentions  about  the  medical  justification  for  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws.

these  laws  provided  some  important  benefit  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outpatient  surgery,  it  would  have  made  them  generally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable. 

            

All  outpatient  surgical  providers  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  admitting  privileges  or  practice  in  an  ASC,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  not  the  case. 

 

 

 

            

Texas  law  expressly  authorizes  other 

 

 

 

 

surgical  procedures,  including  those  performed  under 

 

 

 

 

 

general  anesthesia  ­­ which  early  abortion  is  not  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  performed  in  the  physician's  office.  And  even  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

physicians  that  operate  at  an  ASC  aren't  required  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  admitting  privileges.  The  facility  is  merely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

required  to  have  a  transfer  agreement.  So  these 

   

  

 

 

 

 

regulations  target  one  of  the  safest  procedures  that  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patient  can  have  in  an  outpatient  setting  for  the  most
