But to answer your question, Congress 

1  decide that, and Quicken didn't --
2
3  do -- decide theoretically, in the context of a case 
4  that does not involve paying a fee for a service that 
doesn't exist, whether you can pay for a service that 
5
6  doesn't exist? 
7
 MR. RUSSELL:  I think you can take it on the 
8  same assumption that the court of appeals did, that the 
9  fee was unearned, and decide the question presented.

amended the statute specifically to overrule the Sixth 
Circuit's decision in Graham, which held that loan 
discount fees were not covered by the statute, in that 
case involving a kickback.  I know Quicken argues that 
that case involved origination fees.  We don't think 
that's correct.  But this is -- this is an issue you 
could have an entire case about. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  How? 
 MR. RUSSELL:  And -- but --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What's -- what's the 

argument on the other side?  A point is a way of paying 
more money, i.e., borrowing less.  Since you pay more, 
that means you borrow less.  And so, your interest rate 
is lower because you’ve borrowed less.  Now, what's the 
argument on the other side? 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. RUSSELL:  The argument is Congress 


 Now, you can have debates -- and we will 


mean for a loan discount fee to be unearned.  But for 
present purposes, the circuit split arose here in the much 
more common circumstance, when there are unearned fees 
for appraisals and courier fees, and -- and that's what 
the lower court decided on the basis of.  And it did 
so --

1
2  specifically defined the term "real estate settlement 

3  service" to include the origination of the loan, which 

4  includes but is not limited to the funding of the loan. 

And it did that in order to encompass kickbacks, at the 

5
6  very least, involving loan discount points, which was 

7  what is at issue in Graham.

18  two reasons, we don't have to decide which of the two 
19  we -- we're precluded from considering, right? 
20
21 
22
23  just as well to say that the question presented here 
24  decides the case as it would be to say that the question 
25

raised by Justice Breyer decides the case, right? 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I suppose if -- if 

MR. RUSSELL:  No, I don't think you're 

precluded from considering -- I --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, it’s -- it would be

 MR. RUSSELL:  There are several reasons. 

One is the lower courts did not address this question. 

 And so, if I could turn to that, if you look 

provision of the statute that Congress amended to deal 

 MR. RUSSELL:  Right.  I --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And is there any reason to 

1
2
3  put the one before the other? 
4
5
6  Quicken hasn't briefed it to any extent.  Quicken 
7  doesn't ask you to decide it on the base of that 
8  question.  We haven't briefed it.  It's a complicated 
9  question that involves interpretation of another 
10
11  specifically with this problem.  And it wouldn't 
12  solve -- it wouldn't resolve the circuit conflict that 
13  the Court granted cert to decide. 
14
at the language of the statute, which is reproduced on 
15
16  page 6a of the -- the blue brief, in the words of the 
17  statute, a lender who charges an unearned fee, accepts, 
18  within the meaning of the statute, a portion, split, or 
19  percentage, i.e., 100 percent, of a charge that was made 
20
21  service other than for services actually performed. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- your argument 
22
23  that "percentage" can include 100 percent is certainly 
24  true as a matter of logic.  But in the phrase "portion, 
split, or percentage," I think the more natural reading 
25

for the rendering of a covered real estate settlement 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I think "portion" is the 

1  of "percentage" is something less than 100 percent.  In 
2  other words, you're apportioning or you're splitting the 
3  fee with somebody else. 
4
 MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You could have --
5
6  "portion" I suppose could still mean a full portion; 
7  "split" probably not.  But, I mean, the more natural 
8  reading is surely a division. 
9
word that best fits this situation.  And Congress has 
10
11  used the phrase "portion" in other state -- in other 
12  statutes to prohibit, for example, a public official 
13  from converting to personal use any portion of the funds 
14  entrusted to him --
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22 
23
24  split, or percentage," it seems to me the natural 
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It could mean that, but it 
need not mean that.  It could mean either that or just 
-- just part and not whole; and which of the two it 
means is often decided by the other words with which 
it's associated.  I mean, if you have a phrase that 
says, you know, "tacks, nails, and" -- what?  "Tacks, 
nails, and wooden pegs," it's clear that "nails" doesn't 
mean toenails; it -- it means a fastener. 

 And so, also here, when it says "portion, 

reading is that portion or percentage means not, as it 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I would -- I would say 

something, I think the ordinary understanding is that 

1  could mean, the whole, but rather just a portion. 
2
3  two things about that.  One is that when you have a 
4  statute that forbids somebody from taking any portion of 
5
6  prohibits them from taking the whole of the thing.  The 
7  embezzlement statutes are an example of that. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not what we have. 
8
9  We have -- we have a statute that says you shall not 
10
11
 MR. RUSSELL:  Right. 
12
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay? 
13
 MR. RUSSELL:  And so, the canon, though, I 
14  don't think, is a canon that says when you have related 
15
16  certainly have something in common.  They're all the 
17  measure of something, but the canon doesn't say that you 
18  read them to all mean the same measure of something, 
19  which would run headlong, I think, into the canon 
20
21
22  reason -- one objection to your idea that, well, this 
23  covers partial, so it must cover 100 percent, is that 
24  it's a very different issue if you're talking about 
25

partial and 100 percent.  If you're talking about 

against construing statutes to have surplusage. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the -- one 

take any portion or split. 

words, you give them all the same meaning.  They 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

MR. RUSSELL:  Well, you still have to 

 In this case, for example, you get a whole 
bunch of things from Quicken Loans, including the loan 

1  partial, you have a classic case of a -- a kickback. 
2  But if you suddenly say 100 percent of an unearned fee, 
3  that's a much more difficult question to decide. 
4
5
6  and all this other stuff, and it's kind of hard to 
7  single out, well, this part is unearned but this part is 
8  earned; it's kind of a whole package.  When you have a 
9  portion or split, it's an entirely different issue. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  it's a more -- it's a narrower issue when you're talking 
18  about a portion.  Let's say the kickback goes to the 
19  appraiser.  Maybe you can decide in that case whether 
20
21  appraisal at all. 
 When the alleged unearned fee goes to the 
22
23  whole loan company, it's a little harder to say which 
24  part was unearned and which parts might have been 
25

decide, when you're talking about a kickback, whether 
the person who received the kickback has done anything 
to earn their portion of it.  And so, I don't think you 
avoid the question of what does it mean for a fee to be 
unearned entirely. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, but there --

the loan company really had anything to do with the 

earned. 

10

courier services, flood certifications --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  How does that work? 

 MR. RUSSELL:  But --
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's just -- it's 

1
2
3  the way these loans work, right?  I mean, it's the same 
4  thing whether you pay 10 percent and no points or 9 
percent and 3 points.  You know, which one of those is 
5
6  earned or unearned, it's kind of hard to sort it out. 
7
 MR. RUSSELL:  It's certainly harder to sort 
8  out with respect to loan discount fees.  But the run of 
9  the mine cases here involve things like appraisals, 
10
11
12  The bank says to Mr. Smith we are going to charge you 
13  $100 for a courier service.  And then they don't.  So, 
14  there it is on the bill.  And Mr. Smith, really knowing 
he didn't get the courier service, pays the $100.  All 
15
16  right?  Why isn't Mr. Smith guilty, on your 
17  interpretation? 
18
19  innocent consumer is guilty of a crime.

creates a safe harbor for people who give or accept

JUSTICE BREYER:  So, you -- I don't 

understand that.  It's my fault.  But wouldn't -- it 
says that if she doesn't get the appraisal, but she has 
to pay for it, then why isn't she -- why hasn't -- why 
doesn't she fall within the statute? 

1  charges for services actually performed.  And the 
2  critical word here is "for."  What a consumer is paying 
3  "for" is what she has been charged "for." 
4
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 
MR. RUSSELL:  If she has been charged for an 
5
6  appraisal, what she is giving the charge for is for the 
7  appraisal.  If the appraisal wasn't performed, that 
8  shows she didn't get what she paid for, but it doesn't 
9  change what she was paying "for."  Now --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 
 MR. RUSSELL:  And I think that latter 

MR. RUSSELL:  I think that there are two 

ways you can construe what it means to pay a charge for. 
One is what it is you actually got --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What you got was nothing. 
 MR. RUSSELL:  -- which was nothing.  The 
other is what you are actually charged for, which was

18  saying when the bank writes down, "pay $100 for the 
19  courier service," the bank is charging for the courier 
20
 MR. RUSSELL:  Right. 
21
 JUSTICE BREYER:  When the consumer pays for 
22
23  the courier service which he sees there, the consumer is 
24  not paying for the courier service.  He is paying for 
25

different, depending on whether you're looking from the 
perspective of accepting or receiving, what the charge 
is for.  So, for example, if you were to go to your 
mechanic and you were charged for an oil change but you 
didn't get one, it would be perfectly natural for you to 
say I was charged for and I paid for an oil change.

20

 MR. RUSSELL:  No.  In a traditional kickback

8  of the fee to a real estate agent for nothing, for the 
9  referral of the business, which isn't for a service

18 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Russell, there's one 
19
puzzling aspect of -- of your interpretation.  It would 
20
21  be a rather large thing for Congress to say we're going 
22  to cover overcharges, as I believe HUD says is --
23  counts; and yet, in the -- in the purposes of the Act on 
24  page 1 of the appendix, it says nothing about 
25

provision does double duty.  It is designed and written 
broadly to encompass both traditional kickback 
situations and unearned fee provisions. 

overcharges, nothing about payment for a service not 

MR. RUSSELL:  That's correct.  This 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that is -- that is 

MR. RUSSELL:  That is one of HUD's 

interpretations, although it's an interpretation about 
what it means for something to be unearned, not having 
anything to do with whether split fees are covered or 
not. 

1  received in the -- in the four -- "it is the purpose of 
2  the Act to," and then there are four things listed, and 
3  none of those say to stop charges for services that 
4  weren't performed. 
MR. RUSSELL:  That's true.  First, just to 
5
6  clarify, we don't -- we're not arguing that it covers 
7  overcharges in the sense of excessive charges.

19
20
21  essentially the issuance of a -- of a price schedule by 
22  HUD, and anything above these prices is an overcharge 
23  and hence falls under -- under this provision.  That's 
24  immense. 
25

we know that that enumeration is not comprehensive. 
There are other things in the statute that are not 
included.  And the general purpose of the statute --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But nothing as big as this,

fact, Your Honor did in Smith v. City of Jackson, where 
you held that a provision of a regulation recognizing 
disparate impact was entitled to deference, but a 
provision saying what you had to prove to show a 
disparate impact violation wasn't.  And here 
similarly -- I mean, particularly the overcharge part of 
the interpretation is not even in the regulations.  It's

18  two separate actions, giving an unearned fee and 
19  accepting one.  Sometimes the statute will be violated 
when an unearned fee is collected from the consumer and 
20
21  then shared between two service providers.  But the 
22  statute is also violated when a service provider 
23  collects an unearned fee directly from the consumer and 
24  retains the entire fee for itself.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but I assume that 
HUD's interpretation of a criminal statute like ours 
must give the defendant the benefit of the doubt so that 
if there's any ambiguity -- I mean, that's our standard 
rule.  If there's a genuine ambiguity, you -- you find 
for the interpretation that favors the defendant.  And 
this here -- I think this is at the very least 
ambiguous.  And you are telling me -- well, I guess 
you're right.  I guess HUD is favoring what would be the 
defendant in this case. 

MS. O'CONNELL:  If -- yes, it -- it's saying

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But can you -- I don't want 

1  that it doesn't think that a consumer violates the 
2  statute because the consumer doesn't pay the fee other 
3  than for services actually performed. 
4
to take all your time on this because to me the more 
5
6  important problem was the problem of the difference 
7  between a kickback statute, which we could understand as 
8  well within HUD's expertise and normal and of course 
9  very good reason for doing it.  But a price control 
statute, where we have the Federal agency deciding 
10
11  whether the prices are accurate for each service that is 
12  rendered or whether some percentage or all of it 
13  represents service for nothing -- that's a rather big 
14  novelty in American life.  That is, we have it, but 
they are usually Federal agencies that have a system 
15
16  set up for determining proper prices and so forth. 
17
18  inadvertently Congress brought in the second under the 
19  guise of the first without a big fuss being raised and a 
20
21
 MS. O'CONNELL:  Justice Breyer, I think the 
22  important -- important point here is that this is not an 
23  overcharge case; this is an unearned fee case. 
24  Overcharges are included in the 2001 policy statement, 
25

but there is a basis in the statute to differentiate 

 So, it's hard for me to believe that sort of 

big debate and so forth.

2  taken the position that undivided unearned fees, a fee 
3  for which no service is performed, violates section 
4  2607(b).

9  reduction in the interest rate.  That is an unearned fee 
10
11
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  It looks to me as though you 
12  have an additional statutory problem.  You have two sets 
13  of verbs in this statute.  One is the "give and accept" 
14  set of verbs, and then the other is the "charge made or 
received."  So, it seems to me that what the statute is 
15
16  -- is thinking about is that first, that there is a charge 
17  made or received, and that charge is, of course, the 
18  charge that the consumer pays to the provider.  And then 
19  there's another transaction.  And that transaction is 
the "give or accept" transaction, and that transaction 
20
21  occurs between two service providers.  So, one set of 
22  verbs refers to the consumer-provider relationship; the 
23  other set of verbs refers to the provider-provider 
24  relationship.

MS. O'CONNELL:  Justice Kagan, we agree that

overcharges are reached by the statute.  You say not 

giver and acceptor.  So, once the charge is received 

and accepting, but it doesn't have to involve two 
service providers under the plain language of the 
statute. 

1  that -- that is one scenario covered by 2607(b).  We 
2  don't think it's the only scenario covered by the 
3  statute.  Under our interpretation and Petitioners' 
4  interpretation, there doesn't have to be both a culpable

14  splitting HUD's position.  HUD's position says 
15
16  overcharges, but only a fee when no service is 
17  performed.  So, why couldn't the customers have said 
18  there is a fee for the service performed, that's the 
19  reasonable fee; and the rest of it is a charge for a 
20
21
22  distinction between an overcharge and a fee for services 
23  that are not performed? 
24

 MS. O'CONNELL:  Justice Ginsburg, in this 

case, we don't think that the Court has to -- has to say

 MS. O'CONNELL:  Right.  Our understanding is 

procured nothing for the Petitioners.  It was a 

1  anything about overcharges and whether those are covered 
2  by the statute.  The fee in this case was a loan 
3  discount fee, which is generally paid to procure a 
4  reduction in the interest rate of the loan, and it 
5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. HEFFERON 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 MR. HEFFERON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 In passing RESPA in 1974, Congress was 

28
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 First, its major reform was to standardize 
and increase disclosure of charges, including requiring 

1  controlled by State law.  The statute shows that, in 
2  doing so, Congress tread carefully.  It did primarily 
3  two things in the area of settlement charges. 
4
5
6  a written estimate of charges to be given to people 
7  weeks before the closing.  That, in fact, was done here. 
 Second, as RESPA's finding and purposes 
8
9  section tells us, Congress found that some consumers 
needed particular protection from a particular market 
10
11 
failure.  And I'm quoting from section 2601 in the first 
page of the blue brief.  Quote:  "unnecessarily high 
12 
13 
settlement charges caused by certain abusive practices 
that have developed in some areas of the country." 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21 
22
23  right about subsection (b) and its meaning, what does it 
24  do that subsection (a) does not do? 
25

Congress identified those as kickbacks and 
referral fees.  But in 1974, Congress went no farther. 
It rejected proposals for direct price regulation which 
had been proposed in both House and Senate.  Congress 
did recognize more legislation might be necessary and 
that price controls might be advisable.  And so, it sent 
HUD out to do a study and report back. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Hefferon, if you are 

MR. HEFFERON:  It -- it does two things.

didn't make any reference to an agreement? 

1  First of all, with respect to the transactions that 

2  relate to charges actually paid at the closing, it 

3  eliminates the need to prove an agreement.  All it --

4  all it says is that there will be a violation if you 

follow the money and the money ends up in the hands --
5
6
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, if that's the case, I 
7  mean, why would Congress have done something that says 
8  (a) pursuant to an agreement, (b) not pursuant to an 
9  agreement?  Why wouldn't it just have one provision that 
10
11
 MR. HEFFERON:  Because (a) covers an entire 
12  universe of things which appear, in many instances, away 
13  from the closing table.  For example, an agreement 
14  between an attorney and a developer that the attorney 
says I will do all the title work on the raw land for 
15
16  this development if you later on send me the closings 
17  when you build on the land and sell the particular 
18  parcels. 
19
20
21  then any relationship between two people in the 
22  settlement service business would be presumptively a 
23  kickback.  And so, you had to have that. 
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, well, (a) -- the 
so-called kickback in (a) is not for services not

finder's fee. 

 So, you know, under (a) a finder's fee is --

1  actually performed.  The referral -- the referral is 
2  certainly a service performed to the lender.  There's --
3  there's nothing -- what should I say -- unethical about 
4  getting a fee for a referral.  It's -- it's called a

10
11
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And under (b), something 
12  quite different, and that is giving money to somebody 
13  who performs no service at all is made unlawful.  And 
14  for that, you don't need an agreement, right? 
15
16 
17
18  reading, as I understand it, the words "portion, split, 
19  or percentage" means an amount less than the whole? 
20
21
22  service provider gives 100 percent to the other side, as 
23  opposed to a -- an amount less than the whole? 
24
25

MR. HEFFERON:  That's correct. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, what happens if a 

need to prove one.  I think all parties here --

 MR. HEFFERON:  We don't believe that it is 

covered by section 8(b).  In most -- in section 2607(b).

(b)? 

1  In most instances, it would probably be provable as a

3  one doesn't give all of one's fee away unless there's 

4  something else going on, typically in this instance a 

5
6
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that -- does that 
7  make much sense that if you give one meaning -- if you 
8  stay consistent with your meaning, what you're saying is 
9  a situation where the service provider gives away 
10

Higginbotham, in his dissent, said there is a big 
difference between unearned fees and overcharge fees. 
He said unearned fees, in their simplest form, is no 
service whatsoever.  Overcharges are some service but an 
excessive value. 

 MR. HEFFERON:  That --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If they give away 1 

MR. HEFFERON:  That's correct.  Again, 

Congress was trying to take a measured step here because 
it was for the first time stepping into this local 
market.  Congress left State law remedies alone.  And in 
fact, the preemption provision --

32

 What's wrong with that definition?  Why is 

 MR. HEFFERON:  If the Court would find that 
"portion, split, or percentage" covers 100 percent, then 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is this 100 percent 
thing -- is this a real problem that Congress was 
addressing?  Do you know of any 100 percent kickbacks or 
100 percent payments to somebody else for services not 
performed as opposed to just keeping part and giving the 
rest? 

1
2  that definition unworkable in terms of limiting and 
3  defining this statute? 
4
5
6  we would agree with Judge Higginbotham that it would --

8  situation where the person performed no services 
9  whatsoever for a fee.

19  and referral fees, which it referred to, for example, as 
rebates and commissions, unearned commissions.  And the 
20
21  type of conduct which Congress meant to address was set 
22  forth in this statute and in the legislative history. 
23  And it, of course, deputized HUD to do a study to see if

that -- that a fee for a referral is -- is not properly

section, the title, is "Kickbacks and Unearned Fees." 
That refers to the entire section, (a) and (b).  All 
agree that 2607(b) frequently is -- is implicated if

7  time working on in this case -- HUD says very little 
8  about that.  And it is -- also it doesn't --

19  think that that's true, that -- we defer to agencies, 
not because we think that agencies do statutory 
20
21  interpretation in exactly the way courts do.  We 
22  actually defer to agencies because we think they provide 
23  something different, not because they're the best parser 
24  of statutory language, but because when they see

on the other side.  It's a strong argument.  Have you --
has anybody looked at that notice-and-comment

2  give the policy statement deference because in order to 

3  get to the policy statement, you have to assume the 

4  statute's ambiguous and then assume the regulation's 

5
6  statement.  It would be appropriate for this Court to 

7  impress upon the agency to be quite clear and to be

and believe HUD at the time read the regulation as, 
again, merely repeating the idea that this was -- this 
section was a limited section consistent with 
Congress's --

MR. HEFFERON:  In Long Island Care at Home, 
the Court merely repeated in particular statements made 
in Chevron and Mead that, among other things, a 
regulation cannot get deference unless it -- if it is 
procedurally defective.  And in this instance -- and it 
talked about the fact that a circumstance sometimes

And, in this instance, that's precisely what

rules, pass rules and regulations, and give 
interpretations.  So, what's the procedural defect in it 
just giving an interpretation? 

1  arises when a notice of proposed rule doesn't give the

7  standing, when we believe -- and we cite in the -- in

 MR. HEFFERON:  I believe that that was -- I

24  in Long Island Care at Home.  But the -- the question 
for the Court in this instance is, should it give this 
25

aside the notice-and-comment point, which I think is at 
least ambiguous, which of our cases stands for the 
proposition that whether or not we give Chevron 
deference depends on the thoroughness with which the 
agency addressed an issue, rather than simply an 
announcement of its interpretation? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Which -- putting

3  the power to persuade?  Part of the power to persuade is 
4  its thoroughness; as Skidmore itself says, the detail in 
which it addresses things, how it addresses arguments on 
5
6  the other side, and what it says about those arguments.

3
4  confused.  Under your interpretation or theirs, the 
5
6  services were rendered.  I mean, it's not as if your 
7  interpretation is going to keep the court out of that 
8  business.  To be able to find a kickback, the court has 
9  to determine whether services were rendered or not.  So, 
what's the difference in that inquiry when it involves a 
10
11 
kickback and when it involves a -- a single provider? 
12
 In a kickback situation, the court has to 
13  decide whether there was actually a service rendered 
14  that entitled the person to a percentage or not,

25

MR. HEFFERON:  We agree that in each 
instance, the court would have to make a factual 
determination.  But it comes back to what Congress 
intended in 1974.  It specifically identified that it 
was attempting to address certain abusive practices that 
had arisen in some areas.

5
6  The issue was unearned fees, rendering -- charging for a 
7  service you didn't render.  That's what the whole

12  earlier answer?  I was just waiting for your point, and 
13  it never came.

 MR. HEFFERON:  On the question of whether or 
not to provide Chevron -- actually provide deference, if 
15
16  Chevron was applicable?  If Chevron's applicable to the 
17  policy statement, the policy statement does not deserve 
18  Chevron deference because it is an irrational reading of 
19  the statute.  The statute does not cover the kinds of 
direct regulation that the policy statement suggests 
20
21  that it covers. 
22
23  right that we never get to Chevron deference here 
24  because the statute is plain on its face, and there's no 
ambiguity for the -- the agency to think or do anything 
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Hefferon, you might be

 So, then, what's your argument for why there 

1  about.  But let's just assume that there is ambiguity on 
2  the statute, and the question is whether to provide this 
3  interpretation with Chevron deference. 
4
should be no Chevron deference to this interpretation, 
5
6  given that the statute under which this interpretation 
7  was promulgated refers identically to regulations and 
8  interpretations as something that HUD gets to do? 
 MR. HEFFERON:  Well, the statute does give 
9
HUD interpretive authority, but in this instance, what 
10
11  it is doing -- in fact, it's not quite clear what words 
12  it is interpreting in a way, trying -- trying to 
13  interpret the words and any vague aspects of the 
14  words -- is not a gap-filling situation that we're 
15
16
 Congress reasonably in this statute, as well 
17  as in the Truth in Lending Act, provided that the agency 
18  would have interpretive authority.  A lot of what this 
19  agency was going to be doing with respect to this 
statute is filling a lot of gaps.  It's going to create

17  question?  The question that HUD sometimes -- if HUD is 
18  deciding what form should go on the form, then that's 
19  interstitial lawmaking, and that's certainly something 
that might get more deference than if the question is 
20
21  interpreting the legal effect of these words that appear 
22  in 2607(b).  It is not -- it's not a definition; they're

through the interpretative --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now that's just a way of saying 

1  would look towards a Chevron deference.  But Congress is

3  decided not to allow direct regulation of charges, that 

4  HUD would nonetheless try to do it through the back door

9  that if there is ambiguity here, I -- at least I have 
not found a reason not to give HUD deference in this

situation.  I mean, you say they didn't do a very good 
job.  But we don't usually grade agencies like that, and

22  relevant.  And then if you've looked at all this, which 
23  you could tell me you haven't -- I will try to -- but 
24  what do you find? 
25

differently about the answer.  So, the -- which is why 
from my perspective --- and perhaps you're only 
answering a question for me and no one else has it --
but I would be pretty interested to know whether when 
you looked at the legislative history of this, what you 
discovered was a lot of complaints about consumers 
paying for things they didn't get, period.  Which favors 
HUD's interpretation. 

 Or whether you see a whole long list of

areas of the country.  This was not meant to be a 
panacea.  State law remedies stayed in place.  And, in 
fact, if you look at most of the court of appeals cases 
that give rise to these -- this circuit split, they all 
also bring a claim under State law, whether it's fraud 
or contract or unjust enrichment.

2  providers doing things between each other and a

4  unknowingly are being harmed by that.  The Senate Report

7  commissions, and kickbacks and referral fees. 
 That's what Congress identified in 2601 as

10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  not irrational for Congress to have decided, when it was 
18  taking a step into this area for the first time, to 
19  actually legislate an important area, but not go all the 
way, and instead leave other remedies in place.  And

agents where the agent would get 10 percent of the title 
premium; in exchange, the agent would do the title work. 
In a situation -- if the title agent in fact 

1  not?  So, one suggestion that's made is, well, you 

2  didn't -- if all this statute has to do -- do with is 

3  kickbacks, then all you need is (a), and there's no 

4  necessity for (b).  You said one thing is contract, 

5

7  Actually, I didn't give a complete answer now that I 
8  recall.  It does cover -- the best example is the 
9  classic reason why the -- this section was put in, in

22 
 So, that situation would be covered, but 
23
24  most situations, as I think all parties agree, this 
25

didn't do the title work, it would be receiving an 
unearned fee, that is, part of the title insurance 
commission, for no work.  And that, however, would not 
normally be covered under (a) because the agreement, the 
underlying agreement to give the commission was not to 
refer business; it was actually to do some of the title 
work.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And under -- under (b), 
3  there doesn't have to be an agreement to pay -- under 
4  (b) there doesn't have to be an agreement to pay the 
title company for no work.  It's just if it's a -- if 
5
6  it's a refinancing and the title company did the same 
7  title search, you know, 2 years ago, it says, heck, I'm 
8  not going to do it again, but it still gets the 10 
9  percent, right? 
10

12  agreement to pay it for no work. 
13
14
Circuit's interpretation are all supportive of our view, 
15
16  that is, that the language, the structure, the context, 
17  and the history of this statute all show that it is 
18  important, but it's limited; and it does not address 
19  direct charges made by lenders.  And the Fifth Circuit 
20
21
22  back to Justice Scalia's question?  If a -- if a bank 
23  has an appraisal fee from the past and decides I don't 
24  need a new one, but still charges you for an appraisal 
25

 MR. HEFFERON:  That's correct. 
 So, in sum, the elements of the Fifth 

had it right. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Could you go

 MR. HEFFERON:  If the -- I think the

redo the work, but still charges you a second time, 
they're not liable under your reading of the statute? 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They'd be liable under

13
 Justice Breyer, you had asked why Congress 
14  would engage in a statute that gets at overcharges and 
15
16  unusual, and I agree it's unusual.  That's a reason to 
17  read this statute not to do that, to only get at truly 
18  unearned fees, which are the equivalent of fraudulent 
19  fees, which the law does forbid pervasively.  In this 
20
21
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Once you say that, you're 
22  -- you're outside the reg.  I mean, when you read the 
23  reg and the policy statement, it's pretty clear what 
24  they are thinking of. 
25

has a rate regulation kind of thing, which is very 

case, Congress --

MR. RUSSELL:  No, to be --

correct. 

 MR. RUSSELL:  No, I don't think that's 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No? 
 MR. RUSSELL:  I think that there was a 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And the policy statement is 
1
2  even clearer.  What they are thinking of is overcharges, 
3  period. 
4
5
6
7
8  two-step analysis.  The first step is they decided that 
9  split fees are not the only thing that the statute gets 
at.  And then -- but this -- an unsplit fee still has to 
10
11 
be unearned, and they had a separate interpretation of 
12 
what it means for a fee to be unearned. 
13
14
15
16 
17 
 MR. RUSSELL:  It's towards the end where 
18
19  they enumerate the different kinds of unearned fees. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

-- it's on 53,057.  And what they're explaining is that, 
and they're talking about a third situation, and they 
say one settlement service provider charges a fee to a 
consumer where no work is done, or the fee exceeds the 
reasonable value of the services performed by that 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where do you get --
 MR. RUSSELL:  At any rate --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where is that in the 
policy statement?  The difference between unearned 
and --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's right here.  It's on

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. RUSSELL:  I'm not -- I'm not disagreeing 

with you about that.  They list four different -- or 

 MR. RUSSELL:  That's correct.  They are --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And so, if it exceeds the 

1  provider. 
2
3
4  reasonable value of the services performed by that 
provider, you have to say what is the reasonable value 
5
6  of the services performed by that provider.  And that 
7  involves the agency in the job of deciding what's a fair 
8  or just price for this particular service. 
9
10
11  three or four different kinds of charges that could be 
12  unearned.  You don't have to agree with them with 
13  respect to each of those things, about --
14
15
16  an agency interpretation which is other than what it 
17  says, where what they're trying to do is to change the 
18  nature of the statute from a kickback statute into a 
19  statute that protects consumers across the board from 
20
 MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I would --
21
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, that's where I'm sort 
22
23  of interested in what the legislative history said, et 
24  cetera, et cetera.  It's much more complicated than I 
thought coming in.  I have to look at a lot of things. 
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but what I'm doing 

there, you see, is now I'm trying to make sense out of 

paying for things they don't get. 

58
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. RUSSELL:  Sure.  What Congress said its 

1
2  purpose was, was to get at abusive practices that 
3  unnecessarily increase the costs of settlement.  What --
4  the legislative history was focused on kickbacks, but 
there were examples in the HUD/VA report, at page 16 of 
5
6  that report, and in the Washington Post articles about 
7  markups that are a form of undivided, unearned fee. 
 Congress knew -- subsequent to the passage 
8
9  of this statute, HUD has frequently found and reported 
to Congress incidents of unearned fees, including those 
10
11 
involving loan discount fees.  And the States -- 21 
States have filed a brief in this case telling you that 
12 
13 
there is a pervasive problem with settlement closings 
included padded charges for things that were never 
14 
performed. 
15
16
 With respect to the agency's interpretation, 
17  I would point you particularly to this 1996 rulemaking, 
18  where the agency withdrew an exemption for certain 
19  payments between consumers and providers for the use of 
a particular kind of computer service.  That exemption 
20
21  would have been unnecessary had HUD thought, as Quicken 
22  does, that the statute only regulates transactions 
23  between providers. 
24
25

 And in withdrawing that exemption, HUD 
explained in quite a lot of detail that it rejected

mean, the purpose of this kind of APA/Chevron stuff is 
to prevent agencies, seeing the supreme importance of 
their own mission, taking a statute, running with it and 
in particular transforming into a criminal law something 
that really wasn't much there. 

1  specifically that -- the split fee requirement.  And so, 
2  I don't think there's any question that they've grappled 
3  with this question and that they've explained why they 
4  think that split fees aren't covered. 
The question ultimately is whether that's a 
5
6  reasonable conclusion in light of the language of this 
7  statute --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And then part of that is --
