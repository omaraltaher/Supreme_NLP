JUSTICE STEVENS:  We'll hear argument in case


Number 01-1118, Scheidler against the National


Organization of -- of Women. 


You may proceed.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. ENGLERT:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and


may it please the Court:


This case comes to the Court in a remarkable


posture.  If you agree with the Hobbs Act arguments in the


blue briefs, you should reverse the jury verdicts and


direct entry of judgment for the defendants.  But even if


you believe the arguments in the red and gray briefs, you 

should still reverse, but for a new trial.  And whatever


you do on the Hobbs Act, you should reverse the RICO


injunction because RICO simply does not authorize private


injunctive relief. 


Now, why do I say so starkly that even


respondents and the Government's theories require reversal


of the jury verdict?  Because the attempts in those


briefs, to salvage the theory of plaintiffs' case, concede


that someone must obtain the victim's property for the


offense of extortion to be shown.  And the whole reason

the Court granted cert on the Hobbs Act issue was to


review the Seventh Circuit's holding directly contrary to


those concessions that, quote, a loss to, or interference


with the rights of the victim is all that is required,


closed quote.  Likewise, the jury was instructed that all


it had to find was that the defendants caused someone,


quote, to give up a property right, closed quote.


You will find in the red and gray briefs very


elaborate efforts to suggest meanings of obtain and


property under which the record in this case supposedly


could support a finding that petitioners obtained some


abstract form of property from the clinics or women.  But


no defense of the Seventh Circuit's holding and the jury


instructions that substituted the phrases, interference


with and give up for obtaining. 


So there ought to be no 

question that some form of reversal is required. 


Now, the reason why there should be reversal for


the entry of judgment for the defendants, and not just for


a new trial, is that respondents and the Government's


brief-formulated conceptions of obtaining and property are


wrong.  The essence of the theories is that petitioners


obtained control over the use and disposition of clinic


assets.  To refer to that as obtaining property of


another -- the language of the Hobbs Act -- is an awfully


broad use of language.  It's a far cry from the New York

law on which the Hobbs Act was based. 


QUESTION:  I suppose in some instances one


competitor can buy another competitor's firm and just


close it up in a regular business transaction, and that --


that would be obtaining it in that sense.  Now, of course,


I recognize that title transfers, et cetera, et cetera.


Here the result is about the same.


MR. ENGLERT:  No, Your Honor.  Respectfully,


it's not.  My clients don't have the clinic's property


today as they would if they had, in fact, obtained it. 


They may have temporarily interfered with some use of it.


QUESTION:  Let's assume that the -- that the


boycott or -- or the protests are sufficient to close it


down.  They have obtained it in a certain sense in that


they have obtained -- they have secured for themselves the 

use that they want of it, i.e., no use.


MR. ENGLERT:  That is a sense of the word


obtain, but it's not the sense relevant for interpreting


the Hobbs Act for several reasons.  One is the Hobbs Act


has historical predecessors that this Court has said


should be looked to in interpreting its terms.


QUESTION:  You -- you concede it's a sense of


the term obtained?  I mean, would you really speak of


obtaining somebody's property when you -- when you


interfere with that person's use of it?

 MR. ENGLERT:  Well, I certainly don't -- I'm


sorry, Justice Scalia.  I certainly don't concede it's a


relevant sense of obtain.


Because of -- because of the Hobbs Act


historical antecedents, because of the rule of lenity,


because of the very odd use of language, for all those


reasons, that's not how the Court should interpret obtain.


But more important than any of those things is


the implications of such a theory.  When Carry Nation went


into saloons with her axe and destroyed property, she


certainly interfered with the property owner's unfettered


use and control over disposition of his assets, and that's


exactly what she intended to do.  Was that extortion?


The civil rights boycott of white merchants that


the Court considered in Claiborne Hardware certainly 

affected the ability of the boycotted merchants to use


their property and involved isolated acts of violence as


well.  Was that extortion? 


These aren't hypothetical concerns.


QUESTION:  Of course, that -- extortion wasn't


charged in that case, was it? 


MR. ENGLERT:  No, Your Honor, but were the Court


to uphold the theory in the red and gray briefs, which


wouldn't support the judgment, but if the Court were to


uphold that theory, it certainly could be charged the next

time the facts of Claiborne Hardware come along.


QUESTION:  One must wonder why it wasn't


charged.


MR. ENGLERT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Because it was a State case it


wasn't -- the reason -- reason it wasn't charged.  It grew


up through the Mississippi court system, if I remember


correctly, didn't it? 


MR. ENGLERT:  Well, my -- that's correct, of


course, Justice Stevens.  But my fundamental point is not


that one case was or wasn't charged as -- as extortion. 


It's if you uphold the theory of the red and gray briefs,


it can be charged as extortion in the future.  And that's


actually happened to People for the Ethical Treatment of


Animals. 


It's happened to other animal rights groups. 

Because of these implications, the Southern Christian


Leadership Conference joined the amicus brief of the


Seamless Garment Network at the cert stage.  Disability


rights groups that conduct protests have joined the


Seamless Garment Network brief at the merits stage. 


Activists of all stripes and their admirers -- Daniel and


Philip Berrigan, Nat Hentoff, Martin Sheen --


QUESTION:  But are we talking about actions that


constitute the commission of some kind of criminal offense


in the process?

QUESTION:  Yes, and other things, destruction of


property and so forth, I suppose. 


MR. ENGLERT:  Oh, yes, Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. ENGLERT:  There's never been any doubt in


this case --


QUESTION:  I mean, we're not talking about


conduct that is lawful here.


MR. ENGLERT:  We are not talking about


extortion, but we are talking about some things that could


be punished much less severely. 


It has never been disputed in this case, from 

the opening statement through the closing statement of the


trial or in the earlier phases of the case, that there


were trespasses.  There could be in particular


circumstances --


QUESTION:  -- more than that.  In some cases,


assaults and so forth.


MR. ENGLERT:  Well, fair enough except the --


the jury verdict really is quite at rejection of


petitioners' proof in many respects rather than supporting


it.  But, yes, Justice O'Connor.  I really don't want to

fight with you on that particular point. 


But -- but let's --


QUESTION:  -- I think to paint the picture that


we're talking about, just pure speech is -- is not the


case.


MR. ENGLERT:  No, but that's why I used the


examples of Carry Nation and Claiborne Hardware which


weren't pure speech either.  There was certainly violence


in those cases, but not extortion.


QUESTION:  Would you say coercion?  One of the


questions was, well, coercion -- if that's defined as


using compulsion to force a person to do or not do


something that she otherwise would do or not do, does this


conduct fit that crime?


MR. ENGLERT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  That crime --


MR. ENGLERT:  And that's a very important point


supporting our position because Congress at one point had


coercion as a predicate act in the Anti-Racketeering Act


of 1934 and, at the request of organized labor, took it


out.  In the Hobbs Act, in the passage of the Hobbs Act in


1946, again, organized labor lobbied to make sure that


coercion was not part of the Hobbs Act.  Coercion is a


different crime from extortion, and interfering with


someone's rights is the crime of coercion under the Model

Penal Code, under New York law, under various other bodies


of law, but it's not the crime of extortion.


QUESTION:  Just -- just on the obtain point,


which I -- I agree with you is of great relevance here,


if -- if a group trespasses on property and -- and remains


there for a period of days, can it be said that they're


obtaining the use of the property, or is -- is that too


much of a stretch? 


MR. ENGLERT:  I think it's a stretch, Justice


Kennedy, but even if it weren't a stretch, it still


wouldn't be a Hobbs Act violation for a different reason. 


There must be consent to the obtaining of property or --


of another, and simply going in and engaging in adverse


possession doesn't necessarily entail consent.


QUESTION: 


Well, suppose you withdraw in order 

to avoid confrontation.  I suppose if A robs B, and B


turns over the wallet, in a sense there's consent, not --


not the kind of consent that the law would ever recognize. 


It's a consent in a -- just from the standpoint that


there's a voluntary act in handing over the -- the wallet.


MR. ENGLERT:  Well, that actually --


QUESTION:  You make your -- you make your


muscles move and that's about it. 


MR. ENGLERT:  Yes.  Words can be stretched to


make lots of things into lots of things that the law

doesn't want them to be.  And in fact, the common law


distinction between robbery and extortion, which are both


Hobbs Act predicates, is one is with consent and the other


is without.  So robbery is a classic example of something


that you could stretch the word of consent to cover, but


it isn't extortion.


QUESTION:  I guess it's obtaining property if a


group of people through criminal means tell an owner of a


business precisely and in detail how he has to run his


business. 


MR. ENGLERT:  Oh, I don't think so, Justice


Breyer.


QUESTION:  No?  In other words, if -- if, say,


you have a group of terrible criminals, and they say here


is what -- we're going to kill you unless you do the 

following, and then they say, today you serve X and


tomorrow you serve Y, and you send the money over to Z,


and you do all these different things; in other words,


they run the business. 


MR. ENGLERT:  If it --


QUESTION:  Now, why haven't they obtained that


business? 


MR. ENGLERT:  In the hypothetical example you


just gave me, they most certainly have obtained property. 


You said send the money over to Z.

 QUESTION:  Because I said -- say -- I regretted


putting that in the hypothetical the instant I did. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  I'm simply looking for an example of


a group of criminals who will tell a property owner, a


businessman, exactly and precisely how to run his business


in a way that he doesn't want to run it.  Now, why isn't


that obtaining the property called the business?  I mean,


that's what the SG I think is suggesting basically.


MR. ENGLERT:  And the SG is wrong because that's


not what obtaining property meant under the New York law


in 1946.  It -- it's a stretch of words.  It's a modern


concept of property.


QUESTION:  It's like a theft of services. 


I mean, you go in and you -- there was a -- years ago a 

person who figured out how to whistle various tones into


the telephone so that it would connect people without


charge.  All right.  Now, hasn't that person stolen the


use of the telephone?


MR. ENGLERT:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Yes.  And -- and a person who tells


the telephone company owner, I want you to go and provide


the services to A, B, and C, hasn't he stolen those


services? 


MR. ENGLERT:  Well, that's getting to be more of

a stretch, but probably yes, under United States v. --


QUESTION:  Then -- then the difference between


that and a person who tells the business owner to provide


his services to A, B, C, D, and E, whom he doesn't want


to, that doesn't seem a difference. 


MR. ENGLERT:  No.  There is a major difference,


with respect, Justice Breyer.  Saying do provide services


to A, B, C, D, and E is quite different from saying don't


provide services to A, B, C --


QUESTION:  That's what I wondered, and what is


the difference there? 


MR. ENGLERT:  The difference is that A, B, C, D,


and E have obtained the services in one case and they


have -- and no one has obtained any property in the other


case, exactly the words of the Hobbs Act. 

QUESTION:  Except that services is not property,


and the one thing that is common in both the negative and


the positive examples is the obtaining of control. 


It's -- it's -- it seems to me it's -- it's the control


that's important when he says serve A, B, and C.  It isn't


property that he has obtained.  It's -- it's an action. 


It's a service. 


MR. ENGLERT:  Justice Souter --


QUESTION:  And that's true in each case. 


MR. ENGLERT:  -- if I've understood you

correctly, that's even more support for our position


because the words of the Hobbs Act are obtaining of


property from another.  So if all of Justice Breyer's


examples --


QUESTION:  No, no --


MR. ENGLERT:  -- property --


QUESTION:  I -- I agree with you on that point,


but I -- I guess I'm saying that if you concede in the one


case, I don't see why you -- you really don't have to


concede in -- in the other case because the one thing that


is common to each is control, and there is no property in


a tangible sense that is obtained in -- in the positive


service examples.


MR. ENGLERT:  No.  With respect, what is common


is not control.  It's acquisition. 


It's obtaining. 

That's what obtaining means.  The Solicitor General's own


brief on page 21 in footnote 11 says that's what obtaining


means.  And --


QUESTION:  And what does one obtain?  One


obtains, in each case, control --


MR. ENGLERT:  But control --


QUESTION:  -- i.e., direction.


MR. ENGLERT:  I apologize, Justice Souter, for


interrupting, but control is not property.  Property is


property.

 QUESTION:  My point is if you are conceding that 


Justice Breyer's positive examples would fall within the


statute, I don't see why you don't have to concede that


the negative example, i.e., don't serve, doesn't also


fall --


MR. ENGLERT:  The --


QUESTION:  -- on -- on your own theory.


MR. ENGLERT:  I don't think so, respectfully,


Justice Souter.  The distinction I draw is that in the


words of the statute, one involves obtaining property, and


the other doesn't, on the assumption that the services are


property.  If they aren't property, I win the case for a


different reason.


QUESTION:  What do you do with the New York case


involving a work stoppage? 


Do you agree with that case, 

or do you think it's wrong?  The one the Solicitor General


cites in his brief, the -- the old 1890 case involving


a stop -- a strike, I guess, is what you'd say.  Do you


think that case would -- would be decided the same way


under your view?


MR. ENGLERT:  I -- I think so, Justice Stevens,


but the case is not immediately coming to mind.  I'm


sorry.  I -- I do think the New York courts construed


rather strictly the obtaining of property, and the


Solicitor General's more expansive cases are from long

after 1946.


QUESTION:  It's People against Barondess,


decided in 1892.  It was under the -- under the New York


statute, which I think everyone agrees was the model for


the Federal statute.


MR. ENGLERT:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  It seemed to me there was no


obtaining in the very literal sense that you used the


term, but there was merely acquisition of control of the


operation in that.  And I'm not quite sure how you come


out on -- on those facts. 


MR. ENGLERT:  Well, Your Honor, I'm -- I'm, as I


stand here, blanking on those facts.  I -- I believe the


New York courts did construe obtaining of property rather


strictly in that case and in every other pre-1946 case, 

but I can't -- I apologize.  I can't give you an


intelligent discussion of that right at this moment. 


I'd like to turn to the RICO injunction issue,


if I may.  It's very straightforward.  I plan to address


it only briefly. 


First, this Court has held in several cases that


section 7 of the Sherman Act and section 4 of the Clayton


Act, both worded almost identically to section 1964(c) of


RICO, did not authorize private injunctive relief.


The dissent in Paine Lumber contended that

courts had inherent power to grant injunctions --


QUESTION:  The language of the acts, though, is


a little different than this, isn't it?


MR. ENGLERT:  Well, very, very slightly


different, Justice O'Connor. 


QUESTION:  The analogy may not be perfect


because the language differs.


MR. ENGLERT:  Very slightly, but the -- where


there's a world of difference and not a slight difference


is between section 16 of the Clayton Act and section 1964


of RICO.  And in section 16 of the Clayton Act, Congress


authorized private injunctive relief.  No language


remotely resembling section 16 appears in section 1964 of


RICO, but all of the language from the statutes this Court


held didn't authorize injunctive relief with very tiny 

variations appears in RICO.


Besides the obvious statutory language borrowed


from the Clayton and Sherman Acts, as this Court has


recognized throughout its cases, the statutory evolution


of RICO presented Congress with repeated opportunities


expressly to provide private parties with injunctive


relief under RICO.  Every such proposal failed before and


after the final enactment of RICO.


The court below dismissed the reliance on


legislative history on the theory that this Court would

not ascribe any significance to legislative inaction.  But


ironically the very day the Seventh Circuit decided this


case, this Court was hearing argument in Chickasaw


Nation v. United States, and the opinion of the Court in


that case reiterated the longstanding principle -- with


which some members of the Court disagreed, but the


longstanding principle in majority opinions -- that courts


ordinarily will not assume that Congress intended to enact


statutory language that it has earlier discarded in favor


of other language. 


QUESTION:  Would you clarify one thing on the --


on the rejected amendment?  Was it voted down or


withdrawn?  I can't remember. 


MR. ENGLERT:  It was actually passed unanimously


by the Senate, but then the House didn't take a vote on 

it.


QUESTION:  But we don't know why they --


MR. ENGLERT:  I'm sorry.  I -- Justice Stevens,


I -- I've misspoken slightly.  Excuse me.  The -- the


post-RICO effort --


QUESTION:  Well, no.  I'm talking about the one


before enactment.  The post -- the later statute is a


little less persuasive.


MR. ENGLERT:  The pre-RICO effort was withdrawn. 


The pre-RICO effort was withdrawn by Representative

Steiger on the ground that it would complicate matters too


much to take it up at that stage of the legislation, but


it was very important.  He'd come -- come back again with


it next year.  But he recognized that the statute didn't


have private injunctive relief in it in his floor


statements. 


QUESTION:  At the -- on the second round,


when -- when the Senate passed and the House didn't,


there's no explanation in the House record, is there?


MR. ENGLERT:  Nothing that sheds tremendous


light on this except for Representative Steiger's --

QUESTION:  It would -- it would be -- I -- the


trouble I'm having is I don't have any trouble seeing the 

argument your way.


The -- the reason I'm -- at this point, I'm not


convinced is that you do have in subsection (c) the


language referring -- it says may.  What is it?  May


sue -- I can't -- yes, may sue therefor.  And we've got


the general presumption that all appropriate remedies go


with a cause of action.  And I'm -- I'm wondering if in a


case in which it's uncertain what to infer, either from


the legislative record in -- on intent, or from the


textual record here, whether the presumption not to carry

the day in a case of doubt --


MR. ENGLERT:  It shouldn't because, as is


pointed out at pages 7 and 8 of the Operation Rescue reply


brief and correctly so, this Court has two lines of cases: 


one when Congress doesn't specify the remedies.  That's


cases like Franklin v. Gwinnett County which was an


implied right of action case, and like Califano v.


Yamasaki.


And a different line of cases saying, when


Congress does specify remedies, they're intended to be


exclusive.  A line of cases that -- that --


QUESTION:  Well, it -- may I tell you the reason


I wasn't convinced on that is that if -- if Congress


were -- were specifying in the text here choices among


ordinary remedies, I think that would be a very strong 

argument.


The reason it seems less strong here is that the


choices that -- or the -- the remedies that Congress has


specified are extraordinary remedies, e.g., right in this


section.  What is specified is treble damages, not


damages.  If they had simply said can get damages, I think


it would be a slam-dunk, but -- but what they did was --


was to specify something out of the ordinary, and I'm not


sure that that carries the implication that ordinary


remedies, consistent with what it specifies, are -- are

meant to be excluded.


MR. ENGLERT:  Well, Justice Souter, this Court


said over and over again that it did carry that


implication when the exact same language was used in the


Sherman and Clayton Acts.  The Paine Lumber case, the


D.R. Wilder Manufacturing case, a whole host of antitrust


cases.


QUESTION:  And I just don't remember this. 


Does -- does the -- does Clayton use the phrase, sue


therefor?


MR. ENGLERT:  Oh, yes. 


QUESTION:  I have to go back and look.  Is that


the term of art that's in there?


MR. ENGLERT:  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  The -- the


language of Sherman and Clayton is in the appendix to the 

Scheidler blue brief --


QUESTION:  Yes.  I just -- I just didn't go back


and look.  That is the phrase?


MR. ENGLERT:  It is.  It is.  The terms that


differ are quite trivial, and some sections are separated


into different subsections.  That's about all the


difference there is.


I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for


rebuttal. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Solicitor General.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE


MR. OLSON:  Justice Stevens, and may it please


the Court:


The right to control a business, whether or not


for profit, is a well-recognized and longstanding interest


in property.  When that control is surrendered in response


to unlawful force, whether motivated by economics,


politics, or ideals, the extortionist has attained his


objective, and the Hobbs Act has been violated.


QUESTION:  Well, under that definition, I


suppose that anytime protesters trespass on property,


they've obtained the use of that property and there's a


Hobbs Act violation --


MR. OLSON:  If --


QUESTION:  -- Hobbs Act predicate violation?


MR. OLSON:  If there's an unlawful use of force


or threats or violence, Justice Kennedy, whether it be in


the form of trespassing -- and the aim -- which this Court


recognized 8 years ago in this -- in this very predecessor


case was to shut down the clinics.  If that aim is


achieved, the control of the property has been transferred


from the owner of those clinics to the extortionist.


QUESTION:  Well, if -- if that's -- if that's a

strained reading of obtained, shouldn't we be -- take


counsel of -- that there's a -- serious First Amendment


consequences -- consequence if we adopt that extensive


definition? 


MR. OLSON:  As Justice Souter said in -- in the


dissent, which you joined, in the earlier case, the First


Amendment is not an issue in this case, and it can be


dealt with in particular circumstances in particular cases


where it arises.  The issue here is if the use of force --


QUESTION:  Well, the -- there's always a First


Amendment implication in a protest case.  There's -- at


this point there is a First Amendment issue in the case


because of the broad definition you're proposing, it seems


to me. 


MR. OLSON: 


Well, it was the question that was 

presented that was not accepted by this Court.  Question


3, I think it was, or 4 in the -- the one Scheidler


petition was not accepted by this Court. 


QUESTION:  Well, but the point -- the point


is -- the point is not whether there's a First Amendment


violation here.  The point is whether the interpretation


of the word obtain that the Government is -- is suggesting


we adopt does not threaten to -- to bring us constantly


into difficult situations where we're going to have to try


to sort out whether that definition doesn't sail too close

to the wind with respect to First Amendment rights.


MR. OLSON:  I submit, Justice Scalia, that that


is not going to be the -- the problem that this Court or


any courts are going to have to face. 


First of all, the definition of property as


controlling a business has been accepted for a long time. 


Now, the only question that is --


QUESTION:  You -- you -- do you agree that your


interpretation would have been applicable to the civil


rights sit-ins?


MR. OLSON:  Under some circumstances, it could


have if illegal force or threats were used to prevent a


business from operating. 


QUESTION:  Do you --


MR. OLSON:  In many --


QUESTION:  Do you agree that it would be


applicable to many labor picketing situations --


MR. OLSON:  Well, they --


QUESTION:  -- where they obstruct entrance?


MR. OLSON:  This -- this Court specifically


carved out an exemption in -- in the Enmons case with


respect to legitimate labor objectives --


QUESTION:  No, but --


MR. OLSON:  -- and made it --


QUESTION:  The exception wasn't with regard to

labor objection.  What -- what is there in the statute


that -- that enables you to make an exception for labor


picketing?


MR. OLSON:  What -- what this Court --


QUESTION:  What language of the statute enables


you to separate labor?


MR. OLSON:  Well, I -- I can't pull a specific


piece of the language out of the statute, but this Court


said nearly 20 times in the Enmons case that the Hobbs Act


was not intended to cover achievement of legitimate


collective bargaining demands, and because the Court did


not want to --


QUESTION:  It said any legitimate demands --


MR. OLSON:  No, it --


QUESTION:  -- elsewhere. 


It didn't always limit 

it to just legitimate collective bargaining demands, did


it?


MR. OLSON:  I -- I take that the Court, because


it said over 15, nearly 20 times legitimate collective


bargaining demands, legitimate union objectives --


QUESTION:  Because that's what was involved in


the case.  But why would you separate legitimate


collective bargaining demands from other legitimate


demands?  What is there possibly in the word obtain that


could cause you to separate legitimate collective

bargaining demands from legitimate demands that you --


that you refrain from doing something else?


MR. OLSON:  I -- I can only submit, Justice


Scalia, that it seemed to me a clear implication of the


words used by the Court and the fact that the Court


emphasized that it was -- that we were dealing with -- the


Court was dealing with the extraordinary -- the potential


extraordinary change in Federal labor law, that that


phrase was emphasized over and over again.  Neither this


Court --

labor law exception to the extortion statute.


MR. OLSON:  In the -- in the context of the


history --


QUESTION:

law exception. 


MR. OLSON:  No, not out of nowhere, Justice


Scalia.  There was a long history of --


QUESTION:  You give me no language in the


statute that would justify it.

statute specifically makes it unlawful and makes no


exception for -- for whether the -- whether the -- the

petitioner -- the -- the protester, or the -- or the

wanting to shut down a business or a -- or a boycott of


Israel or -- this is a classic use of force and extortion


in the organized crime setting.  The use of force or


threats to take over a labor union or a business --


QUESTION:  But it says there, to obtain control. 


To obtain control. 


MR. OLSON:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Fine.  What I don't understand is


whether there isn't a line somewhere between obtaining


control in the sense of taking over a business for a


period of time, shutting down a business, and just telling


the owner of the business to do one single thing once that


the blackmailer -- but not the owner -- wants to do. 

MR. OLSON:  Let me --


QUESTION:  There's a spectrum that falls within


that word control or the word taking over that if you push


it to an extreme, the Hobbs Act becomes a coercion statute


in respect to a business owner. 


MR. OLSON:  It -- the question, it seems to me,


was answered in part by this Court in the earlier NOW case


by saying that the extortionist doesn't have to gain a


financial benefit or take possession. 


Now, the -- the robbery and larceny statutes at

common law required the taking and acquiring of


possession. 


QUESTION:  I take where you're going is that it


is a coercion statute in respect to a businessperson


insofar as you ask the owner of the business to do


something that he doesn't want to do. 


MR. OLSON:  That's -- that's part of it, yes. 


And the answer to the question about obtaining --


QUESTION:  If I think that's too extreme, is


there any stopping place? 


MR. OLSON:  Well, there -- there is a stopping


point, is whether at the end of the day, through the


threats or the -- the actions of the extortionist, that


property interest that was held by the victim of the


extortion has been transferred to the hands of the 

extortionist in the sense that the aim has been


accomplished.  The aim was to shut down the clinics.  That


was the attempt, and to the extent that that was or was


attempted to be accomplished, that control --


QUESTION:  General Olson --


QUESTION:  Mr. -- yes, Mr. Olson.  If -- if we


agreed with your view -- and I'm not sure we will -- about


property including the right to control business assets,


it does not, I assume, cover some personal right of


somebody to obtain services in the clinic.  And I guess

the jury verdict covered both.  Could the jury verdict be

MR. OLSON:  We -- we have not addressed that,


Justice O'Connor.  I do --


QUESTION:  Well, I'm asking you to.


MR. OLSON:  I do -- I do agree.  I think that it


would have to be sent back to the Seventh Circuit for a


remand to examine that question.  The jury instruction did


have the component to which you refer which we would


characterize as a liberty interest of a right of an


individual.  And that was --


QUESTION:  And we have no idea what the jury


went on.  There were three pieces, and one involved the


people who worked in the clinic.  One involved the women


who were served by the clinic, and the third involved the 

clinic operation. 


And that was exactly the question that I wanted


to ask you.  Is your bottom line a new trial?  Because the


charge doesn't match the theory you're putting forward. 


MR. OLSON:  I think that -- I think that at the


end of the day, although we haven't briefed it and the


Government is interested in the definition of extortion,


at the end of the day that might have to be the result


because the general -- generalized verdict does not make a


distinction between that which we contend is property

right which was obtained by the extortionist or -- or was


attempted to be obtained --


QUESTION:  Well, you wouldn't want us to send it


back without resolving the extortion issue, would you? 


MR. OLSON:  That's -- no, I --


QUESTION:  You want us to send it back so it


is -- it is -- the jury is given a charge only on the


extortion theory that you're -- that you're delivering. 


Then it comes back up and then we will resolve the issue.


MR. OLSON:  Well, I -- the question presented,


in connection with the Hobbs Act, I think is answered this


way.  Where unlawful -- which this Court should


articulate, we hope, in its opinion.  Where unlawful force


is used to arrest sufficient control of a business to stop


the performance of its services, the Hobbs Act has been 

violated because control of the business, a property right


has been acquired. 


I -- I may have 1 minute left to just mention


one thing with respect to the -- the RICO provision.


Congress created a private right to damages for


RICO violations by intentionally copying language from the


antitrust laws that this Court had repeatedly held did not


confer a right to seek injunctive relief.  This Court has


said that Congress was aware of the antitrust history, was


copying it, intended to copy it, and was presumed to know

the consequences of what Congress was doing.


QUESTION:  Of course, at the time the statute


was enacted, a private litigant could get relief,


injunctive relief, under the antitrust laws, not under


the -- not under the section 7 of the Sherman Act, or


section 4 of the Clayton Act, but under whatever the other


number is.


MR. OLSON:  Section 16.


QUESTION:  But the question is really whether


the first section of the RICO gives us authority. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, may I answer that, Justice


Stevens? 


QUESTION:  Sure.


MR. OLSON:  It seems to me that in the context


of the language that the -- that Congress knew would not 

create a right, and knowing -- Congress knowing that


section 16 did specifically create such a right, and


knowing that this Court had said that when a right is


created and remedies specifically provided, the Court --


the Court will not expand.  The Court will accept what


Congress has done.  And Congress did not adopt and in fact


rejected the opportunities or -- or failed to accept the


opportunities to adopt precisely the remedy that would


have had that result. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Olson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FAY CLAYTON


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MS. CLAYTON:  Justice Stevens, and -- and may it


please the Court:


I'd like to begin with the RICO issue, if I may,


and then turn to the Hobbs Act questions. 


The stark contrasts between the antitrust law


and RICO prove the -- prove why private injunctions are


available.  When it comes to damages, we agree that the


language is virtually the same, treble damages and so


forth.  But when you look at the injunction provisions,


they are radically different. 


In the antitrust law, Sherman IV, all the


injunction provisions were put in a single paragraph 

giving the Government the exclusive duty to enforce.  That


is not -- that was not copied in RICO.  In RICO, Congress


took out permanent injunctions, put them in section


1964(a), a separate, unrestricted section.  Not only did


it give the duty to the Government, it didn't even mention


the Government. 


QUESTION:  But in the next section, it did


mention the Government and said that the Government shall


have the authority to -- to use the injunctive provisions


mentioned in the first section.  Right?

 MS. CLAYTON:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And then in the third section, it


gives private individuals a right to damages, but does not


mention that they have the right to use the first -- first


section.


MS. CLAYTON:  Justice Scalia, of course, you are


correct about section (c).  Section (c) does give standing


to private parties, and gives them these extraordinary new


remedies, treble damages and legal fees, which they could


never get without a statutory grant. 


But section (b) does not give the Government the


right to use permanent injunctions.  It only talks about


preliminary relief.  It takes that one section of


Sherman IV out, and the other part, the permanent


injunctions in Sherman IV, are now, under RICO, put in a 

wholly different provision, the unrestricted section (a). 


The natural reading of section (a), which says


all these permanent remedies, including the injunction


that our trial court granted here, went against future


criminal activity.  Section (a) in an -- unrestricted


language makes that available to the court to restrain


violations of section 1962, the very violations that


section (c) --


QUESTION:  Section (a) says what the court may


grant.  It doesn't say who has authority to ask the court

to do that.  And in the -- the provision (b), it empowers


the Government and the Government only to ask for


preliminary injunctive relief.  It's a strange thing.  Why


would Congress withhold the power to seek a preliminary


injunction and yet give that party the right to seek a


permanent injunction? 


MS. CLAYTON:  That's a question that we have


pondered for a long time, and -- and I think the Motorola


brief, which explains -- a very important brief -- why


preliminary injunctions should be available to everybody,


makes a good argument for that.  But we don't have to


address that question here. 


My own thinking is that section (b) gives the


Government something that it wouldn't have had without the


statutory grant because preliminary injunctions require 

one -- one element that permanent ones don't, the


irreparable harm to the victim.  And the Government, suing


as sovereign, doesn't have property that's harmed.  And if


you look at the Wollersheim case, they recognize that was


a plausible reason for why section (b) is there.


QUESTION:  But you're just addressing the second


sentence of section (b).  There is a first sentence which


says, the Attorney General may institute proceedings under


this section.


MS. CLAYTON:  That's right.

 QUESTION:  Now --


MS. CLAYTON:  That's right.


QUESTION:  -- that -- that gives the Attorney


General the power to institute proceedings under (a).


MS. CLAYTON:  Your Honor, it doesn't -- excuse


me, Justice Scalia.  Section (b) does not say the Attorney


General may institute proceedings under section 1964(a). 


It says under this section which is section --


QUESTION:  What else could it mean?


QUESTION:  What else could it mean?


MS. CLAYTON:  It means section 1964 as a whole,


Your Honor, and in section (c) private parties are given


the right to sue, which is another way of saying the very


same thing.  In fact --


QUESTION:  As I -- sorry.


MS. CLAYTON:  I was going to say in the American


Stores case, this Court construed the very same language


in the Clayton Act, sections 15 and 16.  Institute


proceedings, sue for in the other.  And the Court said


both of them mean both the Government and private parties


may go and get injunctive relief including divestiture. 


It's just two ways of saying the same thing.  The


Government is thought to institute proceedings.  It's


bringing them as a sovereign.  Private parties are suing


for.  It's just the traditional language.  Certainly those

phrases don't bear the weight of the argument that


institute proceedings means this party and only this party


has access to those unrestricted remedies of section


1964(a).


QUESTION:  And I looked -- I mean, I couldn't


make too much out of the fact that you take the language


from the Clayton Act which says the Attorney General may


institute proceedings in equity, and you move it to


section (b) and just change it to say, he may institute


proceedings under this section.  That's the only


difference with the Clayton Act that I could find.


So I looked up the history.  In the history, it


looks as if there were five different bills floating


around, and things didn't -- weren't all that


straightforward.  It got a little mixed up.  And you have


in the House several Congressmen getting up and saying


they made a mistake in the Senate.  They didn't include


this.  They should have.  And then there were four more


bills floating around, and the ones who wanted to include


it said, send it all to the Judiciary Committee, let them


work it out, and they never worked it out.  I mean,


that's -- that's the thrust of it that I -- that I got out


of that. 


Maybe it was just a mistake.  Well, if it was a


mistake, you're the -- you have another law.  You can

bring it under the -- you could get an injunction I guess


under the Abortion Act, the Abortion Clinics Act, or -- it


seemed to me this one -- they made a mistake.  Well, they


made it. 


MS. CLAYTON:  Well, Justice Breyer, even if


someone made a mistake, the bill, as it stands, is what


Congress voted on, and what the President signed.  It is


that bill that we interpret.  And we all agree -- this


Court has said on many occasions that --


QUESTION:  I'm with you on that. 


MS. CLAYTON:  I know you are, Justice Scalia. 


(Laughter.) 


MS. CLAYTON:  Perhaps the only thing.  And


you've often commented on how there are probably as many


reasons for congressional action or inaction as there are 

Members of Congress. 


But the fact is the bill makes a very -- it's a


very radically different structure from the antitrust law. 


Private -- I mean, permanent injunctions are unrestricted,


and under the traditional jurisprudence, Califano -- when


we -- we assume all traditional remedies are available


unless -- unless there's the clearest command.  There's


not even a hint here.  Maybe it was a mistake.  It was


certainly not a clear command to do the opposite. 


And as my -- petitioners have pointed out, the

only time private injunctions were voted on, they passed


unanimously.  Why didn't they put it in there?  I think it


would have been redundant, and the Court doesn't like


surplusage.  If they had said in section (c), and private


parties can get permanent injunctions, then the courts


would have been trying to figure out, well, what did they


mean in section (a).  That has to mean something


different. 


They didn't say again the Government could get


permanent injunctions in section (b).  That would have


been redundant too.  But everybody agrees the Government


can get permanent injunctions. 


In any event, this Court's jurisprudence teaches


us --


QUESTION: 


Don't you think it's --

QUESTION:  We don't agree on whether they get it


pursuant to section (a) or section (b), though.


MS. CLAYTON:  The Scheidler brief, the opening


brief, says that section (b) gives the Government


unrestricted access to the remedies in section (a). 


That's the way they've put it.  I don't read -- if -- if


that's the case for the Government, the same applies to


private parties.  By parity of reasoning, anyone with


standing -- and it's strict standing for private parties. 


You've got to be injured in your business or property.

 QUESTION:  But -- so you say private parties


have the power to require -- to ask the court to order a


person to divest himself of any interest, direct or


indirect?  Do you know of any other situation in which a


private party can -- can cause the -- the divestiture of a


business? 


MS. CLAYTON:  Justice Scalia, it's not


automatic.  The court in its discretion might do it or


might not, but it must --


QUESTION:  I understand that, but to put that


power and -- and to request it in the hands of a power --


of a private party seems to me extraordinary. 


MS. CLAYTON:  It's been in the hands of private


parties under the antitrust law for more than a half


century before RICO was passed, and the courts have had no 

problem exercising their discretion to my knowledge. 


In fact, in the American Stores case, this Court


pointed out how the very same remedy sought by the


Government and sought by private parties, the Government


might get it, and the private party might not.


Furthermore, any -- any injunctive relief --


QUESTION:  You can understand it in the context


of the antitrust laws where the divestiture is the only


way to prevent the -- the monopolization, but to use that


as a punishment for -- for extortion is, it seems to me,

quite -- quite bizarre.


MS. CLAYTON:  And then I think the court


wouldn't grant it to the private party, and they certainly


wouldn't grant it unless it was designed to remedy the


particular injury that the private party suffered to their


business and property by virtue of a 1962 violation.  It


would be very strange, indeed, Your Honor, to remove from


private parties who are deputized to be a -- private


attorneys general, supplement the Government resources, to


take away this powerful core injunctive remedy and instead


make them sue for treble --


QUESTION:  But the divestiture -- you say the


divestiture should never be -- should never be used by the


courts.


MS. CLAYTON:  No, I don't, Your Honor.  I think


that the district courts are --


QUESTION:  It could -- could simply destroy an


organization as the punishment for -- for extortion as


you --


MS. CLAYTON:  The court would only do that in an


extreme case, I am sure.  Maybe they would never give it


to a private party, but it would be up to the -- but the


private party may seek it.  Section (a) doesn't say they


automatically get it. 


QUESTION:  Then it's even odder that they

don't -- the private party can't seek that preliminary


injunction even if they can show irreparable injury.  To


give the extraordinary power of ordering divestiture and


not giving a party who is irreparably injured the


authority to go into court and say, stop now --


temporarily --


MS. CLAYTON:  I -- I agree, Your Honor, and even


though that's not an issue that the Court has to resolve


in this case, I think the Motorola brief makes an


excellent case for why -- since this is a very special


remedy, it's not an exclusive list.  Congress didn't mean


to deprive private parties or anyone else of any of the


traditional remedies.  The Califano rule is clear.  Unless


there's a clear command to deny it, it's available.  I


don't think section (b) -- remember, it doesn't even have 

that duty language. 


One other point I'd like to make is when the


antitrust laws were written, there was no merger of law in


equity.  To go in -- when someone had a right to get


damages, they had to go into the law court which could


only give money damages.  It couldn't give injunctions. 


That had changed by the time RICO passed.  And Congress


knew that.  Congress knew the Federal courts had the


ability to design any appropriate remedy to fix the wrong,


barring the clearest command.  There's no clearest

command.


QUESTION:  Well, you do agree, though, I guess


that were efforts to include language authorizing the


obtaining of injunctions by private petitioners, and that


was not adopted by Congress. 


MS. CLAYTON:  But they were passed unanimously. 


They didn't get in I believe because it would have been


surplusage.  It would have been redundant, and we don't


like that in statutes.


QUESTION:  Well, we don't know. 


MS. CLAYTON:  We don't know, Your Honor, and we


can -- and as the Court has said in Central Bank and Solid


Waste, one never -- it's a thin reed to rest an


interpretation on what Congress might have had --


QUESTION: 


And they have a long, long discussion 

of the battle, and everybody says, without any opposition,


that this isn't there.  You would have thought if it was


surplusage, somebody would have gotten up and said, well,


it is. 


MS. CLAYTON:  Well, I think that's what


Representative Steiger said.  The -- in fact, we quoted


him.  It's ambiguous.


QUESTION:  I don't know. 


MS. CLAYTON:  But it's certainly not the clear


command to the contrary.

 QUESTION:  Well, you have two -- two difficult


and major arguments here.


MS. CLAYTON:  I'd like to turn to it.  Thank


you, Justice Kennedy. 


QUESTION:  I -- I would like to hear your


comments on obtaining property.


MS. CLAYTON:  I would like to turn to those.


I think we all agree that property includes both


tangible things and intangible things.  Of course, in this


information age, some of our most important property is


intangible.  So the question, of course, is how does one


obtain it.  One obtains it by obtaining control over it or


dominion over it, as this Court explained in the Carpenter


and Green case. 


Remember in Carpenter -- now, this is a mail 

fraud case that had the same phrase, obtain property. 


Mr. Winans, the Wall Street Journal reporter, the On the


Street column, was held to have wrongfully obtained


property.  Now, he had already received the information. 


QUESTION:  Do you think that it includes liberty


interest deprivation? 


MS. CLAYTON:  No.  No, Your Honor, I don't.  We


do not believe -- but sometimes they --


QUESTION:  Then what happens to a generalized


verdict no matter how you define this --

 MS. CLAYTON:  Your Honor, the verdict here is


based only on property.  If you look at the Hobbs Act


instruction, it required that the respondents be made to


part with property, not part with liberty interests.  If a


newspaper publishes an editorial, it has a liberty


interest, a First Amendment right, to do it, but it also


has a property right.


QUESTION:  Yes, but it defined property.  It


says you can find a violation, other things -- all the


other -- all the other requirements being met.  You have


to say that the doctors, nurses, or other staff or clinics


themselves give up a property right.  The term property


right means anything of value --


MS. CLAYTON:  Right. 


QUESTION: 


-- including a woman's right to seek 

services from the clinic, the right of doctors or nurses


to perform their jobs, the right of the clinic to provide


medical services free from wrongful threats. 


MS. CLAYTON:  Right. 


QUESTION:  Now, your brief I think, more or


less, seemed to concede that -- that at least two out of


those three parts were certainly wrong.


MS. CLAYTON:  Oh, no. 


QUESTION:  You don't.  I mean, then -- then do


we have to decide -- is this -- is --

 MS. CLAYTON:  No, no.  No, Your Honor.  What we


believe is that to find property in any one of those


aspects of property -- there are three aspects of


property:  the clinic's right to control its equipment and


buildings and so forth, the women's right to spend their


money, and the contract among -- between the two parties. 


Extortion of any one of them proximately injures all of


them because it's two sides of the same coin.  If the


clinic is forcibly -- through threats of violence, the


clinic is forcibly closed, now the women who have


appointments, which are contracts, bilateral contracts,


they can't get in.  It's a -- it's two sides of the same


coin.  So to extort the property of the clinic is to


proximately injure the women in her business or property,


which is -- the standing comes under RICO.  This is


something that petitioners have never even challenged at


the trial court --


QUESTION:  All right.  So -- so in other words,


this instruction is correct that it's -- it's --


MS. CLAYTON:  It is, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  So a -- a woman's right to seek


services is property which, if they say, I don't want you,


the clinic, to serve the woman so the woman can't get the


services, that is obtaining property?


MS. CLAYTON:  It is under these circumstances

where she has an actual agreement with the -- the clinic. 


She's not just going shopping.  Each woman who went to


these clinics had an actual appointment for a particular


service at a particular time.  When I have an appointment


with my doctor for a biopsy, I have a property right in


seeing my doctor at that time.


QUESTION:  What have you obtained control of? 


What have you obtained control of?


MS. CLAYTON:  Just as in the Carpenter case,


you've obtained control of the right to do business and


the intangible rights that come out of business, the


exclusive rights.


QUESTION:  Obtaining control means -- means


nothing at all if -- if whenever you deprive somebody


of -- of a right, you say you obtain control of the right 

that -- that you've deprived them of.  I mean, everything


becomes an obtaining of property.


MS. CLAYTON:  When one uses a demand to make one


cede their control over property -- this is my pen.  This


is my property.  It has ink and plastic.  But I also have


a right to use it for writing.  And if someone puts a gun


to my head and says, if you use that pen, I'll shoot you,


they have taken my property.  They've taken my control.


QUESTION:  If I -- if I say to you, don't --


don't use that pen, or I'll do something unlawful and you

case, in the Craft case, in the Drye case, this Court made


crystal clear the essence of intangible -- and, for that


matter, tangible property is the rights that come out of


it, especially the right of control.  The right to control


my pen, the right of the clinics to control their --


QUESTION:  Or what about the right to perform a


job?  Let's think of a labor strike. 


MS. CLAYTON:  Absolutely. 


QUESTION:  And -- and think of the strike, my


goodness, where people can't get into the factory.  And --


and somebody comes out and says, you've -- you've


interfered under the Hobbs Act and have obtained property;


namely, my right to perform my job is interfered with.


The person at the soda fountain -- you've heard


the litany. 


MS. CLAYTON:  Right.

sit-ins.  The soda jerk who wouldn't serve the black


customers.  Well, this -- this is interfering with my


right to perform my job.

 I mean, this seems -- you have another statute

who don't like these various demonstrations don't, and


they'll all be in under the Hobbs Act and -- and RICO and


so forth.  I'm rather concerned about this problem.  I'd


like you to address it. 


MS. CLAYTON:  I'd like to address those,


Justice Breyer.  Let's start with the soda joke -- jerk


example.


Martin Luther King didn't tell his followers to


go into the Woolworth's and bash the people around and


forcibly prevent the white people from getting service. 


QUESTION:  No, but just obstructing -- just


obstructing -- you've used the term violence several


times. 
 That's not what the instruction required. 

MS. CLAYTON:  It --


QUESTION:  As -- as your argument to the jury


itself indicated, it was enough if they obstructed the


entrance and failed to part like the Red Sea --


MS. CLAYTON:  Not true.


QUESTION:  -- if somebody wanted to go in.


MS. CLAYTON:  Justice Scalia, that is not


correct.  We -- the instruction required that the


respondents be made to give up property.  We -- and -- and


question 12 ensured that a mere blockade or sit-in --

question 6 on the jury form asked the jury if any of the


predicate acts they found was based on a mere blockade and


sit-in.  The jury said no.  I told the jury don't include


in your predicate acts -- I told them -- anything that was


based on mere speech, or mere presence, or the message. 


It had to be something that involved force or violence,


the wrongful use of fear --


QUESTION:  I -- I am reading the closing


argument on behalf of the clinic plaintiffs at the trial,


and it says, in every issue we've shown you the property


rights of the clinics and the women were extorted under


RICO.  Even a few hours of deprivation of legal rights


will satisfy the RICO act of extortion.


There is one way, I guess, in which you don't


have the element of force in a blockade, and that would be 

if the blockaders did something that they were


specifically instructed that they should never do, that


is, politely move aside, part like the Red Sea, and let a


woman through. 


But you know that never happened.  No witness


ever testified to that.  No witness -- not defense, not


plaintiff -- ever said that any of the blockaders were


instructed to let women through. 


In other words, you told the jury that you could

blockade.  It wasn't smacking people around.  It was just


not letting people in.


MS. CLAYTON:  No, Your Honor.  If the jury had


found a mere -- first of all, that was argument.  The jury


follows instructions not argument, as the Weeks case from


this Court has held.  But the evidence supported --


QUESTION:  So you're -- you're changing your


position here. 


MS. CLAYTON:  No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  I see. 


MS. CLAYTON:  When we made -- we made that


argument, but we also told the jury that if they were


basing any predicate acts on the mere presence and a mere


blockade, mere sit-in, they had to put yes to question 6. 


They put no because we showed them that they had to find 

that any predicate act needed an element of force or


violence.  And that's what PLAN did.  It used these --


QUESTION:  Well -- well, but still -- still it


seems to me that your -- your theory doesn't depend on


violence.  Your theory is that you're obtaining -- or that


the defendants here were obtaining property because they


prohibited its use.  That's your theory. 


MS. CLAYTON:  Yes, Your Honor, by -- by wrongful


means.  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  And -- and so -- so long as the means

were wrongful, the obtaining definitional problem still


remains, and I think you should address that.


MS. CLAYTON:  I'd like -- yes, I'd like to go


back to the Carpenter case.  Mr. Winans had the


information, but then he wrongfully obtained it.  How did


he wrongfully obtain it?  When he exercised dominion or


control over it.  This Court said he -- he wrongfully


obtained it when he deprived -- that was this Court's


word -- deprived the Journal of its right to control that


property.


In the Green case, the same way.  The --


QUESTION:  How about Carry Nation?  I -- you


would concede, I take it, based on your argument that if


RICO had been around then and the Hobbs Act, that she


would have been in violation.


MS. CLAYTON:  I would, Your Honor, if she had


been doing it to get consent, to get the business to


change its ways, which I guess she was.  Yes, that's not


the lawful way.  If my client, the National Organization


for Women, organized people to go to Augusta Golf Course


and tear up the greens until they let women members, that


would be extortion.


QUESTION:  But it is -- it is strange to think


of Carry Nation, that notorious extortionist.  I mean, you


know, that's just not the crime involved.  There --

there's a crime there, but is it extortion?


MS. CLAYTON:  Your Honor, the Hobbs Act doesn't


give exemptions for motives, as this Court has repeatedly


held.  There's no more a motive requirement there than


there is under RICO. 


QUESTION:  What's the difference between --


QUESTION:  Ms. Clayton, may I ask you one


question?  I just -- I -- I want to be sure I heard you


correctly.  There's a definition of property in the


instructions, a three-part definition, at page 158.  Did


you tell us that that instruction was not objected to?


MS. CLAYTON:  Oh, no, I don't believe I said


that.


QUESTION:  I just misunderstood you.


MS. CLAYTON: 


The -- the petitioners had offered 

a definition of -- of extortion that was part with


property, and they didn't define it.  So at the trial --


at the pretrial stage, that was all they offered.  They


didn't object then. 


During the course of trial, they made numerous


objections.  I can't say they never objected.  They didn't


timely object. 


And their original view of what extortion meant


was part with property, which is the same I think as give


up property.

 QUESTION:  What is the difference between


coercion and extortion?


MS. CLAYTON:  The difference is whether property


is being attacked.  When you coerce somebody to give up


their First Amendment right, that might be coercion, but


since it's not focused on property, it's not extortion.


QUESTION:  What would you coerce them to do that


is not the giving up of property?  Give me an example.


MS. CLAYTON:  To stop speaking.  You don't have


property in your speech.  Liberty interests are not the


subject of extortion, but -- but property interests are. 


Every extortion is a coercion.


QUESTION:  Shouldn't we draw the line this way? 


Instead of speaking as, for example, the Solicitor General


did and some of the cases do about obtaining control, 

isn't the way to -- to adhere to the line between the


liberty and property distinction to say that you extort if


you gain control in a way which prevents them from doing


business, i.e., engaging in a property exercise, but you


do not extort if you gain control simply in the way they


do business, i.e., their choice of whom to serve?


If we draw that distinction, then the old


sit-ins in the lunch counter weren't there to stop them


from doing business.  They wanted them to do business. 


They wanted them to do business with them.  Whereas, the

case which I think you have is a case that could be argued


that the point of it was to stop the business, period, and


that gets into property and crosses the line from liberty


to property.  Would you accept that distinction?


MS. CLAYTON:  Not quite, Justice Souter. 


I certainly agree that the -- that the sit-in protesters


were not extorting anybody because they were trying to


change people's mind by persuasion, not by intimidation.


But I believe if you look at the old --


QUESTION:  Well, they wanted a -- I mean, but


they -- the --


MS. CLAYTON:  They --


QUESTION:  -- their immediate object was to get


the sandwich or the Coke.  So that was easy. 


MS. CLAYTON: 


But -- okay, that -- that may be 

right.


But when we look at the old organized crime, the


classic organized crime extortion cases that the Hobbs Act


was based on, we see organized crime going in saying, let


these people run your pension fund.  Don't do business


with these people.  Fire these people.  Hire those.  Any


attempt to control a lawful business decision I believe is


extortion, whether it's positive or negative.


QUESTION:  Well, maybe -- maybe it is, but I --


I think -- among other things, I think we are, and should

be more concerned about the First Amendment issues which


arise when you cross the line into liberty than the --


than the cases were 40 years ago and --


MS. CLAYTON:  But the proper -- excuse me,


Justice Souter.  The best way to address the First


Amendment issue is to apply the standards of Claiborne


Hardware to any extortion at conduct, as was done here. 


Make sure that the petitioners had to have specific intent


that the crime be done.  Make sure it was done knowingly,


willingly, wrongfully, not just accidentally.  Make sure


the enterprise authorized or ratified it.  Those were the


instructions given here.  There was -- nothing could be a


predicate act unless all those tests were met. 


And then on top of that, they had to use


demands, wrongful demands, to control lawful business 

decisions.  And I do believe that decisions either to do


something or not to do something, as long as the business


owner -- say the company makes round widgets and square


widgets.  And the -- the extortionist says, we don't like


round widgets.  We want you to only make the other kind. 


Or maybe they don't make round and they want them to start


doing it.  That's as much a control of their business


decisions as all those classic organized crimes that were


the basis of the Hobbs Act.  And it's just as offensive


here.

 Your Honor, we ask the clock not to turn back

years of Hobbs Act jurisprudence which protected


businesses and their customers in making their lawful


business decisions. 


We ask the Court to decline to add any


limitations like tangible or personal to -- to the Hobbs


Act.  By the way, even if you did, the State law --


QUESTION:  You want to retain the labor union


exception, however, I assume. 


MS. CLAYTON:  And of course.  Enmons -- and it's


section (c), Your Honor.  It's section (c) of 1951 that


says nothing in this law will affect -- and then they list


all the labor laws.  That's why there's a union exception. 


Plus the -- the New York and all the other States had not 

only a statutory labor exception, but common law. 


And please don't --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. ENGLERT:  Thank you, Justice Stevens.


The defendants in this case objected strenuously

to reading the word obtain out of the Hobbs Act.  They did


not say that giving up property is enough.  If you read


the 1995 opinion wrongly denying the 12(b)(6) motion,


that's all over the place.  If you look at pages 4324 to


4340 of the transcript at the jury colloquy, the point


that there needs to be obtaining was made quite


strenuously.


QUESTION:  Was -- was this particular


instruction, the one that I read from in 1998, the


instruction that had the three parts to it -- was that


objected to? 


MR. ENGLERT:  Yes, at the -- at the pages I


indicated. 


People v. Barondess.  The work stoppage led to


obtaining $100.  Of course, it was extortion.  That's the


property in that case.  That's -- it's cited in footnote


16 of our opening -- of the Scheidler opening brief.


United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball


Company.  This Court reminded us members of the bar that


the tendency to assume that a word used in two different


legal rules always has the same meaning, has all the


tenacity of original sin, and must constantly be guarded


against.  To think that property's definition in tax cases


and in Fifth Amendment takings cases is necessarily the


definition of the Hobbs Act is simply wrong.  The Hobbs

Act draws its definition of property from the common law


and the New York law, not from takings cases and tax


cases.


The First Amendment is in this case.  Yes, the


Court did not take the First Amendment question, but the


principle of constitutional avoidance always governs the


construction of statutes.  And Ms. Clayton concedes that


classic protest activities that are venerated in American


history in retrospect would be covered as extortion by her


definition.  That should give the Court pause.


Claiborne --


QUESTION:  They wouldn't -- they wouldn't be if


you observed the distinction I was throwing out. 


MR. ENGLERT:  The -- the answer to that


distinction, if I may, Justice Souter, is Claiborne 

Hardware and Carry Nation -- those fact patterns certainly


would be covered even under the distinction you suggest. 


There were 10 acts of violence in 1966 in Claiborne


Hardware. 


QUESTION:  Yes, Carry Nation would be covered. 


There's no question.  The -- the lunch counter sit-ins


would not, as I understand it.


MR. ENGLERT:  Well, actually I -- I don't think


that's historically accurate.  I think there was an effort


to stop the lunch counters from serving other people in

addition to getting them to -- to serve black people.  But


it doesn't matter. 


QUESTION:  Well, the --


MR. ENGLERT:  It -- it -- there are -- there are


examples that this Court should be concerned, I


respectfully submit, about calling extortion under


Ms. Clayton's definition, and that would include the facts


in Claiborne Hardware.  That would include the Carry


Nation example.  The Seamless Garment Network brief goes


into many other examples. 


QUESTION:  If the conduct in Claiborne Hardware


was pretty rough.  Maybe it should have been included. 


QUESTION:  You're not going to get -- you're not


going to get my --


MR. ENGLERT: 


Your Honor, the -- the opinion of 

the Court in that case refers to it has having elements of


majesty as well as elements of violence.  And the Court


really should be concerned about whether the classic


historical pattern -- and please look at the Seamless


Garment Network brief -- the classic historical pattern of


venerable leaders whose followers get out of hand is


really what is meant by Hobbs Act extortion and RICO.


QUESTION:  No majesty with Carry Nation.  I


mean, you don't get my sympathy by saying you -- you might


have interfered with Carry Nation on --

that you would.


MR. ENGLERT:  There's another more legalistic


reason. 


Nation.


QUESTION:  I think both sides agree on Carry


MR. ENGLERT:  If -- if I may, there's another


more legalistic reason why Ms. Clayton's and the Solicitor


General's position has to be wrong, and Justice Breyer and


others have laid their finger on it, Justice Ginsburg as


well. 


What they're talking about is the classic


example of coercion, not extortion, and for those who like


legislative history, the fact that organized labor got 

coercion out of the statute should give you pause.  For


those who don't like legislative history, the fact that


there's a list of predicate acts and coercion isn't one of


them should give you pause. 


I think almost everyone agrees that there has to


be at the very least a remand in this case, and


Ms. Clayton hasn't quite conceded it.  But if this Court's


decision in Griffin v. United States, a criminal case, is


applicable in civil cases or if this Court's decisions in


Yates v. United States, Maryland v. Baldwin, Sunkist

Growers are applicable, then this jury verdict, which


almost indisputably rests, at least in part, on


indefensible notions of property, has to be reversed.


QUESTION:  Can I ask you one question about


that?  Did the individuals get damages here, or was it


just the clinics? 


MR. ENGLERT:  Only the clinics for extraordinary


security costs.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. ENGLERT:  Violence.  Let's talk about


violence for a moment.  Please look at -- at special


interrogatory 4(e).  The jury was asked to find how many


acts or threats of violence to persons or property were


there.  The jury said four.  Ms. Clayton argued 30 in her


closing argument, and the jury said 4.  So actually the


jury rejected -- we know to a certainty the jury rejected


most of NOW's evidence, and there weren't even any


allegations that Mr. Scheidler, Mr. Scholberg, or


Mr. Murphy actually engaged in violence.  There were


allegations they were connected to violence, not that they


engaged in violence.  And I should say my clients are


proponents of nonviolence.  Mr. Terry was not alleged to


engage in acts of violence either, I should add. 


RICO.  Section 4 of the Sherman Act is repeated


almost verbatim in 1964(a) and 1964(b).  Section 7 of the


62 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company

Section 4 of the Clayton Act is repeated almost verbatim


in 1964(c).  Section 15 of the Clayton Act is repeated


almost verbatim in 1964(a) and (b).  Section 16 of the


Clayton Act, the statute that authorizes injunctions,


nowhere in 1964.


And as -- as -- thank you. 


JUSTICE STEVENS:  Thank you, Mr. Englert.
