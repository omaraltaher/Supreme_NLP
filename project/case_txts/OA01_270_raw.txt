CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  The first case this


morning in which we'll hear argument is No. 01-270, Yellow


Transportation, Inc. v. Michigan.


Mr. Rothfeld. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The issue in this case is a narrow one, but it


has considerable practical importance for the continuing


flow of interstate commerce. 


In 1991, Congress enacted a statute that was


designed to ease the burdens that State registration fees


impose on trucks that travel interstate.  To help


accomplish that purpose, the statute provides that a


State's registration fee may not exceed the fee that the


State collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991. 


The question here before the Court is whether


that Federal standard precludes a State from now imposing


a fee on a category of trucks when the State waived the


fee as to that category of trucks and therefore did not


actually collect or charge it as of the controlling date.


QUESTION:  May I ask, did it waive the fee for

all carriers or just the carriers involved in this case?


MR. ROTHFELD:  It -- it waived the fee for all


carriers in the category that are involved in this case.


The State had in place a reciprocity policy. 


QUESTION:  But did it waive the fee for all


carriers in the State? 


MR. ROTHFELD:  I do not believe.  There is


actually nothing in the record, Justice Stevens, that


indicates how many States paid fees -- how many trucks


paid fees and how many did not.  It's my -- our


understanding that there were trucks that were not


benefitting from the reciprocity policy and therefore they


would have paid fees.  So I think -- I think that the


answer, although not reflected in the record, is that some


trucks paid fees and some did not.


QUESTION:  Thank you. 


MR. ROTHFELD:  As I say, the question is whether


if there is a fee that is waived as to a category of


trucks in 1991, whether or not that waiver must continue


to remain in place currently because of the --


QUESTION:  You -- you say as to a category of


trucks.  Why do you add that qualification?  Why shouldn't


it be true, if you're right, that if a truck -- if a fee


was waived as to any truck, it should remain in place?


MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, we think that the inquiry

that's posed by the statute is how were trucks of a


particular type treated.  And for example, imagine if a


State had in place a sliding scale of fees as to different


types of trucks at $10 for red trucks, $5 for white


trucks, and nothing for blue trucks.  The statute refers


to in -- in terms -- it says that the State's fee must


equal the fee not to exceed $10 per vehicle that the State


collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991.  Well,


what in that -- in that circumstance, what is the fee that


the State charged when there are these different


categories of trucks? 


We think it has to be understood to mean the fee


that the State charged to trucks of that type, and so, as


I say, in 1991 in Michigan trucks of a particular type,


trucks that were base-plated in the State of Illinois,


were not subject to fees.  We, therefore, think that under


the plain language of the statute, the same policy has to


apply to trucks in that category now. 


QUESTION:  Now, was there some change as of 1992


in connection with the fee applicable here?


MR. ROTHFELD:  There was a change that was


announced for the 1992 registration.


QUESTION:  Yes, and I guess that isn't before


us --


MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, that -- that --

 QUESTION:  -- in this case. 


MR. ROTHFELD:  To elaborate on -- on Justice


O'Connor's question, in 1991, the 1991 registration year,


there is no question, and it is undisputed, that for the


entitlement to operate in the State in 1991, on November


15th, 1991, the date identified as -- as crucial in the


statute, trucks that were base-plated in States that had


reciprocity understandings with -- with Illinois did not


have to pay fees.  And therefore, Yellow Transportation,


the petitioner here, whose trucks were base-plated in --


in Illinois did not pay fees. 


It is true, Justice O'Connor, that in -- towards


the end of 1991, prior to November 15th, the State


announced a change for the 1992 registration year, and


Yellow, being a diligent taxpayer, actually paid for 1992


prior to November 15th.


QUESTION:  What does the term base-plated mean?


MR. ROTHFELD:  Base-plated means that plates,


license plates, were issued by that State.  So the State


-- the title for the vehicles were in those States. 


Those --


QUESTION:  When you say base-plated in Illinois,


then that means the title was issued in Illinois --


MR. ROTHFELD:  The title --


QUESTION:  -- and it had Illinois license plates

on its truck?


MR. ROTHFELD:  Either Illinois license plates or


plates that were issued through Illinois.  There -- this


goes beyond any issue that's presented here, but there is


a understanding between the States, the International


Registration Plan, and there are international


registration plates that can be provided by -- by any


State, but it's provided through a single State.  And so


the license plates here for Yellow trucks, it is sort of


undisputed, were provided by Illinois.  So there is no


question that within the understanding of -- of the


Michigan scheme in 1991, the Yellow trucks were based in


Illinois and therefore benefitted from the reciprocity


policy in place in -- in Michigan.


QUESTION:  Your -- your test that you propose is


that it's the type of truck.  It -- I take it there's


nothing in -- in the statute or in regulatory


pronouncements that talk about types of trucks unless it's


the number of axles or something.  But type of truck, it


seems to me, can be applied in the generic way that


Michigan argues.  It's a type of truck because it was


within the exemption or without the exemption. 


MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, let me be clear what I --


what I mean by that, Justice Kennedy.  I don't mean type


of truck in terms of the number of axles or -- or the

weight of the truck.  I -- I mean the category -- the rule


that the State applied in 1991 -- the State had in place a


system of rules that applied, different -- as we know,


different fees to different types of trucks.  Let me give


you an example. 


Imagine that the State had a scheme in place in


which it charged $10 for red trucks, $5 for white trucks,


nothing for blue trucks, as I suggested before.  What is


the -- what is the fee that the State applied?  You have


to say the fee the State applied to who and look at the


rule that the State would have applied in 1991.  And that


means identifying the type of truck in the sense of how


would the rule categorize it.  And Congress has frozen in


place, we believe, the rules that governed fee levels at


the time. 


If that were not the approach one took and there


were these different --


QUESTION:  May I ask, under your hypothetical,


would that rule have prevented the company from repainting


its trucks, paint the blue trucks white or the white


trucks red, to get in a different category, which is what


happened here?  They moved from one place of registration


-- one rule where the trucks were licensed to a place of


the home office or something like that.  So could they


have later repainted their trucks?  Or in this case, could

they 2 years later have moved -- changed the -- the rule


on -- on which -- whether it's a place of licensing or the


home office? 


MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, if -- if the question,


Justice Stevens, is whether the -- the fee payer could


avoid the fee by somehow modifying its trucks --


QUESTION:  No, no, no.  Whether the State could


change its -- its -- as it did here.  It did it in one


year.  Could it have done the same thing, say, 3 years


later? 


MR. ROTHFELD:  Our -- our understanding, Your


Honor, is that that -- the State could not do that.  We


think that Congress has frozen in place expressly by the


terms of the statute --


QUESTION:  Locked in permanently to 1991.  So


even if -- let's say, the reciprocity agreement persists


in 1991, but Michigan wants to change it in 1993 and '94. 


It cannot.  It's locked in forever to a reciprocity


agreement that it made with its sister State only for the


year 1991.  Is that your reading?


MR. ROTHFELD:  Yes, and let me explain how we


think that applies. 


First, the statute went into effect in 1994,


although it was enacted in 1991.  So in the intervening


years, the State could have done whatever -- whatever it

wished. 


We think that Congress has frozen the fee levels


in place.  Now, whether those fee levels were established


by reciprocity rule or by unilateral State law or by


administrative fiat, it wouldn't matter.  The State had in


place in 1991 a policy that said trucks of a certain


character, trucks in this instance license plated in a --


in Illinois, were not subject to fees.  Fees were not


demanded from those trucks.  They weren't collected.  They


weren't charged.  Those trucks did not have to pay a fee


to entitle them to operate on the State's roads as of the


relevant period.  And that being the case, we think


Congress, which said the State's fee must equal the fee,


not to exceed $10 per vehicle --


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Rothfeld, the problem I


have with -- with your -- your argument is how does one go


about identifying the category?  Is the category Michigan


trucks, or is the category trucks subject to a reciprocity


agreement so that if a reciprocity agreement that used to


exist with Michigan were canceled, or if -- if a -- for


that matter, a reciprocity agreement that did -- that used


to not exist with New York were adopted, you come into the


category or go out of the category, depending upon whether


you have a reciprocity agreement?  What category are --


are you urging, and why do you pick that category instead

of -- instead of another one? 


MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, we are picking the category


that we think is -- was selected by Congress because


Congress said the fee in place in 1991 is frozen.  And so


if that --


QUESTION:  For -- for the particular truck, or


for the particular State as to which there is a


reciprocity agreement, or with respect to any State as to


which there is a reciprocity agreement?  It's hard to


figure out which category they -- they were talking about.


MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I think that it's not


complex in practice.  I think that what Congress was


asking the State to do is look at how it would have


treated a truck of this type in 1991.


QUESTION:  That's -- that's the key word, of


this type.


MR. ROTHFELD:  Well --


QUESTION:  But what type? 


MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, of whatever --


QUESTION:  Owned by this company?


MR. ROTHFELD:  No, no. 


QUESTION:  Or from this State, or subject -- or


from a State that has -- that currently has a reciprocity


agreement?


MR. ROTHFELD:  I think one would consider the

rule that was in place in the State just as it did in 1991


and say here's a truck, this truck is base-plated in


Illinois.  That is a characteristic this truck has, which


is relevant under our rule, because our rule says under


our existing reciprocity policy, we will not impose a fee


on a truck that has its license plate issued by Illinois. 


Therefore, this truck is not subject to a fee.


If such a truck comes along in 1995, after the


statute goes into effect -- and I should say the statute


here is the refreshing acronym, ISTEA, the Intermodal


Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.  When the ISTEA


statute went into effect, this same -- same truck goes


into the State of Michigan.  It has characteristics which


waive the fee to -- as to it, had this truck been there in


1991, those same characteristics make the State waive the


fee as to it now, because Congress has -- has used the


term the State may not charge fees that it was not


charging in 1991.  Again, the precise language is the


State's fee must equal the fee that the State collected or


charged. 


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. --


QUESTION:  What about new vehicles?  What about


a vehicle purchased, say, in 1995 base-plated in Illinois?


MR. ROTHFELD:  If such a vehicle is base-plated


in Illinois, that is the characteristic that is made

relevant by the State's rule in place in 1991.


QUESTION:  So it's not only vehicles that


existed in 1991, it's any vehicle thereafter acquired. 


So one -- one element of this is that Michigan


could not, on your reading, go over to the principal place


of business, which in this case is -- I take it, is Kansas


with no -- no reciprocity with Michigan -- could not


change that.  Everything is frozen forever under ISTEA. 


Is that your view?


MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that is our view, and we


think --


QUESTION:  Well that's one of your views.


And may -- may I ask you about the -- the answer


you didn't give to Justice Scalia?  Let's assume the


statute isn't as clear as -- as you are arguing that it


is.  Isn't this the point at which you say, if it's not


that clear, Chevron controls the answer? 


MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that is absolutely


correct, Justice Souter.  And if -- it is our view that


the -- that the statutory language is -- is unambiguous,


but if we are wrong about that and if there is any


opportunity to find any sort of -- any wiggle room for the


State in the statute, there is no doubt that the statute


does not unambiguously require that reciprocity --


requires States to -- to change their reciprocity rules

because the State -- the -- the statute refers, as I say,


only to the fee that was charged.  It certainly doesn't


say that States may change rules, particular types of


rules.  And that being the case, Chevron deference is


mandatory. 


Here, in fact, agency deference should be at its


height.  The agency here was expressly delegated by


Congress the responsibility for promulgating


interpretations of the ISTEA legislation.  It conducted


notice and comment rulemaking.  It received dozens of


comments from all interested parties, including the State


of Michigan.  It issued regulations.  It issued formal


interpretations of the statute.  It published a closely


reasoned explanation for its conclusion.  And in those


circumstances, I think every member of the Court has


recognized that deference under Chevron principles is at


its height, and because I think it -- it simply cannot be


said that the statutory language is clearly inconsistent


with the approach taken by the agency, the agency's


approach must be dispositive. 


And here, what the agency found, unambiguously


and expressly, dealing precisely with the question at


issue before the Court now, is that if States had


reciprocity policies in place in 1991, they may not amend,


change, rescind, modify those policies in such a way --

 QUESTION:  Well, but did they change their


reciprocity policy?  They just changed the way of


identifying the State that's relevant for determining


whether a particular truck has to pay or not.


MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I -- I think that is, in


our view, a change in the reciprocity policy.  The


reciprocity policy is determined by what -- by certain


factors.  The State -- it could be a principal place of


business.  It could be a different rule, place of license


plating. 


QUESTION:  Where in the regulations does it say


that the State may not do what it did here? 


MR. ROTHFELD:  The agency issued their


interpretations of its regulations, which were published


actually at two points.  There -- there was a rulemaking


proceeding, and along with rulemaking proceeding, it


issued, as I said, formal interpretations of the statute


and its rules.  There it indicated expressly that in its


view reciprocity agreements must be frozen and cannot be


modified. 


A number of States indicated that they wanted to


change their reciprocity rules, and the commission then


held a second administrative proceeding --


QUESTION:  Well, but did they change their


reciprocity -- did Michigan change its reciprocity

agreement with either Illinois or Arkansas in this case?


MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, there is actually some


question as to whether there were formal reciprocity


agreements in place.  There is no question Michigan had a


policy of providing fee waivers to trucks that were based


in States that in Michigan view provided equivalent


waivers to trucks that were based in Michigan.  Applying


that policy in 1991, Michigan was of the view that


Illinois provided such a waiver for Michigan trucks, and


therefore, Michigan, under its policy announced by its


public service commission, provided equivalent waiver for


trucks that were based in Illinois.  That was


unquestionably the rule that was in place in Michigan at


the relevant time, and because of that, we think, that was


the fee that was collected or charged. 


To identify the fee that was collected or


charged or can now be collected or charged from a


particular truck that comes from the State, one has to


look at the rule that was in place then and say, what was


the fee that would have been applied then to this truck? 


Under that approach, Michigan cannot now change its -- its


way of implementing reciprocity policies and therefore


charge trucks that would not have been charged at that


time.


If there are no further questions now, Your

QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Rothfeld.


Mr. Schlick, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK


ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, 


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. SCHLICK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Congress assigned responsibility for


implementing the single State registration system to the


Interstate Commerce Commission.  The ICC determined that


when States apply the statutory fee cap, they must


consider the reciprocal fee reductions and reciprocal fee


waivers that were in place as of November 15th, 1991. 


That interpretation serves the central purpose of the fee


cap provision, which was to grandfather the fees that were


in place as of 1991, but only those fees. 


The Michigan Supreme Court's generic fee rule,


on the other hand, would convert Congress's grandfather


provision into a provision that would allow new fees. 


The ICC's interpretation ensures that the capped


registration fee is equal to the fee that the State


actually collected or charged as of November 15th, 1991. 


Congress did not set the cap at the amount that the States


could have charged.  If Congress had wanted to do that,

the obvious thing to have done would have been to set the


cap at $10, which is the amount that the ICC allowed all


carriers to charge as of November 15th, 1991.


QUESTION:  Well, isn't there at least an


argument that Congress could have had that in mind by the


distinction between charged and collected?  I mean, if


there is presumably a difference between them, then the --


then the reference to charge would be to a fee that was


not collected, which would get you to the point which you


said Congress could have but did not provide for by the --


by the flat $10. 


So, I mean, I -- I'm not -- I guess what I'm


saying is, unless I'm missing something, I don't think


your statutory argument compels the conclusion, but your


Chevron argument is -- is -- perhaps takes care of your


position. 


MR. SCHLICK:  Certainly the Chevron argument is


-- is essential to this case.  We think that the most


natural reading of charge or -- of collected or charged,


though, is charged, demanded, collected, received.


QUESTION:  Even though that was not the


commission's first view.  The commission's first view of


this case is that the States would not be bound by the


reciprocity agreements and could charge -- whatever they


charged anyone, they could charge everyone.

 MR. SCHLICK:  That's right, Justice Ginsburg.


The ICC did, during the rulemaking proceeding, change its


interpretation.  As the D.C. Circuit said in NARUC v. ICC,


that's what comment periods are for.  And the -- the


commission ultimately relied not only on the plain


language of the statute, but also on the purposes


underlying the statute. 


The conference report on ISTEA makes clear that


there were two purposes in -- in Congress's mind when it


drafted the statute.  One was ensuring that -- ensuring


benefit to carriers, ensuring that the overall costs of


the -- of the State registration requirements were


minimized.  The second was preserving existing State


revenues. 


Michigan's approach, on the other hand, would


allow dramatic increases in the fee amounts, in this case


an increase from 0 to $10 per truck, that would overwhelm


the administrative savings that Congress intended to


ensure through the single State approach. 


That -- that also would be a very odd policy to


allow those increases since Congress would, in fact, have


been authorizing increases that the States themselves


chose not to implement as of 1991. 


QUESTION:  Let me just be sure you agree with


your colleague.  You take the position that they could not

have changed the -- the State to which they give


reciprocity by changing from licensing State to State of


principal place of business, even if they had done it 2 or


3 years later. 


MR. SCHLICK:  As a general matter, that's


correct, but let me explain, Justice Stevens, the


particular problem presented here, which has not been


addressed by the ICC or the Department of Transportation


and that we think is preserved on -- on remand.


As of November 15th, 1991, Michigan arguably had


two different fee systems in place.  The first was the fee


system for 1991.  If Yellow Transportation had come to the


State of Michigan and said, we'd like to add an additional


truck to -- to our registration for this year, effective


immediately, Michigan would have -- it would have charged


and Yellow would have paid under the old reciprocity


arrangement, under which the fact that the truck was base-


plated, had a license plate for Illinois would have been


dispositive. 


However, simultaneously, Michigan -- Michigan


was -- was demanding and Yellow paid fees under the 1992


reciprocity approach where the fact that the -- the truck


had a license plate from Illinois would not be relevant


and the fact that Yellow was headquartered in Kansas would


be relevant.  The ICC did not determine in its American

Trucking Associations proceeding, which -- which is the


relevant one on this question, whether the -- whether that


sort of -- of conflict would be resolved in favor of the


old rule or the new rule.  And that's the question that we


think should remain open on remand.  As a matter of fact,


right now the --


QUESTION:  I -- I don't understand.  I thought


-- I thought '91 is the -- is the -- is the base period


that -- that's consulted.  Why -- why would you use the


new rule? 


MR. SCHLICK:  The new rule would -- would be


implemented as -- as a result of this unusual situation,


unique in our -- in our experience, where there were two


-- where there two fee systems in place at the same time.


QUESTION:  There was only one in '91.  The


second one came in after '91.  If you allow a new fee


system to -- to change things, you should -- you should


allow a new reciprocity agreement to change things.  I --


I just don't see why this is a problem. 


MR. SCHLICK:  Well, the unique feature here is


that both were in place and operational as of November


15th, 1991.  And the -- that -- there's also a question of


whether the move to the new fee system --


QUESTION:  They -- they were both operating in


'91?

 MR. SCHLICK:  That's right.  As of November

QUESTION:  Okay.  I -- I --


MR. SCHLICK:  And operational.  Yellow might --


QUESTION:  I thought the change occurred in


January 1, 1992, but that's okay.


MR. SCHLICK:  To answer your question, Justice


Scalia, the -- the change -- the new system became


effective for the 1992 registration year commencing


January 1st, 1992, but the charges were assessed in the


fall of 1991. 


QUESTION:  So if Yellow Freight hadn't paid


early, would this argument be off the board?  In other


words, this -- this fee was paid.  The 1992 paid -- fee


was paid before November 15th, '91.  Suppose Yellow


Freight had waited till after January 1. 


MR. SCHLICK:  The significance of that, Justice


Ginsburg, would be something for the Department of


Transportation in a pending proceeding that's -- that is


open now to consider.  That -- that's -- that question has


not been answered, the significance of -- of the date of


payment. 


QUESTION:  But you're suggesting there's a


possibility that somebody would be penalized for early


payment, for prompt payment.

 MR. SCHLICK:  No.  I think there would be much


more to it than that.  And again, this is -- this is a --


a unique situation.  There have not been problems with


implementing this system, and the Department of


Transportation has before it a request for declaratory


ruling filed by Michigan, that was mooted by the Michigan


Supreme Court's decision which adopted this generic view


rule that moots out all these questions.  And that


proceeding could be reopened if this Court were to remand


to the Michigan Supreme Court. 


But the -- the specific significance of the date


on which Yellow made payment has not been addressed by the


ICC or by the Department of Transportation. 


The -- the fee system here -- the actual fee


rule of the ICC has been in place for almost 9 years now.


There have not been serious problems of administration. 


It's a mechanical process where States simply fill out the


-- carriers fill out a chart which has the applicable


State, the number of trucks in the State.  It's a matter


of multiplication and then adding some -- the fee for --


for each State. 


As I was explaining, the Michigan situation is


unique and should be left to be resolved by the Michigan


courts and by the Department of Transportation.

 QUESTION:  Do you say the same thing for the


argument that there in fact was no reciprocity in place


with Illinois in 1991? 


MR. SCHLICK:  We do, Justice Ginsburg.  That's a


-- a subpart of -- of this State-specific question.  The


facts surrounding that have -- have really not been


developed before the Michigan courts or even before the


Department of Transportation at this point. 


The ICC's interpretation of the fee cap is a


reasonable implementation of Congress's provision.  It's


consistent with the language of the statute and its


purposes and we submit that it should be upheld.  The


decision of the Michigan Supreme Court should be reversed,


and the case should be remanded. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Schlick. 


Mr. Casey, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. CASEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


Before I begin my principal argument, I would


like to spend just a moment on this -- this point of the


changeover in Michigan from base-plating to principal


place of business.  We believe it is not present in the --


in this case at this point.

 This case was litigated on that point throughout


the Michigan courts up until the Michigan Supreme Court


decision. 


Michigan had in place a system called base-


plating where we imposed fees based on the State in which


the vehicle was licensed.  In early 1991, the system


changed from that base-plating system to a system that all


the other States used based on the principal place of


business of the truck carrier.


QUESTION:  That was what determined reciprocity.


MR. CASEY:  That's what determined reciprocity. 


That's correct. 


And Yellow Freight Company, at that time Yellow


Transportation -- their trucks were licensed in Illinois,


a State with which Michigan has reciprocity, but its


principal place of business of the parent company is


Kansas, a State with which Michigan does not have


reciprocity.  And so when Michigan made this change during


1991, we then switched over and imposed fees for Yellow


Freight for the registration year of 1992.  But those


fees, as normal industry and State practice, were sent out


in September of 1991 for the next registration year.  And


Yellow Freight paid them in October of 1991.  Again,


that's typical industry practice.  They're assessed and


paid in advance of the registration year.

 The statute took effect here in December of


1991.  The statutory language that we're dealing with


talks about a fee that such State collected or charged as


of November 15th, 1991.  Our argument on the -- the way it


was litigated through the State courts is that Michigan


charged Yellow Freight before November 15th, 1991 and we


collected from Yellow Freight prior to 19 -- prior to


November 15th, 1991. 


QUESTION:  Albeit on a system that didn't go


into effect until --


MR. CASEY:  For the registration year 1992, we


charged and collected.  Yellow Freight disputed that. 


That's the way it was litigated up to the Michigan Supreme


Court.  It didn't involve this question of whether


reciprocity was relevant or irrelevant. 


The Michigan -- pardon me.  The Michigan Supreme


Court decided it on a -- a different basis than the other


State court opinions had.  And that raised the question


which this Court granted certiorari. 


In its briefs, Yellow Transportation has implied


that we've somehow waived that issue.  We have not.  We


did not brief it in this Court because this Court limited


the grant of certiorari to the issue that the supreme


court did decide.  So we -- we believe that the case


should be affirmed on the basis that the Supreme Court of

Michigan decided it.  If it is not affirmed, however, we


agree with the United States that the case should be


remanded to the Michigan Supreme Court for consideration


of this other issue which is still viable. 


So turning now to our principal argument in


defense of the Michigan Supreme Court's decision, the


statute required the ICC to implement a fee system, to


adopt a fee for the States, a fee system for a fee not to


exceed $10 per vehicle, that such State collected or


charged as of November 15th, 1991. 


Beginning with the statutory language, under


Chevron, if the intent of Congress is clear, that's the


end of the matter. 


The precise question that needs to be addressed


here is what did Congress intend.  How do you determine


the fee?  We believe that Congress's intent is clear. 


Under the language of this statute --


QUESTION:  Well, if we think it isn't altogether


clear and in fact could be read the other way, don't we


have to consider Chevron deference?  Because that's how


the agency has interpreted it. 


MR. CASEY:  If it -- yes, if -- if the statute


is not clear, then you proceed to the second step of


Chevron, which is whether the agency's interpretation is a


permissible one.  We believe we don't need to get to the

second step of Chevron because the text of the statute is


unambiguous. 


QUESTION:  But if you're wrong about the text


being unambiguous -- and you do have an uphill argument


there because didn't the two lower courts in Michigan


reason the other way?  Didn't they reject the argument


that the Michigan Supreme Court embraced?


MR. CASEY:  The -- I agree the second step of


Chevron is always an uphill argument, to overcome an


agency interpretation.  It's -- but on -- on the facts of


this case, on the text of this statute, we believe that


the agency interpretation is impermissible.  What the --


what the agency did here was not just interpret the


statute; they have, in fact, rewritten it.  They have


imposed conditions in the statute which are simply not


there. 


QUESTION:  But didn't the lower courts in


Michigan say that was a proper reading, that the ICC's


reading --


MR. CASEY:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- was a proper --


MR. CASEY:  Yes, they did.


QUESTION:  Which makes it harder for you to


argue that there is a plain meaning the other way.


MR. CASEY:  Yes, it does make it harder.  I

agree.  But it -- it is still a burden that we believe we


can overcome because we believe that, as this Court did in


the Whitman v. ATA, it is possible to look at a statute,


say a statute is ambiguous, and still say that an agency


interpretation is unreasonable.  We believe what the


agency has done here is unreasonable. 


What the agency has done here is add language to


the statute.  They have imposed the requirement in the


statute that you look at reciprocity agreements.  There is


nothing in the statute about looking at reciprocity


agreements.  There's nothing in the statute about looking


at particular carriers or how particular carriers are


treated.  All this statute -- this subsection of the


statute requires and permits is to look at what the State


collected or charged as of 1991, November 15th.


QUESTION:  Is there anything in the record that


indicates what percentage of revenue a State like Michigan


gets on the basis of these reciprocity agreements or how


much -- how much of its revenue from this kind of tax is


not affected by reciprocity agreements? 


MR. CASEY:  The record in this case is very


scant.  It was decided on summary disposition right after


filing of the complaint.  I do know that in the year 2000,


which is 9 years after the enactment of the statute, total


Michigan revenue from registration fees was $2.7 million.

There are 38 States participating in the single State


registration system.  We have reciprocity agreements with


21 of those States. 


QUESTION:  Thank you. 


MR. CASEY:  But I don't know how those


individually break down.  Michigan registers approximately


5,000 trucking carriers each year.  About half of them are


from Canada.  But I don't know.  That's intra- and


interstate carriers.  The fees for intrastate carriers are


different.  They're $100 instead of $10.  But the record


is very scant in this case because of the way it


developed. 


QUESTION:  Would you tell me again why you think


the statute is -- is clear and unambiguous in your favor? 


MR. CASEY:  There --


QUESTION:  I see -- I see the sense of a generic


approach because of the trucks being painted a different


color or reincorporation and so forth. 


MR. CASEY:  There -- there --


QUESTION:  But I'm not sure that I can find that


under the clear language of the statute.  There's a common


sense aspect to it. 


MR. CASEY:  There are very few words which are


at issue here.  The fee that such State collected or


charged as of November 15th, 1991.  We believe that means

you look only to what the State collected or charged under


its fee system.  That is, what -- if -- if a State


collected or charged its fee -- it's $10 in Michigan --


from any carrier as of November 15th, that ends the


matter.


QUESTION:  So you're reading in -- you're


reading in from any carrier.  And -- and, yes, that's


reasonable to read that in, I suppose.  But it's also


reasonable to read in from a carrier of -- of this sort. 


Or you could read in from this particular truck.  You


could read in a lot of -- you have to read in something,


it seems to me. 


MR. CASEY:  Well, if -- under our


interpretation, under -- under the plain text, we submit


you don't have to read in anything.  The -- the words,


collected or charged, are in the disjunctive.  They --


they're verbs.  They require something.  Charged means


sent out a bill or an invoice.  Collected means we


received something. 


QUESTION:  Let me ask you this.  Did -- does


Michigan -- did Michigan at the relevant time have a


scheme in which every truck of every size, weight, class,


et cetera was charged the same fee?  No.


MR. CASEY:  These -- these fees deal only


with --

 QUESTION:  No, but can you give me a yes or no


answer to that?  Did Michigan say, we have a law that says


if you are a truck, you pay X dollars, no ifs or buts?  Is


-- was that the Michigan law? 


MR. CASEY:  The statute in Michigan imposes a


$10 fee but permits a waiver, meaning 0. 


QUESTION:  So are you telling me that the answer


to my question is yes?  There is only one category known


in Michigan and that is the category of a truck?


MR. CASEY:  No.  There -- there -- there's a fee


of $10 or 0.  Some trucks were charged 10.  Some were


charged 0. 


QUESTION:  So there are at least two categories.


MR. CASEY:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And if there are at least two


categories, don't you have to do just what Justice Scalia


said you have to do?  You have to read something into the


statute, or you would be reading it in such a way as to


charge against a truck in category A what, under the


Michigan law, you would have charged against a truck for


category B.  That can't be right.  So that you've got to


-- as Justice Scalia has suggested, you've got to read in


some kind of a categorization in addition to the plain


meaning of the statute.  Isn't that right? 


MR. CASEY:  I -- I disagree.  The -- the words,

collected or charged, are in the disjunctive.  So if the


State either collected the fee as of November or charged


it as of November --


QUESTION:  No matter to whom.  No matter to what


truck.


MR. CASEY:  No matter to whom.  The fact --


QUESTION:  May I also suggest that the -- when


you look at those words in the context of the whole


subparagraph (4), which is the part --


MR. CASEY:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- which begins, shall establish a


fee system, so you're talking about collected or charged


as part of a system. 


MR. CASEY:  That's correct, Your Honor.  Well,


it's -- it's true.  And that -- that goes to another part


of our argument.  This -- this system or this section,


subsection (3), is the section in which Congress


implemented its goal of preserving State revenues.  There


-- there are two goals that Congress had in passing the


single State registration system.  One is to simplify the


whole procedure for the trucking industry and for States,


and two was to preserve State revenues.


This subsection (3) that we're dealing with is a


section that preserves State revenues.  And when you look


at it in that context, the text here deals only with fees

that the State collects.  There are other sections that


talk about payments by trucks to States.  There are


sections that talk about carriers specifically.  Congress


didn't use the word carriers in this subsection.  They


didn't use the words, payments by trucks to -- or by


carriers to States.  They could have used those words, as


they did in other subsections. 


QUESTION:  Carrier in your view signifying the


entity that owns the trucks? 


MR. CASEY:  Yes.


What -- you -- earlier you mentioned trucks of


different weights and things.  We're talking only here


about the power vehicle.  We're not talking about the


trailer part of the truck.  This is just for proof of


insurance.  It's a $10 only.  There are other fees that


various interstate agreements have for different axle


weights, and that kind of thing. 


QUESTION:  I -- I guess our point is that for


you to make the statute work, you are reading something


into it that isn't there, which is this generic system and


-- or this generic theory.  And there's a certain amount


of common sense to that, but it seems to me that by your


having to do that, you in effect concede the statute is


ambiguous and then your clear argument case collapses.


MR. CASEY:  Well, I would -- I respectfully

disagree, Your Honor.  I --


QUESTION:  The words, fee system, are in the


statute itself.  That's -- those are the first words in


the subsection to which you're --


MR. CASEY:  This -- correct.  This -- this


subsection is part of a fee system, and this -- this


subsection of that system is the section that deals with


ensuring that States receive their revenue.  And when you


put it in that context and you look at the specific words


of the statute here, when you look at the collected or


charged in the disjunctive, the statute --


QUESTION:  I don't understand what you get out


of the disjunctive. 


MR. CASEY:  The statute --


QUESTION:  How -- how does that help you? 


MR. CASEY:  The statute --


QUESTION:  It seems to me that for the trucks


that were from reciprocity States, the fee was neither


charged nor collected.  So how does the disjunctive help


you? 


MR. CASEY:  That's what the Michigan Supreme


Court said, in essence, that if the -- if the State


collected or charged the $10 fee, period, then the statute


is satisfied.


QUESTION:  Did the State sponsor that --

 MR. CASEY:  Everything else is irrelevant. 


Pardon me. 


QUESTION:  In Michigan you -- you helpfully


began your argument by pointing out that the case had been


decided on a different ground below.


MR. CASEY:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And this question of plain meaning or


not surfaced for the first time in the Michigan Supreme


Court, and that was the basis for its decision. 


MR. CASEY:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Did you make that argument?  Did the


State of Michigan make that argument, or was it something


that the Michigan Supreme Court brought up on its own?


MR. CASEY:  It was made in a few paragraphs as


one alternative argument in a long brief, but the


principal thrust of the argument -- it was -- it was


mentioned in the Michigan Court of Appeals opinion and


rejected.  It's in the appendix, I believe, on page 29


where they rejected it.  But, yes, it was presented to the


Michigan Court of Appeals.  It is still active in the


Michigan courts.


QUESTION:  You presented it but not as your main


argument. 


MR. CASEY:  Our argument -- our principal


argument, the way the case was framed in the State courts

was this timing issue.  Did Michigan properly switch over


from the base-plating to the principal place of business


and could we, therefore, impose the fee and apply the


statute to Yellow Freight? 


We also argued as one of our alternative


arguments that it didn't matter or that the -- the statute


didn't matter -- didn't apply to specific carriers, that


it applied broadly to everyone.  The supreme court at oral


argument asked -- started asking questions about this


theory that they ultimately decided it on.  But the -- the


theory that the Michigan Supreme Court decided the case on


was, by no means, the -- the principal focus of the -- the


case that was briefed and argued below. 


QUESTION:  General Casey, you -- you say that


the purpose of this section was to preserve State


revenues, but -- but -- the consequence of the -- the


theory that you're espousing is -- is not just to preserve


State revenues, but to augment them.  It -- it allows the


States to -- to take in significantly more than they took


in before.  That is, all of those considerable States that


had reciprocity and from whom they collected, from whose


trucks they collected nothing, they can now collect $10. 


That -- that's -- it goes far beyond preserving State


revenues. 


MR. CASEY:  Well, the -- we -- we submit that

the fears that have been expressed in our opponents'


briefs that these reciprocity agreements will


automatically be abrogated is unfounded, for a couple of


reasons, principally because those reciprocity agreements


were originally entered into by States for economic


reasons, totally apart from the -- the statute.  It's not


as though the -- the State is looking at this as a -- as a


giant money-making event --


QUESTION:  I understand that.  I'm -- I'm not


worried about the sky falling, but I'm addressing your


argument from the purpose of the statute.  And you say the


purpose is to preserve State revenues, but you come up


with a theory that goes far beyond preserving State


revenues.  It permits the States to augment their -- their


revenues considerably.  In -- in order to preserve State


revenues, you need go no further than -- than your


opponents' theory.


MR. CASEY:  Under their interpretation what has


happened, in effect, is that State revenues are at best


frozen, but in practical effect, they may really be


ratcheted downward because of changing economic


circumstances. 


QUESTION:  Would you explain one thing to me


that response -- it relates to Justice Scalia's question,


too.  In this particular case, it clearly augmented State

revenues because the place of -- principal place of


business of this carrier doesn't have a reciprocity


agreement.  But it would seem to me that with respect to


other carriers, it might diminish the revenue because some


of them -- it might be just the reverse.  They might have


-- that change might go from a State with -- with a --


without a reciprocity agreement to one that does have --


MR. CASEY:  Well, when Michigan changed from a


base-plating to principal place of business, it resulted


in, on balance, no economic benefit. 


QUESTION:  With respect to some States, it would


increase revenues; with respect to others, it would


decrease revenues. 


MR. CASEY:  Correct.  But --


QUESTION:  But your -- your argument is you can


charge everybody $10 no matter from what State.  Isn't --


isn't that your theory? 


MR. CASEY:  Our -- the Michigan Supreme -- under


the --


QUESTION:  That you can, as far as the Federal


statute is concerned, charge everybody $10.


MR. CASEY:  Or the maximum that they were


charging at the time that the statute took effect.  It may


not have been $10.  Whatever their State maximum that they


were charging at the time, and some States don't have $10.

 QUESTION:  No.  I'm -- as far as Michigan is

MR. CASEY:  As far as Michigan is concerned.


QUESTION:  -- your argument is that you can


charge everybody the full $10.


MR. CASEY:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  But Michigan has some interest in


getting its own trucks -- having lower fees in other


States I suppose. 


MR. CASEY:  Of course.  As we've indicated in


our briefs, Michigan has committed that we are not going


to abrogate our reciprocity agreements, but as I -- as


I've indicated, there are economic reasons why States are


not going to, in a wholesale, abrogate these -- or these


reciprocity agreements.  They're not going to cut their


own throats by -- by doing that.  They -- they have to


live with these trucking companies.  They have to live


with these economic benefits that cause them to enter into


these reciprocity agreements in the first place. 


And -- and there's another factor at work here


too.  The -- the 1994 ICC Termination Act required


Congress -- or excuse me -- required the Department of


Transportation to replace this entire regulatory scheme as


of 1997, but it has not happened yet.  Depending on the


outcome of this case, it -- this may serve as an impetus

to replace this entire system with something that could


serve both the States and the trucking industry better


than the current system.  But the -- as -- as you


indicated, the sky is very unlikely to fall regardless of


what this Court does if -- if it affirms the supreme court


or not. 


QUESTION:  May I ask you a question?  What --


how would you come out or how would the case come out if


we decided that the statute required every State to


maintain existing reciprocity agreements?  It couldn't --


they couldn't charge higher fees and they couldn't cancel


reciprocity agreements.  Would you win or lose if we


interpret it that way? 


MR. CASEY:  Would Michigan win or lose?


QUESTION:  Yes, in this case.  As I understand


it, you haven't changed any reciprocity agreement.  You've


merely changed the method of deciding which State is


relevant for the purposes of granting reciprocity to


particular truckers.


MR. CASEY:  Michigan probably would not win or


lose in that.  It would probably be no change --


QUESTION:  You assert the right to terminate


reciprocity agreements.  You -- you --


MR. CASEY:  That -- under the --

 MR. CASEY:  Under the theory --


QUESTION:  -- is that despite this Federal


statute, you can terminate your reciprocity agreement with


Kansas and charge the full $10.  Right? 


MR. CASEY:  That's the theory of the Michigan


Supreme Court opinion.  Yes, it is, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  But you haven't terminated the


agreement, have you? 


MR. CASEY:  We -- we have an agreement with


Illinois, not Kansas.  But we have not.  We have --


Michigan has not terminated any reciprocity agreements. 


Michigan will not.  Other -- under this rationale, other


States could as a --


QUESTION:  General Casey I have a question about


the response you just gave.  I thought there was lurking


in this case as an issue, if there should be a remand,


that there was no viable reciprocity agreement with


Illinois, that that terminated in 1989.  Are you -- are


you --


MR. CASEY:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- abandoning that argument? 


MR. CASEY:  No.  There -- in the past, back in


the early 1980s, there were formal written contracts of


reciprocity.  When Michigan passed its statute in 1989


formalizing the $10 fee, the public service commission

terminated those contracts and contacted every State with


which it had reciprocity to verify this. 


This whole question of reciprocity is somewhat


uncertain.  Many States are not sure with whom they have


reciprocity because various State --


QUESTION:  Is that a -- is that a live issue in


this case? 


MR. CASEY:  Michigan has a reciprocity agreement


with Illinois, we believe.  We -- we operate our system as


though we -- we give reciprocity to trucks licensed in


Illinois, and it's our understanding that Illinois gives


reciprocity to trucks licensed in Michigan.


QUESTION:  So there would be no point in saying


that that's an issue open for a possible remand.


MR. CASEY:  That's -- I believe that's correct.


QUESTION:  But that's not right.  You don't give


reciprocity to trucks licensed in Illinois.  You give


reciprocity to trucks who are owned by companies who have


principal place of business in Illinois. 


MR. CASEY:  That's correct.  I misspoke myself,


Your Honor.  Thank you.  For purposes of this case, at the


time we had the base-plating system, but now it's -- if --


if we ultimately lose on that other point and we are stuck


with the base-plating method and could not -- and the


Michigan court rules against us and we are stuck with the

base-plating method, that could cause a problem for


Michigan. 


Let me -- let me just close by saying that we


believe that the Michigan Supreme Court's decision is


faithful to the text, results in a consistent and a


coherent interpretation of the Federal statute, that is


consistent with the congressional intent, and we believe


it should be affirmed.  If it is not affirmed, we urge the


Court to remand the case back to the Michigan Supreme


Court for consideration of the other issues that were not


considered by it. 


If there are no further questions. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Casey. 


Mr. Rothfeld, you have 4 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  A


couple of quick points. 


First, we think that the key issue in the case


has been identified by questions from a number of members


of the Court.  Something has to be read into the statute. 


Now, we think what we would read into the statute is


clearly the correct thing to read into it, but even if we


are not absolutely right about that, petitioner should


prevail because given the agency's determination here, the

-- the tie goes to this side of the table and we think


that that should be dispositive on that issue in the case.


Second, there's been some discussion about


issues that are other issues in the case and -- and the


proper disposition as to them.  We think that there is no


question about the existence of reciprocity agreements or


policies that would require remand, in response to Justice


Ginsburg's question.  I think Mr. Casey has candidly


acknowledged that there was clearly a reciprocity policy


in place in Michigan, whether identified reciprocity


agreement or simply unilateral policy.  There was no


question about the nature of that policy.  There has been


no dispute throughout the entire course of this litigation


about whether there was such a policy and whether it was


consistently enforced.  And therefore, there -- I think


there is no subject there to be considered further on


remand.


The question of whether Michigan's prospective


change in its policy for the 1992 registration year and


whether Yellow's diligence in paying that early should


somehow affect the proper outcome here and require Yellow


to pay in the future --


QUESTION:  I didn't understand the last clause


that you just spoke. 


MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, the -- the question whether

the fact that Yellow paid in advance of November 15th,


1991 for a registration year that was not going to go into


effect until sometime in 1992 --


QUESTION:  Well, the statute says collected or


charged. 


MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, as of 1991, and the


question is collected or charged, in our view, for what? 


And we think it's for the entitlement to operate on


Michigan's roads at the relevant time. 


I guess I would take a little bit of issue with


what Mr. Schlick said.  The -- the ICC we think expressly


addressed that point in its declaratory order when States,


including Michigan, said --


QUESTION:  Well, but it really hasn't been fully


fleshed out here, that particular angle.  I -- I think it


would be perfectly consistent to agree with your basic


position and still feel that was open on remand, as -- as


the Solicitor General said. 


MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, our view is that if that is


-- if there's to be further litigation on that point, the


proper forum for that is the administrative proceeding


that -- that Mr. Schlick also mentioned.  There is


actually pending before the Department of Transportation a


proceeding initiated by Michigan which takes issue with


the ATA's -- with the -- the ICC's determination on that

point and asks for reconsideration by the agency.  We


think that that is the appropriate place to consider that


where the agency can exercise its expertise.  We then


appeal to the D.C. Circuit if there's to be some -- some


question about it.  So that -- that's what we would


suggest is the appropriate --


QUESTION:  But why should we get into an issue


that the Michigan Supreme Court didn't resolve?  It is an


issue.  You may be right or wrong on the merits of it, but


at least we would not -- we are here reviewing a


determination made by the Michigan Supreme Court.  You are


saying that we should, at the same time, strike at an


issue that the Michigan Supreme Court didn't reach.


MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, it is true the Michigan


Supreme Court did not decide it.  Our suggestion is that


the more appropriate place for it to be subject to further


litigation, if there is to be further litigation, is in


this agency proceeding with an appeal to the Federal


court.  But -- but you are correct that it was not


expressly addressed by the Michigan Supreme Court in this


-- in this case.


One final point quickly in response to Justice


Stevens' question about whether the State terminated


reciprocity agreements or -- or not, or simply changed its


policy.  We think it doesn't matter how you look at it.

Either way, the State clearly changed the rule that it was


applying.  It had a clearly articulated rule consistently


applied that trucks based in certain places would not be


subject to fees.  It is now changing that rule and it's


therefore trying to collect and charge fees as to those


trucks that it did not charge before or collect before,


and we think that is clearly precluded by the statutory


language and is certainly decided by the ICC adversely to


Michigan. 


If there are no further questions, Mr.


Justice --


QUESTION:  Could I ask on that question?  The --


the point is should not exceed the fee that was charged. 


If in the aggregate the change from the place of


determining which State applies, if the aggregate were to


decrease the collections, which theoretically it could be,


then there would be no violation of the statute, as I


understand it. 


MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, we think it can't be


considered in the aggregate.  First of all, the statutory


language refers to the fee per vehicle. 


QUESTION:  No, a fee system it refers to.


MR. ROTHFELD:  It does, but if I may, Mr. Chief


Justice, just respond briefly.  The particular provision


which has the fee-freezing provision refers to the fee per


48 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

vehicle. 	 So I think that would be precluded. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld. 


MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  The case is submitted.
