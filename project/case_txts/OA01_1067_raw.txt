JUSTICE STEVENS:  The Court will hear argument


in United States against the White Mountain Apache Tribe.


Mr. Garre.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GARRE:  Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may


it please the Court:


In 1960, Congress declared the former Fort


Apache military post to be held in trust for the White


Mountain Apache Tribe.  The specific --


QUESTION:  What condition was it in in 1960? 


Was it basically like it is today, or has it gotten worse? 


What was it like then? 


MR. GARRE:  Well, it -- it's certainly much


older today.  It's about 40 years older today.  The


condition the -- the legislative history doesn't discuss


the condition of the fort in particular detail. 


It's important to recognize that the military


fort was built for temporary use -- today, some -- almost


a century ago, and in 1960 had been built for temporary


use, you know, more than 50, 60, or 70 years ago.  So it


wouldn't at all have been surprising if there had been a


state of decay in 1960.

 And of course, when Congress passed the 1960


statute, there was no indication at all -- certainly not


on the face of the statute, or in the legislative history


that's contained in respondent's lodging -- that it had in


mind a historic preservation goal, or that it had in mind


that -- that it would require the Secretary of the


Interior to undertake the enormous financial


responsibility of having to restore a century-old fort.


QUESTION:  -- making use today of a portion of


the structures there for the school and administrative


needs? 


MR. GARRE:  Absolutely, Justice O'Connor. 


The -- the vast majority of the buildings and historic


district area of Fort Apache are used today for school and


administrative purposes. 
 The Bureau of --

QUESTION:  Are those maintained in some fashion


for that use by the Federal Government? 


MR. GARRE:  They are.  As we point out in note 1


of our reply brief, the Department of the Interior has


spent more than $3 million over the past decade or


15 years on repair and maintenance projects at the fort. 


It's also true that the tribe itself has engaged in


historic restoration efforts at the fort with the support


of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of the


Interior, and with the assistance of private, State, and

even -- in some cases -- Federal tax dollars.


QUESTION:  Well, the U.S. Government does hold


the property in trust for the tribe -- the White Mountain


Tribe.  Right? 


MR. GARRE:  That's true.  Just like the U.S.


Government --


QUESTION:  And what basic responsibility does


that entail, would you say, the fact that the Government


is a trustee? 


MR. GARRE:  Well, when Congress places land in


trust for Indians, it has two well-settled meanings that


this Court has recognized.  First, it places a restraint


on the alienation of property, and second, it immunizes


the property from State taxation.  And if you look at


pages 6 and 7 of the respondent's lodging, that indicates 

that in 1958, when there was discussion about what to do


with Fort Apache, the tribe itself encouraged the


Department to have Congress place the land in trust so


that it was in a nontaxable status like the surrounding


reservation lands. 


Now, we know from the first Mitchell decision


decided by this Court that simply placing property in


trust does not in itself create a substantive right to


money damages. 


QUESTION:  But there was an enormous difference

in that case in that the Indians managed the land.  Under


the General Allotments Act, the idea was to make the


individual owner autonomous.  Here, I think it's not


disputed that this land has been operated by the U.S.


Government, and the U.S. Government has exclusive control.


MR. GARRE:  Justice Ginsburg, that -- that may


be true in the factual sense, but the 1960 act -- that is,


that the Federal Government is using the property, but the


1960 act -- quite unlike the General Allotment Act --


specifically reserves to the Government the right to use


the property for Government uses.  And in that respect, we


think the trust relationship created by the statute in


this case is much more limited than the one that was


created by the statute in Mitchell I, and the existence of


factual Federal control cannot in itself give rise to a 

damages action under the Tucker Act. 


QUESTION:  Can you just explain one small point


to -- to me?  I know what "school purpose" means.  What is


"administrative"?  Is that administrative in connection


with the school, or some free-floating administration? 


MR. GARRE:  Well, I -- I think generally, the


"administrative use" can refer to executive uses, and is a


very broad term.  In that respect, I think it's


instructive that Congress used that term.  Nevertheless,


I think that -- that "administrative purposes" has to be

read with school purposes, and can be read to refer to


both uses for storage and the like, and also for


administrative purposes used by the Bureau of Indian


Affairs to undertake activities at Fort Apache or -- or on


the surrounding reservation.  So in that respect, it's


administrative for the purpose of the Department of the


Interior, who operates activities there through the local


agent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 


Now --


QUESTION:  Mr. Garre, is -- is any of the -- or


let me ask you an open-ended question.  How much of the


property which is the subject of this claim was within the


Government's control throughout this period, and how much


of it was not? 


MR. GARRE: 


Oh, well, our position would be that 

the vast majority, if not all, was -- well, that's not


true.  The -- the vast majority of the property has been


within the Government's control, but it's important to


recognize that the court of appeals' decision remands for


building-by-building, in a sense, trial on the existence


of Federal use and control.  And the tribe does have


access to the Fort Apache property.  The tribe is there. 


The tribe even has a -- a cultural museum that it operates


on the property.  So it's -- it's not as though this is a


Federal enclave --

 QUESTION:  Well, is the tribe making -- is the


tribe making a monetary claim with respect to property


which it has had in its control, as distinct from the


Government's, during this period?


MR. GARRE:  If you look at appendix A to the


tribe's complaint, which -- which has a detailed building-


by-building analysis of the ways in which the building


don't meet certain requirements, I think it's fair to say


the tribe's damages claim extends to all the buildings at


Fort Apache and that, therefore, it may extend to


buildings over which the Federal Government is not -- have


any active use or -- or control. 


But we don't think that a damages action can be


brought against the United States based on some fact-


bound, manipulable notion of Federal control. 

QUESTION:  No.  I -- I realize that.  I realize


that. 


MR. GARRE:  Under the Tucker Act -- and this


Court emphasized it in the Mitchell decisions, and it's


emphasized it in other decisions -- a substantive right to


damages against the United States -- which, after all, is


a right to damages against the public fisc -- has to be


grounded in a source of substantive law. 


QUESTION:  Well, if -- can we talk just for a


moment about the analogy?  And we'll call it just that,

the area of private trusts. 


I -- I take it that usually a trustee, who has


the obligation to repair buildings for the beneficiaries


so they don't fall into disrepair, does so at the


beneficiaries' expense. 


MR. GARRE:  That -- that's true. 


QUESTION:  And that -- that didn't seem to


figure into your argument.  Again, it -- it struck me,


as -- reading the briefs -- that that was an argument --


you don't really make that argument. 


MR. GARRE:  Well --


QUESTION:  Is that because the trustee here is


both the beneficiary -- is -- is a co-beneficiary of the


trust?


MR. GARRE: 


That is true and it's much unlike 

the typical common law trust, but the -- the most


fundamental reason, Justice Kennedy, is we don't think


that a court should have to plumb through the common law


to determine whether or not Congress established a right


to damages against the United States in this case. 


And it's also true -- if you look at the common


law, the first thing you -- you're met with -- with -- is


with the general rule that you can't get breach of trust


damages against the sovereign.  So you'd have to get --


not only you'd have to get around the courts --

 QUESTION:  Well, but that -- but, I mean, that's


the whole purpose of the Tucker Act.  I mean, to -- to


plead sovereign immunity begs the question.  That's


exactly the question before us. 


MR. GARRE:  Well, and I agree, Justice Scalia,


and we think that that question should be answered by


looking to the act of Congress on which the tribe relies,


which is the 1960 act. 


QUESTION:  Well, but it would have seemed to me,


following Justice Scalia's question and my own, that if


the law of trusts gave a clear indication one way or the


other that there was a liability, then the Tucker Act


analysis might -- might be different accordingly.


MR. GARRE:  With respect, I disagree.  And I


think the Mitchell I case establishes that.  In


Mitchell I, both the Court of Claims and the dissenters on


this Court reasoned that because the General Allotment Act


placed land, quote, in trust, that therefore one could


look to the common law and therefore one could import into


the Tucker Act all the liabilities that would follow


against a private trustee, even liabilities that would


result in damages actions.  A majority of this Court


rejected that analysis. 


Now, in Mitchell II, the Court specifically


affirmed the result in Mitchell I, and it emphasized that

Mitchell II was different because in that case, the Court


had statutes and regulations that created specific


management duties that could be fairly interpreted as


mandating the payment of compensation for the breach of


those duties. 


Now, the court of appeals recognized at page 18a


of the petition appendix -- and the -- even the tribe


recognizes on page 11 of its brief -- that the 1960 act


doesn't set forth any specific management duties on the


part of the Government. 


QUESTION:  Do you think the Government could


have just destroyed the property or the structures on the


land? 


MR. GARRE:  Well, I -- Justice Stevens, I think


that the notion that the Government would destroy the 

property, if it did so in a way that was clearly


inconsistent with the terms of the act --


QUESTION:  Let me put it another way.  Do you


think they had a duty not to destroy the property? 


MR. GARRE:  That -- that duty, if it exists,


comes from ordinary tort principles and from principles of


just compensation under the Fifth Amendment.  And those


claims haven't been asserted in this case.  This case


involves a breach of trust action, a claim for damages


based on the alleged breach of trust which the tribe

grounds in the 1960 act, and --


QUESTION:  No, I understand.  But part of the


question we have is to what extent did the Government


assume duties beyond immunizing the property from State


taxation and preventing its alienation.  Did they have any


additional duties?  And I'm not clear on whether you've


told me they had a duty not to destroy it or not. 


MR. GARRE:  Not under -- under the 1960 act, the


statute in this case.  Now, if the Government had --


QUESTION:  But did they -- from any source, did


they have a duty not to destroy it? 


MR. GARRE:  I -- I think -- I think it would,


Justice Stevens.  If I could respond by -- by maybe


running through some hypotheticals --


QUESTION: 


You'd help me if you responded yes or 

no, to be honest with you. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. GARRE:  Yes, it would under the Fifth


Amendment to the Constitution if Congress sold the fort to


someone else, or if Congress destroyed the fort.  Then the


tribe might have a claim for just compensation.  The tribe


has referred to some just compensation cases in its brief,


but it hasn't brought a just compensation claim in this


case. 


The tribe also might seek to bring a damages

action under the Federal Torts Claimed Act -- Tort Claims


Act for some kind of destruction of property.  The tribe


hasn't brought that --


QUESTION:  So you are -- to this extent, you're


differing from counsel's position before the Federal


Circuit, because I believe at that level, counsel was


asked if the United States could dynamite all the


buildings to the ground with no liability to the tribe,


and the answer was yes. 


MR. GARRE:  Well, it's -- it's not clear to me


the context in which that question came up. 


But I also think that it's true that if the


Secretary decided that it was necessary to level a


building because it proves an attractive nuisance to


school children, or because it was desirable to build a 

more -- newer and better educational facility at the fort,


that the 1960 act would authorize the Secretary to do


that. 


But -- but we do recognize that there are other


principles in this area stemming from the Fifth Amendment,


a source of substantive law, stemming possibly from the


Federal Torts Claims Act, another source of substantive


law, which aren't invoked in this case, which might be


implicated based on the Government's management of the


property.

 QUESTION:  Well, how about Mitchell II?


MR. GARRE:  Well, in Mitchell II, Justice


O'Connor, the statutes and regulations there, which --


which the Court described as a pervasive, statutory scheme


governing Indian timber management, provided specific


fiduciary management duties that could be fairly


interpreted as -- as mandating payment of compensation. 


They -- they specifically govern the generation of profits


or proceeds for the Indian tribe, and in that case, the


Court held that the violation of those duties, grounded in


a statute or regulation, gave rise to a money damages


action under the Tucker Act.  This case is --


QUESTION:  Well, how would -- how would you


describe the duties the United States has as trustee with


relation to this property? 


How would you describe the sum 

total of its duties? 


MR. GARRE:  I think the -- the principal duties


are the ones that the Court has always recognized when it


places land in trust:  not to alienate the land and -- and


it immunizes it from State taxation. 


QUESTION:  In -- in effect, I think what you're


saying is that there are no trust duties.  There's a


peculiarity here.  The word trust in -- as you're using it


in the argument, simply has those two implications:  don't


give it away and place it in a -- in a condition or -- or,

by virtue of the word trust, it is in a condition to avoid


taxation. 


MR. GARRE:  Well --


QUESTION:  I think you're saying that there are


no fiduciary duties beyond that.  If there is any duty


beyond that, it's got to come from the Constitution, or


it's got to come from a specific provision of -- of a


statute creating a duty not necessarily as -- as that of a


trustee, but simply as a statutory duty.  Isn't that


correct? 


MR. GARRE:  That's correct when the tribe comes


into court under the Tucker Act and asserts a claim for


monetary damages against the United States Treasury. 


We're dealing against an area of sovereign immunity where


the United States is immune from damages for breach of 

trust unless Congress --


QUESTION:  But I think you're saying two things,


and they -- they mesh perfectly.  One, you're making a


sovereign immunity argument.  Two, you're saying there is


no trust responsibility whatsoever on the part of the


trustee except not to alienate.


MR. GARRE:  Not enforceable in an action for


monetary damages.  Of course, in this area, the Court has


recognized --


QUESTION:  So you are conceding that there --

that there might be equitable remedies based on -- on a


theory of fiduciary duty? 


MR. GARRE:  It's conceivable that there would be


an equitable remedy based on a violation of statute, not


on equitable duties.  This is -- this is a realm --


QUESTION:  So that if -- may -- may I just, you


know --


MR. GARRE:  Yes.  Sorry.


QUESTION:  -- pursue the example that Justice


Stevens used?  If the Government said, 30 days from now,


we are going to blow up all the buildings, there would be


a -- an -- an equitable remedy based upon fiduciary duty? 


MR. GARRE:  I think in that situation, Justice


Souter, the tribe might be able to bring an injunction --


injunctive action perhaps under the APA claiming that that 

use of the property, the destruction of it, would exceed


the scope of the Government's use right under the 1960


act.


QUESTION:  Well, is that -- I -- I don't


understand what you're saying. 


MR. GARRE:  That -- that would be under statute,


not on some --


QUESTION:  So -- so you're saying that would not


be based on fiduciary responsibility? 


MR. GARRE:  Well --

 QUESTION:  If -- if it exceeded the Government's


use right, what -- what other obligation -- what would be


the source of -- of a -- of an obligation if -- if it was


not fiduciary duty? 


MR. GARRE:  I think it could be a property


interest as well.  I mean, we acknowledge that the 1968 --


the 1960 act gives this tribe --


QUESTION:  But the property interest takes into


consideration the trust relationship, doesn't it? 


MR. GARRE:  Well, it doesn't necessarily have


to.  The Court has had many cases brought by Indian tribes


claiming just compensation under the Fifth Amendment of --


of property, which -- at least in some management -- some


aspects would have a trust in it.  Overlapping all this


area is the notion that the Government has political and 

moral responsibility to the Indian tribes, and the Court


has recognized that throughout its decisions since --


QUESTION:  Well, but -- just -- just to put


Justice Souter's question back before you -- and my own: 


What trust duties does the United States have in addition


to not alienating the property, and making sure that it's


immune from State taxation?  I think your answer is it has


no fiduciary obligations at all.  There may be some


obligations under the Fifth Amendment to protect property,


et cetera, but as a trustee, it has no fiduciary

obligations other than the ones that are mentioned.


MR. GARRE:  The United States has general


fiduciary obligations to the Indian tribes that this


Court has recognized.  But the Court has never


recognized -- and I think it rejected the notion in the


Mitchell I case that --


QUESTION:  Well, but do those general


obligations with reference to this property import any


duty other than the duty not to alienate and to ensure


that it's immune from State taxation?


MR. GARRE:  Not a duty and certainly not a duty


that's enforceable in an action for monetary damages.


QUESTION:  Well, I would have thought there


might well be a duty for the trustee -- the U.S.


Government acting as trustee here -- not to lay waste to 

the property held in trust for the tribe --


MR. GARRE:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- not to affirmatively lay waste to


it or -- or allow something to happen that just the


ordinary care would suggest should not happen.


MR. GARRE:  Justice O'Connor, that duty


certainly is not expressed in the terms of the 1960


statute, and -- and, of course, there are other


statutory --


QUESTION:  Well, except to the extent that the

statute does say, all right, this property, Fort Apache,


is to be held by the U.S. Government in trust for the


tribe.  And maybe that conveys some notion, in addition to


not alienating it, not laying waste to it.  Now, whether


what's done fits that I don't know.  Maybe ordinary wear


and tear isn't covered, but --


MR. GARRE:  I -- I don't think that that


position would be consistent with the Court's ruling in


Mitchell I, where the Court rejected the notion that the


use of language, in trust, subjects the United States to


all the liabilities of a private trustee.


QUESTION:  Well, there's a little more here than


was true in Mitchell I.  It's specific property, hold it


in trust, and the Government can use it for a school or


administrative needs, but there -- there's something more 

than was in Mitchell I.


MR. GARRE:  With respect, I think that there --


there's less, Justice O'Connor, that -- that Congress


specifically carved out of the trust relationship the


right of the Government to use the property for the


Government's purposes. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Garre, there -- there is one


significant difference, and that is the control element. 


Mitchell I stressed that the control was with the


allottee.  Mitchell II has a whole paragraph that says

what's key is who has control.  And as I read it, it was


that these specific instructions were an indication that


the U.S. had exclusive control, but that the real thing


was the control, who has control of this property.


MR. GARRE:  But -- but there's a key difference,


Justice Ginsburg, between this case and Mitchell II with


respect to the question of control.  In Mitchell II, the


Court emphasized throughout its decision and -- and


discussed the statutes and regulations in detail for more


than four pages.  The control stemmed from specific


statutory and regulatory duties that were created by


Congress in that case, and the Court found that the


violation of those specific duties, which could be


fairly -- fairly interpreted as mandating compensation,


gave rise to a damages claim against the United States. 

In this case, the tribe can't point to a single


statute or regulation, and the only statute it relies in


this case -- in this Court is the 1960 act that creates


any --


QUESTION:  Well, then you're -- you're reading


it differently than I have just set it out.  As I take the


Court to have said control is key, and these specific


regulations show that there is indeed control, that the


United States runs the show.  But the nature of this


trust, there wouldn't be any instructions.  You wouldn't

expect there to be detailed instructions.  The question is


who was in control. 


MR. GARRE:  Well, there -- there is no specific


management duty in this case.  Instead of the situation in


Mitchell I or Mitchell II, Congress gave --


QUESTION:  Can I interrupt with just one -- one


question?  The trust here refers not only to the land but


to the improvements.  Doesn't that make a difference?  In


a -- in a private situation wouldn't that normally create


in the -- the trustee a duty to ensure against fire, and


to take care of the improvements as opposed to just bare


legal title to the property? 


MR. GARRE:  It -- it might, Justice Stevens, but


I think the reference to that also is important in terms


of Congress' express delegation to the Secretary the duty 

to use all of the trust property, the land and the


buildings, to operate an Indian school there, which is


the -- the use that -- that the property had been put


since the 1920s.


QUESTION:  So in your -- in your opinion, if


this statute had added the words, and if the Government


does take control, it shall use ordinary prudence and


skill to preserve the property, then they'd have a claim.


MR. GARRE:  It -- it certainly would be a


much --

QUESTION:  No.  Yes or no.


MR. GARRE:  I -- I think -- if I can analyze


that claim.  I -- I think they -- they might have a claim,


Justice Breyer.


QUESTION:  When you say might, I'm just


imagining the same statute, everything that's gone on this


morning, and it says if they take control, they shall use


ordinary skill and prudence to preserve the property. 


MR. GARRE:  The --


QUESTION:  The answer then is yes or no? 


MR. GARRE:  Well, I think it would be no,


Justice Breyer, and if I could explain why.


QUESTION:  It would be no even then.  Then what


have we been arguing about --


MR. GARRE:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- because, I mean, everybody has


been asking you whether that can be implied here?  And my


impression was you said yes.  I mean, if it --


MR. GARRE:  Congress creates a number of duties. 


And Congress has legislative -- of course, in the area of


historic preservation, and it creates duties that the


courts below found are procedural in nature.


QUESTION:  And so if they said, and by the way,

if in fact they take control, the trustee -- i.e., the


United States -- has a duty when they take control to use


ordinary skill and prudence to preserve the property.


MR. GARRE:  Then the statute -- they would --


they would have a specific management duty.  And then the


question --


QUESTION:  And so the answer is then they would


have -- they could -- then they'd win.  Right?  If it said


that.


MR. GARRE:  I -- I think they might under that


situation.


QUESTION:  Okay, fine. 


MR. GARRE:  But there's a second question under


the Court's cases that the Court would have to answer it,


and that's case two, and that's whether or not that 

specific statutory duty can be fairly interpreted as


mandating the payment of compensation.


QUESTION:  And it adds, and indeed if they


violate this, they have to pay a lot of money.


MR. GARRE:  Of -- of course, in that situation. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  Then we're all right.


MR. GARRE:  Of course, in that situation --


QUESTION:  So our issue here -- what I'm getting


at is our issue then is whether that word control implies


those latter words --

 MR. GARRE:  Well --

That's the question.  Is that right or not? 


MR. GARRE:  I don't think it's the question


because the word control doesn't appear anywhere in the


face of the statute.


QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  I -- I was reading --


it's subject to the right of the Secretary of Interior to


use any part of the land in improvements.


MR. GARRE:  Right. 


QUESTION:  So I -- we have to decide right to


use -- does that imply those words that are left out.


MR. GARRE:  Right. 


QUESTION:  It didn't say he had to use it, did


it? 


MR. GARRE:  No, not at all. 


QUESTION:  No. 


QUESTION:  So in order to say he controlled it,


you -- you would have to say he --


QUESTION:  I misspoke.  I'm sorry to have mixed


people up. 


MR. GARRE:  Right. 


QUESTION:  I meant right to use.  Does it imply


the words that are not there when they use it?


MR. GARRE:  Yes.  And -- and I think -- and if I

could be more clear, I think that we think the Court's


cases and the Tucker Act -- and -- and we think can also


look to cases in the section 1983 context -- establishes a


two-step inquiry.  First, has Congress created a specific


duty on the Government's part, and second, can that duty


be fairly interpreted as mandating a payment of


compensation breached?


QUESTION:  How does it work in other areas of


real estate law, where suppose I turn my beach house over


to a friend and he has a wild party and destroys it?  Do I


have a claim against him if I had no knowledge he would do


such a thing? 


MR. GARRE:  Conceivably you might have a tort


claim, Justice Breyer, but that's not a claim that's --


QUESTION: 


So normally is it the case when you 

give or lease or give property to other people if they


wreck the place, contrary to expectation, we imply into


those promises or words that they had to take reasonable


care?


MR. GARRE:  Possibly as a breach of a contract


or a tort --


QUESTION:  All right. 


MR. GARRE:  -- violation.


QUESTION:  If we normally do that in the law,


why would we not do the same thing here where, indeed, in

addition to what you normally have, you have this word


trust and special relationship? 


MR. GARRE:  I think the Court refused to do that


in the Mitchell I case because there, the Court used the


language, in trust, and it refused to --


QUESTION:  Well, it wasn't a question of laying


waste in Mitchell I, was it?  It was just a question of


not using the land to its utmost financial benefit. 


MR. GARRE:  Well, that's true, Justice Scalia. 


And --


QUESTION:  So the question he's asking you is --


is destroying the land. 


You say in your -- you quote in your brief


Austin on trusts to the effect that there is a fundamental


difference between a private trust and a public trust. 

What -- what kind of cases is -- is that -- is that


section referring to?


MR. GARRE:  Well --


QUESTION:  I mean, suppose I leave my -- my


house to the City of Falls Church in trust for the people


of Falls Church.  What -- what obligations are imposed on


the City of Falls Church? 


MR. GARRE:  I think what the -- I mean, there


you might have a situation where the question is whether


you could enforce obligations against a private individual

who left it in trust.  Here we're talking about a


situation where the --


QUESTION:  No, no.  I'm talking about


imposing -- what obligations are imposed upon Falls


Church.


MR. GARRE:  You could impose -- you could --


QUESTION:  I leave property to Falls Church in


trust for the people of Falls Church or in trust for some


category of the -- of the people of Falls Church.


MR. GARRE:  I think the Restatement


provisions --


QUESTION:  The Little League or something. 


MR. GARRE:  -- that we referred to incorporate


the doctrine of sovereign immunity in this area, and you


could impose possibly injunctive --


QUESTION:  Oh, is that all that -- that Scott on


trusts was referring to, just the doctrine of sovereign


immunity?


MR. GARRE:  Well --


QUESTION:  Because if that's all he was


referring to, you know, that's been waived by -- by the


statute here.


MR. GARRE:  No.


QUESTION:  I thought there was something quite


different he was referring to, that the whole nature of a

public trust is different from a private trust.  If that's


not the case, then all of that is quite irrelevant it


seems to me. 


MR. GARRE:  I -- I think it's both, Justice


Scalia, that the public trust is different in that we


don't ordinarily assume that the Government acts in all


its capacities as a private trustee.  And that's certainly


true in the Indian law context.  This Court -- there are


more than 56 million acres of land that the Government


holds in trust.  If the Court assumed just by Congress'


use of the word in trust, the Government had assumed all


the liabilities of -- of a common law trustee, then that


would be an enormous potential liability that there's no


indication whatsoever Congress ever agreed to assume.


QUESTION:  Okay, Mr. Garre.  You're -- you're


arguing that you can't infer from the use of the word


trust that all of the obligations and all of the potential


liabilities of a private trustee are carried by it.  But


your argument seems to go, if I understand it, to the


other extreme, that the use of the word trust seems to


imply no obligation and no responsibility unless it is


followed by a specific delineation of what those


responsibilities are. 


And my question is -- Justice Breyer a minute


ago was saying, well, what would be different if we added

certain words.  And my question is what would we -- be


different if we subtracted certain words on your theory? 


What if the statute had not included the words, in trust? 


Wouldn't your argument be exactly the same? 


MR. GARRE:  Under the Tucker Act -- and, of


course, the Tucker Act doesn't refer to claims for breach


of trust.


QUESTION:  No, but would you answer my question? 


Wouldn't you be -- aren't you making the same argument


under a statute that says in trust that you would be


making under a statute that did not include the words, in


trust, at all?  Isn't that so? 


MR. GARRE:  Yes.  That -- that's true, Justice


Souter.  But I -- I think --


QUESTION: 


Then you -- what -- what are we to do 

with the usual canon of construction that we assume that


Congress does not use useless words?


MR. GARRE:  Those words had great effect here. 


They had the same effect that the words have -- this


Court has recognized -- with respect to the alienation of


land and with respect to immunization of land to State


taxation.


QUESTION:  Yes.  They -- they couldn't alienate


under a statute that says the -- the land and et cetera


will be held by the United States for the tribe.  Taxes

couldn't be levied by lesser sovereigns against lands held


by the United States under those circumstances. 


MR. GARRE:  Those -- those --


QUESTION:  It seems to me that the word, in


trust, means nothing.


MR. GARRE:  No.  With respect, I would disagree. 


It has those two settled consequences.  We know from


pages 6 and 7 --


QUESTION:  But why would you not have those


consequences without those words?  It's true if you have


those words, the consequences follow.  But wouldn't the


consequences follow without the words?


MR. GARRE:  No.


QUESTION:  And if in fact that's all the


Government -- if that's all Congress was getting at, why 

didn't Congress simply say that instead of using the


phrase, in trust, that normally carries enormous


implications? 


MR. GARRE:  The -- that -- that line of argument


is the argument that we think that the court of appeal --


the Court of Claims made in Mitchell I and that the


dissenters made in Mitchell I, and we think that the


majority of the Court rejected --


QUESTION:  And -- and Justice Ginsburg has


suggested that maybe the -- the significance of that line

of argument depends on whether there was or was not


control. 	 But I think --


MR. GARRE:  In the factual sense.


QUESTION:  -- on your argument, I think what


you're telling us is that Mitchell I -- and in any event


your argument -- has the implication that those words add


absolutely nothing. 


MR. GARRE:  No, no, Justice Souter.  That's not


the implication of our argument.  They do have the


accepted meanings.  The United States holds land in trust. 


It is immunized from State taxation.  If the tribe itself


held it or private Indians held it, it wouldn't be


subject -- it would be subject to State taxation.


QUESTION:  What if the Government of the United


States held it? 


MR. GARRE:  Well, it does in this case, and


that's the significance of holding it in trust.


QUESTION:  Yes, and it -- and it would do so


under the statute if the words, in trust, weren't used.


MR. GARRE:  That -- that -- it also has -- in


this case it has the effect of making the lands here like


the surrounding reservation lands.  And -- and again, I


think pages 6 and 7 of the tribe's lodging helps to make


that point.

rebuttal.  Thank you. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Brauchli. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. BRAUCHLI


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Justice Stevens, and may it


please the Court:


If the Secretary of the Interior had never taken


control of these buildings, we would not be here.  It


would be a -- a bare trust.  Simply putting these


buildings in trust does not create any fiduciary


obligations. 


But the Secretary did take control.  It's not


mandatory; it's voluntary.  And that's why this case is


exactly like Mitchell II.  In Mitchell I, there's no nexus


between the General Allotment Act and managing a forest. 

But when you look at the forest management statute,


there's a direct nexus from the forest management statutes


to control of the forest, and when you control the forest,


to the exclusion of the tribe, then you are responsible as


a fiduciary.


QUESTION:  But the control -- the control here


was not control given for the benefit of the tribe.  To


the contrary, it was control given for the United States'


own use.  It seems to me that's -- that's quite different. 


I agree that if -- if you -- you say the United States

shall control it for the benefit of -- of the tribe, you


might have a different case.  But that's not what this


statute said.  It said the United States shall control it


for its -- its use, running an Indian school and so forth.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Justice Scalia, I respectfully


disagree. 


QUESTION:  Administrative purposes. 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  The -- the benefit to the


tribe -- Congress stripped the United States of all fee


simple, absolute title and gave 100 percent beneficial


title to the tribe.  The United States has no retention of


ownership whatsoever.  They have a use easement, and


that's all they have.  A very limited right.  And the


benefit is what Congress said, and Congress said, we're


going to take this fort, which we established to kill 

Apaches and imprison them, and we're going to give it to


the White Mountain Apache Tribe.  And they gave it, and it


has value.  It has 35 buildings.  It has 7,500 acres.  Now


it's only -- you know, we're down.  We're talking


about 288 acres. 


QUESTION:  I thought the fort was to protect


white settlers.  But you -- you know, you can describe it


the way you like. 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, it was to protect white


settlers --

QUESTION:  Yes, I understand.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  And there was a benefit.  And


the -- the benefit said -- it's been postponed because the


United States Secretary reserved a very limited right to


use it for a school --


QUESTION:  I -- I want to make I understand your


argument.  If the Government had, after this statute was


enacted, said, you know, we really don't have any interest


at all in these buildings, and just let them go to waste,


but they didn't use them in any way, there would be no


liability? 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Absolutely none.  Before


March 18, 1960, they could have --


QUESTION:  Why?  I mean, what -- what kind of a


theory is that?  If -- if the Government occupies the


buildings and -- and by that preserves them in a small


sense, they're falling apart, but at least it's better


than a complete -- complete abandonment, they're liable,


but if they completely abandon them, they're not.  I -- I


just don't understand that. 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Justice Kennedy, if I understood

your question, I thought you meant before March 18, 1960


when they owned it --


QUESTION:  No, no.  I mean after 1960.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Oh.


QUESTION:  I thought your initial argument was


that after 1960, once the Government took control by,


i.e. -- by that I thought you meant possessing the


buildings --


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Occupying. 


QUESTION:  -- it had a duty, but that if it had


not possessed the buildings or occupied the buildings, it


would have no duty.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes, that is true.  That's what


I'm saying.  The -- the fact is that they occupied --


QUESTION: 


I -- I just don't understand that. 

MR. BRAUCHLI:  They occupied and physically


controlled the buildings.  If -- for instance, we are not


filing a claim for the four buildings.  There's only 4


buildings out of 35 being used for a school right now. 


The -- four.  And so we're not filing a claim for those,


and they just -- they just sprang for 3 and a half million


dollars to fix those up.  But the other buildings that


they have used and occupied and destroyed and -- and


some -- they've demolished four -- those are the buildings


that we have a claim for.

We're not charging you for reasonable wear and tear,


but --


QUESTION:  Well, since 1960, did the U.S. use


some of the buildings other than it's now using?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes, and the reason that they


have fallen off from use is because the enrollment went


from 500 students down to about 80.


QUESTION:  Well, if there are 35 buildings on


the premises, how many did the Government use since 1960?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  The Government used all of the


buildings.  They physically occupied them. 


QUESTION:  All of them. 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes. 


QUESTION: 


Physically occupied all 35? 

MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes, they did, and they used them


for storage and for schools.


QUESTION:  Since 1960.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes.  And so it's been under the


exclusive control.  But as --


QUESTION:  And now it physically occupies 4 of


the 35.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Four for school and about six for


its administrative use.

view on the hypothetical that I asked your -- your


colleague on the other side?  Suppose I leave property to


the City of Falls Church.  The City of Falls Church takes


possession.  It's not occupied by anybody else.  And


it's -- it's in trust for the people of Falls Church.  The


City of Falls Church takes possession.  It doesn't do


anything with the land.  It just leaves it there.  Now, in


the law of trusts, that -- that would be wasteful, and the


trustee would have to use the land in order to generate


income for the people of Falls Church, or at least do


something for the people of Falls Church. 


Do you think the City of Falls Church would be


in breach of trust?  Do you know of any lawsuits against


cities or any public entities that -- that have accepted


land or other property in trust?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  If -- if the land is being -- as


I understand the question, you -- you are leaving this to


Falls Church and as a beneficiary --


QUESTION:  It's a lot.  It's a great big lot,


and I say, you know, I'd like to leave it to the City of


Falls Church and I do.  And the City of Falls Church


doesn't do anything with it, just leaves it there.  It


could have built a -- you know, an apartment building and


gotten a lot of income for the city coffers.  It could


have built a baseball diamond or whatever.  It just leaves

MR. BRAUCHLI:  That is not our situation --

MR. BRAUCHLI:  I don't know because --

here --


MR. BRAUCHLI:  I don't --


QUESTION:  -- it seems to me. 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, I don't think --


QUESTION:  I think it goes to the point of


whether a public trust is the same thing as a private


trust.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, this is a private trust. 


I think this is a private trust, and it's not a public


trust.  But it's --


QUESTION:  Even if it were, I guess the real


analogy would be it goes to the City of Falls Church to be


held in trust for the public to be used as a school for as


long as they want it, and thereafter to go to the


archeological society for preservation.  And now they run


it down as a school, and the question would be can the


archeological society now sue them for the loss.  I don't


know.  Maybe it can. 


QUESTION:  Well, this -- this doesn't say that


it goes to the archeological society --

 QUESTION:  It goes to the tribe.


QUESTION:  -- or that it goes to the Indians


afterwards.  It just says, in trust.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Justice Scalia, I think you're


saying that -- you're talking about a situation where the


beneficiary doesn't do anything with the property.  If


the -- if the -- I think the analogy would be -- that


you're making is if the White Mountain Apache Tribe did


nothing to their property.  Then that's their choice.  But


if you as the trustee went in there and destroyed the


property that you were going to give to the --


QUESTION:  I'm not talking about destroying it.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  -- beneficiary of Falls Church,


that's our situation. 


QUESTION:  Yes. 


I'm putting destroying it 

aside.  I'm -- I'm just saying that the City of Falls


Church doesn't do anything with it.  It does not do what a


trustee would normally have to do, and that is produce


income from it, or -- or use it in -- in some way that


will benefit the -- the cestui que trust.  Okay?  It just


leaves it fallow.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  And they're a trustee.


QUESTION:  And -- and I don't know of any


lawsuits in which in such a situation a citizen could say,


you know, I'm -- I'm a citizen of Falls Church, and you

are wasting my -- my trust estate. 


QUESTION:  No.  I don't even know of one that


says I have my forest which I leave to the people of Falls


Church, and lo and behold, 20 years later, that forest is


a wreck.  They cut every tree.  And I don't know if the


citizens of Falls Church can sue there either, but I know


the Indians can.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  I don't -- I think there's a


different -- there's -- this Court unanimously last term


in the Klamath case said that the fiduciary relationship,


the trust relationship, between the United States and the


tribes is the primary cornerstone of Indian law.  It was a


unanimous opinion.  There's a special trust relationship


between the Indian people and the United States Government


and when the United States --


QUESTION:  But does that -- does that extend to


a requirement that the United States spend its monies


rather than the tribe's monies to preserve the land? 


Suppose in this case that some basic erosion systems were


needed because the land was eroding, endangering the --


the topography, and some simple irrigation rivulets or --


or drainage rivulets would -- would save the property. 


Would the United States have the obligation to perform


those -- those repairs?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes.  Yes, they do.

for that?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Because they --


QUESTION:  That's -- that's certainly not a -- a


trustee doesn't have the duty to repair at his own expense


in -- in a private trust.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, this is not a -- I -- the


United States, if they are -- the beneficiary is the


tribe, and I think when you have a trustee in control and


occupying, they -- according to the treatises I read --


read, there's an absolute obligation to protect and


preserve the beneficiary. 


QUESTION: 


Not at the trustee's own expense. 

That's the point.  The -- the trust itself has to provide


the means, the -- the financial wherewithal to make those


repairs.  This isn't a duty financially imposed on the


trustee.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, I just disagree with that. 


When the United States is the trustee --


QUESTION:  Well, you'd have to have some


authority.  You may disagree, but how -- how do you find


it out of trust law? 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Okay.  My authority is the

Mitchell II which was a waste case as well as a benefits


case because in that case, there was a requirement to


manage the forest on a sustained yield basis, and if --


QUESTION:  All right.  If your --


QUESTION:  Waste -- waste is different. 


QUESTION:  If your answer to me --


QUESTION:  Waste is different from doing


something that costs money, and the money has to come from


somewhere.  And -- and do you think the United States


could sell off a piece of this to private hands in order


to obtain the money to renovate these buildings?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  No, but they did appropriate


money --


QUESTION:  So you're -- you're urging then that


ordinary trust law does not apply in the case of a public 

trust.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, I think that the trust


relationship between the United States and Indian tribes


is sui generis. 


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  You cannot import the common law


wholesale into a -- this type of situation. 


QUESTION:  Based on your answer you gave to me


about the hypothetical about the erosion occurring, it --


it would seem to me that if the United States has an

affirmative duty in that case, the fact that it occupied


or didn't occupy the buildings does not alter its duty to


keep those buildings in repair.  Its occupancy and use has


nothing to do with the case --


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- because in my hypothetical they


didn't occupy or use the land.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, the complaint is for -- for


damage to the infrastructure for failure to keep up the --


the water and sewer system, the electrical system, as well


as the buildings that they used and controlled.  They had


total, exclusive control.


QUESTION:  But if they didn't -- in Justice


Kennedy's question, if the United States didn't use it for


administrative and school purposes, then the United 

States, under the terms of the trust, has no right to hold


it because they have this exclusive right of occupancy


only for those purposes.  And if they just let the -- then


it would be -- wouldn't it belong to the tribe?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  It expires and they -- they said


that in the court of appeals below that the -- the circuit


judges said, well, can you use it as a uranium dump?  And


the Department of Justice said, no, because that would be


a breach of the trust because we're only allowed to use it


for school or administrative purposes.  Therefore, a

uranium dump would be outside the use allowed. 


I think waste is a use outside what Congress


allowed them, and it's a specific use and it should be


construed against the easement.  The easements are not


wide open.


QUESTION:  Yes, but I'm not sure you confront


the question, and I'm not sure what the answer is.  If the


waste -- duty to protect waste requires spending some


money, whose money do you spend?  The trustee's or the


trust's?  The beneficiary's money or the trustee's money? 


If you buy an insurance policy, does the trustee pay for


out of his own pocket or out of trust assets?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, I think in this case the


United States was obligated to prevent the deterioration. 


All they have to do is repair -- they have 

basketball-sized holes in the roof letting rain in which


progressively deteriorates -- deteriorates the property.


QUESTION:  Could the United States have used


trust assets to perform that duty?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  I think they should use their own


assets since they're using it rent-free, and they should


protect the property because they have --


QUESTION:  You're saying they should use it. 


Could they -- in your judgment, could the United States


have used trust assets to perform that duty?

 MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes, the United States' assets.

QUESTION:  That's not my question. 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Oh, you mean the trust assets. 


You mean the buildings themselves?  I don't -- well, they


have collected rents --


QUESTION:  Could they cut --


MR. BRAUCHLI:  -- for some of the buildings.


QUESTION:  Could they cut down some trees and


say, we're going to sell off some timber because we've got


to raise some money to fix the roof?  Would that have been


a -- a legitimate use of the property?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Of the tribe's timber?


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. BRAUCHLI: 


I would say they cannot do that 

without the tribe's permission.


QUESTION:  So it's literally got to come out of


a pocket of the National Government which has no relation


to the tribe's assets is what you're saying. 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  That's what I'm saying.


QUESTION:  Suppose you -- you rent -- it's


rather interesting.  I mean, suppose -- suppose that the


trustee -- this were an ordinary trust, but the trustee


was giving it to a third party to use, which he'd have the


right to do under the trust.  And the third party didn't

repair the basketball-sized holes in the pavilion.  How do


we decide if it's that third party's responsibility, or if


trust assets should have been used?  I mean, here I'm


thinking that --


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- the trustee is both the trustee


and the third party himself because he's using it for his


own purposes.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, under landlord and tenant


law, the tenant would certainly be liable for the waste,


and this Court said that in the Bostwick case. 


QUESTION:  Would the tenant have to repair the


holes in the roof? 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  The tenant would be responsible. 


Any lease of tribal property by a -- a tenant, the -- the 

duty is to the United States as well as the tribe.  And


the United States under the leasing regulations has an


absolute duty to go in there and protect the -- to protect


the value of the property -- and I put that in my brief --


the value of the property from a tenant who's injuring


that property.  So here they're saying we're like a


tenant, but we can commit all the waste we want to.


QUESTION:  What precisely are you asking for? 


You said -- you started to say something, and then you


were asked a question.  You said you're not asking for

wear and tear.  What is the measure of the damages


you're --


MR. BRAUCHLI:  I think the measure of damages


would be against the measuring stick of a reasonable


trustee in like circumstances in total control of the


trust corpus of his beneficiary.  And I'm saying it's that


amount of damages necessary to bring it up to code, less


reasonable wear and tear. 


QUESTION:  So it would be -- that -- that would


be the -- 14 million-dollar figure to bring it up to code?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, that was been altered


because the tribe has engaged in a little self-help, and


we actually took over five -- five buildings, and we had a


grant from the White House Save America's Treasures and


the National Endowment of the Humanities and the State of 

Arizona, and the tribe put 2 million of their own dollars. 


So I think that figure is more like $8 million, and


that's --


QUESTION:  But you're still -- what you're


talking about is what it would cost to bring this up to


historic building preservation level?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Not necessarily.  Its just a --


when you have -- not -- we're not talking about restoring


it.  We're talking about rehabilitating the buildings and


you can keep its historic character and make modifications

modifications, but you have to keep the historic


character.  You can upgrade the electricity.  You can


repair the roofs.  And actually the code is a lot more lax


than the Uniform Building Code.  The --


QUESTION:  What -- what is this code?  Is it a


generally applicable code about things like electric


wiring and -- and sound roofs, or --


MR. BRAUCHLI: 


Well, the Bureau of Indian 

Affairs usually uses the General Services Administration

Building Conservation.  That's what the National Park


Service --

BIA's assessment, in 1998 came out within a few hundred


thousand dollars of our assessment of the -- of the cost


to make the repairs which they had deferred maintenance


basically for 40 years in some buildings.


QUESTION:  Mr. Brauchli --


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- I'm -- I'm confused about -- about


these buildings that -- that have basketball-sized holes


in the roof.  The Government is still using these


buildings?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  No, they have not.  Because of


the deferred maintenance, those buildings are boarded up.


QUESTION:  Well, then they're not using them


anymore.  So I mean, you can't argue --


MR. BRAUCHLI: 


Right, and that's --

may use the buildings.  If they're no longer using them,


and they have basketball hole -- size -- -sized holes in


the roof, it seems to me you have to come up with some

theory other than the Government's continuing control


which imposes upon the Government the obligation to repair

MR. BRAUCHLI:  The -- the buildings -- when the


need expires, their right to be there expires.  I'm


talking about the -- the boys' dorm now.  That's the


basketball-sized holes in the roofs. 


We made a demand.  The tribe made a demand for


the return of 15 buildings.  They said, you no longer need


them.  Give those buildings back to us.  Your -- your


right to be there has expired, but you give us the money


for the -- to repair those because they're not


inhabitable.  They used to be. 


Our experts -- we've spent 

a lot of money.  We have photographs from 1960.  We know


they were in very good shape in 1960.


QUESTION:  And what did the Government say?  You


can't have the buildings, or you can't have the money? 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  They said -- oh, they -- they


want to give us the buildings.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  They said, you can't have the


money.


QUESTION:  Well, that's exactly right, it seems

to me, if the only theory on which they're obliged to


repair them is that they're in control of them.  They're


saying, you know, we're not using them anymore.  We don't


want to repair them.  If you want them, they're yours and


you can repair them.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  They don't own them, and under


Mitchell II, this Court said that when the United States


is in control of a -- of a resource of a tribe, a -- a


fiduciary relationship is established in respect to that


resource. 


QUESTION:  No, but isn't your argument that


they -- I -- I'm not saying whether you win or lose on it,


but isn't your argument that they are obliged to give us


the money to repair them because the deterioration took


place when they were in control? 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  Isn't that your point?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  That is my point which I did not


apparently express very well, but that is the point


that --


QUESTION:  You mean they -- they were still


using those buildings when the -- when the basketball-


sized holes in the roofs appeared?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  They were using the buildings as


the progressive -- it's not a Big Bang Theory about a

building falling down. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  It's -- it's a progressive


deterioration of the buildings.  And then when they felt


that -- they just started to board them up, and -- and we


said, okay, we'll take -- they said -- well, actually,


they wrote a letter, said they're yours.  And we said,


what do you mean they're -- they're ours?  With an


$8 million repair bill and you had total control, and you


feel you have the right to destroy property that you don't


own?


And this deprives Congress of the benefit that


Congress intended.  So here's the executive branch saying,


we don't care what Congress gave you.  We'll make sure you


don't get anything except a -- a pile of rubble.  And


someone has got to pay for that, and the tribe should not


pay for that.  And that's the point of the damage claim. 


We went to the Secretary and they said -- after


a year of wasting my time at the solicitor's office, they


said -- finally, the Special Assistant to the Secretary


said, you're going to have to sue us because we're not


going to give you the money, and we feel we have the right


to destroy this property.  And that's -- whether it's


demolition by neglect or, as the Department of Justice


said in the circuit court below, since you don't have

title to this property, contrary to the plain text of the


act, we have the right to dynamite it. 


And somehow it's been held in some kind of


purgatory state where what Congress intended to give to


the tribe wasn't really intended to give to the tribe. 


It's a -- it's a plaything for the BIA to play with and


destroy. 


And that's not the fiduciary relationship that


this Court has been noted for in -- in respect to a one-


on-one relationship.  In Nevada versus United States, we


said, when it's one on one, a fiduciary relationship and


there's a fiduciary obligation incumbent upon the United


States when it deals with Indian people. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Brauchli --


QUESTION:  What about --


QUESTION:  -- can I ask this factual question? 


I should know, but I really don't.  How long ago did the


Government's active use of the buildings cease?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  It is different depending on the


building, and that's why we say we have to go


building-by-building.  And they have raised the statute of


limitations.  They said, your claim is premature, in -- in


the trial court.  Then, in the circuit court they said,


it's -- no.  They said it's -- you're too late.  You


didn't -- the statute of limitations will bar your claim.

So that's still lingering out there. 


Then, in the -- then in the circuit court of


appeals they said, it's not in trust, and therefore we can


dynamite it. 


Then, in their briefs here they say, we control


everything and your claim is premature. 


So they have shifting defenses. 


Different buildings, because they didn't


maintain them, they started sloughing off one-by-one


because they --


QUESTION:  Do you have a theory on when their


active use of the buildings ceased?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  It's -- it goes -- it really does


have to go by building-by-building because I would say


that --


QUESTION:  Give me any building.  Was it


10 years ago?  Five years ago? 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  -- in the last 5, 6.  The last 6


years have been progressive, where they started boarding


them up and just stopped --


QUESTION:  And your theory is that the -- the


waste occurred before or after they ceased using some --


or some of each? 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  It's -- it's some of each.  It's


a deteriorating use.  We don't ask them to restore

pre-1960 condition.  We're saying take the 1960 condition,


and the waste you committed from 1960 when it's under your


control.  We don't want them to -- they don't have to


restore it back to its -- as they say -- Old West shape. 


We're just asking it -- for the condition that when we got


it from Congress, Congress said, here's the gift.  Here is


the Fort Apache, but we're going to give the Secretary


just a limited use, and when that need expires, then the


Secretary has no right because but for that act, the


Secretary can't even set foot on that property.  It's


trespass. 


QUESTION:  Well, is it -- let -- may I also get


clear on something that I -- I thought I was clear on but


I'm not.  Is it your theory that they are responsible for


the waste or damage or deterioration that took place up to 

the point at which they ceased actively to use it, or up


to the point at which they relinquished control over it to


you?  Because I take it those -- for some buildings --


will be different -- different dates.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes.  There's -- they maintain


that they relinquished some buildings and therefore it's


barred by the statute of limitations.


QUESTION:  No.  But what is your theory?  Is it


that their responsibility is measured by the date at which


they ceased to use, or the date at which they relinquished

control to you? 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  It was the date when they


relinquished control and we accepted it because we refused


to accept them without the money to repair them. 


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  And they're --


QUESTION:  So you're saying during part of the


period in which the -- the property was just boarded up,


their responsibility was still in effect. 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Yes, because they still kept them


on their facility inventory maintenance list, but they


didn't get -- they get the maintenance money and they use


it for other things other than the --


QUESTION:  Suppose in -- suppose in 1960 the


Government said, here are the buildings.  We don't want


them.  And you said, well, you know, it's -- it's going to


cost us a lot of money to keep up these buildings.  You're


going to have to pay for that.  We can't do that.  Could


the Government then say, well, we have a stand-off, we'll


destroy them?


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Are you talking about after


March 18th, or before --


QUESTION:  This is after the 1960 act was


enacted and they had become the trustee.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  If they never physically occupied

those buildings or they stopped using them, it's not their


liability.  If they walked away from the property in -- on


March 18th, 1960, they said, Hey, Congress just gave this


to you.  We've been using them but we're going to walk


away today.  No responsibility.  None.  Because when they


were the owner, they can do whatever they want.  When the


tribe becomes the owner and they -- they take control of


the trust corpus, then there's an obligation, the most


fundamental, rudimentary, crude fiduciary duty as to --


QUESTION:  Can -- can the Government terminate


this trust anytime it wants? 


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Pardon?


QUESTION:  Can the Government terminate this


trust anytime it wants by executive order? 


MR. BRAUCHLI: 


No, it cannot because the 

executive branch does not have the power to terminate this


reservation.  Only Congress can. 


QUESTION:  That's -- that's what I thought.  The


trust remains in effect at all times.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  But it's -- it'd be only a bare


trust, Your -- Your Honor, because if -- once they -- once


they relinquish the control and the need is not there,


their liability ends.  You know, we have taken over the


cook's cabin.  We've taken over four buildings.  Their


liability is going to end there because we took them over.

We had to use some self-help.


QUESTION:  What -- what of the Government's


argument that this was really an illusory trust?  That is,


the statute, the 1960 statute, gave the Government the


right to use this for -- for school and administrative


purposes as long as they wanted to.  So at -- looking at


it from 1960, that could be forever.  They might have


wanted to use it as a school forever, and then the tribe


would have nothing.


MR. BRAUCHLI:  Well, the -- to answer that


question, Your Honor, the measure of damages always could


be measured against a reasonable trustee.  If they kept


using for 100 years, then of course, there's going to be


normal -- you know, even normal wear and tear, but there's


still -- that's something for the trial court to sort out 

as to the measure of damages.  I mean, what is


reasonable -- what is reasonable to repair, what is


reasonable not to under the circumstances.  That's --


that's a question for the trier of fact as to the measure


of damages.


But, you know, the reality of the situation is


that the need has expired except for about 10 buildings.


In this -- I mentioned the Bostwick case because


in the Bostwick case, the United States had open, free


use -- unrestricted use of a private home, and they --

they committed waste.  And there was -- and this Court --


Court -- they were sued.  The United States was sued and


the Court said that there's an implied covenant against


waste even those the lease is silent as to that duty.  And


I think the analogy is here in the trust situation. 


When -- when -- it doesn't matter if the statute doesn't


say you have to repair buildings when you're using them. 


It would be unnatural for a statute to say so.


That's all I have, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Brauchli.


Mr. Garre, you have 1 minute left.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. GARRE:  Thank you, Justice Stevens.  May it


please the Court:


The Government is not using the property, and is


not required to use the property for the benefit of the


tribe as the court of appeals acknowledged at page 14a of


the appendix to the petition.  It's using the property for


its own Government purposes, and in that respect, this


case is completely unlike Mitchell II, where the statutes


and regulations specifically required the Government to


manage the property as an economic resource for the


Indians.


There are no trust assets to pay for any


59 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

historic restoration efforts because Congress directed


that the property would be used for Government purposes,


not for any -- any kind of economic purposes that would


generate assets.  Congress has a separate regime for


historic preservation.  It grants millions of dollars each


year for historic preservation projects, and as


Mr. Brauchli alluded, Congress has granted funds for


historic reservation at Fort Apache.  The tribe has


engaged in its own historic preservation efforts there


with millions of dollars of private, State, and Federal


funding, and the Department of the Interior has put


millions of dollars of its own maintenance and repair


efforts into the fort.


Thank you very much. 


JUSTICE STEVENS: 


Thank you, Mr. Garre. 

(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
