MS.  LEWIN:  Yes,  Justice  Sotomayor.  In  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

in  1898,  Congress  passed  a  joint  resolution  for  the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognition  of  the  independence  of  the  people  of  Cuba 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  the  initial  opposition  of  President  McKinley,  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ended  up  recognizing  the  independence  of  Cuba. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  If  you  were  careful  to  say 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  outset  that  this  is  not  recognition,  the  court  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals  decision,  I  think  it  was  in  the  Judge  Tabor 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concurrence,  said  that  both  parties  urge  upon  us  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  ­­ that  the  power  of  recognition  is  involved  here 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  Congress  has  done  it.  And  then,  of  course,  the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Attorney  General  takes  ­­ takes  the  opposite  position 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ­­ that  this,  A,  this  is  recognition  and,  B, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  why  it's  void. 
 

 

 

 

            

Did  you  change  your  position  here,  or  am  I 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  misinterpreting  the  way  this  ­­ the  court  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals  discussed  it? 
 

 

 

            

MS.  LEWIN:  We've  provided  to  the  Court 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

alternative  options  for  resolving  this  issue.  Our 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

primary  position,  as  I  said  at  the  outset,  is  that  what 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  written  in  this  statute  does  not  amount  to  a  formal 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognition  of  sovereignty  because  the  language  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  itself  is  very  narrow. 
 

 

 

 

 

            

It  begins  by  saying  that,  for  the  purposes 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of,  for  the  narrow  purposes  of  recording  a  place  of

birth  on  a  passport  or  a  Consular  Report  of  Birth 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Abroad,  that  is  where  ­­ what  this  statute  provides  for. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  also  does  not  state  that  in  all  circumstances  you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  list  Israel  as  the  place  of  birth.  It  is  merely 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving  the  individual  choice. 
 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  ­­ the  ­­ does  ­­ the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  is  part  of  a  section,  Section  214.  And  I 
   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  you're  trying  to  read  G,  and  so  it  is 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disassociated  from  the  purpose  that's  expressed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout  214,  that  is,  that  Jerusalem  is  the  capital 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Israel.  Congress  said  that,  and  you  ­­ you  are 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  deal  with  a  piece  of  one  section  without 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regard  to  the  ­­ to  the  thrust  of  the  whole  provision, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  has  said  we  think  Jerusalem  is  the  capital 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Israel. 
 

 

            

MS.  LEWIN:  Justice  Ginsburg,  the  ­­ that  is 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct.  This  section  of  the  statute  should  be  reviewed 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  constitutionality  of  it  be  determined  on  its 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own.  But  the  Court  should  look  not  at  what  Congress  may 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  intended  by  the  entire  section  but,  rather,  what 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  section  actually  did.  And  this  section,  as  I  said, 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

gives  the  individuals  a  choice  and  does  not  confer 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

formal  recognition.  There  are  benefits  that  come  with 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

formal  recognition.

you  say  ­­ I've  heard  exactly  what  you  said.  And  I 
   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that's  certainly  a  reasonable  position.  You  could 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

read  this  and  say  it  doesn't  really  say  anything  about 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognizing  anything. 
 

 

            

But  the  Solicitor  General  of  the  United 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States,  after  conferring  with  the  State  Department, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  "Since  Israel's  founding,  every  President  has 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adhered  to  the  position  that  the  status  of  Jerusalem 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  not  be  unilaterally  determined  by  a  party,"  and 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  adds,  "by  requiring  the  President  to  contradict  his 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognition  position  regarding  Jerusalem  in  official 
 

 

 

 

 

 

communications  with  foreign  sovereigns,  the  section 
 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutionally  encroaches  on  the  President's  core 
 

 

 

 

 

 

recognition  authority." 
 

 

            

So  he  has  a  different  view.  He  thinks  it  is 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  policy  not  to  recognize  Jerusalem  as  the  capital, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  you  apparently  agree  with,  and  he  thinks  that  this 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  have  some  tendency  at  least  to  suggest  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary. 
 

            

Now,  I'm  a  judge.  I'm  not  a  foreign  affairs 
 

   

   

  

 

 

 

expert.  And  when  he  tells  me  that,  and  they  are  foreign 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affairs  experts  in  the  State  Department,  how  can  I  say 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  I'm  right  even  if  I  agree  with  you,  and  they,  who 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  in  charge  of  foreign  affairs,  are  wrong  when  they 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  those  two  statements,  which  certainly  sound

MS.  LEWIN:  Two  points,  Justice  Breyer.  The 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

first  is  that  what  goes  on  a  ­­ on  a  passport  as  a  place 
 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  birth  is  not  tantamount  to  recognizing  foreign 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty.  Taiwan  is  a  perfect  example.  The  State 
 

   

  

  

 

 

 

Department  puts  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  I  want  ­­ and  I  must 
 

    

   

 

 

 

interject  at  this  point  because  you  emphasize  the  Taiwan 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  and  it  seems  to  me  it's  most  distinguishable. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Taiwan  and  China  maintained  from  the  beginning  there  is 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  one  China,  and  so  Taiwan  is  a  place  name.  It's  a 
   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

region.  It's  in  no  way  recognizing,  no  ­­ there's  no 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  recognition  in  the  Taiwan  example. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  LEWIN:  That's  correct,  Justice 
 

  

 

 

 

Ginsburg.  So  what  you  put  on  the  passport  does  not 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automatically  confer  recognition  ­­

FAM,  which  is  the  Foreign  Affairs  Manual,  says  pretty 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  that  if  there's  a  dispute  about  the  larger

objected  or  didn't  object  or  so  forth.  I'm  not 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interested  in  that. 
 

 

 

            

I'm  interested  in  what  we,  as  judges,  do

other  things  were  not  contrary  to  our  recognition

What  am  I  supposed  to  do  in  respect  to  that? 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  LEWIN:  Well,  the  first  ­­ the  first 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  is  that  this  ­­ what  goes  on  the  passport  does  not 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confer  the  benefits  of  formal  recognition  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty.  This  does  not  entitle  the  government,  the

JUSTICE  BREYER:  If  you  take  that  position, 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

which  explains  it,  then  what  do  you  think  of  Justice 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Story  who  writes  in  1833  that,  "The  exercise  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prerogative  of  acknowledging  new  nations  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

ministers"  ­­ and  he  makes  clear  that  involves  whether  a 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

city  or  a  region  is  part  of  a  country,  et  cetera,  he 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  it's  an  executive  function.  Some  argue,  as  we  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  we've  just  heard,  that  Congress  could  make  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision,  too,  but  that  hasn't  been  decided.  And  he 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concludes  that,  "A  power  so  extensive  in  its  reach  over 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  foreign  relations  could  not  properly  be  conferred  on 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  other  than  the  Executive  Department  will  admit  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little  doubt." 
 

 

            

            

MS.  LEWIN:  Justice  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  he  is  saying,  of  course, 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  to  have  one  person  deciding  such  a  thing,  and 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  has  to  be  the  Executive.  That's  1833,  pretty 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowledgeable  about  the  founders'  intent. 
 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  LEWIN:  But  that  is  a  rather  extreme 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

position,  number  one,  to  suggest  that  the  Executive 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Branch  would  have  not  only  the  authority  to  recognize  a 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  government,  but  also  at  the  State  Department's 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say­so,  that  automatically  would  end  the  question  or  any

always  review  with  not  appointing  an  ambassador. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  ­­ there  is  review  in  a  variety  of  alternative 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways  by  Congress.  It  just  may  not  be  the  way  you

Justice  Breyer,  Justice  Story  and  William  Rawle  both 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  that  authority  of  Congress  to  review. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Justice  Story  also  said  that,  "If  such 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognition  is  made,  it's  conclusive  upon  the  nation 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unless,  indeed,  it  can  be  reversed  by  an  act  of  Congress 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

repudiating  it."  And  then  he  went  further  to  say  that, 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"If  the  President  refuses  to  recognize,  then  he  said 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  may,  notwithstanding,  solemnly  acknowledge  the

pretty  much  the  exact  opposite,  that  the  recognition 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  was  really  just  a  trivial  formality.

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  In  any  case,  this  is  not

this  is  not  recognition;  it  just  has  an  effect  on  ­­ on 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  Department's  desire  to  ­­ to  make  nice  with

Israel,"  but  that  was  changed.  Was  it  changed  in

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Answer  my  question.  Did 
 

  

  

 

 

 

you  apply  formally  to  have  it  changed  or  did  you  just 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  this  ­­ that  position  in  litigation? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  LEWIN:  The  position  was  then 
 

  

 

 

 

 

subsequently  taken  in  litigation.  But  in  subsequent 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

renewals  of  the  passport,  too,  it  has  been  just  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

request  of  "Israel"  be  put  on  the  passport,  and  it  has 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  back  with  "Jerusalem." 
 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  May  I  ask  you  another  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

another  factual  question?  When  Menachem  was  born,  was 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  issued  a  birth  certificate  by  the  Israeli 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

authorities? 
 

            

MS.  LEWIN:  Yes. 
 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  And  the  United  States 
 

  

 

 

 

 

recognizes  that  as  ­­ as  a  lawful  exercise  of  Israeli 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority,  to  issue  a  birth  certificate  for  a  child  born 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

in  Jerusalem?

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  what  ­­ this  is  a

I  understand  it  is  the  position  of  the  United  States 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Israel  does  not  exercise  full  sovereignty  over 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jerusalem,  but  in  that  ­­ in  this  instance,  the  issuance 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  birth  certificate,  and  others  I  can  think  of,  I 
   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

suspect  the  United  States  recognizes  that  Israel  is 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawfully  exercising  attributes  of  sovereignty  over  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

territory  of  Jerusalem.  Is  that  correct? 
 

  

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  someone  ­­ let's  say  an  American 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizen  committed  a  crime  in  Jerusalem,  would  the  United 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  take  the  position  that  the  Israeli  government  has 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  lawful  authority  to  prosecute  that  person  for  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime? 
 

            

MS.  LEWIN:  I  do  not  believe  so,  Your  Honor. 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  believe  that  they  would  feel  that  the  Israeli 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  has  the  authority  to  prosecute  that  crime. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Ms.  Lewin,  if  I  can  ask  you, 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

if  your  primary  position  is  that  this  is  not  a 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognition  statute,  can  we  talk  a  little  bit  about  what 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is?  I  mean,  why  ­­ what  ­­ what  is  the  design,  what 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  effect  of  this  statute  other  than  as  something 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  goes  to  recognition? 
 

 

 

 

            

MS.  LEWIN:  This  statute  is  a  statute  that 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

was  created  to  give  individuals  the  right  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­identify  as  they  choose  that  they  were  born  in

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  the  United  States 
 

  

 

 

 

 

Government  does  not  usually  give  people  that  right  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­identify  in  this  way.  In  other  words,  I  think  this 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  the  Chief  Justice's  question  in  the  first  argument, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you're  an  American  citizen  born  in  Northern  Ireland, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can't  get  the  right  to  say  Ireland.  For  that 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter,  if  you  are  an  American  citizen  born  in  Jerusalem 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today,  you  can't  get  the  rights  to  say  Palestine. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  is  a  very  selective  vanity  plate  law, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

if  we  might  call  it  that.  And  ­­ and  it's  selective 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  Congress  had,  it  appears  to  me,  and  it's 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with  the  rest  of  the  statute,  as  Justice 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ginsburg  said,  a  real  view  that  this  was  the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

self­identification  it  wanted.  In  other  words,  the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

ability  of  American  citizens  to  say  yes,  I  was  born  in

MS.  LEWIN:  This  statute  was  rectifying  a 
   

  

 

 

 

 

misguided  policy  of  the  State  Department  which  enabled 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals  born  in  Israel  proper,  whether  in  Tel  Aviv 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  in  Haifa,  who  were  opposed  politically  to  the  State 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Israel  to  remove  that  sovereign,  to  remove  reference 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  Israel  from  their  passport,  but  it  did  not  allow  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flip.  It  did  not  allow  those  who  are  born  in  Jerusalem

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  What  about  Palestinians

that  option. 
 

 

            

MS.  LEWIN:  Correct,  Justice  Ginsburg, 
 

  

 

 

 

because  at  that  point  there  was,  before  1948,  a 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Palestine.  So  the  ­­ the  law  was  not  going  so  far  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Now,  people  can  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

Palestinians  cannot  ­­ American­born  Palestinians  cannot 
 

 

 

 

 

 

do  that.  And  that  suggests  that  Congress  had  a  view, 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  view  was  that  Jerusalem  was  properly  part  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Israel. 
 

            

MS.  LEWIN:  And  that  is  because  this  statute 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  dealing  with  an  existing  sovereign  that  you  either 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remove  from  the  passport  or  put  on  the  passport.  They 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weren't  complicating  the  situation  by  putting  in

argument  is  that  this  is  not  recognition.  Now,  suppose 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  Department,  and  I  think  this  is  its  position, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  this  is  recognition.  If  we  defer  to  the  State 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department's  judgment,  to  the  government's  executive 
 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  on  that  point,  and  the  government  said  this  is 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognition,  and  you  say  it  isn't  recognition,  why 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  the  government  trump?  If  the  government  ­­ if 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Congress  really  wants  to  test  its  power,  it  can  pass 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  law  saying  you  must  recognize  Israel  as  being  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimate  government  of  Palestine,  but  it  has  not  done 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  And  since  it  has  not  done  that,  it  seems  to  me 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government's  argument  trumps. 
 

 

 

 

            

MS.  LEWIN:  Justice  Kennedy,  you  are 
 

  

 

 

 

 

correct.  The  way  the  balance  of  powers  works  is  that

authority. 
 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  ­­ I  guess  there  are 
 

    

   

 

 

 

competing  canons  here.  I  mean,  one  is,  I  suppose,  that 
 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

we  listen  to  the  State  Department  on  matters  of  foreign 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affairs,  but  I  suppose  another  one  is  that  we  do  not 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hold  a  ­­ an  act  of  Congress  to  be  unconstitutional  and 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thereby  ineffective.  So  that  seems  to  me  a  draw, 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  it? 
 

 

            

            

MS.  LEWIN:  Yes,  Justice  Scalia.

send  an  official  letter  to  all  foreign  ministers

Congress  and  it  says  every  time  a  U.S.  citizen  is  born 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Jerusalem,  the  Secretary  of  State  has  to  send  an

you  provide  seems  to  be  very  similar  to  what  a  passport 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does.  A  passport  recognizes  an  individual  as  an 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

American  citizen  for  purposes  of  communicating  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  to  the  foreign  government. 
 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Yes,  exactly  right.  That 
 

  

  

 

 

 

was  going  to  be  my  point,  that  it  was  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter). 
 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  ­­ that  it  was  extremely 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

similar  to  what  a  passport  does,  that  both  are  forms  of 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diplomatic  communication,  and  that  what  we  usually  say 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  diplomatic  communication  is  that  whatever 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress's  other  foreign  affairs  powers  are,  the  power 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  diplomatic  communication  belongs  to  the  President  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  President  alone;  that  in  that  realm  we  only  speak 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  one  voice. 
 

 

 

            

And  so  I  guess  I  have  to  sort  of  say  that 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  answer  that  you  gave  me,  that  this  could  ­­ that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  could  say  to  the  Secretary  of  State,  here's  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diplomatic  communication  that  you  have  to  send  to  other 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  ministers,  seems,  well,  a  little  bit  shocking. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  LEWIN:  But  recognizing  an  individual  as 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

an  American  citizen  facilitates  the  transfer  and  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

movement  of  American  citizens  across  borders.  This  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  passport,  if  it  were  to  list  Israel  pursuant  to

required  to  be  sent  to  every  foreign  head  of  state  would 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  unconstitutional,  but  that  doesn't  mean  that  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passport  is,  because  the  passport  is  used  primarily  for

why  ­­ why  is  it  that  it's  okay  for  Congress  to  say 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  hasn't  happened,  meaning  to  say  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  born  in  Jerusalem  is  actually  born  in  Israel?

MS.  LEWIN:  Yes.  Since  1948,  Israel  has 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

acted  as  the  sovereign  over  western  Jerusalem  where  our

"The  Secretary  of  State  of  the  United  States  of  America 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hereby  requests  all  who  it  may  concern  to  permit  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizen,"  blah,  blah,  blah.  That's  what  ­­ that's 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ you  know,  the  Secretary  of  State  requests  all  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  who  are  going  to  be  looking  at  this  passport. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  then  in  Haig  v.  Agee,  we  described  a 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passport  as  a  letter  of  introduction  in  which  the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

issuing  sovereign  vouches  for  the  bearer  and  requests 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  sovereigns  to  aid  the  bearer.  So  this  is,  this 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passport,  it  seems,  both  on  what  it  says  itself  and  on 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  we've  said  about  it,  it's  like  a  letter  from  the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Secretary  of  State.  It's  a  communication. 
 

   

  

 

 

            

MS.  LEWIN:  It  is  a  communication  merely  to 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

facilitate  this  transfer  of  individuals  as  American 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens,  not  to  make  public  statements  about  where  they 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  born  or  where  they're  from  or  what  countries  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  recognizes. 
 

 

 

            

            

If  I  may  reserve  the  rest  of  my  time.

Let  me  get  to  the  heart  of  the  problem  with 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  214(d).  Even  if  Section  214(d)  does  not 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

officially  change  or  formally  change  the  recognition 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  of  the  United  States,  it  tries  to  deny  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President  the  power  to  give  effect  to  our  official 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognition  position  by  forcing  Executive  Branch 
 

 

 

 

 

 

officials  to  issue  official  diplomatic  communications 
 

 

 

 

 

 

that  contradict  that  position. 
 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  ­­ what  if 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  were  a  law  that  said  precisely  pretty  much  what 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  just  said?  The  law  says,  okay,  Mr.  President,  you 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  recognize  whoever  you  want,  but  if  you  recognize 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  ­­ this  country,  this  government,  we're  going  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treat  it  as  if  you  hadn't  recognized  this  government. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For  all  purposes  of  domestic  law,  we're  going  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pretend  ­­ we're  going  to  operate  on  the  assumption  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  recognized  this  country. 
 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  think  there  would  be 
 

    

 

 

 

 

limits  to  Congress's  ability  to  do  that.  We  think  that 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  recognition  power  that  the  President  possesses 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily  includes  the  power  to  give  effect  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognition  decisions. 
 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  ­­ so  that  law 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  unconstitutional?

all  purposes,  yes,  because  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  isn't  that 
 

  

 

 

 

 

exactly  what  the  Taiwan  Relations  Act  says?  What  it 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says  is,  "The  absence  of  diplomatic  recognition  shall 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  affect  the  application  of  the  laws  of  the  United 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  with  respect  to  Taiwan." 
 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 
 

  

 

 

 

 

that's  quite  different.  The  Taiwan  Relations  Act  was  an 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act  that  was  an  exercise  of  the  necessary  and  proper 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power  to  implement  the  President's  foreign  relations 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  about  how  Taiwan  should  be  treated. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  let's  say  the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

President  ­­ let's  say  the  President  did  not  want  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  Taiwan  and  Congress  passes  a  law  that  says  for 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  purpose  under  American  law,  we  will  treat  Taiwan 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  if  it  had  been  recognized? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  That  might  raise  a 
   

  

 

 

 

serious  Constitution  question,  but  that  isn't  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation  that  was  ­­ it  wasn't  the  case  when  it  was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted,  it's  not  the  case  now,  and  it's  ­­ and  it's 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  from  the  current  situation. 
 

 

 

 

 

            

The  fundamental  problem  with  Section  214(d) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  it  purports  to  try  to  force  the  Executive  Branch 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  issue  official  diplomatic  communications  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

contradict  the  position  of  the  United  States.

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  is  that  really  true? 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Suppose  ­­ could  Congress  pass  a  law  saying  that  every 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passport  ­­ every  passport  issued  to  an  American  citizen 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must  list  the  place  of  birth,  including  country,  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  for  this  purpose,  the  country  is  the  nation  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issued  the  birth  certificate  to  that  individual? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Could  ­­ could  Congress  do  that? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  ­­ I  think  that  that  ­­

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  in  a  situation  like  that,  the  Court  ought  to  defer 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  Executive  Branch's  judgment  that  the  place  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

birth  listing  can  have  significant  diplomatic 
 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences.  We  have  had  policies  in  place  for  decades 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  this  country  that  align  place  of  birth  designations 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  our  official  recognition  policy.  The  reason  we  do 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  because  foreign  sovereigns  look  to  these 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communications  as  indicative  of  where  we  stand  on 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  If  it  ­­ if  it  is  within

difference  does  it  make  whether  it  antagonizes  foreign 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

countries? 
 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  there  are  certain 
 

  

 

 

 

 

things  that  are  within  Congress's  power  that  would 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

antagonize  foreign  countries  that  wouldn't  raise  a

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ the  mere  fact  that  it

Your  Honor,  is  that  what  this  statute  does  that  those

itself,  to  communicate  a  message  that  contradicts  the

a  disclaimer  of  the  kind  that  I've  explained  to  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners'  counsel.  She  said  that  would  be  perfectly

issued  a  signing  statement  which  really  was,  in  effect, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  disclaimer,  in  2002.  President  Bush's  statement  said 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  2002,  this  does  not  change  our  official  recognition

asking  me,  this  is  a  place  where  the  Court  should  accord 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deference  to  the  judgments  of  the  Executive  Branch  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  Department,  in  particular.  If  the  State 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department  had  thought,  if  the  executive  had  thought 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  could  solve  the  diplomatic  problem  by  minimizing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  effect  of  this  provision,  pretending  as  though  it 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  going  to  have  this  effect,  certainly  they  would 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  followed  that  course. 
 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Not  necessarily. 
 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  What  they're  asking  you

to  do  is  to  look  ­­ they're  asking  the  government  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lie. 
 

            

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  think  that  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  not  ­­ that's 
 

  

 

 

 

 

exactly  what  you're  saying  the  government  should  ­­ the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

executive  department  should  not  do. 
 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  do  think  the  problem 
 

    

 

 

 

 

here  is  that  the  executive  made  a  considered  judgment  in 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2002  that  this  couldn't  sensibly  be  handled  that  way. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  ­­

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  So  how  are  we  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  if  it  just  says 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Disputed,"  parentheses  after  it,  "Disputed"?  Then  I 
   

  

 

 

 

 

gather  they  wouldn't  be  lying.  They  would  be  telling 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  truth. 
 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  I  don't  know.  I 
    

   

  

 

 

mean,  a  couple  things  about  that.  First,  Your  Honor, 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  have  the  effect  of  identifying  the  passports 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  were  issued  to  people  born  in  Jerusalem  on  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  that  would  be  the  reason  to  put  it  on.  But 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond  that,  it  isn't  disputed  as  a  matter  of  the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

official  position  of  the  United  States.  The  position  of 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  it's  disputed 
 

  

 

 

 

 

as  a  matter  of  the  government  of  the  United  States.

Official 

Part  of  the  government  says  this  ­­ well,  actually,  no, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  Congress  is  not  saying  under  my  hypothetical, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  is  Israel.  It's  saying  there's  a  dispute  about  it, 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  I  would  think  is  about  as  true  a  statement  as  you 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  make. 
 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  there's  a  dispute 
 

   

  

 

 

certainly  among  the  parties  of  the  region,  but  I  think 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  whole  premise  of  Petitioner's  argument  here  is  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  government  of  the  United  States  there  isn't  a 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute  over  the  recognition  issue. 
 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Can  you  help  me  with  this 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  question?  How  should  we  approach  it  generally? 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  is  to  say,  I  can  think  of  instances  where  a  similar 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  is  serving  nothing  other  than  administrative 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matters  ­­ the  passport  should  be  red  or  something  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  can  think  of  instances  where  it  causes  a  lot  of 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trouble.  But  I  can  think  of  instances  like  this  one, 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  could  and  you  could  easily  replicate  this 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

controversy  with  Israel  in  our  imaginations,  similar 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

controversy  with  Donetsk  and  the  Ukraine,  where  we  make 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  agreement  with  Russia  and  something  similar  comes 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up,  or  with  Iran,  and  pretend  that  ­­ remember  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Russia  once  invaded  the  northern  part  of  Iran.  And  all 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  the  world  there  can  be  similar  kinds  of  problems 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  it's  debatable  what  the  words  of  the  passport

what  others  will  think  they  mean. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  how  do  we,  who  know  little  about  it, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determine,  when  it  gets  into  the  realm,  that  we  should 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stay  out  of  it  and  let  the  President  and  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  gives  him  that  power  or  should  ­­ some

What  in  your  mind  is  the  right  standard?  How  do  we 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide? 
 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  do  think  this  Court, 
 

    

 

 

 

 

the  last  time  the  case  was  here,  said  that  ultimately  it 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  up  to  the  Court  to  judge  the  constitutionality  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute.  Of  course,  we  accept  that.  But  in  doing 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so,  we  believe  it  is  quite  important  that  the  Executive 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Branch  get  deference  on  judgments  of  precisely  the  kind 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Your  Honor  has  identified.  This  statute  is  a  very 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rare  passport  statute.  There  really  isn't  any  other 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

passport  statute  like  this  one  that  purports  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interject  an  issue  of  recognition  policy  into  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

content  of  passports. 
 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  General  Verrilli,  if  we 
 

  

 

 

 

 

agree  with  the  Petitioner,  we  do  not  have  to  confront 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  constitutional  question  whether  the  President  has 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exclusive  power  over  recognition.  If  we  agree  with  you, 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  are  going  to  have  to  grapple  with  that  constitutional

question,  right?  So  maybe  you  want  to  talk  about  it. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  let  me  ­­ I'm 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

delighted  to  talk  about  it,  but  before  I  do,  let  me 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  address  that.  I  don't  think  you  necessarily 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  address  the  question  of  exclusive  power  to  rule 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  us,  and  here's  why:  I  think  that,  given  the 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petitioner's  position  that  214(d)  does  not  change 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognition,  the  official  recognition  position  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States,  and  the  Senate  amicus  brief  saying  it 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  change  official  recognition  position  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States,  then  that's  a  given,  that  the  official 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognition  position  of  the  United  States  is  that  we  are 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  recognizing  any  nation's  sovereignty  over  Jerusalem 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  this  point  until  the  parties  work  it  out. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

With  that  as  a  given,  the  separation  of 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

powers  problem  with  Section  214(d)  is  that  it  forces  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Executive  Branch  to  engage  in  diplomatic  communications 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  contradict  our  official  recognition  position  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undermine  the  President's  credibility,  and  that  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  But  if  it  does,  then  their 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  is  going  to  be  it  does  amount  to  a  ­­ if  it 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  contradict  it,  then  Congress  is  making  its  own 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  about  recognition.  You  have  to  confront  that. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Are  they  entitled  to  do  that?  I  don't  see  how  you  can 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

avoid  that  question.

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  I'm  happy  to 
 

  

 

 

 

 

address  it.  I  will  address  it  now,  but  I  do  think  that 
 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can  decide  the  question  on  the  ground  I  just  decided 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  ultimately  resolving  that  question. 
 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Couldn't  you  say  that,  at 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  minimum,  the  Petitioner  has  conceded  that  it  is  not 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  that  this  is  recognition? 
 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yes,  that's  certainly  the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

case  and,  therefore,  we  take  as  a  given  that  the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President's  position  on  recognition,  which  is  the  same 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  the  position  every  President  going  back  to  Truman,  is 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  official  position  of  the  United  States  and  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

executive  is  being  forced  to  issue  diplomatic 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communications  that  contradict  it. 
 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  General  Verrilli,  it  is 
 

  

 

 

 

 

­­ the  requirement  of  place  of  birth  on  the  passport, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  doesn't  come  from  the  Congress.  That  comes  from 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  executive,  right? 
 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  That's  correct.  There's 
 

  

  

 

 

a  longstanding  policy  there. 
 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  I  thought  that  the 
 

   

  

 

 

 

purpose  of  birthplace  identified  by  the  government,  by 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  executive,  is  to  identify  the  person  and  not  ­­ it's

of  it  was  to  identify  the  individual;  isn't  that  right? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Yes,  that  is  its  primary 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

purpose.  But  even  though  that's  its  primary  function 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  passport,  it  has  the  effect  of  raising 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diplomatic  foreign  policy  issues  about  our  recognition 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position,  and  that  is  why  we  have  had  in  place  official 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policies  in  the  Foreign  Affairs  Manual  going  back  to  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

early  1960s  that  align  decisions  of  place  of  birth  with 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our  recognition  policy.  And  in  fact,  before  they  were 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

formalized  in  the  manual,  they  stretch  all  the  way  back 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  World  War  II.  It's  just  inevitable  that  foreign

Department's  web  site,  is  that  you  really  have  to  have 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  for  two  reasons.  And  the  first  is  that  very  often 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  nations  require  place  of  birth  information  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let  you  travel  to  that  nation,  so  it's  going  to  be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

highly  inconvenient  if  it's  not  in  the  passport. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

             

And  second,  law  enforcement  and 
 

 

 

 

 

counterterrorism  officials  were  quite  concerned  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

passports  were  going  to  become  less  effective  in  their 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

efforts  if  you  removed  the  place  of  birth  designation. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Can  I  ask  you  the  question  I 
   

   

  

 

 

 

 

asked  Ms.  Lewin.  What  exactly  is  the  position  of  the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

executive  regarding  Israel's  exercise  of  sovereign 
 

 

 

 

 

 

powers  in  Jerusalem?  Is  it  the  case  that  it  is  the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  of  the  executive  that  Israel  cannot  lawfully 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise  any  sovereign  powers  within  Jerusalem? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  The  position  of  the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

executive  is  that  we  recognize,  as  a  practical  matter, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  authority  of  Israel  over  West  Jerusalem.  With 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  rest  of  Jerusalem,  the  issue  is  far  more 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complicated.  It  might  well  be,  as  a  practical  matter,

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  that's  right.  But 
 

  

  

 

 

 

as  a  practical  matter,  I  don't  think  one  can  infer 
 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

anything  about  our  recognition  policy  from  that.  We're 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognizing  practical  reality. 
 

 

 

              

I  do  think,  for  example,  Your  Honor,  if  we 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  to  start  issuing  passports  to  people  born  in  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Crimea  tomorrow  that  identified  Russia  as  the  country  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

birth,  that  would  carry  obvious  implications  for  our 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  policy  position,  and  it  would  contradict  the

with  the  President's  recognition  power? 
 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Well,  I'm  trying  ­­ try 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  give  you  a  precise  answer  to  that.  If  the  statute 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  they  may  not  ­­ passports  may  not  be  printed  in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Country  A  because  the  United  States  does  not  recognize 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Country  A,  that  would  be  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Because  Congress 
 

  

 

 

 

wished  the  President  would  not  recognize  Country  A.  So 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  response  to  that,  we're  directing  that  passports  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  now  printed  in  Country  A  be  printed  in  Country  B. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  That  would  be  a  harder 
 

   

  

 

 

 

case  than  this  one,  I  think,  because  it  doesn't  as 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  implicate  the  President's  ability  to  give  effect 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  recognition  power.  And  one  reason  it  doesn't  is 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  that  doesn't  affect  the  content  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diplomatic  communication  in  the  way  that  Section  214(d) 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does. 
 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  thought  your 
 

    

 

 

 

position  was  that  the  President  has  the  exclusive  right 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  decide  what  interferes  with  his  recognition  power. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  No,  I  think  that  the 
 

   

  

 

 

 

President  has  the  right  to  give  effect  to  his

It  is  ­­ after  all,  recognition  is  not

therefore,  expect  that  it'd  be  assigned  to  the  Executive

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  But  with  respect  to  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect  to  the  executive  functions  around 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognition,  when  Congress  wanted  the  ­­ excuse  me,  when 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  framers  wanted  the  Congress  to  play  a  role  and  the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  envisions  a  role  for  the  framers  in  those 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

executive  functions,  it's  prescribed.  Article  II  gives 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  Senate  a  role  in  confirming  ambassadors,  it  gives 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Senate  a  role  in  advice  and  consent  for  treaties. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  there  isn't  anything  in  Article  II  as  a  structural

case  in  the  government's  favor  here  is  that  what 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  can't  do  is  use  the  authority  it  has  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regulate  passports,  and  we  acknowledge  this,  as  we  did  in  our 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief,  that  Congress  has  authority  to  regulate 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passports.  It  can't  use  that  authority  to  command  the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Executive  Branch  to  issue  diplomatic  communication  that

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  appreciate  the  appeal 
 

    

 

 

 

of  that  idea,  Justice  Kennedy,  but  the  problem  with  it 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  the  need  to  make  that  statement  doesn't  further

think  quite  candidly  ­­

why  doesn't  it  further  it? 
 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  Because  the  very  need  to 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

make  the  statement  calls  the  credibility  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President's  representation  of  our  recognition  position

the  United  States. 
 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  General  Verrilli,  I  think 
 

   

  

 

 

the  answer  to  the  question  that  Ms.  Lewin  gave  was  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she  said  yes,  the  Executive  could  put  that  on  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passport.  But  she  also  said  Congress  could  then  pass  a 
   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  saying,  this  is  antithetical  to  our  view,  and  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  have  to  be  put  on  the  passport.  On  the  passport 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  just  birthplace,  Israel,  period.  Congress  could  pass 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  into  law  and  counter  whatever  the  President  does. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  And  I  do  think  that's  the 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

necessary  implication  of  the  Petitioner's  argument  here, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  only  that  Congress  could  forbid  a  disclaimer,  but 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  could  require  that  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  that  law  isn't  in 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

front  of  us. 
 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  But  ­­ but  were  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  the  Court  to  uphold  the  constitutionality  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  that  is  in  front  of  you,  it  seems  to  me  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary  implication  of  that  would  be  that  Congress 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  prevent  a  disclaimer,  it  could  require  not  just 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Israel  be  listed  but  Jerusalem,  Israel  be  listed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  ­­ on  a  country  of  birth,  and  it  seems  to  me  that

was  born  in  Israel.  It  could  have  been  anywhere  in

President's  credibility  as  our  sole  spokesman  in  matters 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  diplomacy.  And  there  is  not  an  issue  on  which  the

question  of  the  status  of  Jerusalem. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  question  of  the  status  of  Jerusalem  is 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  most  vexing  and  volatile  and  difficult  diplomatic 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  that  this  nation  has  faced  for  decades.  It  goes

the  matter  is  that  the  parties  in  the  region,  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nations  in  the  region,  and  frankly  people  around  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world  and  governments  around  the  world  scrutinize  every 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word  that  comes  out  of  the  United  States  Government  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every  action  that  the  United  States  Government  takes  in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  to  see  whether  we  can  continue  to  be  trusted  as  an 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

honest  broker  who  could  stand  apart  from  this  conflict 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  help  bring  it  to  resolution. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  there  is  no  doubt  that  Section  214(d), 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  it  was  enacted,  had  a  serious  adverse  effect 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

calling  our  credibility  into  question.  You  can  just 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  the  statements  from  foreign  parties  that  are  in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Joint  Appendix  and  the  State  Department  communiqué 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  pages  231  to  233.  You  can  look  at  contemporaneous 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

press  accounts  from  that  time,  and  it  seems  to  me 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  ­­ of  course,  if  we  were  required  to  implement 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this,  we  would  do  everything  we  could  to  try  to  mitigate 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  problem.  But  it  seems  to  me  that  the  right  ­­ it  is 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite  important  for  this  Court  to  understand  that  there 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  very  serious  risk  that  that  harm  to  our  credibility 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  an  honest  broker  on  this  very  serious  vexing  issue 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  be  called  into  serious  question  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Why  would  that  be  so?  No 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

matter  how  this  Court  decides,  everyone  will  know  what 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  position  of  the  President  is.  Everyone  will  know

what  Congress  thought  when  they  passed  this  legislation. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whatever  we  do,  that's  not  going  to  be  changed,  and  our 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  isn't  going  to  be  based  on  any  view  that  we  may 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  about  whether  Jerusalem  should  be  regarded  as  part 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Israel  or  the  capital  of  Israel. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  why  will  there  be  any  effect  on  foreign 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy  except  by  people  who  will  misunderstand  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation,  either  ­­ either  because  they  really  don't 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  it  or  they  will  exploit  it  in  some  way? 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I've  got  ­­ I've  got  at 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  two  points  to  make  about  that  if  I  could.  First, 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  a  misperception.  It's  an  accurate  perception. 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

One  looks  at  214  as  a  whole,  not  just  214(d).  What 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

214(d)  ­­ what  214  does  is  try  to  force  the  Executive 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Branch  to  take  a  series  of  steps  that  no  nation  would 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  if  it  did  not  recognize  the  sovereignty  of  Israel 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  Jerusalem,  and  that  nations  would  only  take  if  they 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  recognize  the  sovereignty  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  But  Congress  did  that,  so 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  that  we  do  is  going  to  change  that  or  change 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  Congress  thought. 
 

 

 

            

GENERAL  VERRILLI:  I  think  that's,  with  all 
 

    

 

 

 

 

due  respect,  too  easy  an  assumption,  Your  Honor.  The 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  between  when  this  statute  was  enacted  ­­ and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  did  give  rise  to  very  serious  problems  that  we  had  to

work  very  hard  to  try  to  get  under  control.  The 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  between  then  and  now,  there's  two  very 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  differences,  and  they  lead  to  a  very  important 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion. 
 

            

 

The  first  important  difference  is  it  won't 
 

 

 

 

 

 

be  one  branch  of  the  United  States  Government  saying 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  should  happen.  It  will  be  two  branches  of  the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  Government  saying  it  should  happen.  It 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

won't  be  that  we  will  ­­ that  this  statute  will  have 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  enacted,  but  it  won't  be  enforced.  It  will  be 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforced. 
 

            

And  the  consequence  of  those  two  things 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together  is  that  the  credibility  of  the  executive  ­­ the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

credibility  of  the  President  on  this  fundamental 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  of  where  the  United  States  stands  on  the  status 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Jerusalem  until  the  parties  work  it  out  will 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inevitably  and  seriously  be  called  into  question  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

into  doubt. 
 

 

            

Foreign  governments,  foreign  peoples  will 
 

 

 

 

 

not  be  able  to  have  complete  confidence  that  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  that  the  President  announces  on  behalf  of  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  is,  in  fact,  the  position  of  the  United 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States. 
 

            

That  is  exactly  why  Section  214  violates  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separation  of  powers,  even  if  you  conclude  that  Congress

strongly  disagree  with.  The  official  position  of  the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  is  that  Jerusalem,  we  don't  recognize  any

And  what  this  ­­ what  this  statute  does  if 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  enforced  will  undermine  the  credibility  of  our  ­­

important  diplomatic  position  as  we  move  forward.

disagreement,  but  not  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  could  you  tell  me 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  a  lie?  You,  the  United  States,  are  being  asked 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  put  on  the  passport  that  you  believe  the  place  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

birth  of  this  individual  is  Israel,  and  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  ­­ and  the  executive  has  said,  no,  we  don't 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it  was  Israel,  we  think  it  was  Jerusalem. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  LEWIN:  But  the  speech  is  the  speech  of 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  individual  who  has  self­identified. 
 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  the  individual  is 
 

  

 

 

 

 

not  the  one  issuing  the  passport.  It's  the  government. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  document  says.  This  is  a  diplomatic  exchange 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

between  sovereigns. 
 

 

            

MS.  LEWIN:  But  we  are  permitting  that

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  take  it,  Ms.  Lewin,  when 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

you  say  the  West  Bank,  I  take  it  you  think  that  Congress

MS.  LEWIN:  We  are  providing  two  alternative 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

arguments,  Justice  Kagan:  One  saying  that  this  is  does 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  amount  to  recognition;  or  if  the  Court  decides  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reach  the  separation  of  powers  question  and  views  this 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  somehow  implicating  the  recognition  clause,  that  at 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  point  the  law  passed  by  Congress  would  trump  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President.  Allowing  the  State  Department's  say­so  to 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

control  because  it's  an  expert  in  foreign  relations

We  suggest  that  this  is  analogous,  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognition  power,  is  analogous  to  the  President's 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority  to  enter  into  executive  agreements  to  resolve 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreign  claims,  and  that  just  as  though  that  is  not  an 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explicit  authorization  provided  to  the  President,  it's 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also  not  exclusive,  and  the  agreements  entered  into  by

the  President  cannot  contradict  or  run  counter  to  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

express  will  of  Congress. 
 

 

 

 

            

With  regard  to  the  international  response  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this,  the  consequences,  first  of  all,  described  by  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Solicitor  General  are  grossly  exaggerated.  And  what  the 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

world  knows  could  be  the  ­­ first  of  all,  the  United 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States  State  Department  could  make  clear  in  their 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statements,  as  they  did  with  Taiwan,  that  this  does  not 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  the  United  States'  policy  with  regard  to  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sovereignty  over  Jerusalem. 
 

 

 

            

And  because  the  passports  would  be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

indistinguishable  from  those  who  are  born  elsewhere, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  continuing  statement.  While  this  may 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

initially  have  some  impact,  over  time,  and  I  propose  a 
   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

short  time,  particularly  if  the  United  States  makes  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement,  this  will  become  a  nonissue  because  there's 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

no  continuing  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Can  I  say  that  this  seems  a 
   

   

  

 

 

 

 

particularly  unfortunate  week  to  be  making  this  kind  of, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"oh,  it's  no  big  deal"  argument.  I  mean,  history 
 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests  that  everything  is  a  big  deal  with  respect  to 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  status  of  Jerusalem.  And  right  now  Jerusalem  is  a 
   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tinderbox  because  of  issues  about  the  status  of  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access  to  a  particularly  holy  site  there.  And  so  sort 
 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  everything  matters,  doesn't  it?
