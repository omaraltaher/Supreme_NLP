 (10:03 a.m.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Osborn v. Haley.

 Mr. Grant.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC GRANT
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. GRANT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The court of appeals misinterpreted the 

Westfall Act in a way that unfairly deprives tort 
plaintiffs of the most basic procedural protections 
routinely afforded in both Federal and State courts. 
That misinterpretation cannot be reconciled with the 
text and history of the statute, the nature and 
operation of official immunity or the jurisdictional 
limitations of article III.  Accordingly, the judgment 
of the court of appeals should be reversed and this 
State law case should be remanded to the State courts 
where it rightfully belongs.  In the alternative, the 
court of appeals judgment should be vacated for lack of 
appellate jurisdiction.

 Prior to the Westfall Act, courts considered 
whether, assuming the alleged acts occurred, the Federal 
employee was acting within the scope of his employment.

In Westfall v. Erwin, this Court added the additional 
requirement that the acts be undertaken with a 
discretionary function, but invited Congress to address 
the issue.  In responding with the Westfall Act, 
Congress did not change the basic rule that scope of 
employment sets the line for immunity.  Indeed, Congress 
confirmed that rule.  In particular, Congress gave no 
hint that it was radically rewriting the rules to direct 
Federal district courts to determine the merits of 
wholly State law claims in some sort of unprecedented 
summary proceeding.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why is it a wholly State 

law claim if the principal matter is whether this 
Federal employee is immune from suit?  That's the 
threshold question that has to be answered.  It's 
determined wholly by Federal law, so you must get 
through that Federal law gateway before you can go any 
place else in the suit.

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor, that is true in 

perhaps a majority of Westfall Act cases, but in cases 
like this and a significant and recurring subset of 
cases there is no Federal law question because scope of 
employment simply is not at issue.  What the Government 
does in those subset of cases is merely to assert the 
defense of he didn't do it or it never happened.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that -- it's not it 

never happened as though the Federal employee was off in 
Hong Kong.  He was there on the premises.  He is 
claiming that whatever he did was within the scope of 
his authority.  It seems like it's a question of 
phraseology that you're dealing with.

 MR. GRANT:  With respect, Your Honor, that 
is not the case, certainly in this case and in others. 
The Government has conceded that if Respondent Barry 
Haley acted as alleged in the complaint he was acting 
outside the course and scope of his Federal employment.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I think Justice 

Ginsburg's point, and it concerns me as well, is that 
the Government is entitled to say that during the time 
the event occurred, i.e., the firing, he was on duty and 
he refrained from committing any unlawful act.

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor, there may be cases 
where even if the acts occurred, they were within the 
course and scope of the Federal employment.  But in the 
case like this, as in Wood versus United States, as in 
Melo v. Hafer in the Third Circuit, the Government 
concedes, because the law and the facts require the 
Government and the employee to concede, that if the 
alleged acts took place they were necessarily outside 
the scope of employment.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the actual 

statutory language refers to acting within the scope of 
employment at the time of the incident, and so a 
certification based on the view that at the time of the 
alleged incident, he was acting entirely within his 
scope would seem to be within the language of the 
statute.

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor, on its face the 
certification in this case, as in others, tracks the 
statutory language.  But when the Government's position 
was examined in the district court, it became apparent 
that the Government's essential defense, in fact 
supported by two declarations, including the declaration 
of Respondent Haley, was that he simply did not do the 
acts alleged.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but the question is 
what the district court should examine, and the statute 
talks about the incident out of which the claim arose. 
So that necessarily requires the Government to look at 
the complaint, see the incident out of which this claim 
arises, whether or not the claim is true, and to certify 
it.

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  "Out of which the claim 
arose" it seems to me is of some importance.  But the

dissenting judges in the First Circuit case, Wood, 
didn't think it was important.  I'm not sure they were 
right about that.

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor, this Court has 

consistently made a distinction between immunity and the 
merits.  Starting in cases like Mitchell versus Forsyth 
in 1985 and continuing through cases like Richardson 
versus McKnight in 1997, the Court has consistently 
recognized that immunity is different from a defense on 
the merits.  It's different from a defense of he didn't 
do it or it never happened.  And I would say that, 
although the time of the incident is important, that is 
only one of several factors certainly under Kentucky law 
in determining whether something happened within the 
course and scope of employment.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well how is it -- I 

mean, that line is awfully difficult to draw.  You assert 
he didn't do it versus something else.  But it's easy, 
let's say it's an assault case and the person says, you 
hit me, and the person says, well, it was entirely an 
accident; I was gesticulating with my hand so it wasn't, 
wouldn't have met the requirements for the tort.  Now, 
are they denying the incident in that case?

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor, the Court in Wood v. 

United States took account of the possibilities of

artful pleading and would allow the Government to 
challenge the characterization of the incident.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it's not just a 

characterization.  If it's something that has, for 
example, a mental element, the plaintiff can assert, you 
did that with malice aforethought and the defendant can 
say, no, I didn't.  Now, is that a characterization or 
is that a denial of the incident?

 MR. GRANT:  I believe that's a 

characterization, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why isn't it the denial of 

an element of the claim?  There's no recovery for 
assault if the mental element is what the Chief Justice 
just described in his hypo, and if in fact that is an 
element of the claim how do you draw a distinction 
between that and the existence or nonexistence of any 
act at all.

 MR. GRANT:  There are, Your Honor, certain 

cases in which --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, I'm not asking about 
certain cases.  I just want to know analytically how you 
do it or how you think we're supposed to do it.

 MR. GRANT:  There are cases in which the 
merits and the immunity defense overlap and in those 
cases the district courts are fully empowered to make

factual findings.

Official 

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, in this case the 

immunity defense is, number one, as you said, the 
Government forthrightly said at the beginning right in 
terms of the statute that he was acting within the scope 
of his employment.  Secondarily, as you said, the 
Government in effect elaborated on that and said the 
reason he was not acting outside the scope of his 
employment is that these acts which would have been 
outside scope didn't happen.  Why is that any 
different from the claim in the Chief Justice's hypo 
that there was no intent to harm?

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor, because a claim of, 

that the alleged act did not occur, that he didn't do 
it, is not a claim of immunity.  Again, this --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  It's a claim upon which the 

immunity depends.  The immunity is claimed -- the 
immunity claimed here is that at the time in question he 
was not acting outside the scope of his employment.  The 
reason he was not acting outside the scope was that he 
didn't do what they say he did.

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor, I'm sorry if I have 
the same answer to the question, but again, this Court's 
jurisprudence has consistently distinguished between 
defenses, so to speak, on the merits, a claim that the

alleged act did not occur, that one of the elements of 
the State law claim is not met.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  In this case, if Mr. Haley 

had said, I had some conversations with the private 
employer and the plaintiff's name was mentioned during 
the conversations, but I never told them to discharge 
her, would this, would that be something -- would your 
argument apply there?

 MR. GRANT:  It would apply, Your Honor, if, 
if that factual determination were relevant to scope of 
employment under the applicable law, namely the agency 
law of Kentucky.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, is it?  I mean, 
that's -- the problem that I have with your argument, 
Mr. Grant, is that in life things are often not, it 
happened or it didn't happen.  There is a middle 
ground, which is this officer is saying, I was there at 
the relevant time or place and when I was there 
everything that I did was within the scope of my 
employment, I didn't do anything that was outside the 
scope of my employment.

 MR. GRANT:  There are cases in which there 
is a middle ground, Your Honor.  But this case is not 
one of them, and there is certainly a distinct and 
recurring subset of cases, like Wood and Melo and

Kimbro, where it is conceded on the facts and the law 
that if the actions occurred, they occurred outside the 
scope of employment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand why 
anyone would want to come out the way you urge us to 
come out.  Why would it make any sense to give a Federal 
employee the benefit of trial in Federal court when he 
committed the act, and then you debate about whether it 
was, whether there was liability or not, and yet deprive 
him of the benefit of a Federal court when he denies 
that he did anything at all?  Why would you want one set 
of cases to remain in the State court and the other set 
of cases to go to Federal court?

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor, it's Congress that 

set the line at scope of employment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I mean, that's what 

we're debating, whether the line is there or not, and as 
you've seen from the discussion, there is at least some 
ambiguity in it.  There being ambiguity, why should we 
find a line that doesn't make any sense?

 MR. GRANT:  Well, Your Honor, I believe that 
line does make sense because if the Government's view is 
adopted and the view of the majority of the court of 
appeals, the merits of the wholly State law claim will 
be resolved in Federal court and resolved in a

procedural context that denies a tort plaintiff the 
right to discovery, that denies the tort plaintiff a 
right to the normal evidentiary presumptions on a motion 
to dismiss or motion for summary judgment, and denies 
that tort plaintiff the right to a jury trial.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that can happen when in 
fact the certification of the Attorney General turns out 
to be wrong and there isn't any immunity.  Still, the 
whole thing is going to be tried in Federal court.

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor, in that situation, 

the merits will at least be tried under the normal 
provisions for discovery and evidentiary presumptions, 
even if it does ultimately proceed against the United 
States.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But Mr. Grant, I'm a 

little puzzled.  Why is the discovery in the Federal 
system any less valuable in the State system?

 MR. GRANT:  Because what the Government 

advocates here, as I think most starkly illustrated by 
the Third Circuit's decision in Melo v. Hafer is some 
sort of summary proceeding that takes place before the 
normal processes of Federal litigation.  After all, it's 
the Government's position that this employee is immune.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Isn't that only summary 

for the purpose of deciding whether the removal was

Official 

 MR. GRANT:  It's for the purpose of deciding 
scope of employment, but the Government's interpretation 
of that phrase encompasses essentially the merits of the 
case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not for 

deciding whether removal -- I thought the statute says 
that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive 
with respect to removal.

 MR. GRANT:  It is conclusive, Your Honor, in 
those cases that truly do implicate scope of employment. 
In this case, by contrast, the certification was 
essentially to raise the he didn't do it or it never 
happened defense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what does it 
mean to say that the certification is conclusive with 
respect to scope of employment for purposes of removal 
if it doesn't mean that it's conclusive, if you're going 
to have judicial review that is going to address the 
question of removal as opposed to the validity of the 
certification on the merits?

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor, it's conclusive 

where it satisfies the definition in the statute.  What 
is conclusive in the final sentence of paragraph (d)(2) 
of section 2679 is this certification, and this

certification of course is the one referred to earlier 
in that paragraph.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you're saying 

it's only conclusive if it's right?

 MR. GRANT:  No, Your Honor.  It's only, it 

can be conclusive right or wrong, but it's only 
conclusive if it satisfies the statutory definition, 
being about scope of employment, not about the merits. 
In this case, for example, there never will be, never 
could be a true scope of employment determination, the 
Government having conceded it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose, Mr. Grant, that 

the district court had said, I'm going to deny the 
substitution of the United States as the defendant, but 
I realize that this is a debatable question, so I'm not 
going to order a remand until the defendant and the United 
States have had a chance to challenge my initial ruling 
that I deny the substitution of the United States. 
Suppose that it had happened that way?  Would you have any 
right to get back in the State court?  Wouldn't that 
properly go to a court of appeals?

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor, that, that could 

certainly go to the court of appeals under the 
discretionary appeal procedure in section 1292(b), or 
perhaps by mandamus.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, suppose that 

happened, and then the court of appeals said the United 
States should have been substituted?

 MR. GRANT:  That would -- that would on its 
merits restrict the district court from remanding, but 
of course in this case, the district court did enter an 
order of remand based on its interpretation of section 
2679.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But your position is that 
the Attorney General's certification is conclusive --
is not conclusive in those situations in which the 
Attorney General doesn't draw the line properly between 
an event denying answer and an event characterizing 
answer?  Whenever the Attorney General is wrong on that 
very nuanced decision in some instances, then the 
Attorney General's certification is not conclusive?

 MR. GRANT:  The short answer is yes, Your 

Honor.  The Attorney General's certification is not 
conclusive where it does not satisfy the statutory 
definition, where it is not a certification that truly 
implicates scope of employment.  We have tried to draw 
the distinction between an unauthorized or improper 
certification, one that doesn't meet the statutory 
definition, and a certification as, as the Court in 
Aliota versus Graham said was wrong or erroneous on its

merits, so to speak, on the facts, on the law, of State 
agency law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Grant, these items 
we've been discussing are perhaps the more important 
features of the case.  But your argument in your brief 
didn't begin with those.  It began with the assertion 
that there is no jurisdiction to review the district 
court's remand order at all.  I take it you're not 
abandoning that, are you?

 MR. GRANT:  Absolutely not, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Then why was it first in 

your brief and not first in your argument?

 MR. GRANT:  It was first in my brief because 
this Court ordered me to brief and address it, and I was 
happy to do so.  The court of appeals in fact did lack 
jurisdiction in this case.  This Court has made clear as 
recently as the Kircher opinion last term that section 
1447(d) means what it says.  And in this case, the 
district court entered an order remanding the case to 
the State court from which it was removed, and 1447(d), 
of course, bars review of that order by appeal or 
otherwise.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There is at least 

considerable tension with 1447(d), though, and 
2679(d)(2), in that that specifically says that for

purposes of removal, the Attorney General's certification 
is conclusive.  And it doesn't, if you look at 2679, it 
suggests, you'd think that case would proceed in Federal 
court rather than be immediately remanded without the 
availability of review.

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor, on the merits of the 

interpretation of 2679(d)(2), we tried to explain why 
conclusive does not operate in a case like this, but I 
think the important point for jurisdiction is that this 
Court has consistently said that even if a district 
court misinterprets a jurisdictional statute, that 
review is nonetheless barred by section 1447(d).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This is a different 
type of jurisdictional statute in that there is concern 
on Congress's part here to provide a Federal forum for 
the adjudication of whether something is within the 
scope of a Federal employee's duty.  It's not 
inconceivable, but it would seem illogical to 
specifically provide for review of that determination 
but then have that review take place in State court 
rather than Federal court.

 MR. GRANT:  Well, Your Honor, Congress 
obviously knows how to make exceptions to section 
1447(d).  I believe it was footnote eight of this 
Court's opinion in Kircher that cited a number of

examples.  The Government in its brief relied on 12 
U.S.C. section 1441(a), and that statute which involved 
the Resolution Trust Corporation specifically refers to 
appeal and remand.  And so what this Court has said is, 
the bar of section 1447(d), which has been around for 
more than a century, is not to be ignored unless there 
is a clear statutory command that makes an exception.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But here not only, not only 
does it say that the Attorney General's certification is 
conclusive for purposes of removal, but there is no 
mention about remand in relation to a case that is 
removed after the Attorney General's certification. 
Whereas by contrast, where the Attorney General doesn't 
certify and the case is removed, the statute does 
address the issue of remand.  So if you put those two 
things together, isn't it perfectly clear that Congress 
did not want these cases that are removed on the 
Attorney General's certification to be remanded?

 MR. GRANT:  No, Your Honor.  The authority 

to remand in this case proceeds from subsection C of 
section 1447.  As this Court has said in various cases, 
including the International Primate Protection League 
case in 1991, when a Federal district court lacks 
subject matter jurisdiction because a case, a party 
attempting to remove has done so without authority to do

so, section 1447(c) obliges a remand.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would have thought your 
answer would have been even if, even if the remand was 
improper, even if it is the case that, what is it, 
(d)(2) envisions that the suit remain in the Federal 
court.  Nonetheless, if there is an erroneous remand, it 
is still a remand that is covered by the prohibition of 
review.  I mean, we said in other cases that even when 
the remand is wrong, the remand is not reviewable.

 MR. GRANT:  That is my answer, Your Honor. 

Section (d)(2) goes, gives direction to district courts, 
but section 1447(d) gives direction to appellate courts.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  If that's your answer, can 
I go back to the other main issue for a second?  I would 
have thought that your case, unfortunately for you in my 
mind, is the classic case where there should be 
jurisdiction because the AG is supposed to say look, I 
don't think anything happened, okay?  So he was doing 
his job all day.  But if something did happen, I'll tell 
you what, it was within the scope of his employment. 
And apparently, that's just what they did say here.  And 
then it got mixed up in the courts below.  In other 
words, if he made some phone calls and even if he 
mentioned the employee, even if he said something 
improper, it was within the scope of his employment,

which is just what they said.  So because of that, it 
seems to me this makes a lot of complexity out of 
nothing.  Now you explain what your answer is.

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor, with respect, I 
believe the Attorney General said just the opposite, 
that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  In the district court he 
didn't say, if something happened here, it was in the 
scope of his employment?  I thought he had.  Maybe he 
hadn't.  I thought he had, but I'll ask him that.

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER:  In the district court I 

thought he said that.

 MR. GRANT:  The Attorney General's 

submission, the Government's submission in the district 
court was that nothing happened.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, it was there first, 
but you can argue in the defense alternative, I think 
nothing happened.  But if the plaintiff can convince a 
jury otherwise, fine, but then what they can convince 
him of is within the scope of his employment.  Now did 
that happen in the district court, that they said 
something like that or not?

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor, the Government did 

make what it called an alternative argument.

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why can't they do 

that, which is just what Wood says they can do, if 
anybody, you know, thinks that's valid?  But the --
what's the problem then?  Because I would have thought 
that the reason this case appears difficult is because 
yours is a case where the AG should be able to come in 
and remove it.

 MR. GRANT:  The district court, the very 

same district court that the Government so, so 
desperately wants to review the facts of this case, said 
that given Mr. Haley's declaration under penalty of 
perjury, it would not accept that alternative.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But it's wrong in that, 

isn't it?

 MR. GRANT:  Well, the Government did not 

appeal that point in the court of appeals, and in fact --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, the Wood issue was 
the issue of where if anything happened, of course it's 
outside the scope.  It's like one employee shoots 
another, you know.  There is nothing to do with scope of 
employment there, it's plainly outside.  And of course, 
this act, in my view then, then, was that this is not an 
act that allows the AG to defend that kind of thing. 
But if it's arguable at least that something happened, 
if it happened at all it was within the scope of

 MR. GRANT:  Your Honor, the Government --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the problem with --

there should be a problem with what I say from your 
point of view, so --

MR. GRANT:  I think the problem is in the 
record, Your Honor, and the Government's brief at the, 
at the petition stage on page 14 in note five quotes its 
own appellate brief in the court of appeals, and that 
brief says the memorandum of understanding between the 
Forest Service and the private respondent showed that if 
Haley did cause the contractor to fire Osborn, he acted 
outside the scope of his employment.  And the court of 
appeals quite logically took that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So you're saying they have 

abandoned the argument?

 MR. GRANT:  They have Your Honor and the 

court of appeals recognized that on page 3a of the 
petition appendix.  If the Court has no further 
questions I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

Official 

 In the Westfall Act Congress provided an 

absolute immunity for Federal employees for acts 
taken within the scope of their employment and it 
went further and provided that when the Attorney 
General certifies that the employee was acting 
within the scope of his employment at the time of 
the incident out of which the claim arose, that that 
issue of Federal immunity is to be decided by the 
Federal court.  It is the Attorney General's assertion 
of this Federal defense of immunity that satisfies 
article III just as the employee's own assertion of 
immunity satisfies article III under the Federal Officer 
Removal statute and just as a, in other circumstances a 
plaintiff's assertion of a claim under Federal law 
satisfies article III.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So what if the 
Attorney General certifies and removes a case in a 
criminal case, a case clearly not within the statute? 
What happens then?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, I think that 
the, the -- that would probably be a defect in removal 
procedure rather than a jurisdictional defect but even 
if it is --

procedure, he follows the procedure meticulously; it's 
just wrong.  It's a criminal case.  The statute says he 
can do it in a civil case.  On the other hand the statute 
also says that his certification is conclusive.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, Your Honor 
even if that is a case that would be removed without 
jurisdiction, that case is quite different from this 
case because this case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, this one is a 

civil one and that's a criminal, but I'm just 
trying to understand how broad your argument that this 
is not subject to further review goes.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, the issue 
that is not subject to further review for purposes of 
jurisdiction is the Attorney General's certification 
that the employee was acting within scope.  The 
statute doesn't provide that the Attorney General's 
certification that it is a civil action is conclusive 
but only the Attorney General's certification that the 
employee was acting within scope is conclusive for 
purposes of removal.  That's the essential element of 
the Federal defense and that's what satisfies article 
III jurisdiction.  And in fact, this Court in the 
Willingham case recognized that an employee could assert 
a claim of Federal immunity even though he was also at

the same time denying that he caused any harm to the 
plaintiff.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well I thought your 
analogy to Willingham was a strong one until you go back 
and read the statute.  Willingham is a very different 
statutory predicate.  It's acting under color of law. 
This is much more specific.  At the time of the 
incident, he was acting within his scope, so I'm not 
sure the analogy holds up.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well if anything 
the language of the Westfall Act is broader because as 
Your Honor emphasized earlier, the statute, the Westfall 
act provides that the Attorney General is to certify 
that at the time of the incident out of which the claim 
arose the employee was acting within the scope.  So 
arguably the necessary question is what was the employee 
doing at the time.  The Federal Officer Removal statute 
is somewhat narrower because it requires that the claim 
arise out of the, the acts taken under color of office.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But yet that would 

be a good argument if the statute said the Attorney 
General can certify that the employee did not do 
anything outside the scope of his employment, but it's 
phrased in the affirmative.  He has to certify that he 
was acting within the scope of his employment.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That's right.  And 

that's what the Attorney General did here, certified 
that Mr. Haley was acting within the scope of his 
employment at the time of the incident out of which the 
claim arose.  And as several --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So that's the issue then. 
And what I -- is my, my question for you is this, let's 
imagine not this case, which as I said I think is too 
complicated and probably is one that the Government 
should be able to defend, but suppose it's an assault 
like Wood's, a sexual assault and there is absolutely no 
doubt that if it happened it was outside the scope of 
employment, everybody concedes it but Government.  And 
the Government's position is, nothing happened.  All 
right?  Nothing happened.  You say Government, would you 
like to argue that if something happened, and they may 
be able to prove something, something like a movement? 
No, we agree there was nothing like that, we agree 
nothing like that happened; we are not going to defend 
on any scope of employment ground.  All we are arguing 
is that ordinary work went on and that was within the 
scope of employment.  Now, does this act cover it or 
not?  Your view is yes and you read, you know I thought 
it was a close question but you read what I thought the 
other way in Wood, though it was obviously a close

question.  So what is your basic response to that?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  You are correct 
that our view is that yes, the Attorney General can 
certify in that case.  The issue is really one along a 
continuum as I think Your Honor has recognized.  Of on, 
on the one extreme, one might say that the Attorney 
General must accept all of the plaintiff's allegations 
as true.  And, and I don't think that anybody here is 
arguing that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was the position of 

the district court, though, wasn't it?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That was the 

position of the district court, although I don't think 
the Petitioner is now advocating that view.  And that 
view would certainly be inconsistent; it would create 
the anomaly that the Attorney General's authority to 
certify scope and to assert the immunity on behalf of 
the employee would be narrower than the employee's own 
authority to assert the immunity, because again going back 
to the Willingham case, the Court never asked whether it 
would be within the scope of employment for the prison 
officials to have maliciously tortured the prisoner; 
rather the defense was we didn't harm the prisoner but 
anything that happened between us and the prisoner 
happened within the scope of our employment.  And so the

Attorney General's authority to certify has to be at 
least as broad as that in our view.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  The basic point I think in 

Wood is this.  I'm the district judge.  And the 
Government, you come in and argue in the alternative. 
Nothing happened, but if it did happen it was within the 
scope of employment and they say there is no 
possibility.  You'd say, plaintiff, I want to know here 
if there is a reasonable chance, maybe any chance, that 
a jury could find that something went on here that was 
within the scope of employment that shouldn't have.  And 
if the answer to that question is no, the defendant wins 
either because of summary judgment or because -- no, 
sorry.  I've gotten lost in what I said.  Do you follow 
it?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  The -- I think I do. 

In our view --

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Good, I'm glad 

that someone did.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  In our view, it 
would be anomalous that the, that the more innocent 
employee would be deprived of the benefits of the 
Westfall Act, and if I could use a more simple --

practicality of it.  I don't think you can give me a 
case that is going to be hard for me as a district judge 
to decide because I'm going to ask you, the Government, 
to tell me if anything went on here that might have been 
within the scope of employment.  And I look at what 
you're saying; if you say no, if you say no you can't 
defend it.  If you say yes, you can defend it and that's 
going to be the end of it as long as your view is based 
on a reasonable reading of the record.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, I don't think 

that that could be the end of it.  As Justice Ginsburg 
pointed out, reality is much murkier than the black or 
white and even in the hypothetical that Your Honor 
poses, it is quite possible that as the case progresses, 
the plaintiff is going to attempt to introduce evidence 
that is much more ambiguous as to whether the employee 
was acting within the scope or not.

 If I could use a simple example of assault. 

If the, if a supervisor is dressing down her employee 
for, for inadequate work, the employee then sues the 
supervisor alleging that she assaulted her, shaking her 
fist right under her nose, threatening harm to her. 
Even if that would be outside the scope of employment, 
the employee might say -- the supervisor rather might 
say, I never raised my hand at all.  I raised my voice

certainly but I never raised my hand.  A third party 
witness may say well I saw the supervisor wag her finger 
at the employee but not in a threatening fashion.  Now --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And as long as a jury could 

find that there is a view of the record such that the 
plaintiff might prove something wrong that it was within 
the scope of employment, such as finger wagging that 
hits her forehead, for example, you can defend it. 
What's the problem?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, if the 

employee --

JUSTICE BREYER:  The only problem is if you 

admit that you can't prove anything like that.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  If the employee was 

acting within the scope of the employment when she 
wagged a finger, then a fortiori she was acting within 
the scope of her employment when she didn't raise her 
hand at all.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, not a fortiori, for the 
reason that Congress wrote this statute not to give the 
defendant the right to call in the Government to defend 
him no matter what he did.  The reason that Congress 
wrote the statute was to repeal the Westfall case, which 
was a question of the scope of immunity, which was the 
question of the scope of Government responsibility to

take away that limited determination in Westfall.  That 
was the only point.  Congress could have written a 
statute the way.  What's your response to that?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  But Congress made, 
established an absolute immunity where the employee was 
acting within the scope of employment, and Petitioner 
agrees that scope of employment is the essential 
question for immunity.  So if in my hypothetical the 
supervisor was acting within the scope of her employment 
when she dressed down, raising her voice but not raising 
her fist, her, her subordinate, then she is protected by 
the Westfall Act from a claim arising out of the context 
of that employment.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But what happens in a 

case where the certification is clearly wrong?  I mean, 
you get into a fight with your neighbor.  It's got 
nothing to do with your employment at all but the 
Attorney General certifies that it does.  You know: 
"They are always thinking about your cases.  You must 
have been thinking about it at the time."  That 
certification goes into the district court.  The 
district court looks at it and says this is ridiculous, 
throws it out, then that State law assault case proceeds 
in Federal court?

Congress enacted the Westfall Act against the 
presumption of regularity of Federal officials and that 
is of course what this Court has often said as well, and 
so I don't think we should construe the statute on the 
presumption that the Attorney General would, would 
certify ridiculous cases.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well what about the, 

Lamagno, where the question was, was the employee 
working within the scope of his employment or was he off 
on a frolic of his own?  I think that's the kind of 
question that the Chief Justice put to you.  The 
certification, if it were wrong, the Attorney General 
said what he was doing was within the scope of 
employment and turned out he was on a drunken binge with 
his friends and they got in his car and killed someone. 
If that certification within the scope was wrong and 
instead he is on a frolic of his own, then the United 
States isn't substituted.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That's right.  That 
would mean that the district court did not on the merits 
ultimately uphold the defense of immunity, but as the 
Court said in Mesa, the merits of the immunity defense 
have nothing whatsoever to do with the question of 
jurisdiction.

was about, was the certification reviewable?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That's right. 

Lamagno was about whether the certification was 
reviewable.  Your Honor is also correct about the facts 
of that case.  One of the points of dispute between the 
Government and the plaintiffs there was whether 
Mr. Lamagno was drunk at the time of the accident, and, 
and the Attorney General certified on his understanding 
that Mr. Lamagno was not drunk.  And that was upheld by 
the district court on remand after some discovery and 
summary judgment type litigation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the Court said that 

that could be reviewed.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That's right.  It 

can be reviewed and the Attorney General's certification 
is not conclusive for purposes of the substitution.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Right.
 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  It is conclusive 

for purposes of the court's removal jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What does that mean?  Does 
that mean that if the district court finds that in fact 
the defendant was not acting within the scope of his 
employment, the United States is eliminated as the 
defendant and the individual employee is resubstituted?

That's what happened.  But, and in that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where, where does that come 

from?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, the procedure 
for what happens upon the district court's review is not 
spelled out in the Westfall Act, neither is the review 
itself in particular.  But the, the employee --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe the United States 

should remain the party defendant and the United States 
should pay which would be the, you know, the price of 
the Attorney General's certification.  He should be 
careful what he certifies.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, the uniform 

view of the lower courts is that when the certification is 
overturned, the effect is to resubstitute the employee 
as the defendant and it proceeds in Federal court as a 
pendent claim.  The Attorney General's assertion of the 
defense of immunity which we presume to be colorable 
because we presume regularity by the Attorney General, 
confers article III jurisdiction on the courts, even 
though it may ultimately on the merits be rejected. 
This Court held in the Carnegie-Mellon case that the 
district courts have discretion whether to exercise 
jurisdiction over pendent claims once the Federal 
question has been resolved.  If the courts have

discretion to exercise that pendent jurisdiction, then 
certainly Congress can instruct them to exercise that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, they wouldn't 

have discretion in that case, though, because the 
statute says the Attorney General's certification is 
conclusive for purposes of removal.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That's right. 

Congress has removed the discretion in this class of 
cases and says that the courts must retain jurisdiction.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought maybe your 
answer, one alternative answer, would have been that you 
can't remand the case but you can still dismiss it.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, the, perhaps, 

perhaps that's so.  Certainly Carnegie-Mellon --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It would still be 

conclusive for purposes of removal, but it doesn't mean 
it's conclusive for purposes of subject matter 
jurisdiction.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  By its text, the 

statute speaks to removal and that the Attorney 
General's certification is conclusive for purposes of 
removal.  But I think --

for purposes of removal jurisdiction, but still leave

grounds that, although it had removal jurisdiction, in 
fact the premise of that removal jurisdiction was wrong, 
and it would therefore remand, in effect, because the 
only claim it had before it was the equivalent of a 
pendent claim.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  But the -- as the 

Court held in Carnegie-Mellon, a remand of pendent claims 
after the Federal issue has been resolved is not a 
remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction within 
the meaning of 1447(c).  Rather, it is a discretionary 
remand under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, and 
so --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  In that case it would be 

reviewable.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  And it would be 

reviewable.  That's why -- that's one of the reasons why 
the district court's order here is reviewable, because 
it is not an order of remand authorized by 1447(c) 
because, first of all, Congress has instructed the 
courts that they are not to remand.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's, that's what the 

district court said it was, though, isn't it?  Didn't it 
-- wasn't the district court remanding for lack of 
jurisdiction?

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you want us to review 
the, the assertion of the district court that it was 
remanding for, I mean that would mean every case would, 
would be reviewable.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  No, Your Honor, 
because here the Court need not go beyond the face of 
the district court's order to understand what it was 
doing.  The court exercised jurisdiction over the 
Federal question that was properly brought before it by 
the Attorney General's certification and this Court's 
decision in Lamagno.  After resolving that, the district 
court said, having concluded that the United States is 
not a proper party to this case, the court must now 
determine whether or not it has jurisdiction, and it 
also said that the absence of the U.S. as a party to the 
case destroys the court's jurisdiction.  So it's evident 
that the court understood that it had jurisdiction and 
that it was a subsequent event that deprived it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me go back to the 

Chief Justice's hypo a little earlier.  Could the 
district judge at that point dismiss the case without 
prejudice to refiling in the State court?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  I don't think that 
that would be consistent with Congress's intent.  The --

Official 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  It would be consistent 
with the court having jurisdiction to dispose of the 
case.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That is true.  But 
I think that the intent of Congress was the same as this 
Court, all the members of this Court, recognized in 
Lamagno.  In Lamagno, even the dissenters, the 
plurality, all acknowledged what Congress intended by 
the "conclusive for purposes of removal" language was to 
prevent the shuttling back and forth of the case.  Once 
it was removed, it was to stay in Federal court.  That 
was what Congress intended.  And one reason --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then it's more than 
pendent jurisdiction, because pendent jurisdiction 
leaves it up to the Federal court to either retain the 
State claim or send it back.  So this is -- what you're 
suggesting is something other than pendent jurisdiction.
 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That's right.  By 
pendent jurisdiction what, what I meant to convey was 
that it is within the Court's article III jurisdiction 
to exercise jurisdiction over the State law claims that 
were pendent to a Federal claim.  Under this Court's 
judicially developed doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, 
that is discretionary with the court.  But if it is

discretionary with the court, then certainly Congress 
can mandate that the court exercise that jurisdiction 
and that it would be consistent with article III.

 But another reason why Congress would have 
wanted the case to remain in Federal court even if the 
certification is overturned is, as we've alluded to 
before, the development of the case subsequent to the 
certification substitution decision may, may illustrate 
that the plaintiff's claim does indeed assert facts that 
were within the scope of employment.  The court would at 
the very --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the 

jurisdiction wouldn't depend on that.  Justice Ginsburg's 
point that there's more than pendent jurisdiction here I 
take it is because these are not separate State claims 
appended to what you thought was a Federal claim.  This 
is the same claim that you initially thought was a 
Federal claim and then it turned into a purely State law 
claim, and that may be analyzed quite differently for 
purposes of jurisdiction.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  No.  The case is I 

think not distinguishable from removals under the 
Federal Officer Removal statute, where Congress has 
indicated that it is the Federal defense that confers 
jurisdiction rather than the Federal claim.  Then, the

ultimate merits of the Federal defense are irrelevant to 
the jurisdictional issue.  And the Court --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  So you're saying there are 
two claims, one claim is raised by the defense, and if 
you look at that claim which is by definition Federal, 
then it's fair to look at the original State claim by 
analogy as a pendent claim?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is that fair?
 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What happens if the 

Attorney General doesn't certify and it goes to State 
court?  I take it one of the concerns we have here is 
that there will be a deprivation of jury trial if the 
certification is wrong and if it's in Federal court. 
Suppose that there is a denial of certification.  Then 
under (d)(3) --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  (D)(3).
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- the employee can ask 

for a certification decision.  I take it that's a 
Federal law defense that the, or a Federal law 
point, that the State court must hear and so now we're 
back in State court?

jury trial and if that's so I'm not sure if that helps 
you or helps the Petitioner.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, I think that 

Your Honor's point illustrates that this issue of Federal 
law is one that Congress has mandated be resolved at the 
outset by the judge, and if the employee petitions for 
certification over the Attorney General's objection the 
statute allows the Attorney General to remove the 
petition to Federal court and the statute states that 
the district court shall find and certify whether the 
employee was acting within the scope.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in my case I guess I 

don't think it ever gets to district court because 
there's no certification, but then the employee can ask 
the State court to have a bench trial on the scope of 
employment.  Am I right about that?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  He can, you are 
correct.  It is at the option of the Attorney General 
under (d)(3) to remove the case at that point so that 
the review of his noncertification happens in Federal 
court.  (D)(3), in stark contrast to (d)(2), provides 
that if the district court holds that the Attorney 
General was correct that the employee was not acting 
within the scope the case is to be remanded to State 
court.  So the presence of the remand --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But my point is I suppose 
the Government can just say, we're not going to make the 
certification and we're not going to remove.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So then the State court 

still has to have the bench trial on the scope of 
employment.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That's right.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm not sure if that helps. 

It seems to me that might be an argument for limiting 
the inquiry just so that we can avoid having bench 
trials in almost every case.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  The -- I think what 

that illustrates is that Congress wanted the issue of 
immunity resolved at the outset of the case by the 
court.  And one reason that that is so essential under 
the Westfall Act FTCA scheme is that if the immunity --
if the scope of employment issue is resolved in favor of 
the employee, that has many, many consequences, 
including that the United States is the proper 
defendant, exclusive jurisdiction lies in the Federal 
court, the case must be dismissed until an 
administrative claim is filed and that avenue is 
exhausted.

defenses come into play depending on how the scope of 
employment issue is resolved.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Right, but that's the 

strongest argument I thought the other way initially, 
that suppose the issue is whether he is on a frolic of 
his own.  That you resolve in a bench trial.  If the 
answer he was, okay, it stays in the Federal court 
anyway.  I understand that.

 But if you're going to take your position 
whether, say, it's a sexual assault as it was in Wood 
and the question is well, was there a sexual assault or 
not, and if there was it's clearly outside of the scope 
of employment, well, then you're going to have all these 
things resolved in a bench trial and actually it's 
supposed to normally be before a jury, for example.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that so?  If the 

employee is resubstituted, it's going on now, the United 
States is not a party, just the Federal employee, but 
it's staying in Federal court under this pendent 
jurisdiction-like theory, wouldn't either party be 
entitled to a jury trial?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Yes.  Yes, Your 

Honor.  I think Justice Breyer's question, though, had 
to do with the procedure at the certification review 
stage.  That is to be done by the district court sitting

without jury and that's because under the statute the 
Attorney General's certification has the legal effect of 
making the United States the defendant.  The United 
States -- the action shall be deemed an action against 
the United States and the United States shall be 
substituted, and that is true unless and until the 
certification is overturned.  And there is of course no 
Seventh Amendment right to jury trial against the United 
States.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  No, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And wouldn't that destroy 

the whole purpose of 1447(d), which is to stop this 
ping-pong?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  No, Your Honor, I 

think not.  And we have two arguments that both the 
issues, substitution and remand, are appealable.  One is 
a very specific one and that is that Congress has 
categorically taken this kind of remand outside the 
court's authority under 1447(c) by specifically 
prohibiting remand at all in 2679(d)(2), and that 
argument of course would not have relevance, I don't 
think, much beyond this case.  And this Court has 
recognized that Congress can exempt a certain class of 
orders from the scope of 47(c) and (d) without 
cross-referencing those provisions.  In the Rice case, 
the Court said that that specific removal provision did 
not purport to impair or restrict the application of the 
then equivalents of 747(c) and (d).  But clearly 
2679(d)(2) does purport to impair the authority to 
remand by making the certification conclusive for 
purposes of removal.  So with that as our narrowest 
argument --

that our opinions show that even an erroneous remand is

nonetheless governed by 1447(d).  There are a lot of 
erroneous remands and this would just be, just be 
another one.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  But when Congress 

specifically prohibited the courts from remanding a case 
under 2679(d)(2) it certainly did not mean to protect a 
court that ignored that mandate from review.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't the problem, and 

maybe I'm missing, and I may be missing something here, 
but isn't the problem with your argument is that the 
statute didn't come out and say you can't remand.  The 
statute said, for purposes of removal, the certification 
is conclusive, and that allows for the kind of dichotomy 
that you and I were talking with before.  A court can 
say look, I know that I have article III jurisdiction 
here, but in point of fact I am, I am remanding because 
what you and I are calling here the pendent claim does 
not support any of the Government's theory.  If that's 
the case, then under 1447(d), there could be a review of 
it because it was not a jurisdictional ruling.  But if 
on the contrary, the judge said, as I think the judge 
said here, I am remanding because based on this 
analysis, I do not have jurisdiction, i.e., the judge 
went against the statute saying that jurisdiction is 
conclusive.  That is an erroneous jurisdictional ruling,

and as Justice Scalia said, we have said over and over 
again, however erroneous it may be, it is not 
reviewable.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  If I may, Your 
Honor?  I think, two things:  One, that there is a 
difference between Congress categorically prohibiting a 
certain kind of remand, and saying that a remand was 
simply erroneous.  And secondly, that that argument 
would not go to our argument that under Waco, at the 
very least, the order on substitution is appealable, 
because it is separate and independent from remand.

Congress knows how to make an exception to section 
1447(d).  All of the examples cited by the Court in 
Kircher, and by the Government in its brief, 
specifically referred, used the terms appeal and remand. 
The statute here contains neither of those terms.

where the district court did not even purport to be 
relying on one of the grounds enumerated in section 
1447(c), namely lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  In 
this case, of course, the district court explicitly 
cited both that statute and used the term subject matter 
jurisdiction, and the Government itself is, is not 
willing to go behind that.  On the merits, the 
Government has argued this morning that the Westfall Act 
provides a Federal forum to assert a Federal defense of 
immunity. 
The Government has analogized this statute 
to section 1442(a), which allows the assertion of a 
colorable Federal defense, but the defense of, he didn't 
do it, it never happened, is not a Federal defense.  It 
is not a defense of immunity.

 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about the defense of, 

I was on the job and everything I did on the job was 
within the scope of my employment?

 MR. GRANT:  In certain cases, Your Honor, 
that could be a defense of immunity, but in a class of 
cases identified by Justice Breyer, there will be an 
admission.  There has to be an admission under the facts 
and the law, that even if the alleged acts occurred, it 
was outside the scope of employment.  In that case, the 
defense is purely a merits defense.  And I think for 
this Court to say otherwise in this case would require

overruling, or being contradictory to over 20 years of 
official immunity jurisprudence, where the Court has 
consistently distinguished between immunity defenses and 
defenses on the merits, where certainly the lower courts 
have taken that conceptual distinction and said a 
defense that the alleged acts did not occur do not raise 
an immunity defense.  And so, the assertion of a defense 
in that case on the merits is not the assertion of a 
Federal defense.  It is not sufficient to confer Federal 
jurisdiction under article III.  It does not meet the 
definition of a statute, of the statute, which uses the 
phrase "scope of employment" no fewer than seven times. 
There is no indication that Congress in the Westfall Act 
intended to change the normal rules that purely State 
law defenses such as he didn't do it were to be decided 
in a Federal forum.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But then you're left with 
this question Justice Scalia raised.  If it's ambiguous, 
an employee says I did everything within the scope of my 
employment, I did nothing improper.  They allege I did 
something improper.  I didn't.  I was a faithful 
servant.  The negligent employee will be allowed the 
Federal forum, but the one who was a loyal, careful 
employee has to be in the State court.  Does that make 
any sense?

MR. GRANT:  Your Honor, I think that's, with 

respect, a misunderstanding of how the statute works. 
The employee who acts within the scope of his 
employment, whether or not he did the acts alleged, gets 
immunity.  The employee who acts outside of the scope of 
employment --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This is an employee who 

said I never did one thing that was inconsistent with my 
Federal employment.

 MR. GRANT:  That's an employee who should 

win on the merits and will win on the merits.  As 
Justice Kennedy recognized, there are certain 
applications that allow the State court to resolve even 
a Federal defense.  We should trust that State courts 
will resolve State law defenses in a manner fair to 
their own citizens as well.
