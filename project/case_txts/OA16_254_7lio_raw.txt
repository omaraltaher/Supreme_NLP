CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMY GASTON 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GASTON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

At issue in this case is whether The Hague 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Service Convention permits service of process by mail if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State of destination does not object.  Our position 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that such mail service is allowed, and it's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three-part argument. 

 

            

First, purely textual evidence of meaning 

 

 

 

 

 

shows that this reading of the treaty is at least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable. 

            

Second, some additional considerations, 

 

 

 

namely, this Court's decision in Schlunk, as well as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history of events leading up to the treaty, further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confirm that this is a reasonable reading of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Article 10(a). 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, your adversary 

  

 

 

 

basically starts from the proposition that this text is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unambiguous.

MR. GASTON:  Yes. 

  

 

4 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you agree with that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

proposition? 

            

MR. GASTON:  No.  We do not agree the text 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is wholly unambiguous.  We believe the text begins as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very ambiguous.  Looking at Article 10(a), (b), and (c), 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where (a) uses the word "send," (b) and (c) use the word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"effect service."  And instantly, just looking at that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

small area, one says, well, wait, what does "send" mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here?  Does it mean send to serve?  Send for nonservice? 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Send for both purposes?  Is it the same or different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than to effect serve? 

 

 

 

            

And we have a presumption that has been used 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the statutory context the different words are usually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to mean different things.  It's not a irrebuttable 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

presumption, but even that presumption leaves ambiguity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So why do 

  

  

 

 

 

 

you think the drafters used those two different phrases? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What's your best answer? 

 

 

 

            

MR. GASTON:  The -- -- the -- the best --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a practical answer and then there's a -- a legal 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

answer. 

            

The practical answer -- and this involves 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the circumstances leading up to the treaty -- is that

there were three prior treaties dating back to 1896, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

where a French term "addressee" was used in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogous provision, and that, in French, was also not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term of art for "service." 

 

 

 

 

            

There were two other French terms of art for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"service," and the convention used "nova casiam" and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"signif casiam" as terms for service.  And then in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section, which was 6(1) of the earlier treaties, at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least of the 1954 treaty, it used the term "addressee." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And in context, it was very clear that it meant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"service" because there were other references to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"service" later in that section, and it was understood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to mean "service" because the term in French was broad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough to cover "service." 

 

 

 

            

And what happened in 1964, during the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drafting of the treaty adopted in 1965, they had to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prepare, for the first time, an English version of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treaty.  Because they would have two texts, French and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

English, and, as a practical matter, what they did is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they took that language and simplified the article to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which it would be part of, and it lost some of its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it -- is it fair to say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that your first argument, you were talking about the

went a little bit beyond text. 

   

 

 

 

6 

            

Is one of your arguments that maybe "send" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is ambiguous when you look at (a), but when you look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) and (c), you know why they used the word "send" and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so it's not ambiguous -- even though it's ambiguous, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much better interpretation is your interpretation, just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by looking at (a), (b), and (c)? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

argument? 

            

Is that your argument?  Is that your first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GASTON:  No.  The first argument is that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

all -- there -- there is quite a bit of textual evidence 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond (a), (b), and (c) that suggests "send" in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article 10(a) means "serve" --

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right. 

  

 

MR. GASTON:  -- despite a presumption that 

   

  

 

 

 

different words usually mean different things.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that first happens as you draw outward from (a), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b), and (c) to Article 10 as a whole, which has a right 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of objection by a State of destination. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

So states that are party to the treaty can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

object to Article 10(a) or 10(b) or 10(c).  And if 10(a) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means "send" for nonservice purposes, it's basically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, okay, you can send these judicial documents for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unofficial, nonlegal, nonbinding purposes, unless the 

 

 

 

 

 

State of destination objects.

JUSTICE ALITO:  There's a body of law, a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

body of international law regarding the way in which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

treaties should be interpreted, and there are certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rules about the interpretation of treaties.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

treaties are also the law of the United States.  So the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question that you started out answering is a rule for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting laws of the United States. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So what do we do in a situation where there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might be a conflict between these two bodies of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretive standards? 

 

            

MR. GASTON:  And -- and I think, luckily, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

this case I don't think rings up the conflict, because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the only way you remove the ambiguity in a -- in a way 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against Petitioner's position is to take a canon that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

words usually mean different things and make it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

irrebuttable, and that's -- that's not the law under --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under Federal law.  This Court has -- has not applied 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that canon in some situations. 

 

 

 

 

            

And here, you -- you get to a greater 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning by -- and if I could carry out the answer to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the State of destination objecting -- it would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very odd to put in a treaty about service, some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision that -- to allow states to object to the use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of their mails for unofficial purposes. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It -- it really -- I think most people would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

say:  Well, before the treaty I could use the mail for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

unofficial purposes; after the treaty, I ought to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

able to use the mail for unofficial purposes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And even the -- the delegates of members who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have met in the years after the treaty have said:  Yes, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even if a State objects or not, you can certainly use 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the mail for -- for unofficial purposes because that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't affect any sovereign interest of the State. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They don't have a -- a need to object. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

That structural argument, which is part of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal law looking at the structure of treaties, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough, I would -- I would say, by itself to drastically 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reduce the ambiguity here.  And then any remaining 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

nearly textually vanishes when you think about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entire treaty as a whole, which is it's a treaty on 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

service. 

            

The title is the Convention on the Service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

preamble discusses simplifying service, expediting 

 

 

 

 

service, making service more reliable. 

 

 

 

 

            

And in -- in that context, I think the best 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that -- that Respondent can get to is the idea, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, maybe there's still some remaining ambiguity, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it certainly seems that -- that send here is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- a rule of service.  And we have domestic examples

where rules of service, after they've made clear we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about service, they use common verbs of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transmission:  Send, deliver, mail.  In Texas, you can 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

effect service by mailing and so the verb is -- is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

"mail."  In -- in that context, the word "send" in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article 10(a), although this is -- is a legal argument, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is not practically what happened, but -- but send 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a -- is a perfect word for the directness of the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

transmission. 

            

Every other transmission in the treaty 

 

 

 

 

 

requires some sort of intermediary, whether it's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

central authority, a consulate or a diplomatic 

   

   

 

 

individual or channel or a judicial officer in -- in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State of destination.  When you're talking about sending 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

through the mail, serving documents, you send them, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's the only case where you can directly effectuate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service. 

            

The -- the other of -- in terms of -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms of text still, the context of certain other words 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also shows that send is used and meant as service. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There are three channels, other than the central 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority, that are mentioned in the treaty:  Diplomatic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

channels, postal channels and consular channels.  All 

  

 

 

 

 

 

three use the word "channels."  And that's in Articles 9 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and 10.

And then later, in Article 11, it talks about channels 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

of transmission.  And then later in Article 21, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speaks of more generally methods of transmission.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think these are also contextual evidence that all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

channels that have been discussed are service channels.

this Court has said we can consider, at least absent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wholly unambiguous text, is overwhelmingly in support of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the idea that, in fact, at the time of drafting, the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the drafters and those who adopted it at that convention 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended to allow service by mail. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There have been a number 

   

  

 

 

 

of countries that have said:  We don't want you to use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mail.  They have taken that option. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GASTON:  Yes.  I have counted --

    

  

 

 

 

actually, of the 71 countries who have either acceded or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ratified the treaty, nearly half, 30, have expressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their objection to -- to mail by lodging a declaration 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the government of the Netherlands.  And there are a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

handful who have lodged a qualified objection where they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, well, yes, mail is okay, but if you do it this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular way. 

 

            

So, yes, certainly that number indicates 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  And in some cases, such as Canada, in this case

their declaration -- who doesn't object -- specifically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

states, we understand.  We are saying we don't object to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service by mail.  And that's not in every case, but --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but several -- several of the declarations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Have positively said we 

  

 

 

 

 

don't object. 

 

            

MR. GASTON:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If -- if you -- you are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right, does Menon, does she get any chance to defend on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the merits?  Or if she suffered a default judgment, is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it? 

 

            

MR. GASTON:  In -- in general, that is not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it because the convention has two provisions in Articles 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 and 16 that enable a person to -- to potentially void 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a judgment or to extend the time to appeal if certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions are shown.  Whether that could be introduced 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a enforcement proceeding, for example, in Canada, if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the judgment were sought to be enforced, if I were on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other side, I would be trying to argue Articles 15 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and 16 and try and -- and try and show there was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem with the judgment.  But at least in this -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forum State, I think if -- if those articles are not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raised at the default judgment stage or within a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable time after the judgment --

the articles?

MR. GASTON:  Articles 15 and 16. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, what do they say? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GASTON:  So Article 15 precludes the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

entry of a default judgment depending on whether the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

forum State -- and in this case, that's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States -- whether they have opted to go in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first half of Article 15 or the second half of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article 15. 

 

            

            

The first half of Article 15 based --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where does the person 

  

 

 

 

 

get to raise the defense that they didn't actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receive notice? 

 

            

MR. GASTON:  They can certainly raise it in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- in the proceeding where the judgment was entered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within a reasonable time after they got actual notice of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the judgment.  And that's Article 16 specifically.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

have to show they didn't have notice, they have to show 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they had a prima facie defense, and then they could get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief from the finality of it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And if the Court has no further questions, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would reserve the remainder of my time.

FOR UNITED STATES, AMICUS CURIAE, 

 

 

 

 

13 

               

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it please the Court: 

 

 

 

            

Article 10(a) of the Hague Service 

 

 

 

 

 

Convention permits service through postal channels on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

persons abroad if the law of the forum State -- that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State where the case is pending -- authorizes such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service and if the receiving State where the mail will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be delivered hasn't objected to Article 10(a). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I'd like to start with this permit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorize framework, because I think there's been a lot 

   

   

 

 

 

 

of confusion in the lower courts on this subject.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question presented here is perhaps phrased a little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

inartfully in terms of authorization, and it would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really helpful if this Court would clarify this point. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Article 10(a) says that provided the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of destination does not object, the present convention 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shall not interfere with the freedom to send judicial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

documents by postal channels to persons abroad.  So it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not interfering with freedom.  It is -- it's not the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same thing as providing an affirmative authorization for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service by mail.  That affirmative authorization has to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

be found elsewhere.  And the place where you find it is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the law of the forum State.

So, for instance, in our Federal system, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

you look at Rule 4 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a subsection of Rule 4 that says where an 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

international agreement permits, but does not authorize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service on persons abroad, here are a bunch of things 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can do.  And some of those options include service 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by mail, using registered mail by -- sent by the clerk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the court, service by mail if the district court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge in a particular case directs it, and so on. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So that's where you get the authorization. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You have to -- the forum State has to authorize the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service by mail on a person abroad. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

At the other end of the process, you have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see whether the receiving State has objected to service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by mail.  And as my friend indicated, nearly half of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

countries that have acceded to or ratified this treaty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have indeed objected to service by mail.  Some of them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have given a sort of conditional objection that they'll 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

only service by mail if --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

way. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did they --

  

 

 

 

MS. GOLDENBERG:  -- it's done in a certain 

   

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did they make a 

  

 

 

 

 

distinction, any of them, between the initiating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

document, the complaint, as distinguished from documents

later on in the litigation? 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  None of them do, no.  None 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

of the -- the statements that countries have made when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've stated whether they object to Article 10(a) or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not simply state either we object to service by mail or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we don't.  Some of them don't actually use the word 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"service."  Many of them do; more than -- more than half 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of them do.  Some States that have not objected have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also used the word "service" when they've made that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement.  So I think that is an indication -- one of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many indications that other contracting parties to this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convention, like the United States itself, understand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Article 10(a) is about service and not simply about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some kind of informational mailing. 

 

 

 

 

            

So as I said before, we think it would be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

helpful if the Court would clarify the -- the permit, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorize, object framework.  The court of appeals 

  

 

 

 

 

 

decision that we think best captures this is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Brockmeyer decision from the Ninth Circuit, which lays 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this out correctly and also has a very helpful 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussion of how Rule 4 interacts with the treaty. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Beyond that, as my friend said, there are a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot of textual indications here that this is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convention that is about service.  Just to highlight one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he didn't touch on, there's a structural argument,

which is that Articles 8, 9, 10(b), 10(c), 11 are all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about alternative channels for service, and it would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

very odd for this convention to suddenly jump to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that wasn't about service in Article 10(a) and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then jump back again to service in 10(b), 10(c), and 11. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why do you think they used a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different word? 

 

            

MS. GOLDENBERG:  I think my friend correctly 

    

 

 

 

 

gave the reasons, which is there is a historical reason 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and a practical reason.  The historical reason is that I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think they simply carried over the French word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"addresser" from the 1954 civil procedure convention 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that replaced -- that this convention replaced as to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States that were parties to both.  Addresser had been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understood by everyone and it was clear in context to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capture service.  And so I think if you actually compare 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the language of the 1954 treaty and the language of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article 10(a) in French, they are virtually identical. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It was just the drafters carried it over.  And that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the way that people understood it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

On a practical level I do think that "send" 

   

   

 

 

 

 

is just a very natural way to refer to putting something 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the mail, and so it makes sense to use that verb 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there rather than a different verb, especially when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

you're talking about a situation in which the service

can go directly from one party to another. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We think the contrary interpretations really 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

don't work here, but at the very least there's ambiguity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this treaty, and at that point this Court's decisions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are clear; you turn to extrinsic sources of information. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Here, each and every extrinsic source points strongly in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the direction of the interpretation we're espousing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You have the -- the history, and that is the draft 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convention and the contemporaneous understanding of 

 

 

 

 

 

people who were there when it was drafted.  You have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent interpretation of the executive, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to great weight, and here, has been completely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent from the beginning till now.  You have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent interpretation of other contracting parties, 

 

 

 

 

 

which this Court has said are entitled to considerable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

weight, and you also have an expert consensus among 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scholars and so on. 

 

 

 

            

So affirming the court below would take us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out of step with the rest of the world.  70 other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

countries are parties to this treaty -- to this treaty, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it could believe an irritant if they think that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're not living up to our obligations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It also would make service more difficult 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for U.S. plaintiffs who are looking to serve defendants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who are abroad.  It would take away from them the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

ability to use the mails in situations where they might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be trying to serve someone in a country where the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

central authority is slow or expensive.  And so for all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those reasons, we think that the Court should reverse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

the judgment below. 

 

 

            

            

If the Court has no further questions.

Before I get into the -- into the thrust of

opponent's brief, Bruno Ristau, he's -- he's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acknowledged expert in this whole area of -- of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extrajudicial service.  In his two-volume treatise, 

  

 

 

 

 

he -- he says -- he goes through all this talk, all this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis about all these different cases that -- on this

it's a mistake.  It was -- I call it -- I call this case

the case of Bartleby, the Scrivener, because it turns on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

this mistake that the lead scholar says that is out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there. 

            

And so if -- if you look at the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obvious section of the treaty on page 8 of the Joint 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix, under the mistake --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I think that 

    

   

 

 

leading scholar -- maybe I'm wrong, but I thought I read 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it, thought that it -- that it may have been the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scrivener's mistake, but the intent was clearly to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect service by the --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  It clearly comes down on -- on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their side of the camp.  That -- that's undoubtedly. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So this leading scholar 

  

 

 

 

 

calls it a misuse of words, but that the intent was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear in -- for all the reasons everyone else is giving? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  Exactly.  And it also uses a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

similar analysis that the dissenting opinion in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas Court of Appeals said.  Basically, you look at all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these other things out there beyond the text to -- to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come up --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why is this clear? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Your adversary says isn't the lack of clarity inherent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the question; what do they mean by "send"?  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't define "send."  They don't define "service."  So 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

doesn't that automatically create an ambiguity?  And why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

isn't the ambiguity approached the way the other side 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says? 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  Okay.  First of all, I do not 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

think that there is an ambiguity in -- in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular point that we're all here talking about.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I -- and I say that for the reasons that were cited 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically in the Fifth Circuit opinion, but that whereas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you take the words to "effect service" -- or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually, "effect service of" -- and substitute those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for "send," then -- then it is crystal clear for them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So then if you use the -- I don't really 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it's a canon.  I think it's more of a rule of 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

usage, that if I alter the -- the word that I'm using 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throughout a document for something else, well, then I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

just trying to alter the -- the message that I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sending. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it a convention on the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

service of documents?  It's not a convention about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

sending documents, but it's a convention -- everything 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in this convention relates to service, and the whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of it was to facilitate international 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cooperation in litigation. 

 

 

            

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  No doubt about it. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And so just -- just as

in -- in this case, the service is sought to be made in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Canada, there will be cases where courts abroad want to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serve somebody in the United States.  The whole purpose 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

of this was to make it easier to conduct litigation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international -- to facilitate international cooperation 

 

 

 

 

 

in litigation. 

 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  No doubt about it.  And I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

would -- and I would suggest that sending documents 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are -- okay.  The -- the question -- the follow-up 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question from what you're saying, Your Honor, would be, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, what -- what -- does it mean just service of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

initiating documents, service of process, or service of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any judicial documents? 

 

 

            

Now, if you -- the -- the first part of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treaty talks about service of -- of judicial documents. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And so it would seem to me logical to include within a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treaty that's focusing on service of documents 

 

 

 

 

 

 

internationally, also service of documents after service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of process.  And so from my perspective -- and I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm a fairly reasonable man -- so from the reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person's perspective, you would think that it -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you would include service of other types of documents 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

within a service of process treaty. 

   

 

 

 

            

And now also there's a really important 

   

 

 

 

 

extrajudicial -- and I'm -- I'm going to jump into

some extra text --

 

 

 

22 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm -- I'm not grasping 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what you mean by "process."  It's on the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convention is on the service of documents. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  Yes.  Judicial documents. 

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.  And so is the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

notion of process the way we think about it in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States, a process server?  That's not universal, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is it?  I mean, a lot of civil law countries don't have 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the notion of tagging -- having a process server tag the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant. 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  Right.  Okay.  The -- the 

  

  

  

 

 

 

history -- okay.  I do want to jump into some extra 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

textual information which specifically addresses that 

 

 

 

 

 

and a lot of other things. 

   

 

 

 

            

Okay.  So the history of this -- of this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treaty was -- was such that they weren't -- they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really trying to kill this French method of service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- in France, "nova de cashiano" -- I don't speak 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

French, so -- but the Schlunk case talks all about it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and the problem there was that an official in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

France, once you give the citation, the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certificate or citation or summons, to the official 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, that is service.  And so -- so defaults were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being entered against parties that never actually got

notice. 

            

And so then -- then the United States had --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had passed a -- had passed Public Law 88-619 in 1964, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

whereby we allowed foreign countries to come here and to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

easily effectuate foreign service by going to a district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge and getting an order signed to serve, say, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

French or Ugandan or wherever, a -- a summons on -- on 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an American -- or whatever person is in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States.  So they could get judicial assistance 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the United States very easily. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Okay.  So within the context of that act, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

then the United States went -- sent their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representatives to The Hague to start getting engaged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with this -- this Hague Conference to normalize 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international laws.  And -- and so the motive was to get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other countries to make it easy for our citizens to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serve overseas and also to -- to push forward due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process, okay. 

 

            

And so then the -- when the drafters, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they -- they got this -- this convention prepared, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they came to the -- the Senate committee, and then the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lead spokesman at that Senate committee was asked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically -- and I have the page here -- I don't have 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it handy, but basically the -- the spokesperson for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- for America told the Senate -- the senators --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

that the only thing America is giving up is the same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing that we had already given in that Federal act that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

I just mentioned.  And that Federal act doesn't have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything in it about -- about mail. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So -- so the actual lawmakers of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States that signed off on this treaty were told 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the people that participated in the -- in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convention drafting that -- that we're going to -- it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't all about service, like you were saying, Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  It was either -- it was, in large part, about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

due process.  And the only thing that we're giving up is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same thing that we gave up in -- in this Federal act 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that I'm talking about. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I'm sorry.  Did we 

  

  

 

 

 

 

give up or do you think they thought we were giving up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the right to authorize States to permit service by mail? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  Service by mail was --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or your position is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

is that we did; that in the treaty, we intended, by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

signing the treaty, to give up the power of States to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorize the service by mail? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  Service by mail was actually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not talked about in the Senate hearings.  There was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one --

Alderson Reporting Company

think it's a fair reading of a treaty for us to read it 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

to constrict the rights of States to effect service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent with due process?  Because there's no doubt 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we consider mail service consistent with due 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process. 

            

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  Okay --

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The United States 

  

 

 

 

authorize it, right? 

 

 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  Well, the -- under --

  

 

 

 

 

 

according to Brockmeyer, the case -- the -- the position 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Solicitor General wants the Court to adopt, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual holding in that case was that the Article 10(a) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does -- does not authorize service by mail.  It permits 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it --

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right. 

  

 

 

MR. HOOTMAN:  -- meaning, you've got to look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the local law --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I accept that.  But 

    

   

  

 

 

many states permit service by mail, correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  Well, Texas doesn't, according 

  

 

 

 

 

to the majority opinion in this case, because all four 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of my points were sustained in the -- in the lower 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  And one of those points was specifically whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or not Texas authorizes service by mail.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But -- take Rule -- Rule 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

4(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorizes service, as in the courts of the State where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the district court is located.  And I think Justice 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor is referring to some States -- not Texas --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but some States do authorize service of the summons and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint by mail. 

 

 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  I'm sure some States somewhere 

  

 

 

 

 

 

do.  They -- they could theoretically, let's put it that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way.  And so then you -- then you -- then you're with --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up to the question of -- okay, let me -- let me put this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way. 

            

In Brockmeyer, the Court said that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treaty does not authorize it, but Rule 4(f) of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows it in some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances; namely, when the clerk sends it.  So the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clerk can mail the -- the process, but the party can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and, therefore, I win in my case. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Now, in this -- in my case, the Texas -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas Court of Appeals, the majority opinion actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sustained all four of my issues that were raised in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- in the court of appeals.  And one of those was --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and by the way, the -- the dissent said I waived that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one issue, but -- but the majority of that panel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sustained it, which -- and that issue was whether or not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

27 

Texas law authorizes service by mail. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So if the Brockmeyer logic were to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted by this Court, you would basically say, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes, the -- the treaty permits it, permits it being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service by mail, if the local law allows it.  And so, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes, it's permitted, but the Texas court has already 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ruled on it and, therefore, a decision -- the lower 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court's ruling is affirmed. 

 

 

 

            

So -- so even if you go this -- this route 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of it's not authorized, but it's permitted, you still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to affirm the -- the Texas judgment because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority said that --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, if it's -- if it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

permitted under a Federal treaty, then how can Texas not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permit it? 

 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  Because unless -- that took me 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a long time to figure that distinction out.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically, the question is -- and the question of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service was granted on is whether or not the treaty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorizes service by mail.  That means the treaty 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

itself says you can serve pursuant to the treaty by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sending it in the mail versus the Brockmeyer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction, which is that the treaty doesn't say that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you serve by mail pursuant to the treaty, rather, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the treaty allows the other States or the Federal

government to pass a rule so that the local law, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

local United States law allows service by mail.  Okay. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

So then Brockmeyer says work through that and said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, yes, Rule -- Rule 4(f) permits it, but only if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clerk sends it.  And since the clerk in that case didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

send it, the default was set aside. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so -- then then you take that line of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thinking and apply it to my case and you say, okay, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, no, the treaty doesn't authorize it, because we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follow the Brockmeyer line of thinking, but it does 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permit it if Texas law allows it.  Well, a Texas court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already passed on it and said -- in the majority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion, because they sustained my four issues, Texas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law does not authorize service by mail. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I thought --

    

  

 

 

 

I thought I had read this and I'm looking at it.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blue brief at page 9 says, "Under Texas law, a plaintiff 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

can serve a foreign defendant in several ways, including 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

by certified mail return receipt requested, either by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sending it to any defendant directly, or if certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions are met, by sending it to the Secretary of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State, by complying with the provisions of any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable treaty, and if certain other conditions are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

met by other court-ordered means." 

 

 

 

 

            

So -- and there's a citation to the two

sections of the Texas Civil Procedure Act.  So it seems 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to me that Texas law, on its face, authorizes service by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other court-ordered means.  So why was the service here 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineffective under Texas law? 

 

 

 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  Right.  It's rule -- Texas 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Rule of Civil Procedure 108(a).  It's entitled service 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of process in foreign countries. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right. 

  

 

MR. HOOTMAN:  Right.  And it -- and it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

provided -- it has all this stuff that can happen. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Basically, there's about -- there's six different ways 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it can occur. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why wasn't the 

  

 

 

 

 

service here pursuant to one of those authorized Texas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways? 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  Well, the short answer is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because the Texas court said it wasn't the proper way to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do it.  Now, I think the more sophisticated response to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would be similar to the Brockmeyer holding, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which -- which is because it was sent by -- I walked 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down -- I walked down to the post office and dropped a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

summons in the mail and send it to Uganda or wherever to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serve somebody, the Texas court said you can't do that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, in the Brockmeyer case, the specific

reason was is because the clerk didn't do that.  Now, if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

the clerk -- I -- I send a request to the -- to the 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clerk and I say, hey, please send this -- this summons 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to Uganda and they drop it in the mail, that would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate under -- under the Ninth Circuit case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Okay?  But the -- but the point here is that -- that if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you follow the Brockmeyer line of thinking, you have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to -- service by mail is proper, if our local 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authority allows it.  And in our case, the majority 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion sustained all four points, and one of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points was that Texas law doesn't allow it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And -- and also, you know, the technical --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I don't mean to be overly technical, but we didn't --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you didn't grant cert on the question of whether or not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Texas law allows it.  We -- we granted on whether or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not the treaty authorizes it. 

 

 

 

 

            

And so I've got that holding from the Texas 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court on the Texas law.  I think that's dispositive, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

assuming you get to that.  And the only way you get to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is if you say that the treaty -- if you say that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the treaty authorizes service by mail, you don't even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get into that can of worms, because the treaty itself is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the vehicle through which you're serving process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Okay? 

            

If you follow the Brockmeyer line of

thinking, you say, well, no, the treaty doesn't

Texas majority holding which has already ruled on that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question.  And --

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think it's a problem 

   

  

 

 

 

 

for your position that no other court in the world has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construed the treaty this way? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  That's clearly a problem. 

   

  

 

 

That's why I focused so hard on text. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  I mean -- I mean --

    

   

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Someone's got to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

first, right? 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  Then that now -- that is why I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cited to -- I forgot what they call it, but it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically the -- the restatement of law in Europe. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's why I cited to that, to see what their mindset 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is.  And I don't know if you recall that quote in my 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, but basically, they will look at a document when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're interpreting it, if it says X, but -- but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everyone's intent was Y, they go with Y.  And that's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that just runs train -- a steam train roller over our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separation of powers concept. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, this goes back to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

Justice Alito's question.  I mean, is that -- is that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

your answer to it, that it's just they're all construing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this because he -- they use a completely different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretive stance than we do? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  No doubt about it.  It's a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

whole different mindset.  They -- they're looking at the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subjectivity of what everybody wanted.  And here, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because of our separation of powers, who's the law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maker, that's why I go off in the area and all that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other really interesting stuff, and I think it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

actually crucial here because --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, one question I suppose 

   

  

 

 

 

might be whether that is in fact producing the disparity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- in judgments.  But even suppose you're right that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is, I mean, these are treaties.  So the idea that, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, we would be consistently interpreting a treaty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently from the entire rest of the world would seem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to create problems for our treaty-making powers, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our -- our ability to conform with what our treaty 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

partners expect.  I mean, it would be -- be sort of a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem for international relations, wouldn't it?  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we're like, well, we just interpret everything that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

write differently from the way everybody else in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world does.

want to be -- come across as, you know, arrogant four 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of thinking. 

 

 

            

Okay.  We do have also to respect the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution.  Who -- who passes these laws?  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

lawmakers. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You are taking a 

  

 

 

 

 

statement from a -- it's not exactly restatement; it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort of this European project written by a law professor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Denmark.  And you're saying that's how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

all Europeans -- they don't -- you don't think that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the same debates that we have on the extent to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which you go beyond the text?  You think they all agree 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the way you interpret text and it's all that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Orlando said is -- that's true, generally?  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you find it -- they have the same debates that we do. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  I'm definitely no European 

  

 

 

 

 

legal scholar, by any means, but I do -- I do believe 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that cite that I gave, I did some research to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see how respected it was, and I believe -- maybe I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong on that, but I think it's on par with our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restatement. 

            

Do they -- do they do what we do here? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Well, if you look at the Vienna Convention --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And someone brought that up, by the way.

The Vienna Convention says how you're supposed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

interpret treaties. They actually do the opposite of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, that quote that -- that you're -- that I gave you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and now you're giving back to me.  And they focus hard 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on text, just like I'm urging the Court to do under our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separation of powers doctrine. 

 

 

 

            

So I surmise that -- that a fair amount of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

them do look at that -- that section, but then a whole 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot of 'em others also surely look at the Vienna 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Convention, because they're the ones that most of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

European countries, if not all of them, have actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

signed off on it.  And the United States has not. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But it is -- it is a codification of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

customary international law.  And, therefore, you know, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if -- depending on how much emphasis we put on customary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

international law, we're going to look at the Vienna 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Convention to help us interpret a treaty, assuming you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

get beyond the text like I've urged the Court in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first half of my brief. 

 

 

 

 

            

So in answer to your question --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The -- the source that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you cite is not talking about the interpretation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes; it's talking about the interpretation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

private contracts between two individuals. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  That's primarily the -- yes, I

35 

cite to that as, oh, look here, here's my number one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cite at all.  I was just trying to give a perspective 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

on, hey, look, I do have all these international cases 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against me, but let's look at their mindset a little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bit. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, one of the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, if you are talking about -- and I think this is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a distinction between statutes and treaties.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

visualize treaties, anyway, as close to -- to contracts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And if you're talking about contracts, it's very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important to -- what the conduct and expectations of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties were as they went into the contract, and it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant evidence of sort of how they dealt with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situations after the contract, somewhat unlike how you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might interpret a statute. 

   

 

            

MR. HOOTMAN:  I have a real problem -- and I 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

realize the cases make this analogy to contracts -- but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I have a real problem with that analogy, because it --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it doesn't factor in the -- the Constitution.  We -- we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopt a treaty and make it a Federal law, just like a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal statute, except it's done through the President 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and et cetera. 

 

 

            

And so it's really not -- yes, it's like a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract, but, no, it's not.  Because this Court has to

apply the Constitution to it.  And so here, you -- if --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have the drafters and then the nice Bartleby's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

error, the scrivener's error -- and by the way, this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court has written on when there's a scrivener's error, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're not going to just fix it, because that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legislating.  Unless -- unless the error has -- has, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, a ridiculous -- the absurdity doctrine and it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

got a -- so under -- under you-all's kind of authority, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can't just fix the scrivener's error. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so the scholar, Mr. Ristau, I thought, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

did me a great favor by, yes, he went page after page 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that I lose, I lose, it's okay.  But then he says it's a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scrivener's error.  So then when you apply the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

separation of powers doctrine principles to that, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't just fix it because there's a logical reason to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include service of -- service of process-type documents. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because it makes perfect -- to me, it makes perfectly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good sense.  It make -- it doesn't -- it doesn't make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense to me to not include that in there. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so if you use the -- the canon of -- you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

call it canon or a method of usage, and -- and different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word -- there's a different meaning, if you can see the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different meaning, you don't -- you don't have an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguous situation here.  And so you are bound by the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution to interpret the words of the -- of the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

of the treaty and say:  Well, it's not authorized. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37 

            

            

So that's kind of how I analyze it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

And then -- and then I really want -- this, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to me, is a really big point, and I haven't articulated 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it well, but the Solicitor General cited to the Senate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Record where the -- the international guys that went 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over to the Hague and brought this beautiful treaty that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they put a whole lot of work into with the history of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- this Federal statute that I'm talking about, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everyone wanted to start cooperating. 

 

 

 

 

            

Then they get before the Senate testifying, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and one of the senators is asking something like, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what do we get out of this?  And -- and -- and he's got 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this section in there, it's -- it's on -- it's on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 24 and 25, he's the U.S. delegate, Philip Amram, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and he said due process and also we are giving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing we had not already given in -- in Public Law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

88619. 

            

So the senators that actually signed off on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this, that's what they heard.  And you got to understand 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that -- it's so important, I put it in my little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

book here.  Okay.  That Public Law 88619 was a big deal 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

back then, because America says:  Hey, we're going to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let the foreigners come over here, go to a district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge, request an order to serve, you know, a French

petition or whatever. 

 

 

38 

            

And then after that -- and that was a -- you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, that was politically a big deal.  We open our 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doors and we want them to open their doors to us. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So they go -- they go -- they go prepare 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this treaty, and then they come back and testify to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- to the people that are going to actually make our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law and they tell them that's -- that's what -- what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened.  And now we got this mail thing going on. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So -- so from the lawmakers' perspective, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they didn't actually hear that. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, there is a bar review article that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

same man that testified, Mr. Amram, there's a little 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

section in there, which the Solicitor General cites in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their brief, where they say something like service by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mail.  He -- and I read the article.  It goes on and on 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about this treaty, a little bit mind-numbing.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

it's -- and then he says Article 10(a) service by mail, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a little bitty snippet.  You can see it in the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Senate record.  But it doesn't -- it doesn't -- service 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by mail says the same thing that the treaty says.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't say service of process by mail. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so, to me, it would seem like you don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have an ambiguity here.  There was a change in usage 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that makes perfectly good sense to allow service of

the Bartleby, the scrivener error because of you-all's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

previous cases, Chan v. Korea, in particular. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

            

And -- and then you have the other issue, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is even if you go with this Brockmeyer scenario, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then -- then Texas has already passed on this question, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and Texas law doesn't allow service by the participant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by mail.  And so you got to affirm anyway. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So if there's no further questions, I'll 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turn it over to the other -- other side.

States' position and it points out, actually, an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

ambiguity in the world "authorize," which is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question presented that -- that -- that ambiguity is my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsibility, because "authorized" can mean empower or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it can mean permit.  And in this situation, permit is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the Brockmeyer case reads it as, it's what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States suggests is correct, and we -- we think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is correct because of the ambiguity in the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of what the freedom to do things means. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And -- and I would also alert the Court to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some more specific discussion of that.  The Permanent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bureau of the Hague Conference puts out a handbook every 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so many years, and the 2016 edition, which is the fourth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

edition, at paragraph 257, discusses some extrinsic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence from the 1964 Special Commission discussions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during the drafting, making it clear that it was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two-part test.  If the State doesn't object, State of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

destination, you have to look at the law of the forum 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and see if it affirmatively authorizes it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Moving then to the -- to the contention that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court of appeals here has already ruled that service 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by mail wasn't allowed under Texas law, that's -- that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the result of the holding because the Court held that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the treaty preempts Texas law.  And it -- and it -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if the treaty, in fact, prohibits service of process by

mail, it does preempt Texas law.  And that's what the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41 

this Court in Schlunk said.  It said that the treaty 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- is mandatory and it preempts inconsistent methods 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of service under -- under State or Federal law.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was not a determination that, apart from the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

treaty, service of process here was not consistent with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas law and --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that preemption 

  

 

 

 

 

question before us? 

 

 

            

MR. GASTON:  No.  I would say it has been --

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it has been decided by this Court in -- in Schlunk, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court -- and it cited a prior case --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we're not 

  

 

 

 

 

being asked to rule on that because I gather the Texas 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court of Appeals has a different view on that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GASTON:  I think the Texas Court of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Appeals has the same view, which is that -- that if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treaty prohibits service by mail, the fact that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorized under Texas law is dead letter and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore --

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we were told by the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other side that Texas law -- forget about treaties --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Texas law does not permit service of process by mail 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

period. 

            

MR. GASTON:  And that is nowhere in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

court of appeals decision.  And the Texas State law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

determinations that we -- this Texas State law that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cite at pages 9 and 10 of -- of the blue brief provide 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three or four ways in which service of process by mail 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  If you win in -- this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Article 10, in fact, permits service by mail, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you'll go back to Texas and you'll say, see, it permits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it expressly.  So the rest of the treaty doesn't preempt 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the provision that allows service by mail, so Texas law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no longer prohibits it; is that right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GASTON:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So we should send it back. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It doesn't say that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

at all.  What Article 10 says is whether or not the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convention shall interfere with a particular way.  So 

   

  

 

 

 

 

then you simply say if you're right, okay, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convention doesn't interfere with it, but Texas law can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibit it. 

 

            

MR. GASTON:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Absolutely say it doesn't. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GASTON:  Yes, that is absolutely 

  

 

 

 

 

our position. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the Court of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Appeals said otherwise?

MR. GASTON:  No, the court of appeals held 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

that The Hague Service Convention prohibits service of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process by mail and, therefore, it sustained the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's challenge to the trial court judgment on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the basis that there was no valid service of process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because the service that was effected was prohibited by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Hague Service Convention.  The --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, I'm sorry, you're saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it just never got to this question of what Texas law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says. 

            

            

            

MR. GASTON:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. GASTON:  On our blue brief at 32 and 33, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think it's clear, not only did the negotiator for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States tell the Senate that this treaty involved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service -- allowed service by mail and the Executive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Branch internally relayed that message to the -- to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President, so it's very clear internally that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States Executive Branch understood that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States' intent was that it allowed service by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mail.  Respondent makes a distinction between service of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

process and service of post-answer documents. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I think while one might imagine a treaty 

   

 

 

 

 

that would do that, this treaty doesn't make any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

internal distinctions between judicial documents that 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

are process and other judicial documents with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44 

limited exception of Article 15 that only talks about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting relief from a default judgment with respect to a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

summons not -- not being served.  And so as one lower 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court has said, it would be very odd if Article 10(a) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was about service of every judicial document except 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process, which is what would be required to -- to go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with Respondent's interpretation. 

 

 

            

And unless the Court has any further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions, I would cede the rest of my time. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The case is submitted. 

 

 

 

(Whereupon, at 12:13 p.m., the case in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
