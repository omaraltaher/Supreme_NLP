 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-289, Horne v. Flores and the 
consolidated case.

 Mr. Starr.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. STARR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In January of 2000 the district court in 
Arizona concluded that the Nogales school system had 
failed to provide an equal educational opportunity for 
its English language learners in that particular 
district.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I -- I thought the 

determination was that it had failed to provide funds 
that could reasonably accomplish the -- the -- the plan 
which the district itself had adopted.

 MR. STARR:  Well, Your Honor, the specific 
finding was that there needed to be -- there were very 
elaborate findings here.  There needed in fact to be 
remediation to in fact support a plan, and the State --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  But the district agreed on 

that, I take it.  The district said, you've got to do

something.  This is our plan.

 And I thought the district court then 

said -- the school district did that, and I thought the 
district court then said, well, the -- the funding that 
you have come up with, or the funding scheme you have 
come up with simply is not rationally related to the 
plan that you, yourself, have adopted.  Am I -- am I 
wrong on that?

 MR. STARR:  You are correct.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 MR. STARR:  It needs to be a rational plan. 

But then by the time of the 60(b) hearing, the 
circumstances had dramatically changed.  There had been 
a failure.  But in November of 2000, a sea change 
occurred in educational policy.  The old system in 
Nogales was done away with throughout the State. 
Strategic English Immersion, intense immersion, and the 
results are already being shown.  Nogales --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was the year, Mr. 

Starr, the year of that change to the SEI from the 
bilingual education?  What was the year of that?

 MR. STARR:  The voters voted it in, in 
November of 2000, and it began feathering in very 
promptly as soon as the school districts could in fact 
respond, and Nogales --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And yet the district 
court kept renewing his instruction, provide funding 
that reasonably relates to the cost, many, many times 
after the SEI became effective.  And we -- we have the 
original decree which was, what, a declaratory judgment 
in 2000.  Then he issues a series of order.  None -- and 
none of them are ever appealed.

 MR. STARR:  That is true.  And in fact one 
of the grounds of our submission this morning is that 
the failure to appeal should be in fact a cause for 
concern.  Indeed, 60(b)(5) is all about exceptions to 
finality, especially when we are dealing with a very 
quintessential State and local function, namely, 
education.

 And, thus, the court should have been open 

to consider what the Ninth Circuit had commanded it 
consider, namely the changed circumstances.  And what 
were those changed circumstances?  Nogales was doing 
great.  A new leadership came in.  Superintendent Cooper 
made tremendous reforms.  The State responded, not only 
with a new methodology, but by funding that methodology. 
And, Your Honor, all of this --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Nogales was doing great?  I 
mean, I asked my clerk to go get some figures out of the 
record and she says in 2008 in the sixth grade, just to

take an example, 77 percent of the English learners in 
Nogales failed the tests as compared to 32 percent 
statewide.  In the tenth grade 84 percent failed the 
reading exam compared with 34 percent statewide.  In 
2008 the reading exam fourth graders, 67 percent failed 
in Nogales, the English learners, compared to 30 percent 
statewide.

 Now, I'm sure that progress has been made, 

but it doesn't seem to me, looking at that kind of thing 
-- and the record is filled with that kind of thing --
that that -- that you could say that the objectives are 
achieved.

 MR. STARR:  Your Honor, first of all, the 

exam to which you are referring is given in English.  If 
I am taking German, then I am not going to do well in a 
German --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, isn't the point of 

this to teach the children to learn English?

 MR. STARR:  But the point is the -- the exam 

that you should look at is the AZELA exam.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  I am not 
following this exchange because I don't understand 
whether the -- the statewide percentage is the statewide 
percentage of English learners or the statewide 
percentage of all students.

MR. STARR:  Here is -- and I think we can

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you can't answer that, I 
think Justice Breyer can.  But I would like to know what 
comparison --

JUSTICE BREYER:  He doesn't actually have 

the right to ask me questions.

 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't.  That's -- that's 

exactly true.  But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Very much true. 

Counsel, why don't you try and answer?

 MR. STARR:  Thank you.
 I would go, if I would -- if you would, to 

page 46a of our Pet. Ap, where you -- Petition Appendix, 
where you, in fact, get the information summarized, and 
then go to -- and this is the Ninth Circuit's own words 
that "Nogales is doing substantially better," "the State 
has developed a significantly improved infrastructure."
 And then if you go to the superintendent's 
Petition Appendix, you will see -- this is the relevant 
information under No Child Left Behind, which is one of 
the changed circumstances -- the Nogales students are, 
in fact, doing better than across the State.  The key is 
to measure the progress that has, in fact, been made and

that is not disputed.  Everyone agrees.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I still don't 

have an answer to Justice Breyer's -- I guess 
Justice Scalia's question following up on Justice 
Breyer's.  What are the parameters or the -- the data 
with respect to the figures Justice Breyer gave you?

 MR. STARR:  Yes.  The key, I would refer the 

Court to Appendix 312 of the superintendent's petition 
and the prior pages.  And that gives the percentage of 
students making progress under the exams that are 
administered by the State statewide, and that you will 
see that throughout, including in the high school, that 
the students are, in fact, making progress.  The 
district court concluded that Nogales had --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the answer is 

that Justice Breyer's figures are correct with respect 
to the appropriate bases of children.  You are just 
saying that you want to use a different test than the 
one that he was quoting?

 MR. STARR:  Well, again, my quarrel with his 

figures had to do with the nature of the test being 
exam.  There are different tests being administered.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  The figures 
are accurate.  You just think a different test should be 
used?

MR. STARR:  That one shouldn't take too 

seriously a test that is --

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Let's take the 
one you mentioned. Let's take the one you mention.  The 
one you mentioned, I take it the student academic 
achievement in mathematics, which is something called 
the AYP guidelines test, they are for high school, which 
you mentioned.  It has -- I think it's 2008, maybe it's 
2007 -- we have limited English proficient students, 
this is passing their test, 22.4 percent of the English 
learners are at students scoring at or above proficient. 
The overall rate is 68 percent.  So it seems like about 
a third.

 Now, if you look at the reading language 

arts, the average is 73.5.  Limited English proficient 
is 15.4.  And that's quite a difference, 75 percent as 
to 15.4, in the high schools, on the tests that you have 
mentioned.

 So I just say -- my only point is that we 

have a couple of findings here; you are right, they have 
made progress, but they are not quite home yet.  And I 
would say that, looking at this record, it seems to 
suggest that.

 MR. STARR:  But not home yet, Your Honor, 

is, in fact, the key question.  What is home?  And that

brings us to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's do another one.  What 

they started out in the year 2000 is they said one 
problem with this State is we don't know what it costs 
the average -- the increased program.  They haven't done 
a good study to tell what it costs.  But we think it's 
somewhere around $1500, maybe it's $1300, maybe it's 
$1400 per student.  And as of this very moment, the 
State is providing 3 to $400, leaving it up to the 
school district to find the rest of the money, which it 
has to take from other things like English, or -- is 
that right?

 MR. STARR:  No, that is incorrect, Your 
Honor.  First of all, there has been a substantial 
increase in funding, which we supply and summarize at 
pages 22 and 23 of the opening brief.  And you will see 
throughout the testimony -- the testimony is absolutely 
clear, including the plaintiffs', the Respondents', key 
witness, Dr. Zumudio, agreed that there has, in fact, 
been substantial progress, indeed there is an effective 
program in place.

 And so our fundamental quarrel with the 

approach of the district court is it blinded itself to 
the significant changes structurally as well as the 
progress that had been made and just said it doesn't

matter because this is all about funding, and that is 
not true.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Starr, can I take you 

back to the beginning of the 60(b) motion, because you 
seem to have shifted ground?  The 60(b) motion as 
presented to the district court said that this new law 
passed by the Arizona legislature, 2064 -- "2064 creates 
a plan for adequate funding of programs for the ELL 
students."

 That was the whole basis for the 60(b) 
motion, whether the new law was supplied adequate 
funding, and the Speaker of the House and the Senate 
intervened specifically for the purpose of defending the 
new law.  Your current argument is detached from the new 
law.

 MR. STARR:  It is not detached, but our 

submission is, in fact, that we look to what the 
district court had before it in the 60(b)(5) hearing. 
It had an eight-day evidentiary hearing.  It was not 
simply legal argument over that particular bill.  And 
that evidence --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that was the basis 

for the 64(b) motion, that 2064 provided adequate 
funding.

 MR. STARR:  Your Honor, there were a variety

of points made, and the 60(b) submission was not limited 
to this new bill.  Rather, it was a totality of the 
circumstances, here are the changed circumstances. 
That's what the whole eight-day trial was about.  The 
eight-day trial was about what are the new funding 
mechanisms, what is happening on the ground in Nogales. 
And as I say, even the Respondents' own key witness said 
that there is an effective ELL program now in place, and 
that, in fact, progress --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we -- do we have 

the -- the intervention application in the papers before 
us and the 60(b) motion?

 MR. STARR:  Yes, you do -- you do have it 
before you.  And there is no question that the Speaker 
and the President were, in fact, submitting to the 
district court HB 2064 as part of the submission.

 My point is the evidentiary hearing went 

much more broadly and here's the key:  Under the EEOA, 
all that is required under the Castaneda framework is, 
in fact, good faith efforts toward compliance.  The 
questions that are flowing suggest there has been no 
good faith effort at compliance, and there has been. 
That's what the eight-day hearing was all about.  That's 
one of the things that Superintendent Cooper testified 
to and discredited.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, I -- help me out 

then.  I thought the -- the issue was not whether there 
had been any good faith attempt at compliance, but 
whether there were two deficiencies under the scheme, 
under the -- I forget the statute -- the new bill.  One 
deficiency was that it limited the funding for any given 
student subject to -- to ELL -- to two-year funding 
when, in fact, the evidence showed that you couldn't get 
a kid up to par with two years of education.

 The second deficiency was that the -- that 

the State funds -- strike that, I'm sorry -- that 
Federal funds were being used to supplant what should 
have been a State responsibility rather than merely 
supplementing.  I take it that is simply a matter of 
degree, but that was the problem.

 I thought those were the two problems, 

two-year funding, supplantation.  Am I -- am I wrong? 
So there was no -- my point is that there was no denial 
that some good faith efforts had been made.  The finding 
was that there were two deficiencies and these were the 
two deficiencies; is that correct?

 MR. STARR:  As -- that is correct.  But as 

to the latter with respect to the Federal funds, 
supplant versus supplement, all that we have is -- and 
this is an issue that is entrusted to the Department of

Education.  It's not trusted to the district courts 
under No Child Left Behind.  This is an apparatus that 
Congress has determined there should no longer be -- not 
that EEOA doesn't -- it has its beachhead, it has its 
place, but now No Child Left Behind has a very elaborate 
process including a plan, and Arizona is in compliance 
with that plan.

 The point is the HB 2064 points completely 
blinded the district court to what was actually before 
him, and we think that that is wrong.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Starr, how do you 

explain the fact the State of Arizona and the board of 
education are troubled by the same two points?

 MR. STARR:  There is no question that there 
is disagreement within the house with respect to that. 
But, Your Honor, there is no authority on the part of a 
Federal court under No Child Left Behind to render this 
kind of interpretation.  And it has blinded us --
ultimately, it is irrelevant.  It has blinded us to the 
issue --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what is it -- No 

Child Left Behind I thought has a specific saving 
clause, "Nothing in this part shall be construed in a 
manner inconsistent with any Federal law guaranteeing a 
civil right."  And the EEOA is such a law.

MR. STARR:  That is correct.  The point that 
I am making is the interpretation of supplemental versus 
supplant is in fact one that is entrusted to the 
Department of Education.  We only have a letter.  That's 
not final agency action.  But I want to return to what 
we think is the key in a 60(b)(5) hearing.

 What is key in 60(b)(5) is to listen to the 

changed circumstances.  What are the changed 
circumstances?  And the Court blinded itself to these 
very important changes in terms of State funding --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the one State 

funding?  Because I looked at your brief, page 22 to 23, 
and if I understand it correctly it says that the 
educational expenditures, that is to say monies, 
increased in this Nogales and USD --

MR. STARR:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- maintenance and 

operation budget, by 30 percent.  Well, I'm sure they 
did.  But that's I take it the entire maintenance and 
operation budget.  The numbers I had -- and I am quite 
interested to know if they are wrong -- the numbers that 
I have is that the only survey they've done across the 
State, or the most recent one, says that the English 
language instructional costs range between 1570 and 
$3300 per pupil.  And then if you look at the amount the

State provides outside of the reading, writing and 
arithmetic, which they provide, et cetera, for all 
students, what they provide is -- currently it's $340, 
and if that law had gone into effect, 2064, it would 
have been $450.  Now, are those numbers totally wrong?

 MR. STARR:  The numbers are not wrong, Your 

Honor, but the numbers are in fact not the pivotal 
point.  The EEOA is not a funding statute, and let me 
come to the specific point of cost studies.  The State 
of Arizona did in fact seek to undertake a statewide 
cost study.  And our -- one of our fundamental problems 
here is this case is no longer about Nogales.  It has 
been expanded.  Even though it was a class action 
limited to Nogales, it has been expanded to include an 
intrusion into the prerogatives of the State.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was the fault of the 

Arizona attorney general, who told the court:  You 
cannot deal with Nogales alone because under the Arizona 
Constitution the -- all -- all the school districts have 
to be treated equally.  So, it wasn't the plaintiffs 
that initiated that move to make it statewide; it was in 
fact the Arizona attorney general.

 MR. STARR:  And we are now seeking relief 

from that, because what we now know --

state law changed?

 MR. STARR:  What has changed --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  I mean, the reason -- the 
reason for getting into this is that the State required 
it.  Has the State law changed?

 MR. STARR:  The State law does not require 
specific earmarked funding, district by district, and 
here's the key --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I assume it's --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, we are not talking 

about -- I'm sorry.

does not require that any -- any judicial decree with 
respect to a particular district be expanded to the 
whole State.  It seems to me you could comply with the 
State Constitution.  If and when a judgment is rendered 
as to the district, it would then be, under the State 
Constitution, the responsibility of the State executive 
to make sure that the other -- other districts are 
equalized.

 But why the attorney general had to come 

into the Federal court and say, do it to the whole 
State, because the whole State has to be equal, I -- I 
can't understand that, to tell you the truth.

court should have been on guard --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  What is the district court 

supposed to do?  The attorney general for the State 
comes in and says, do it this way.  It seems to me that 
the State has no standing later on to say:  Oh, gee, the 
district court should have said:  Sorry, Mr. Attorney 
General; you don't know anything about your State law; 
we won't do it this way.

 MR. STARR:  Your Honor, we are not trying to 

relitigate the original judgment.  We quarrel with it, 
but that's not why we're here.  We're here --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  The fact is he wanted to be 

thrown into the briar patch, didn't he?

 MR. STARR:  It was --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The State attorney general 

wanted the decree.

 MR. STARR:  There is -- there is no question 

that there was a division of the opinion within the 
State and that in fact the attorney general was 
essentially siding with the plaintiffs in their 
litigation.  There is now a very different perspective 
and you have that before you, that the governor who 
controls the litigation in the State is the chief 
executive of the State in terms of determining what the 
State's position is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you tell me what 

your submission is with respect to the error you see in 
the findings and the order made after the eight-day 
hearing?  First, are you saying that after No Child Left 
Behind that the duty of the State with respect to 
educating the students who have a different language was 
less onerous?

 MR. STARR:  No, it's not less onerous, but 

there is a different methodology and a different 
approach.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  And are you 

saying that because of that methodology any remedy based 
on funding is no longer appropriate?

 MR. STARR:  A funding remedy is in fact 

inappropriate presumptively statewide.  That is our key 
submission, because of the variation in costs, district 
by district.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If we could -- is it valid 

as to Nogales, if we focus just on Nogales?

 MR. STARR:  Not in terms of changed 

circumstances, because of what has in fact happened on 
the ground.  Namely, one of the thing when we go back to 
the original order --

saying that the order the district court gave with 
respect just to Nogales --

MR. STARR:  Yes.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- is inappropriate 

because it used a funding remedy or a funding measure of 
compliance when it should have used blank, and then fill 
in the blank?

 MR. STARR:  Yes.  It should have simply 
determined under Castaneda the three-part test.  It 
should not have said the EEOA requires a particular 
level of funding.  That's precisely what Castaneda --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But that isn't what it -- I 
don't understand that it has ever said that.  I thought 
the funding point was basically this:  You, Nogales, 
have come up with plan A.  You have come up with funding 
B.  Funding B is not enough money to fund plan A.  It is 
your plan, you've got to fund your plan.

 That is not saying that the Federal statute 
requires a particular level of funding.  It's not saying 
that the district court can take over the responsibility 
of deciding what is appropriate funding in a school 
district.  It's simply saying, "If you choose plan A, 
you have got to pay for plan A."

ever go beyond that?

 MR. STARR:  It did go beyond that in this 
sense.  It did not in fact determine whether in fact 
there was an effective program in place.  That's the 
oddity about this case --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  In other words, it should 

have said:  Before I decide whether your funding for 
plan A is good enough, I have got to decide whether plan 
A itself is worth anything?  I mean, I have got to 
evaluate plan A?

 MR. STARR:  No.  The difficulty is seeking 
to enforce a specific funding order, and particularly 
statewide, which intrudes --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.  Let's go back 

to Justice Kennedy's point a moment ago.  Let's just 
talk about Nogales for a minute.  With respect to plan 
A, that was Nogales' plan.  And the district court said: 
You can't fund that plan with the amount of money that 
you have appropriated.  Did the district court go beyond 
that with respect to Nogales?

 MR. STARR:  The district court failed to 
note that plan A had changed.  There was no longer a 
plan A.  It was strategic English immersion which has an 
entirely different methodology.  And what it also --

and this case was going on for, what, eight, nine years 
before there was ever an argument.  I mean in all of 
these orders that were not appealed, don't those 
judgments, unappealed judgments, settle anything?

 MR. STARR:  Of -- of course.  They let that 

judgment stand during that period of time.  But the 
whole purpose of 60(b)(5) is relief from finality.  It's 
a --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but didn't -- didn't 

the court -- you say plan A is no longer in effect; they 
have a new plan under the No Child Left Behind Act.  But 
didn't the -- didn't the district court find that the 
funding for that plan is inadequate, for the two reasons 
that were mentioned earlier?

 MR. STARR:  Well, it said that -- here is 

what the court held:  That it has developed a 
significantly improved infrastructure for ELL 
programming, but it has not complied with the original 
judgment.  That is our complaint.  The original funding 
judgment was in fact informed by a different methodology 
and a different set of circumstances.  For example, 
Superintendent Cooper comes in and says:  I don't want 
to spend money on teachers' aides; they are standing in 
the way.  Yet the Respondents say:  We need money for 
teachers' aides.  That's part of No Child Left Behind.

Inputs -- now we look at -- we test, we 

determine what progress is being made and, we are 
requiring progress to be made.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I didn't think there was 
in the district judge's declaratory judgment, spend this 
much on teachers aides, that much on the other.  It was: 
You need a plan and you have to figure out how much it 
costs, and then you have to appropriate money that 
matches the cost.

 But the district court -- I may be wrong 

about this, but I thought that the original declaratory 
judgment didn't try to tell them what the components of 
that plan had to be.

 MR. STARR:  You are precisely right, but the 
point I'm making is that the objects of that underlying 
decree shifted by virtue of the new methodology that was 
in fact adequately funded through a whole variety of 
funds.  The funds that Justice Breyer has referred to 
are only part of the basket of funds that have been made 
available.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  No.  But doesn't it --

doesn't it -- don't we come back to Justice Scalia's 
question of a moment ago?  Even with the -- the changed 
plan to immersion, isn't the finding that two years of 
funding per child is not enough?  And you are

supplanting, not supplementing.  Isn't that still the 
problem?

 MR. STARR:  We believe not.  We believe that 
ultimately those two issues are irrelevant to the issue 
that is before the Court.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But those are the issues 

that the court focused on; are they not?

 MR. STARR:  Wrongly, because that's --

that's part of our quarrel, THAT the district court 
simply focused on these two elements of HB 2064, and 
blinded itself to the evidence --

JUSTICE BREYER:  There is a minor thing that 
I -- I think -- I'm not sure that Justice Ginsburg said. 
I thought that the funding order was not fund the plan 
you come up with; but rather, come up with a funding 
plan that bears a rational relationship to -- to the 
plan you come up with.  So is that right?

 MR. STARR:  That is correct, and that is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  And now the 

district court is at considerable remove.  He says they 
have not yet come up with a study and a plan that seems 
satisfactory, and they haven't shown how the funding is 
rational in relation to the plan that they haven't fully 
developed, though they've made progress.  That's where 
we are -- is that where we are?

MR. STARR:  Three brief points.  On the 

study, the State did undertake a study, and this is in 
the record.  And the National Conference of State 
Legislators said:  We throw up our hands because we 
can't do this statewide.  I would invite the Court to 
refocus on Nogales as a district versus statewide.

 What was entered here in this order, which 

makes it so extraordinary, is that the entire State 
funding mechanism has been interfered with by the order. 
This case started out in Nogales.  And so the statewide 
study was in fact undertaken.  But we could not do it. 
The National Conference of State Legislatures said:  We 
throw up our hands.  We can do a local study, and it was 
done.  And if the Court refocuses on the various 
tranches of funding, including in Nogales itself and 
from the State, one will see that there has been a very 
substantial increase in the actual funding as well as 
progress.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I -- I agree with 

that.  I think it was a vast mistake to extend a lawsuit 
that applied only to Nogales to the whole State, but the 
State attorney general wanted that done.

 MR. STARR:  But we should be able now to --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's -- that's water 
over the dam.  That's not what this suit is about now.

MR. STARR:  No, Your Honor, not under 60(b), 

and this Court has warned about the ability of State 
officials --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  What has 60(b) got to do 

with the question of whether the attorney general 
represents the State before the court?  If the attorney 
general comes back into court and says, no longer do we 
want this statewide, then you've got an issue.  If the 
-- if the attorney general speaking for the State does 
not do that, then I don't see why Justice Scalia's point 
is not the answer.

 MR. STARR:  Not under Arizona law.  It is 

the governor who speaks and the attorney general is 
beholden --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  So the district court is 

supposed to referee a fight between the governor and the 
attorney general at this point?  Is that what's going 
on?

court is to listen to what the State has to say through

It should have listened to the --

The attorney general speaks for the State when the 
governor directs him or her to do that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But he was speaking alone 

for years and years, and 60(b) -- and it has been said 
over and over again -- is not a substitute for appeal. 
What wasn't appealed was that Arizona is required by 
Federal law to determine the cost and adequately fund a 
statewide system of English acquisition programming.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which would be good enough 

to fix Nogales.  So you are quite right.  There is a 
vast difference in each district.  But that attorney 
general wanted enough money to fund the whole State the 
way you have to fund to -- to fix Nogales.  That's what 
he wanted.

 MR. STARR:  And former officials shouldn't 
continue to be able to bind the State.  I would like to 
reserve the remainder of my time.

was a systemic violation of the EEOA.  And the court 
further found that the program deficiencies were the 
result of the lack of funding rationally related to the 
programs.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can I ask whether the 

requirements of the EEOA are at all affected 
by Congress's later enactment of the No Child Left 
Behind Act?  I mean, you know, it's a very vague 
requirement that you make a good faith effort to -- to 
provide language assistance to children.

 Why shouldn't the courts decide that what 

constitutes a good faith effort is pretty much what 
Congress thought was necessary in the -- in the No Child 
Left Behind Act, and if you comply with that, you are 
doing okay?

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Scalia, just one 
point of clarification on -- in our view on what the 
EEOA requires, and then I will address the No Child Left 
Behind point.  The EEOA doesn't really require good 
faith efforts.  It requires efforts that are in fact 
reasonably calculated to overcome language barriers.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  I would call that 

good faith, but that's fine.

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  With that -- With that 

clarification, thank you.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's fine.
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  With that clarification on 

the question of whether No Child Left Behind sets the 
standard for compliance with the EEOA, which is, I 
think, what the petitioners' position is, we think the 
answer is no for two fundamental reasons.  First is just 
a textual point.  The text of No Child Left Behind 
doesn't say anywhere that it displaces the standards for 
compliance with the EEOA.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't think that's their 

argument, counsel.  I don't think that it is their 
argument that No Child Left Behind supplants the earlier 
act.  It is simply their -- their argument is that it 
informs an interpretation of the language of EEOA, which 
is that the State is required to take appropriate 
action, which is a very vague standard.

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  I think their argument at 

the end of the day, Justice Scalia, is that if you 
comply with No Child Left Behind -- and I will get to in 
a moment what compliance with No Child Left Behind can 
mean -- then you have necessarily complied with the 
EEOA.  That compliance with the No Child Left Behind 
sets the standard for compliance with the EEOA.
 And I don't think that is workable 

particularly when you take into account what petitioners

mean by "compliance with No Child Left Behind."

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask you this question 
about the Ninth Circuit's decision, which is what we are 
reviewing?  Suppose -- I know there -- there is a debate 
about how well Nogales is doing at this time.  But let's 
suppose Nogales came in, and they said this:  We had 
plan A back when this was originally litigated, and now 
we have an entirely different plan, and this plan 
doesn't cost one penny more than what we were spending 
in 2000.  But it is a very good plan, and it has 
produced very good results.

 As I read the Ninth Circuit's decision, they 

would not grant relief from the judgment under those 
circumstances, because they focus exclusively on 
incremental funding for EEL programs and Arizona's 
funding model.  Isn't that correct?

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I -- I don't know 

that that is a correct interpretation of the EEOA.  What 
we would say is that if the State came forward with a 
showing that completely regardless of funding the 
programs on the ground work, well, that would be 
something that the district court would have to take 
into account.  But the state hasn't --

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, but isn't -- that isn't 
really my question.  Isn't -- isn't it the case that the

Ninth Circuit judged the -- the permissibility of relief 
under 60(b) solely with regard to incremental funding 
and Arizona's funding model?

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  The Ninth Circuit focused 
on funding, Justice Alito, because that is the way the 
case has been litigated from the outset.  And that's the 
way the State has said from the outset that it would 
achieve compliance with the --

JUSTICE ALITO:  That's the way it was 

litigated originally, but I thought the whole focus of 
the motion for relief from the judgment was:  We have a 
new plan, and it is not tied to funding, and it will 
produce good results without looking at incremental EEL 
funding.  And wasn't the Ninth Circuit obligated to look 
at that?

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I think the Ninth 
Circuit was -- was required certainly to review the 
district court's inquiry into that.  And what the 
district court found is at page 100-A of the appendix to 
the petition filed by the legislative intervenors.  And 
what the district court found there is that the 
improvements today, although significant, failed to 
reach the high school; that they were fleeting.  And --
and this is particularly significant.  In addition, the 
district court also explained that it was premature to

make an assessment of many of the changes, because many 
of the new standards are still evolving.

 And the reason the district court said that 

is that -- is because of the enactment in 2006 of 
Arizona HB 2064, which changes the framework for 
administration and funding of ELL programs in a way that 
I think fortifies the district court's denial of 
complete dissolution of its judgment and -- and ensuing 
orders.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I guess, as I 

understand Justice Alito's question, if the prior order 
is based on funding a particular plan and the State 
comes back and says, this is a new approach.  It could 
be for any number of reasons, and say that, you know, 
the plan is not working, or there have been other 
budgetary crises in the State that strain what we can 
afford to spend on this particular program.  Here's 
another plan.  The funding levels are different.  You 
should look at it.

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Yes, that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What's wrong with 

that?

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  There is nothing wrong with 

that, and it should be looked at.  And the district 
court did look at it, and what the district court found

was that the claims of progress, although there had been 
progress, the progress hadn't reached the high school. 
The progress was fleeting and that it was premature --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not a question 

of progress; it's a question of the plan and the 
approach.  And I understood the Ninth Circuit -- I'm 
looking at page 72a -- it talks about the ELL's specific 
funding that was based on the prior order.  And what I 
understood the State's submission to be -- look at what 
the superintendent has done in this particular case, and 
so on, so that those specific funding levels aren't 
applicable.  And I would have thought it an 
extraordinary enough thing for a district court to tell 
a State legislature:  Pass this budget, and you, 
Legislature, pass it, and -- I guess -- you, Governor, 
sign it, or you are not going to be in compliance.  And 
if they've come up with a different way with different 
funding requirements, I don't know why that's not a 
changed circumstance that justifies looking at the 
judgment --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, the district court 
didn't issue that sort of order.  And -- and the Ninth 
Circuit -- if you look at page 66a -- it did review the 
evidence in the record and fortified the district 
court's conclusion that the new plan, Your Honor,

Mr. Chief Justice, that was presented, which is to the 
effect that, regardless of funding, we have made 
advances based on management improvements that should 
satisfy the statute.  That was the claim that was made 
by Petitioners.  I think that's what you're alluding to. 
And the district court rejected that at page 100a, and 
the Ninth Circuit fortified the district court's 
rejection of it by looking at the evidence in the record 
concerning --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what page is this?
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  It's at 66a.  That the 

court of appeals reviews the testimony and fortifies the 
district court's conclusion that, based on the advances 
to date, there's still work left to be done.  Because at 
the end of the day you have to have a plan in place.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I don't think 
the State -- I didn't understand the State to disagree 
that there's still work to be done.  I thought that the 
plan -- the point was that their approach had changed, 
including by No Child Left Behind, that they don't have 
to reach the same specific funding levels that the 
district court order required.  And what I understood 
the Ninth Circuit to say is, no, those specific funding 
levels are still in place.

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, there's two

fundamentally different assertions being made by 
Petitioners, if I understand it:  One is what 
Justice Scalia alluded to earlier, which is that No 
Child Left Behind changed the legal landscape in a way 
such that compliance with No Child Left Behind, such as 
it is, sets the standard for compliance with the EEOA.

 Now, there's a distinct argument that's also 

being made which is that conditions on the ground have 
improved as a consequence of management improvements. 
Regardless of No Child Left Behind, this is a factual 
argument, that factually things have changed in a way 
that ought to let us from underneath the district 
court's supervision.

 Now, the -- they are different points, and I 

think the district court addressed both of them.  With 
respect to the second one, where there is the facts on 
the ground, what is critical is that, in order to 
justify complete dissolution in a case like this, the 
Petitioners would have to show, not only that conditions 
have improved, but they have improved in a way that is 
durable and sustainable over time.  And the district 
court --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What degree --
MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- doubted that.

do you think is necessary?  Do you agree with the Ninth 
-- the Ninth Circuit says, "We cannot say the district 
court clearly erred when it found this burden was not 
met.  A district in which the majority of ELL tenth 
graders failed to meet State achievement standards while 
the majority of native English speakers passed is not 
one whose performance demonstrates that the State is 
adequately funding ELL programs."

 Do you really think that you haven't 

complied with adequate funding of ELL programs until you 
raise all of the ELL students up to the level of native 
English speakers?

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, I don't think the EEOA 

requires raising everyone.  I think it requires --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's all this says. 

The majority doesn't --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- doesn't meet the -- a 

majority of ELL tenth graders fail to meet the 
standards, but the majority of native English speakers 
do.

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, that's part of what 

it says, and I think what the Ninth Circuit is also 
alluding to with respect to the high school in 
particular that, if you look at State survey that

Petitioners rely on in -- in touting the improvements in 
certain schools, it also with respect to the high school 
shows that the two high schools in Nogales was ranked --
were ranked at the very bottom of the survey for ELL 
students.

 So there's problems on the ground, but what 
the district court focused on concerns the enactment of 
2064, which is that no matter was think about the 
improvements that have -- that have been made to date, 
the landscape fundamentally shifts upon the enactment of 
2064 because the administration and funding of ELL plans 
changes at that point.  And it's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's the new plan that 
we're talking about, is 20 -- there have been references 
-- well, now they have a new plan.  Does everybody agree 
at least that the new plan is 2064?

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  I -- I think we would agree 
because that sets the charter for provision of programs 
to ELL students going forward from its enactment. 
That's the infrastructure from -- from here on out.

 And that -- there's three particular 

features of that that I think are significant and that 
fortify the district court's conclusion that complete 
dissolution was unwarranted.

 The first is the one that was raised by

Justice Souter, which is that whatever you think of the 
progress that has been made to date -- and the district 
court found that, while it was significant, it didn't 
suffice -- that changes from what can be brought to bear 
from here on out as half the resources that were 
available before, because that's the net effect of 2064. 
That's what the district court found, at pages 107 to 
108a of the Petition Appendix.  And when you have half 
resources to work with -- at the very least I think what 
the district court thought in saying that it was 
premature to make an assessment is that we have to have 
some period to assess what happens on the ground as a 
consequence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there any --
MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- of this new funding 

recipe.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does -- then does 

that stay true without regard to what is happening 
economically to the State?  In other words, the district 
court can say:  You've got to spend this much money on 
this program, and I don't care what it means for jails, 
roads, anything else, when there are profound changes in 
economic circumstances of the sort that everybody's 
experiencing lately.

the State would have to present that, Your Honor, and I 
don't believe the State to have done that so far.  But 
the State would have to make the argument that funding 
constraints are inexistence in a way that doesn't allow 
us to -- to use one example -- to -- to put together an 
optimal program, and so here's the program that we want 
to put in place in --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Counsel, I --
MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- jurisdictions.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I find it bizarre that we 
are sitting here talking about what the whole State has 
to do on the basis of one district which is concededly 
the district that has the most nonnative English 
speakers and has been a problem district all along.  And 
we are saying whatever this district court says for --
for this school district applies statewide.  Now, that 
is bizarre.

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the mere fact that the 
State Attorney General acquiesced in that kind -- kind 
of a system at the outset, does that force us to still 
accept at this time that whatever is -- is necessary for 
Nogales is also necessary for the entire State?

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Justice Scalia, I think 

that that issue becomes largely an academic one for the

following reason:  that the reason that the State 
Attorney General made the acknowledgment that he did is 
that, under the Arizona State Constitution, funding 
decisions don't vary from district to district.  So 
whatever funding menu is put into place in order to 
achieve compliance with the EEOA with respect to Nogales 
is going to be the same one that exists throughout the 
State.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'll let --
MR. SRINIVASAN:  It's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'll let Arizona worry 
about that.  It's -- it's another matter to have a 
district court decree that the whole State has to do 
this thing.  And whether -- whether it's done equally or 
not would be a matter for the State courts to determine, 
instead of for this district judge to determine, right?
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, it could be, but I 
don't think there's really much of a dispute that the 
statewide funding measure doesn't really affect what the 
State's going to do in this case, because --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it seems to me very 
odd that -- assume you have a constitutional provision 
which says funding must be equal in each district.  Then 
you find one district that's way behind, and that is, we 
will assume, is -- has been deficient in -- in providing

language education.  You are saying that if the court 
orders more money spent for that district, it must 
automatically order money -- additional money for every 
other district in the State?

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  No, absolutely not.  Not --

certainly not in the abstract.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- yes, but that seems 

to me the necessary conclusion of your argument in the 
answer you gave Justice Scalia.

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  I don't think it's a 

necessary conclusion of my argument, Justice Kennedy.  I 
think it's a conclusion that rests on we are in this 
litigation in this particular context, given the Arizona 
Constitution's uniformity clause.  It's as a consequence 
of that clause that this issue even arises.  And I think 
the Attorney General --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But, again, what you're --
you're saying that any time a district court in a single 
district orders more money to remedy a constitutional 
problem, that because of that clause it has to apply to 
every other district.  That just can't be.

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, if the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if -- and if it is, 
then that is a very good reason for the district court 
to cede its jurisdiction to the State authorities.

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, if the litigation had 

come up in a different way, Justice Kennedy, such that 
it had always focused exclusively on what happened in 
Nogales, including the funding aspect of the case, but I 
think what would have been appropriate is that the 
district court would have inquired about what funding 
resources belong to Nogales in particular.  And then 
what would have happened by operation of State law would 
be that, whatever the funding calculus with respect to 
Nogales, it would automatically apply across the State 
because of the Arizona Constitution's uniformity clause.

 Now, in this case, the litigation -- the 

complaint was assessed against the entire State, and the 
Attorney General accepted that, and I don't think at 
this point in time we can revisit that, particularly 
when it's largely an academic question given the 
uniformity clause --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I gather it's 

often the case in institutional litigation of this sort 
that the political figures, whether it's the Governor or 
the Attorney General, can't go to the voters say, look, 
we should spend more money on this.  So they go to the 
district court judge and say, make us spend more money 
on this.  And they get the same result they'd wanted in 
a non-democratic way, particularly when there's a

division, such as here the legislature doesn't want to 
do something, and the Governor or the Attorney General 
does.

 So why should we put a lot of weight on what 

the representation is when we are at least concerned 
that it might be a -- I don't mean it in a pejorative 
sense -- but a collusive piece of litigation?

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, two points, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and first -- and I don't mean to 
quibble, but the Attorney General did contest the 
litigation at the outset.  What happened is, after a 
judgment was issued against the State, then I think 
there was an acquiescence in the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's hard for 
the Attorney General to get funding from the legislature 
for all he wants to do, and this is a way for him to get 
it, to go to the legislature and say look, you don't 
have a choice.

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, sure, 

Mr. Chief Justice, but I think what the Court did in 
both Rufo and Frew is it accommodated those concerns, 
and it accommodated the interest in finality that comes 
from judgments, and the interests in allowing a 
different set of State officials to suggest new programs 
to make that suggestion to the district court.  And it

accommodated those in a way that requires a showing at 
the outset that there has been a significant change in 
facts or a significant change in law.  And on --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Can I ask just a 
question that was confusing to me?  What standard for 
changed circumstances do you understand the Ninth 
Circuit to have applied?

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  The one that was outlined 

by this Court in Rufo.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Which is?
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  A significant change of 

facts or a significant change of law.  And the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I am looking at page 
72a of the Ninth Circuit opinion, and the standard they 
use there is radically changed, not significantly 
changed.

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, on page 49a they 

invoke the precise wording of this Court, cite Rufo for 
that proposition, and also --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, if we have a --
if we are confused as to which standard they applied, 
because at one point they say significantly changed and 
at another point they say radically changed, what should 
we do?

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I -- I would give

effect to the articulation of the standard in the 
standard review question section of the opinion.  Of 
course you could remand if you felt that it was 
necessary, but I think the reason why the Ninth Circuit 
uses the language such as Your Honor found in 72a is 
that it has to be considered in the context of the 
nature of the violation and the nature of the relief 
sought.

 The violation was a systematic one; the 

relief sought is a complete dissolution of the judgment 
and ensuing order, and in that context I think it is 
fair to say that what is significant is more significant 
than what would be the case in -- for example, in Rufo, 
where what was sought was a relatively modest 
modification of the consent order concerning whether you 
would have single bunking or double bunking.

 Now on the question of whether there is in 

fact a significant change or significant change of facts 
or significant change in law, on No Child Left Behind, 
Justice Scalia, to return to the question that you 
asked, the reason that No Child Left Behind in our view 
doesn't displace the standard for EEOA is that 
Petitioner's standard is that as long as the State has 
an approved No Child Left Behind plan, which is true of 
all 50 States, that they necessarily satisfy the EEOA;

and what that would mean is that even if a State didn't 
implement that plan, even if the State didn't -- didn't 
-- didn't have accountability measures that it in fact 
followed, that required school districts to achieve the 
annual measurement of progress that would be laid out in 
the plan -- notwithstanding all of that, a plaintiff 
would lack authority to come into the court and litigate 
his private cause of action under the EEOA and get a 
court order that requires the State to take appropriate 
action --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right but --
MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- simply because the State 

will have had an approved plan.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand that.  You 

could get the plan approved and then not fund it.  But 
at least the additional funding demanded by the district 
court should be whatever additional funding is necessary 
to comply with the No Child Left Behind Act.  Right?
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  I -- I don't think so. 

Because --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, then -- then it's not 

as simple as you made it.  Of course, I agree with the 
fact that if you get approved under the No Child Left 
Behind Act and then don't fund it, of course that --
that won't satisfy your obligation.  But if you have

gotten approved, the test for whether you are satisfying 
your obligation should be how much money would it cost 
to implement the program that you have gotten approved 
under the No Child Left Behind Act.

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  The -- the No Child Left 
Behind Act doesn't -- it doesn't approve a particular 
program.  What it imposes are voluntarily accepted 
funding conditions, and that includes --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't approve 

programs?

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  No --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought the States had to 

submit a program.

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  What the EEOA concerns are 

programs that are reasonably calculated to achieve 
overcoming language barriers.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  Right.
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  What No Child Left Behind 
concerns is, is there a testing program in place that 
calls for certain improvements in testing over time.  As 
long as the plan describes the tests that will be taken 
and the progress that will be achieved or sought to be 
achieved over time, a plan will be approved.  Now, even 
if the State doesn't achieve the plan -- the progress 
that is called for by No Child Left Behind --

the progress called for No Child Left Behind hasn't been 
made in the last two years, according to the 
superintendent's web site.  Even if you don't make that 
progress, there is no way under Petitioner's approach to 
vindicate the EEOA cause of action to obtain appropriate

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY

 OF BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

49

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 It's important to recognize what Petitioners 

asked for here at the rule 60(b)(5) stage.  That was 
complete dissolution of the court's immediate orders. 
It was not to just limit those orders just to Nogales; 
it was not to improve -- or to approve improvements in 
Nogales as an interim measure.  As a result, the burden 
was on them to show either full compliance with the 
orders the district court had entered or material 
changed circumstances that made compliance unnecessary.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But couldn't the district 

court give them the relief to which they were entitled 
even if it was less than what they sought?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Certainly.  But they didn't 
demonstrate that -- entitlement to that relief either. 
To the extended we are talking about the question of 
whether conditions had changed in Nogales that there was 
no longer an ongoing violation of Federal law, the 
district court held an 8-day evidentiary hearing, and it 
made factual findings showing that the problems had not 
ceased in Nogales.  And as you noted, Justice Ginsburg, 
this changed circumstances argument that is now heavily 
relied upon by Petitioners was not the primary thrust of

their argument before the district court.

 The primary thrust of their argument was 

that HB 2064, which is the State's scheme for ELL 
education, had some serious -- would -- would satisfy 
the judgment; and their other argument was that No Child 
Left Behind completely preempts -- that was the language 
they use -- completely preempts and renders obsolete the 
EEOA.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, when you 

were starting out I heard you articulate a third 
standard, materially changed.  What is your 
understanding of the standard applied by the Ninth 
Circuit?  Was it materially changed, significantly 
changed or radically changed?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I understand it to be 

significant change, which, I don't see significant and 
material as being all that different.  I think that 
the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I don't either 

but I see both of them being different from radically 
changed.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Again, I think if you look at 

the Ninth Circuit's opinion, particularly where it 
starts out with the standard of review, it cites this 
Court's precedents in Rufo and Agostini; it talks about

the need for significant changed circumstances.  I 
understand that there are portions of the Ninth 
Circuit's opinion that say -- that have the radical 
change language, and again, I -- I think that that 
language is -- just reflects the arguments that 
Petitioners were making, that they wanted complete 
relief from these remedial orders and that, you know, 
the underlying judgment here was a systemic violation. 
I mean, it's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did the district court on 

the 8-day hearing on remand make a finding that its 
incremental funding determinations that it had made 
earlier were an accurate way to measure compliance and 
to insist on compliance under the new immersion program?
 MS. SAHARSKY:  If I understand your question 

correctly, and please correct me if I don't, but the 
district court considered two different arguments.  The 
first was under House Bill 2064 which considered to have 
-- which continued to have this incremental funding. 
It's that we have two problems with House Bill 2064, 
which were the two-year cutoff and Federal funding 
problem.

 On the second question which -- the second 

argument Petitioners made which said, everything is fine 
in Nogales because we have money from other funds, the

district court said no, there's -- there's been an 
ongoing violation of Federal.  Law you haven't met your 
burden of showing me that violation ceased because 
things aren't better in Nogales.  Do --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Why does it matter that 
there is -- why focus on incremental funding for ELL 
programs exclusively?  What difference does it make 
where the money comes from -- where it comes from, 
putting aside federal money that can't be supplanted?  I 
just don't understand that.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I think the reason the 

district court was focused on that because that was 
always the State's position that, in terms of the 
statewide scheme, that that is how they were going to 
fund ELL education.  Now it -- and so the State was 
always, from 2000 up to the time of the district court's 
rule 60(b) hearing, going down this path whereby it 
would put in place an ELL program and then give this 
amount of funding --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that may have been 

their -- that may have been their position originally, 
but at the time of the 60(b) hearing, what difference 
does it make whether the money came from funds that were 
designated for ELL program, or from general State funds, 
or from county funds?  What difference does it make

whether the money was taken from some other program that 
the school was operating?

 Suppose they fund -- they take the money for 
the ELL programs from money that was previously used for 
music instruction, or art, or gym, or teaching German or 
anything else.  Now those may all be bad things, but 
what does that have to be with the EEOA?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, the district court 
could have found that the plan had changed and that 
funding could come from -- from different places. 
That's right, if the State had changed its plans or that 
Nogales otherwise would have sufficient funding from 
circumstances that -- or from other source, that would 
be one thing.  But the district court found that Nogales 
doesn't have that funding from other sources.

 For example, it can't use the federal 

funding that it -- that the Petitioners claim could be 
used to solve its problem under the EEOA.  There are 
specific conditions on federal grant programs that 
forbid that.

 It also could not raise any significant 

amounts of funding through county tax overrides, which 
was another source the Petitioners had said would --
would provide sufficient funding.  So the question the 
district court had to ask is, there has been an ongoing

violation of federal law, has that violation of 
federal -- federal law ceased because the State has put 
in place, Nogales has put in place programs that are 
reasonably calculated to help these kids learn English?

 And the district court said Nogales has 

cobbled together these sources of funding.  And it is 
doing the best they can.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But the fact that you keep 
talking about the district court emphasizes my concern 
about the decision of the Ninth Circuit, which is what 
we are reviewing.  And as I read the decision of the 
Ninth Circuit, they focused exclusively on incremental 
costs associated with ELL programs and the educational 
funding model that the State had at that time.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  With respect, I don't think 
that that was their exclusive focus.  I understand that 
it was a primary focus of that decision, and the reason 
for that was because the primary argument --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, they say.  They were 

required -- the Petitioners were required to demonstrate 
either that there are no longer incremental costs 
associated with ELL programs in Arizona or that 
Arizona's funding model was so altered as to make 
incremental costs issue relevant.  That was their 
explanation of the holding, 60 -- 63A of the Speaker's

appendix.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  That's right.  And what I 
understand that to mean is that they were required to 
either show compliance with the judgment which was that 
they would put together a plan that funded ELL education 
based on incremental costs or that the State was going 
to go down a different path and come up with the funding 
some other way, and that would result in a program 
reasonably calculated to help ELL students earn English.

 And the district court found there were 

neither and the court of appeals found there were 
neither.  And the court of appeals did go through the 
alleged changed circumstances, and Nogales had issued a 
91-page opinion that talked about the significant 
resource constraints that still exist in Nogales and the 
persistent achievement gaps that still exist in Nogales.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I still have trouble 

with the idea of district courts ordering State 
legislatures to fund it.  Isn't the preferable approach 
for the district court to say you have a violation, you 
have to fix it, and I'm going check to see if you fixed 
it at particular intervals?  And it's up to you, the 
State, to determine how you are going to fix it.

 And the State might change its mind.  They 
may start out by saying we have got all of this extra

money and that's how we will fix it.  Then there is a 
budget crisis, the kind that we are familiar with, and 
he says we can't the money, we are going to do it some 
other way, and here's the way.

 But that's kind of the judgment of the 

State, not for the district court.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  And I think the district 

court was appropriately differential to the State 
throughout this litigation.  You will note at the time 
of the 2000 judgment that the district court didn't put 
any remedial order in place.  And that's because at the 
time of trial the State said, look, we are going to put 
in place an ELL program that everyone in the State can 
use and figure out how much it costs, what works and 
what doesn't.  We are going to do a cost study, so 
please let us do the cost study and we will come back to 
the court.

 And the district court said fine.  And ten 

months later that didn't happen.

 Now, there was a change, as Petitioners 

note, to a different theory of ELL education, structured 
English immersion and the court said, okay, do your 
program based on structured English immersion and just 
tell me how much it costs, tell me how you rationally 
fund it, and that will be fine.  The district court here

did not want to be in the business of micromanaging 
State education.  Through this entire litigation the 
district court was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why does it order 
then -- why did its order specify and be linked to the 
termination of the legislative session, and say you have 
12 days left in the session and that's how many days you 
have to enact this budget?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I think it's because the 

State kept coming back to the district court and saying 
that the legislature had asked for this cost study, 
there was an interim bill, House Bill 2010, where the 
legislature said we put in place another study that we 
are going to perform.  And it's because the State 
said -- constantly said the legislature is going to do 
this cost study, figure out how much good programs cost, 
the school -- the State board will be involved, 
et cetera, that the district court entered its orders 
looking to the time period in which it expected action 
to occur.

 I mean, this happened over a nine-year 

period.  The district court, to be clear -- I think this 
is a very important point -- never said you need to do 
any special kind of ELL program, bilingual, structured 
English immersion, you need to have any certain number

of teachers, nothing like that.  And it never said you 
need to put this certain amount of funding in place, 
$200, $300 per student, anything like that.

 And Petitioners at the rule 60(b)(5) stage 

faced a heavy burden to show if what they wanted to show 
was that the State was now going to go down this new and 
different path, because even at the time of the rule 
60(b)(5) hearing, the state Was on the same path.  It 
had just passed House Bill 2064, which just like at the 
time of the 2000 judgment said we are going to put a 
statewide program in place for ELL education --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the district -- the 
district judge said that that 2064 did not have enough, 
it raised it to 450 or whatever.  And the district court 
said there are three things wrong with it, the two 
years, using the federal funds to -- to supplant not 
supplement, and that the $450 figure wasn't enough.

 And the only way that $450 figure was going 

to get changed was through legislation, right?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Could I answer that?  I think 

the problem with the $450 figure is that the district 
court was never told what the State was planning to buy 
with that, what that $450 was for.  The State -- the 
district court just said to the State, please tell me 
what your programs are going to do and approximately how

much it costs to fund them.  And that 450 wasn't tied to 
any particular ELL programs.  That was the problem.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Saharsky, I have one 

late arriving question.  Do you think that the 
constitutional -- State constitutional provision at 
least there has to be equivalent funding in districts, 
do you think that would be called into play if the 
Federal Government under a federal program gave 
additional funds to a particular district?  Which I am 
sure it does, those districts that have federal 
facilities probably get additional -- additional money, 
would all the rest -- under this constitutional 
provision, would all the rest of the State have to belly 
up to that -- to that same level?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  No, as I understand it --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I doubt it.
 MS. SAHARSKY:  -- when it's talking about a 

uniform --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah.
 MS. SAHARSKY:  -- and equal amount, it's 
talking about the amount that the State gives to the 
school districts.  It's not with respect to any federal 
funding from other sources.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, if federal funding 
doesn't count, why would a federal decree applicable

only to a particular school district count?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I think that the idea was 
that there needed to be -- the State determined that 
there needed to be -- it was going to solve the problem 
statewide not only because of the concern under the 
State constitutions, that it would provide for all ELL 
students.  And it was not that it would provide the same 
amount to each school district, but just the same amount 
per ELL student.  That the State had decided that it was 
going to fill that responsibility because -- both 
because of the Constitution and because it's responsible 
for supervising education statewide.  Thank you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. STARR:  Thank you.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me, Mr. Starr, 
based on this last argument, that it actually is in your 
favor if the order of the court as to one district 
automatically requires additional expenditure for every 
other district, that is simply one more measure that the 
Court should use in finding an alternate remedy.

 MR. STARR:  Yes, Your Honor.  The state 
funding remedy here is extraordinarily intrusive and

overreaching.  It is something that has not been done 
under the EEOA ever, and certainly the No Child Left 
Behind provision should inform now this particular 
remedy.  The remedy was originally, of course, designed 
to address the situation in Nogales, but it was 
expanded --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It is no content to the 

equal child -- No Child Left Behind.  There is no 
content to it.  All it requires is testing.

 MR. STARR:  It's part --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You can't say how much it's 

going to cost.

 MR. STARR:  But, Your Honor, there is a very 

elaborate plan that is submitted and then a 
determination is made by the Federal Government about 
funds under Title 1 and Title 3, but here is our 
fundamental submission.  The Ninth Circuit simply 
applied the wrong 60(b)standard.

 It, in fact, used this remarkable language, 

but it also of radical change, but it also gave undue 
weight.  It said it ten times to the fact that the 
original judgment was on appeal, and then it simply did 
not pay heed to the incredibly intrusive nature of a 
statewide funding remedy in light of the fact that we 
can now look at what has happened in Nogales.  We see

the changes that have, in fact, been there, and 
certainly the EEOA by its design in section 1712 of EEOA 
makes it very clear that the remedial reach of the EEOA 
is quite limited.  It's limited to particular 
circumstances.

 Here the EEOA has been transmogrified to 
apply statewide.  That has not been done before.  It 
should not have been done in the first instance but 
certainly in light of the changed circumstances.

 And the changed circumstances, 

Justice Ginsburg, go back to structured English 
immersion.  They did not begin with the passage of HB 
2064.  Structured English immersion came in in the year 
2000.  That is why the legislature then came in and put 
these facts in evidence before the district court, which 
made no factual findings statewide at all, ever.  There 
are no statewide factual findings in this record 
whatsoever, none.  And therefore statewide funding 
remedy should not have been permitted.  Sixty (b)(5) 
relief should be granted.  I thank the Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
