PRELOGAR                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 MS. PRELOGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               Congress enacted Section in response to       the epidemic of domestic violence in Indian Country.        The Ninth Circuit was wrong to strike down the statute          as applied to offenders like Respondent who have abused         and battered their intimate partners again and again,        but whose tribal­court misdemeanor convictions were      uncounseled and resulted in a sentence of imprisonment.                     The Ninth Circuit's constitutional analysis     disconnects the validity of the underlying prior       conviction from the permissibility of relying on those        convictions to prove the defendant's recidivist status       if he commits additional criminal conduct. And that         runs counter to this Court's precedence.                  In Nichols v. United States, this Court held        that a conviction that was uncounseled but was valid at           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review the time it was obtained remains valid when it's used in           a subsequent prosecution to classify the defendant as a         recidivist. As I understand the Court's logic in that           opinion, the rationale was that in the absence of an          actual Sixth Amendment violation in the underlying       proceeding, there's no proceeding in which the defendant        had but was denied a right to counsel.                     He didn't ­­ he has a right to counsel in           the subsequent Federal prosecution, and here, Respondent       had that right and it was respected. He was ­­ he was             represented by appointed counsel at every critical       stage. But when a defendant doesn't have a right to             counsel in the prior proceedings that resulted in that         conviction, then there's no defect, no constitutional       defect in those underlying convictions that can possibly        be carried over or exacerbated through reliance on those         convictions in the subsequent proceeding.                   Now, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, and    Respondent's arguing here, that that might apply when        the conviction is ­­ is valid under the Court's         rationale in Scott. There, of course, the Court held          that there's no right to appointed counsel in a         proceeding that doesn't result in imprisonment. And        Respondent urges the Court to limit Nichols to that         situation, where you have a defendant who ­­ who wasn't           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review imprisoned in the prior proceeding.                 But I don't think that makes sense as a          matter of the logic under this Court's decision in ­­ in           Nichols, nor do I think it makes sense as a matter of              practical reality.               Here, for example, Respondent says that if      only his Tribal Court had sentenced him to a fine rather            than to imprisonment, there would be no constitutional        infirmity with relying on those convictions in his        Section prosecution.               But I can't fathom why it is that the Tribal           Court's sentencing determination would make any      difference with respect to the validity of those        convictions or the permissibility of using them to        identify the defendant as among those class of        individuals who are properly ­­                JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you had a       conviction from a foreign country. Would that ­­ could           that be used for this purpose, assuming the statute         allowed it?              MS. PRELOGAR: I don't think that there         would be any Sixth Amendment problem if Congress        chose ­­             JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would there be a due         process problem?  Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             MS. PRELOGAR: I think it ­­ I think that it             would raise a more serious due process issue, but I           think that there are ­­                                                    JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why more serious ­­      MS. PRELOGAR: Because ­­    JUSTICE KENNEDY: ­­ in England?      MS. PRELOGAR: Well, I think that it would          be incumbent on a defendant in that situation to try to            come forward and make a showing that that foreign          conviction was obtained in a proceeding that wasn't         fundamentally fair. Tribal courts, I think, are         fundamentally different, Justice Kennedy.                JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could that showing be       attempted in a case like this?                   MS. PRELOGAR: In a Section prosecution?         So that raises the question whether there should be a          right to have a collateral challenge to a particular           conviction.             JUSTICE GINSBURG: I ­­ are foreign        judgments ­­ are foreign convictions ­­ I thought it had           to be a Federal, State or a tribal court.                       JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm assuming the statute       was amended.              MS. PRELOGAR: That's correct. So ­­ so         just to clarify, it's true, Justice Ginsburg, that        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Section doesn't cover foreign convictions. And I         understood Justice Kennedy to be asking whether there        would be a constitutional problem if it did.                     To the extent that this Court would perceive        the need to recognize an as­applied due­process       challenge to a foreign conviction, I think tribal          convictions are very differently situated.                 And here's why. Tribal convictions aren't       rendered wholly outside the auspices of our Federal        system or Federal review. Congress has plenary        authority in this area, and it's acted.                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's certainly       rendered outside the Constitution.                MS. PRELOGAR: It's true that the       Constitution doesn't govern tribal court proceedings,      but Congress has plenary authority, and those       proceedings are governed by Federal law through the        Indian Civil Rights Act.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this case would        come out differently if Congress had not enacted the         Indian Civil Rights Act?                MS. PRELOGAR: I think that if Congress         hadn't enacted the Indian Civil Rights Act, it's        possible that it wouldn't have made tribal court        convictions predicates because it wouldn't have the same        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review confidence that there's a baseline level of procedural         fairness.             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if       they ­­ what if they had? In other words, convictions           in a tribal court do count as predicates, and there is            no Indian Civil Rights Act.                 MS. PRELOGAR: In that circumstance, then I        think the inquiry would focus on what level of         procedural fairness is being applied in tribal courts in         the absence of that kind of Federal oversight. And I           think that that would also raise the question whether,         given the absence of Federal court review or ­­ or          Congress having enacted the Indian Civil Rights Act,        whether there should be a collateral challenge that's         permissible in that context.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it would be a         case­by­case determination?              MS. PRELOGAR: Yes, I think that in that          situation, there would be no grounds to say that the          Constitution categorically prohibits Congress from     defining the elements of the crime in that way. So I            think that it would be required for the defendant to try           to raise some kind of case­specific, individualized       objection to that kind of conviction.                  But just to be clear, Respondent is not        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review attempting to make that kind of argument here. And the           Ninth Circuit's rule is a categorical rule that says          that all tribal­court convictions that are      uncounseled ­­             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We already do that,       don't we, in the career armed felony statute because we          permit reliance on foreign convictions, correct?                  MS. PRELOGAR: I ­­ I'm not sure that the           ACCA permits reliance on foreign convictions. I do know           that there are a number of Federal statutes that do.           The drug statutes, for example.                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that we already put        in play the issue of whether an individual in a foreign            proceeding follows due process or not.                  MS. PRELOGAR: That's right. I think this          Court has recognized and ­­ and certainly some of those          statutes expressly permit the kind of collateral       challenge that I've been talking about with ­­                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And this due process is        not raised in this case at all, right ­­                    MS. PRELOGAR: That's absolutely correct ­­                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ by Respondent?                  MS. PRELOGAR: ­­ it's not raised here.                    Respondent never attempted to argue that      there was anything wrong with his prior tribal­court        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review convictions. He has acknowledged at every stage that         those convictions were obtained in compliance with the        Indian Civil Rights Act.                He has never suggested that he didn't       actually commit those repeated acts of domestic violence        that resulted in some five convictions in tribal court         for assaulting his intimate partners. And I don't          understand him to be trying to raise any kind of          collateral challenge in this case.                 So I don't think that it's properly        presented here, and I'd urge the Court to reserve         judgment on that issue, which I think raises a number of             complexities, and wait for a case in which there has           been full briefing on them ­­                 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If he hasn't raised it        here, are you suggesting by reserving it in this case,          that on remand, that issue could be aired?                    MS. PRELOGAR: I don't think that it would          be a live issue on remand, because Respondent has never           sought it at any stage of the proceedings to make this           kind of claim that there was any unfairness in his          tribal­court proceedings or that he was wrongfully       convicted in tribal court.                And I should emphasize, too, Justice       Ginsburg, that if he had that kind of claim, he had           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review alternative channels to raise it previously.                  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me just as a          matter of practice, if you know, are these claims of ­­          of unfairness in individual tribes made often or in         recent years, in cases like this?                                          MS. PRELOGAR: So ­­    JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just don't know.        MS. PRELOGAR: I'm not aware ­­ I'm not         aware of any case in which someone has tried to make           this kind of as­applied due process challenge that we've         been discussing. And so I don't know of any Section             prosecution that presents that issue. Obviously, in        some other contexts where the Court has recognized a         limited right for collateral review, for example, under        the Mendoza­Lopez decision, I think that those claims         are more commonly made.                But ­­ but here I think that it's quite          clear that Respondent hasn't preserved that argument.       He doesn't want to press it. He doesn't think there was            anything wrong with his tribal­court convictions.      Rather, what he's arguing is that all of those         convictions should be categorically treated as though       they don't exist when you're determining whether the        defendant is a recidivist for purposes of prosecution         under this statute.   Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the        National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers had       discussion of a few prosecutions where those claims were          raised.             MS. PRELOGAR: Yes. So ­­ so those are          habeas cases, though, where the defendant, following the        channels that Congress prescribed to catch those kinds        of errors, sought Federal court review from the tribal         court judgments. And I think that that actually shows           that the habeas remedy is a meaningful safety valve in           this context.              Obviously, I ­­ I think that the presumption          should be that tribal courts are applying ­­ complying         with the Indian Civil Rights Act, and I think that the            studies that have comprehensively looked at this bear        that out and show that there isn't any rampant         unfairness occurring in those criminal prosecutions.                  But to the extent that a case slips through          the cracks, Congress said in U.S.C. Section that          a defendant in that circumstance can come to federal         court and get his conviction overturned if he has a          valid claim.              When a defendant doesn't exercise that       channel of review and doesn't seek to in any way dispute           the validity of his tribal court convictions ­­       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but how would        that work in a case like this? I mean, let's say there               are procedural deficiencies in one of the predicate        prosecutions. And, you know, the defendant says, okay,         well, it was a misdemeanor. He ­­ he doesn't seem to be              terribly troubled by convictions, anyway, but ­­ so he         says, I'm not going to seek review of that.                     But then later on, the prosecution comes        along. Is he just sort of stuck with the prior           allegedly deficient prosecution because he didn't bring       every challenge he possibly could have at that time?                     MS. PRELOGAR: Yes, I think he is stuck with           the decision he made. And, of course, the same argument           could have been made in the Nichols case. The ­­ the            defendant there, because it was just a misdemeanor         conviction and because he wasn't incarcerated, wouldn't       have had any reason to challenge that conviction.                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe he       didn't have any ­­ maybe he didn't have any reason to           challenge it. I mean, my hypothetical assumes a ­­ a             predicate offense conviction that the defendant may not        have challenged for whatever reason. And yet when the           ­­ if I've got the numbers right ­­ action comes up,            it turns out it's a lot more serious, which often           happens in these multiple offenders. You know, it's         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review three ­­ three strikes and you get it. But you don't            necessarily know that the first strike was that ­­ that          big a deal. It's only when it's accumulated with the            others that it is.                MS. PRELOGAR: Well, that's absolutely the       case. But I think, as this Court has recognized in a             number of decisions in Nichols and in Daniels, although         the stakes might be higher when the defendant commits         additional criminal misconduct, and although that might       mean that he's exposed to those more severe penalties,         that there's nothing unfair in that process. And as          well, there's nothing to suggest that those more severe         penalties are being imposed for the prior acts.                    Rather, the Court has reasoned in a long         line of precedents, that in those kind of recidivist         situations, the penalty is a hundred percent for the          most recent act of violence or for the most recent act           of crime. And so there's ­­ there's no constitutional          problem with ­­ with permitting the defendant to be         classified as a recidivist.                 And the Court also noted in Daniels that        even if a defendant thinks that there was something          unfair about the original proceedings but lacked the        incentives to challenge it, or for whatever reason        didn't seek review at that time, he knows those         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review convictions are on his record. And it ­­ it's a basic             principle in our criminal justice system that if you do          it again, you're going to be treated more harshly.                     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't ­­ I ­­ I            saw that argument in ­­ in your brief, and I'm not sure            I'm quite ­­ well, I'm not sure I agree with it.                          I mean, the ­­ the idea you're saying is        that, well, if there's three offenses and on the third          one, you get this much enhanced penalty, that that's         only for the third one. It doesn't ­­ it's not being            imposed for the prior two.                   I mean, I understand that, that you're       already been convicted and sentenced under the prior        two, but it seems to me as a practical matter it's fair             to say that the enhancement is based on those prior two.           You can't just ignore the prior two and say, no, no,           it's all just about this third offense.                   MS. PRELOGAR: That might be true as a         practical matter, but I think this Court has recognized          that as a legal matter and as a constitutional matter,            the sentence is imposed only for the latest offense.                     And the Court made this particularly clear,       I think, in Nichols where it said that, although         obviously the defendant was exposed to additional       punishment based on the fact that he had the prior          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review conviction, still, the ­­ the penalty in the recidivist         prosecution was wholly attributable to the instant       offense and not to anything that came before it.                     And ­­ and I think the contrary ruling would          call into question some of the Court's double jeopardy         context or ex post facto laws. There's a long line of             this Court's precedents that recognize that principle,       that the recidivist prosecution is solely for the most         recent act, but it's an aggravated act because the         defendant falls within that category of offenders who        have done it before, who have that criminal history, and          should, therefore, be treated more harshly if they don't         learn from their prior misconduct and their prior        punishment.             JUSTICE GINSBURG: Bryant makes ­­ makes a        distinction between a sentence enhancement on the one         hand and the case where the prior conviction counts as          an element of the current offense.                              Would you address what that argument was?       MS. PRELOGAR: Yes. So I understand that          Respondent's making the claim that Nichols should be        limited to the sentencing context because it was a         sentencing case, and, of course, that case happened to         involve a sentencing enhancement. But I don't think           that there's any logical difference between the use of         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review the conviction when it's an enhancement in that way and          the use of the conviction when it's made an element of a            crime.             In either instance, the substantive purpose      of relying on that prior conviction is simply to         establish that the defendant has that criminal history        and that he's, therefore, properly classified as among        those offenders who should be treated as recidivists if         they commit additional misconduct.                And I don't think that the placement,        whether in a sentencing enhancement or ­­ or as an           element of a crime, should make any difference with          respect to the purpose to which that conviction is being          put.             Now, it's certainly the case the different       standards of review apply and that the conviction at the          sentencing enhancement needs to be proofed only by a         preponderance, whereas at the guilt stage it would have         to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. But in either            circumstances, it's the fact of the conviction that        matters.             And actually ­­              JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the proof would be        simply submitting, I suppose, a certified copy of the           judgment of conviction.   Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             MS. PRELOGAR: That's correct. I think         what's relevant, whether in the Nichols situation or        in ­­ under Section is ­­ is that the defendant, in            fact, was previously committed of that domestic violence        offense.             JUSTICE KENNEDY: Should there be      distinctions between prior, A, acts; B, convictions,       that in one case would result in a ­­ the commission of             a crime, and in another case, just enhance the sentence?          Should there ever be a distinction?                   MS. PRELOGAR: I can't think of one in the           context of ­­ of this kind of recidivist prosecution         that would require a distinction. Nichols ­­                    JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you use the       existence of a civil judgment for domestic assault to          enhance a criminal sentence?                 MS. PRELOGAR: I don't think there would be          any constitutional problem with that. And, in fact,         there are ­­              JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. And then you could         use a previous criminal ­­ a previous civil adjudication           for domestic assault as the basis for a Federal crime.                       MS. PRELOGAR: Yes, I think that's right.         And I don't think that anything in the Constitution          would prohibit that.   Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's a very extensive ­­        that's a very extensive argument you're making.                    MS. PRELOGAR: Well, there are ­­ I think          that the reason why that's not constitutionally       problematic is because those civil adjudications are ­­       are valid. They're entitled to the same presumption of          regularity and validity as any other valid adjudication        that's obtained.              And in fact, a number of States have laws          that function somewhat like that in the drunk driving         context where the first infraction, the first drunk        driving incident is prosecuted as a civil offense, and          then a second drunk driving offense is treated as a           crime that requires proof of that civil adjudication.        And courts that have considered the constitutionality of        those schemes have reasoned that there's nothing       inherently problematic with giving effect to that civil        adjudication.               I think this reflects too that the States       and jurisdictions have broad leeway to structure their        recidivist statutes, whether they make them elements,       whether they make them sentencing factors. Recidivism        is a ­­ a large problem, and the Court has recognized in              a variety of contexts that States have a lot of leeway            in choosing how to deal with that problem. But I don't             Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review think that there's any inherent problem with the use         of ­­ of a valid conviction.                    And again, just focusing back on the logic       of this Court's decision in Nichols, what the Court was          looking at there was whether there had been an actual          violation, because if you don't have a right­to­counsel         defect in that prior adjudication, whether it's civil,        whether it's ­­ it's criminal and uncounseled because        it's a misdemeanor that didn't result in imprisonment,         whatever the reason, the range of reasons why you might          be able to validly adjudicate guilt without the        assistance of counsel, there is simply no constitutional        infirmity in that conviction that would preclude its use         in a subsequent proceeding.                 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know why ­­ why         Congress, in the Indian Civil Rights Act, made the right          to counsel narrower than the right in the Sixth         Amendment?             MS. PRELOGAR: I think that Congress, when         it enacted the Indian Civil Rights Act, after years of          studying this issue, was sensitive to balancing autonomy        for tribes and tribal sovereignty against individual       rights. And I think that Congress must have made the            judgment that, given the other protections in the Indian         Civil Rights Act, tribal­court defendants could be       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review fairly and reliably adjudicated guilty without the       assistance of counsel.               And that's actually something that's echoed      in this Court's precedents, because of course in Scott         and in Argersinger, this Court recognized that the        assistance of counsel under the Federal Constitution       isn't required in order to validly adjudicate the guilt         of a misdemeanor defendant.                 In that circumstance, I think the Court ­­        what underlies that decision has to be a recognition          that there's something fundamentally different about      misdemeanor prosecutions, and that the assistance of       counsel isn't essential in that circumstance to validly        adjudicate a ­­ a defendant's guilt.                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So ­­ so they knew         better than Madison?               MS. PRELOGAR: Well ­­                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Madison ­­ the       drafters of the bill, they thought, well, maybe the         right to counsel was necessary here but Congress think         it's not that necessary.                MS. PRELOGAR: But as I was just saying,          even under the Sixth Amendment, even where it applies it          doesn't preclude adjudicating the guilt of a defendant         in State or Federal court. This Court's decision in          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Scott recognizes there's ­­ there's nothing wrong with        that.             And actually, I ­­ I think that the          on­the­ground practical realities bear out that      judgment, because even those defendants who aren't       indigent and aren't entitled to appointed counsel,       generally, in a large number of cases, decline to hire           counsel to represent them in misdemeanor cases, whereas        when you look at felony prosecutions, almost everybody        hires counsel if they're not entitled to appointed        counsel.             So I think that the nature of the proceeding          here really is critical in helping to understand why         Congress's judgment was rational, why the ­­ why the         Indian Civil Rights Act represents a reasonable baseline         level of ­­ of procedural fairness that's guaranteed to         tribal­court defendants, and why there's nothing wrong,       then, with giving effect to those tribal­court judgments        if the defendant fails to learn from his past behavior          and his past punishment.                These are offenders who have been repeatedly       punished by their tribal courts. It requires at least          two prior convictions. And the problem is, is that the           tribal courts, for the most part, are limited to         misdemeanor punishment, and that, for this class of        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review offenders, has proven to be an ineffective remedy; it         hasn't deterred the additional misconduct.                 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The tribal ­­ there was a         limit ­­ I think has been raised ­­ there is a limit on               the punishment, the incarceration that a tribal court         could order. I think it was ­­ wasn't it originally one             year?             MS. PRELOGAR: Originally, I believe it was         six months, and then it was lengthened to one year. And            it was one year at the point that respondent was          convicted.             JUSTICE GINSBURG: One year, and now it's        three years?              MS. PRELOGAR: That's correct, yes.      Actually, I think this is notable because I think it            shows that Congress, in recent years, every time it's         looked at how tribal courts are functioning and has made          a determination about the rights and ­­ and what to          recognize in those tribal­court proceedings, it's acted       to recognize expanded authority for tribal courts, both        with their sentencing authority, with respect to their        jurisdiction.             So I do think that that reflects legislative         judgment that tribal courts are sufficiently protective       of individual rights, and that there's no fundamental        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review unfairness that's occurring in those proceedings that       would cause, I think, this Court to question the          reliability of those determinations.                And I would point again to Respondent's        concession that if he had simply been fined in tribal          court and had not received a sentence of imprisonment,          then there would be no problem with giving effect to          those tribal­court convictions. That shows, I think,         that Respondent's suggestion that there might be some        kind of a reliability concern with this conviction is          really unmoored from the constitutional analysis that       he's asking the Court to adopt in this case.                     If there are no further questions, I'll       reserve the remainder of my time.                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   Mr. Babcock.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN C. BABCOCK                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                 MR. BABCOCK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               The right to counsel is fundamental and       essential in our country, and that is something that         needs to be adhered to.                 Using the tribal­court convictions in which      Mr. Bryant was not afforded counsel, then turning them         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review into an essential element of a (a) prosecution, runs          afoul what ­­ what this Court has stated is a          fundamental right for years.                 If we take a look at the cases that deal           with the Sixth Amendment analysis, from Johnson, to        Gideon, to Burgett, to Tucker, to Loper, reliability has         been the core concern of every single one of those          decisions.             JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you do ­­ disagree        with ­­ I think Ms. Prelogar said that you ­­ you            acknowledged that if the only sentence had been a fine,           no jail time, that these ­­ these two prior battery          misdemeanors, if the ­­ the tribal court gave only a          fine and no jail time, then those convictions could be          used under for a prosecution.                   MR. BABCOCK: Correct. And the reason that         we've stated that, and we don't believe that does         anything besides strengthen our argument in this case,        because the reason why there is no violation of the          Sixth Amendment is simply because the Sixth Amendment        doesn't exist. If this case would have been in a State             or Federal court, the only court in the United States in           which it would not run afoul of the Sixth Amendment is           tribal court.              Mr. Bryant is not only a tribal member. He           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review of course is a United States citizen. But in taking a             look at the Nichols case, which relied upon Scott, and          Scott specifically stated that they drew a bright line          with incarceration in dealing with the adjudication of        guilt, Mr. Bryant was incarcerated for his underlying        tribal­court convictions.              The defendant in Nichols, the uncounseled      DUI which he was convicted of, and the exact holding in           Nichols I think is extremely important in this case          where this Court stated that the Sixth and Fourteenth         Amendment are not violated when in fact there is an          adherence to Scott; in other words, there's no        incarceration, and they are valid to enhance punishment        in a subsequent proceeding.                 So if we take a look at the individual in           Nichols, if he was incarcerated for the uncounseled        misdemeanor conviction, that case would not adhere to        Scott. So it comes to reason, Mr. Bryant himself being           incarcerated, that violates Scott.                            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I ­­ I ­­           JUSTICE KENNEDY: My thought is this is        quite formalistic. It doesn't have anything to do with          inherent reliability or unreliability. In fact, if it         were an uncounseled felony conviction, it might well        have been that the trial judge was much more careful          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review than he would be in a misdemeanor case. It's almost the             opposite.               I ­­ I understand your ­­ the efficacy of         the clear line, but it's more formalistic than        functional, it does seem to me.                  MR. BABCOCK: Well, and I think it's the way           that we take a look at it ­­ and I think it's important               if we take a look at what Justice Scalia stated in the             Crawford case. And that, of course, had to do with the            Confrontation Clause issue, but it specifically dealt       with the Sixth Amendment analysis based upon       reliability. His statement was it's not whether or not          it's reliable, but how reliability is assessed.                   The tribal court convictions in this case       were not subject to the crucible of meaningful        adversarial testing. And that goes right back to what          Justice Ginsburg stated in Shelton in , that        element. And it is an element of the offense. It is             being used to establish guilt.                 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But as Justice Ginsburg       pointed out, you could make the same argument if it had           been just a fine and no Sixth Amendment violation.                      MR. BABCOCK: Exactly, but what we're asking        this Court ­­              JUSTICE KENNEDY: So I don't understand why         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review one is reliable and the other is not reliable, other          than the formalistic argument which I can understand.                     MR. BABCOCK: And we are certainly not        saying that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction is       reliable, and neither does Nichols. If we take a look            at Justice Souder's concurrence in Nichols,      realistically what's being stated here is that because        if there is no deprivation of liberty, that the         unreliability is essentially tolerated. But in this        particular case, Mr. Bryant was incarcerated.                  JUSTICE BREYER: But did anybody object at        that time and say this sentence is unconstitutional?                                            counsel.             MR. BABCOCK: No. Mr. Bryant ­­       JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so ­­     MR. BABCOCK: ­­ did not have a right to           JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. But, I mean, is          anybody here now claiming that the sentence was        unconstitutional at the time?                            MR. BABCOCK: I a.m., Your Honor.        JUSTICE BREYER: You have? Where did you         say that in your brief? Because they say you didn't.                       MR. BABCOCK: I ­­ I, of course, I filed a             motion to dismiss on ­­                JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I'm saying in your          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review brief in this Court, have you claimed that the sentence,          the proceeding in the Indian court violated the Federal         Constitution?                         MR. BABCOCK: We have not.      JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Well, then, I take          it that for purposes here, you concede that. I don't            see how you can get around the fact you haven't          complained.             So if it's a valid conviction, why can't you          use it? I mean, you could ­­ you could sentence people             to more; that's what Nichols says. You could sentence          them to three times the sentence without any conviction.         You would just introduce some evidence that he hit his          wife before badly.                  You could ­­ you could raise the sentence if      it was a civil ­­ if it was a civil case. And ­­ and                 there was a judgment in favor of the wife, I take it.              So why can't you raise the sentence on the ground that           there is a valid conviction, period? End of the case.            Which is, I think, what Nichols said.                    MR. BABCOCK: Well, Nichols also dealt with        an underlying conviction in which the Sixth Amendment        did exist. And in this particular case, once we ­­                      JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. But you have told me          that you have not ­­ I don't see how you could send a              Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review person to prison on the basis of the ­­ the lack ­­           where there's no counsel. If the Indian tribes can do           that, then I don't see why the Federal government can't           later use it if that's valid.                  MR. BABCOCK: Well, I think the reason why          is because of the United States District Court, and         certainly, in this Court, the Sixth Amendment does        exist. And the only ­­                 JUSTICE BREYER: And then we should hold        that ­­ I guess, that all of the convictions in all the             tribes that are using, going to jail where people might          go to prison for more than six months or at all, for a             day, all those are invalid.                             MR. BABCOCK: If they're ­­     JUSTICE BREYER: Then the law of Congress is         unconstitutional. Is that ­­ is that ­­ but no one's           asked us to hold that, so I don't know that we should             hold that in this case.                 MR. BABCOCK: Well, we're certainly not       challenging the constitutionality of the Indian Civil       Rights Act, but we are certainly ­­                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the      question, which is: Standing alone, was that earlier         conviction violative of the Constitution?                 MR. BABCOCK: It was not, because it was in          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review tribal court. Any other court, it would be.                     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. And so you're        not challenging that the Bill of Rights do not apply ­­          because we've long held that ­­ don't apply to Indian          courts, correct?              MR. BABCOCK: Correct.                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They don't apply to       English courts ­­              MR. BABCOCK: Correct.                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ and other foreign       courts.             MR. BABCOCK: Correct.                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And there are plenty of        foreign courts, like England for a time ­­ I think it's             changing it now ­­ where they would convict people after          a magisterial inquisition where the defendant didn't       have counsel. You're not saying that process violates         the Constitution?              MR. BABCOCK: No, I'm not saying that        process violates the Constitution.                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're saying simply      because we're using that conviction, we now violated.        Why?             Nichols, as I understand it, had two        rationales: One that says using a prior constitutional          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review conviction, one that doesn't violate the Constitution,       is not enhancing a sentence, is not changing that          earlier conviction. It's not enhancing a sentence for          that earlier conviction, so you can use it, because it's          just setting the platform for the current punishment,        for the conduct now.                 How does your argument ­­ why does your       argument change that rationale?                MR. BABCOCK: I think a big reason why is            our fundamental difference between guilt phase and       sentencing phase. And certainly if we take a look at            the offer ­­              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, we ­­ Nichols       itself said enhancement statutes, whether in the nature        of criminal history provisions, such as those contained        in the Sentencing Guidelines, or recidivist statutes       that are commonplace in State criminal law, those        recidivist statutes make prior convictions an element,       do not change the penalty imposed for an earlier         conviction. That's what Nichols said. So the Nichols          rationale covered both.               MR BABCOCK: I read ­­                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Covered sentencing     guidelines and covered recidivist statutes.                 MR. BABCOCK: I think the difference here is          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review that it's being used to establish an essential element         of the offense.                           ­­            okay.             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know, but ­­       MR. BABCOCK: And it ­­ it's not technically         JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Nichols said that's      MR. BABCOCK: It's not technically, we       argue, a typical recidivist statute. It's not ­­         example ­­ for, like, U.S.C. , in a controlled           substance, doubling the mandatory minimum.                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, it says it was        relying on recidivist statutes that are commonplace in        State criminal laws.               MR. BABCOCK: Correct.                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And those        make them an element of the crime.                   MR. BABCOCK: They make them an element of         the crime, but ­­ but Chief Justice Rehnquist also went          on to talk about the less exacting standard that is          attached to the sentencing proceeding than at the guilt         phase. Also, what ­­                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the second prong       of Nichols.              MR. BABCOCK: It is. And in talking about          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review that, if you're taking a look at the less exacting           standard, of course, what we have to do is rely upon the            preponderance of the evidence in a sentencing scheme.         If we take a look at the determination at the guilt            phase, which Justice Ginsburg brought out in Shelton,        the big difference is that has to be proven beyond a           reasonable doubt. And if it was not subjected to the           meaningful adversarial system that this Court holds as a         fundamental right since Gideon, the entire ­­                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't that a due         process argument?              MR. BABCOCK: I believe that the due process          and the Sixth Amendment argument are certainly       intertwined in this case. And if there is a procedural            due process error, we have been stating the entire time          that's because Mr. Bryant is having an uncounseled        conviction being used as an essential element in a         subsequent Federal prosecution.                                       JUSTICE GINSBURG: I can see ­­       JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's ­­     JUSTICE GINSBURG: ­­ the distinction      between ­­ that you made between beyond a reasonable          doubt and preponderance of the evidence, but       practically, I mean, what's involved here is proof of a           conviction entered by a court. And so you ­­ you            Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review present the certified copy of the judgment, and that's         it. That satisfies proof beyond a reasonable doubt.                      MR. BABCOCK: I think that this Court, in          taking a look at convictions themselves, if you want to           take a look at cases such as Tucker and as Loper, it             wasn't enough. The actual process and how those         convictions were obtained and whether or not the        procedural safeguards of the Sixth Amendment right to        counsel was adhered to was of the utmost importance.                     If we take a look at the case in Loper, that            was being used for impeachment purposes. In impeachment         purposes, the Court held that that fell into that ­­ a           different stage under the determination of guilt. And         even for impeachment purposes ­­ and I do understand          that the difference is that has to deal with a felony            conviction. This is a misdemeanor conviction. But even           for impeachment purposes, it wasn't enough for the trial         judge to be able to just take a look at the conviction             and let that in. This Court held that that          impermissibly went afoul with the Sixth Amendment right        to counsel and went to the ­­ to the determination of           guilt.             Clearly, this is more than a sentencing        enhancement situation. The offer of proof itself sets         forth what needs to occur. And one of the elements has            Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review to be a conviction, at least two or more convictions,           from tribal court. We certainly know Petitioner has         conceded since day one that the Indian Civil Rights Act          does not afford native Americans the right to counsel.                     So if we take a look at the waivers that we            would now have for an uncounseled misdemeanor       conviction, we would have actually waiving your right to         counsel. Certainly Mr. Bryant didn't do that. He can't           waive a right he didn't possess.                   Second, he's not indigent. Well, there's no        reason to do a financial affidavit, because there's no          right to counsel so we don't have to determine that          eligibility.             Third, whether or not he was incarcerated       based upon an adjudication of guilt as set forth by          Scott.             And, now, fourth, we would have one final        exception to an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, and       that would be if it came from tribal court. Because           there is no other court in the United States,         misdemeanor­wise or not, that an individual is not        afforded a fundamental right to counsel.                   JUSTICE GINSBURG: What are the ­­ the cases         both Justice Kennedy and Justice Scalia suggested that        in ­­ not in this statute, but there are criminal          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review statutes that allow the use of a foreign conviction to           count for recidivism purposes, for ­­ for a variety of           purposes. And many of our partners in the world don't           have the same ­­ same rights as ­­ that are in our Bill             of Rights, and yet we ­­ we credit those convictions.                      MR. BABCOCK: We do credit those ­­ those         convictions, but we do take a look at whether or not            they adhered to the procedural safeguards that we deem         as fundamental in this country.                 And a lot of countries, of course, do not          deem the right to counsel as fundamental or essential.         We certainly do. And if we take a look at the right to               counsel case from , in the dissent, Justice Alito         stated that the complete lack of counsel is the epitome          of unfairness. That would be triggered essentially as         structural error.              So if we take a look in this situation, the           only reason why the conviction doesn't run afoul,        reliability can't be based upon nonexistence. If you're         an employee in a company, you never show up to work,            they don't deem you reliable. And that's exactly what's          happened in this situation. The only reason why it does           not run afoul is because the Sixth Amendment doesn't         exist.             If we take a look at what counsel has talked           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review about as a remedy to fix this situation, which should be            Federal habeas, it is my opinion that Federal habeas         has ­­ provides no assistance whatsoever to an        individual like Mr. Bryant.                First of all, you have to attach ­­ you have          to challenge the legality of your detention. How can          you challenge the legality of his detention based upon         lack of counsel when he possesses no such right? Also,           there has to be detention at the time, or there has to            be a filing of the habeas at that crime.                      We know that the prior conviction, the last        one, was from . He certainly did not file a habeas             petition back then, and they're extremely uncommon, and        there has to be some tie to detention. That is           completely moot in this case. He has no way to           challenge this. And we know taking a look at the            Supreme Court case in Custis. In Custis, which was          decided just two weeks before Nichols, and that has to          do with an armed career criminal analysis, and they say          that the lack of counsel is a fundamental right. You            have the ability to challenge a predicate for an ACCA           enhancement based upon the lack of counsel. That's what          we're doing here, but we have no other forum whatsoever          to come before this Court and challenge the        constitutionality of using those as a predicate offense         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review establishing an essential element.                  I do also believe that in taking a look at          the difference between sentencing and the guilt phase,        it's taken on a different trend in this Court when we            take a look at the Apprendi line of cases. And            certainly we know that there is an exception based upon          a prior conviction, based upon Almendarez­Torres, but       that premise is based upon, once again, that the         procedural safeguards that we hold important in this        country are adhered to.                In those particular cases, specifically in      Blakely, the reliance that a judge had to do wasn't           enough. They essentially turned those element ­­ turned         those situations into elements. And in this case, we          don't have to do anything such as that. This is an            element. We don't have to say that this is increasing a            mandatory minimum. We do not have to say that it's           putting something on the guidelines more. Essentially,        what we're doing is we're saying we have an uncounseled          conviction that has never been subjected to a        fundamental right. The crucible of adversarial testing        in this country mandates we're just going to let that          slide, because Congress itself passed a law upon native          Americans that didn't adopt the full Sixth Amendment        protections. Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review If there's nothing further, thank you, Your       CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       Ms. Prelogar, eight minutes.                Honor.                                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                             MS. PRELOGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.        I'd like to begin by responding to       Respondent's point that there is a less exacting         standard that's applied at sentencing. Nichols did        include that language, but as I read the Court's opinion           there, Nichols was actually drawing a contrast between         trying to relitigate the underlying facts that led to         that prior conviction versus relying on the prior        conviction itself. And Nichols observed that a        defendant is in some respects better on when you look at           just the fact of the prior conviction because that         conviction represents an adjudication of guilty beyond a        reasonable doubt.              Well, that's the same representation that      the prior conviction has when it's used at the guilt          stage. Thereto, that prior misconduct had to be proven          beyond a reasonable doubt.                 The kind of distinction that Respondent      would have this Court draw would resurrect essentially        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review what ­­ what prevailed under this Court's decision in         Baldasar, where you would have a hybrid conviction that          would be good for its own purposes and valid and          constitutional in the original proceeding, but would       lapse into unconstitutionality and become invalid when       you tried to use it subsequently. The Court obviously          overruled Baldasar and Nichols, and we'd urge the Court         not to return to that kind of hyperconviction.                    And finally, I don't understand Respondent       himself to actually be adhering to this sentencing        versus elements line, because again, he's conceded. If         the tribal court had fined him, it would be perfectly          fine to use those prior tribal court convictions as an          element of the Section offense.                  I'd also like to respond to Respondent's       suggestion that all uncounseled misdemeanor convictions      are unreliable. I think that that's wholly at odds with            the line this Court drew in Scott and Argersinger. It           just cannot be the case that this Court was willing to           interpret the Sixth Amendment to tolerate wholly       unreliable convictions in that context. Rather, I think          that the Scott­Argersinger line reflects that the       assistance of counsel is not essential to an accurate         and reliable determination of guilt in that context.                    And to the extent that that was left in any          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review doubt, I think Nichols confirms the point. Because in           Nichols, the argument was made that although those prior         uncounseled convictions might have been sufficiently      reliable when there was less at stake, they should not          be relied upon in a subsequent proceeding where the          stakes are much higher. But this Court wasn't persuaded          by that, and I think rightly accepted the line that if            the conviction was obtained in a proceeding that was          sufficiently reliable to adjudicate the defendant's      guilt in the first instance, then there is no way to say            that that proceeding suddenly becomes fundamentally      unfair and unreliable when you're giving effect to that         valid, constitutional prior conviction subsequently.                 And then the final thing I would note is          that although there's been a lot of talk about fairness           here, I think it is important to recognize that          Respondent had it entirely within his power to not have          a Federal court consider these prior tribal court        convictions. If he didn't want that to occur, then what           he should have done is stop abusing his domestic         partners. But because he didn't learn from those prior          tribal convictions, because he kept battering women in        Indian country and contributed to that epidemic of        domestic violence, I don't think he should be heard to           complain that he's being prosecuted under Section .        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             If there are no further questions, we would        ask the Court to reverse.                                         CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       The case is submitted.    (Whereupon, at : a.m., the case
