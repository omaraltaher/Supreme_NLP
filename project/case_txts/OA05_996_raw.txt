 (10:04 a.m.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

first today in Marrama versus Citizens Bank of 
Massachusetts.  Mr. Baker.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID G. BAKER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BAKER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Section 706(a) of the Bankruptcy Code 

provides that a debtor may convert a case under chapter 
7 to a case under any other chapter of the Bankruptcy Code 
at any time if the case has not been converted previously 
from another chapter, and that any waiver of the right 
to convert a case under the subsection is unenforceable. 
Other subsections of section 706 give rules for the 
Court to decide about conversion in the case where some 
party other than the debtor requests conversion of the 
case and also provides that the conversion must lead to 
a chapter to which that debtor is qualified to be a 
debtor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Baker, as I 

understand it subsequent to the grant of certiorari in 
this case, your client filed for relief under Chapter 13 
and that relief was denied.  You're now seeking under --

your petition seeks a conversion to Chapter 13 and I 
guess I wonder what relief is still open to you.

 MR. BAKER:  In the present case or the new 

case?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What relief is open 
to you in this case?  In other words, you're trying to 
get a conversion to Chapter 13.  Subsequently, you've 
tried to apply for relief under Chapter 13 and that's 
been denied.  Why isn't the case moot in the sense that 
that relief is not available to you now?

 MR. BAKER:  The circumstances of the new 

case are entirely different.  In fact, in that -- in the 
present -- the new case, the court decided that he was not 
eligible because his debt limit exceeded the statutory 
limitations that exist section 109(e).  There is a 
three-year time span between the two, and we believe 
that the existing case is not moot because he still has 
remedies that he can obtain in Chapter 13.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if he isn't 

eligible -- the new case determined that he was not 
eligible because his debts were too high.  He didn't 
incur additional debts between the time of the 
proceeding one and proceeding two?

 MR. BAKER:  Yes, Your Honor, he did.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Or he didn't reduce the

debt.  If we have a finding from the bankruptcy court 
that he is ineligible, that is number one condition 
to convert into Chapter 13.  If you don't meet that 
condition, that's the end of the matter.

 MR. BAKER:  I wouldn't say it would be the 

end of the matter in the present case because the 
eligibility was never questioned below, was never a 
factor below.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But now there has been a 

finding, and it's an essential finding, that there be 
eligibility.  And wouldn't the bankruptcy court's 
findings in the later case have preclusive effect?

 MR. BAKER:  In the prior case?  I would say 

no, Your Honor.  First, because as I mentioned, the 
issue of eligibility within the monetary limits was 
never raised below.  And in fact, if you look at his 
schedules in the supplemental joint appendix, he is 
clearly within the statutory limits based -- just 
looking at his schedules.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's a question you 
can argue on appeal in -- from the recent decisions, but 
for the moment you have a bankruptcy court making that 
determination, which I think would be preclusive on 
another bankruptcy court.

 MR. BAKER:  The -- well, the -- the

bankruptcy court made a decision in the current case, 
the new case, but they haven't dismissed it.  Dismissal 
is in fact on appeal to the District Court for the 
District of Massachusetts.  The reason is, in our view 
is that the bankruptcy court in the new case incorrectly 
looked back to the claims that had been filed in the prior 
case.

 Now, it is a difficult issue in some 

respects because there is case law at least in 
Massachusetts or the First Circuit that says a debtor 
does not have standing to object to claims in a Chapter 
7 case.  So the fact that a number of claims were 
filed and argued doesn't relate to, in a prior case, 
does not have a preclusive effect in the new case.
 Now we did, in fact, object to quite a 

number of claims and the eligibility, and I think that 
ultimately once the claim objections are resolved, we 
will be within the statutory limits.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If the decision is 

affirmed on appeal to the First Circuit, do you think 
you could still argue that there's qualification for 
Chapter 13, after the court of appeals has affirmed a 
determination that there isn't?

 MR. BAKER:  I'm -- I don't quite follow the 

question.  Would you mind restating it?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We have now a judgment that 

this debtor is ineligible for Chapter 13.  If that 
judgment is affirmed on appeal to the court of appeals, 
can you nonetheless argue that somehow there is no 
preclusive effect?

 MR. BAKER:  Yes, Your Honor, because there's 

a three-year difference between the two and 
substantially different facts.  The -- we have to go 
back, I think, to the case that's at bar, because it is 
those claims, the claims that were filed in the current 
case that are the issue.  As I say, we are in the process 
of doing objections to those claims and I think that 
ultimately we will come within them.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They're not at issue as far 
as this mootness question goes.  I mean, you're seeking 
to have the right to file under 13.

 And if, in fact, there's no eligibility to 
file under 13, you're asking for the impossible.  The 
case is simply -- you know -- it's just air.  So I 
guess, perhaps you rely on the fact that the case is 
still on appeal.  Should we not take as a given that 
there is a judgment that you don't qualify for 13, and 
yet you're coming before us asking us to say that you 
can apply under Chapter 13.  It doesn't make any sense.

suggest that it does, Your Honor, because once -- we don't 
really get to the eligibility question until the court 
below considers it in the context of the case that's at bar. 
We have to, as I say, we are in the process of objecting to 
claims and resolving them.  Now the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, didn't you make that 

argument to the bankruptcy court that found that you 
were not eligible?

 MR. BAKER:  No, Your Honor, because as I 

mentioned before, the case law in the First Circuit up 
to this point has held that a Chapter 7 debtor does not 
have standing to object to claims.  Now in the new case, 
in fact, the bankruptcy court --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what I'm asking.  A 

Chapter 7 debtor doesn't, but a Chapter 13 debtor 
presumably does.  So didn't you make the same argument 
to the bankruptcy court.

 MR. BAKER:  In the old case, yes, once we 

converted the chapter.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And they rejected it?
 MR. BAKER:  No.  I beg your pardon, Your 

Honor.  No, we did not address eligibility in the 
present case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't care about the 

present case.  I care about the Chapter 13 case in which

you have been found not to qualify for Chapter 13 
treatment.  Didn't you make before that court the same 
argument you're making now that some of the debts 
shouldn't be counted.

 MR. BAKER:  I did.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They rejected it, right?
 MR. BAKER:  Pardon?
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And they rejected it?
 MR. BAKER:  The bankruptcy court did reject 
it, yes.  But they rejected it because, as I say, up to 
that point the case law had held that we did not have 
standing to object to the claims, so we were bound by 
what was there.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you said it was only a 

Chapter 7 debtor who couldn't object.

 MR. BAKER:  Right.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you are applying under 

Chapter 13.

 MR. BAKER:  Right.  What I'm trying to say 
is in the previous Chapter 7 case we lacked standing to 
object to those claims and that in the new Chapter 13 
case the court took the Chapter 7 case claims and said, 
you're bound by these in the new chapter 13 case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Didn't you object to that 

and say you should look at these claims afresh?

MR. BAKER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And what did the court say? 

Did it say it had to or that it did so and still found 
them over the limit.

 MR. BAKER:  It -- the bankruptcy court in 
the new case said -- pardon?  The bankruptcy court in 
the new case said that there are circumstances under 
which a debtor would have standing.  This was in effect 
a new rule of law for that, for this district.  So 
subsequent to that decision we did, in fact, object to 
quite a number of claims and substantially reduced the 
total of those claims, and I think that once --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What did the bankruptcy 

court say?

 MR. BAKER:  The bankruptcy court sustained 
our objections to those claims and in fact reduced the 
total substantially.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand that. 
But did it reduce it to a level that you qualified for 
Chapter 13 treatment?

 MR. BAKER:  We are not finished with the 

claims objection process.  I believe that once we are --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course you are.  They've 
rendered a decision.  How could you not be finished with 
the claims objection process if the bankruptcy court has

Official 

 MR. BAKER:  Because the bankruptcy court 

rendered a final decision which is on appeal in the new 
case.  We are objecting to the Chapter 7 claims in the 
old case.  I apologize if this is confusing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It is terribly confusing. 
It seems to me that the Chapter 13 bankruptcy court had 
the responsibility for determining whether you qualified 
under the, you know, under the amount of debt.

 MR. BAKER:  And it did so by reference to 

the claims that had been filed in the previous Chapter 7 
case.  We can't object to claims in a Chapter 13 case 
that haven't been filed.  So procedurally, we had to go 
back to the Chapter 7 case and do the claims objections 
within the context of the old Chapter 7 case.

 Now, in the Chapter 13 case we used the --

the bankruptcy court used the total of those claims that 
had been filed in the Chapter 7 case to determine 
eligibility in the 13.

 In doing so, the bankruptcy court basically 

announced a new rule of law that the claims that had 
been filed would be essentially I suppose, res judicata 
in the subsequent case, but that in some cases a 
Chapter 7 debtor --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you objected to that, I

Official 

 MR. BAKER:  Sorry?
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You objected to that, to 

that ruling?

 MR. BAKER:  Not necessarily, because it does 
give you a vehicle to go back to the old Chapter 7 case 
and do the procedural claims objections in that case, 
which is what we did, and we substantially reduced the 
total of the claims.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is the status of the 
Chapter 7 case?  I was under the impression it had been 
dismissed and a determination of no discharge had 
been made.

 MR. BAKER:  A determination of no discharge 
had been entered.  However, it was an asset case, so it 
remains open, it remains open at this point, until the 
Chapter 7 trustee makes a distribution to creditors or 
files his final report with the court.  It has not been 
dismissed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there's a 

determination that you're not entitled to a discharge? 
That has been made.

 MR. BAKER:  That's correct.

where it says, the word is you "may convert," and that 
means you can convert no matter what?

 MR. BAKER:  The plain language of the 

statute says that, yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No matter what?  Okay, 

suppose they repeal Chapter 13 before you convert.  Then 
can you convert?

 MR. BAKER:  I'm sorry.  Would you repeat 

that?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm just producing examples 

where it's clear you can't convert.  Now, suppose 
Congress -- there is no Chapter 13.  Could you convert 
then?

 MR. BAKER:  Not if there's no Chapter 13.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, okay.  Suppose he dies. 

Could you convert then?

 MR. BAKER:  If the debtor dies?
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  No inheritance, no 

nothing.

it's --

 MR. BAKER:  Well, there is a rule, I believe 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Even though there's no such 

person existing any more.  He's gone and his whole 
family is gone, and there's no inheritors, nothing. 
Then can he convert?  No.

MR. BAKER:  Right.  I think the rule 2009 

says, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm trying to produce 

ridiculous examples.  Maybe -- all right, so you say 
even if he's dead and there's no family he still could 
convert.  That's an extreme test of my hypothetical, but 
okay.  What about if, in fact, he goes insane?  No.

 MR. BAKER:  Well, again, Your Honor, the 

rule says --

JUSTICE BREYER:  What about if, in fact, the 

conversion is part of a scheme to defraud millions of 
people in a foreign country because it will be viewed as 
a signal that they should mail their life savings into a 
particular account in Switzerland?  Can he convert then?

 MR. BAKER:  The statute is plain, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You say yes on that?
 MR. BAKER:  I would say yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Even though it's going to 

bilk people out of millions of dollars?

 MR. BAKER:  I think that the statute is 

plain and says that the debtor may convert.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No matter what?  Even if 

he's dead, even if he's insane?

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well alright, then I can't 

get anywhere with my hypotheticals.

 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I would have thought the 

answer was no, but there we are.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Baker, couldn't the 

-- let's say the conversion goes through.  The first 
thing that the bankruptcy court does in the Chapter 7 
converted to Chapter 13 is say:  I'm going to dismiss 
this suit, the -- the bad faith taint stays with the 
case, it doesn't get -- you can't erase it; and so back 
you go to the Chapter 7.  Why couldn't the bankruptcy 
court now sitting as a Chapter 13 court say:  We're not 
going to let a debtor who has conducted himself in bad 
faith proceed in this court?

 MR. BAKER:  The bankruptcy court could 

certainly do that.  The procedural safeguards of due 
process require, obviously, notice and hearing of the 
court's reasons for wanting to say that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but your claim doesn't 
rest on a due process denial of hearing does it?  That's 
not, that's not the question you brought to us.  So it 
seems to me that Justice Ginsburg's question is not 
answered by saying, well, he'd get a hearing in that 
case.  The fact remains that in that case the, as I

understand it, the judge in Chapter 13 could immediately 
deconvert to Chapter 7, couldn't he?

 MR. BAKER:  Well, I wouldn't say he could 

immediately reconvert.  Again, there is the due process 
requirement that the debtor have an opportunity to be 
heard on the issue.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But due process is not the 

issue here.  The fact is the bankruptcy court could 
deconvert or reconvert to Chapter 7, in effect, 
following the election that the debtor makes.  That's 
so, isn't it?

 MR. BAKER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well then, why would we 
have a system as ridiculous as to preclude the court 
from looking at fraud or bad faith at the moment of 
election, go through the paperwork and the folderol of 
converting to 13, and immediately turn around, 
admittedly having the power, to deconvert?  That would 
be a rather foolish system.

 MR. BAKER:  Well, perhaps, but it is the 
system that Congress has given us.  Congress has said 
the debtor may convert at any time so long as it has not 
been converted previously.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When cases are 

reconverted to Chapter 7, is that typically done before

or after the filing of the Chapter 13 plan?

 MR. BAKER:  Most of the time, a plan is -- I 
don't do it this way, but most practitioners will file a 
plan at the same time as they file the notice, the 
motion to convert.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But they don't have to.
 MR. BAKER:  They don't have to.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And the deconversion could 

be done prior to the filing of the plan?

 MR. BAKER:  I suppose arguably it could.  In 
my view, the statutory provisions of section 1307 have to 
be applied to the question of conversion.  So I think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Creditors -- under 
Chapter 13 one of the prerequisites to approval of the 
plan is that the creditors get at least as much as they 
would have gotten under Chapter 7, right?

 MR. BAKER:  That's correct.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So presumably the 
creditors might want to see what the Chapter 13 plan 
looks like themselves.

 MR. BAKER:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly. 

And I think it's the Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy 
Appellate Panel noted that sometimes a problem debtor 
files a plan and gets it confirmed, pays creditors, 
and everybody winds up better off.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could the district 

court -- pardon me.  Could the bankruptcy court make 
that same determination in deciding whether or not to 
allow the Chapter 7 proceeding to be converted?  He 
could make this inquiry in a Chapter 7 proceeding?  He 
says:  I don't think you should be able to convert 
because there's a fraud, but I'll look at how the 
creditors come out.  Could he do that?  And then you 
don't have the specter that Justice Souter referred to 
of this transfer back and then the transfer back, which 
is a waste of time.

 MR. BAKER:  Well, again, the statute says 

that the debtor may convert except in certain 
circumstances.  I think that the requirement of a motion 
to convert a case gives the court the procedural 
mechanism for looking at the case, seeing, making sure 
that the debtor --

JUSTICE BREYER:  But there is a difference, 

and this is -- assume with me, which apparently you 
don't agree, that everywhere in law there are implied 
exceptions for unusual circumstances.  I have never 
found an instance where you couldn't think of some 
exception that they didn't see.  You could not bring a 
thing if you were insane or dead or if a death would 
ensue or a murder.  Assume that, all right.

Then the question would be, well, what about 

this instance?  And I think the strongest instance --
the strongest argument for saying there's is no 
exception here is the argument that the trustee 
discovers that this individual is behaving dishonestly, 
that he's hidden assets.  Maybe he has a safe deposit 
box and he has a key and the key -- the key will allow 
him to get diamonds out of the safe deposit box and hide 
them.  Under 7, the trustee has the key.  As soon as you 
convert it to 13 the key is given back to the debtor, 
who has been shown dishonest.

 Now, assuming you're going to have some 
exceptions, why isn't that a very, very powerful one?

 MR. BAKER:  Because ultimately the Chapter 
13 trustee has the same powers of the Chapter 7 trustee 
with the exception, as Your Honor is pointing out, of 
possession of the property in the bankruptcy estate. 
But that's how Congress wrote the statute.  We should 
not ignore Congress's command about the process of 
converting and look for exceptions before we proceed to 
go back to the appellate court --

JUSTICE ALITO:  If I could come back to a 

prior question.  Unless there is some different 
procedure required when -- between the two situations of 
denial of conversion from 7 to 13 and allowing

conversion but with immediate reconversion back to 7, 
unless there's some difference between that's required 
by the code in those two situations, maybe it is because 
you have to -- in the reconversion situation, you have 
to wait until the plan is filed.  Maybe it's because the 
bad faith doesn't carry over.

 But unless there's some difference, I don't see 

what this case is about.

 MR. BAKER:  Well, ultimately the case is 

about the language of the statute and whether the court 
should apply it as written.  And I think --

JUSTICE ALITO:  You can't provide any reason 

why there's a difference between those two?

 MR. BAKER:  I'm sorry?
 JUSTICE ALITO:  You deny -- do you dispute 
the fact that the bankruptcy court could simultaneously 
convert on the motion of the debtor from 7 to 13 and 
during the 20-day period that's required by the rule, 
the rules, reconvert?  Do you dispute that, for bad 
faith?

 MR. BAKER:  I dispute that the court could 
do it sua sponte and without notice and an opportunity 
for a hearing.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If it gives notice and 

an opportunity for a hearing during the 20 day period --

you have to give 20 days notice before the conversion 
takes place; is that correct, from 7 to 13?

 MR. BAKER:  I believe that's correct.  When 

you file a motion, a 20 day notice is required, yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If it has the hearing during 

that period, you don't dispute that the court could do 
that, or do you?

 MR. BAKER:  Well, again we come to the 

question of when the plan gets filed.  The plan isn't 
filed until after it's converted, according to the 
rules.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But here there was a 

hearing on the motion to convert, right?  There was a 
hearing?

 MR. BAKER:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And as I understand it, 

there was no objection to the character of that hearing? 
There was no request for an evidentiary hearing?  So 
there was a hearing.  Now, does that get wiped out too, 
just the way, the determination that you couldn't 
convert?

 MR. BAKER:  The procedure I would, I would 
expect to see is that if the court saw an issue of fact 
with respect to whether the case had been converted or 
whether the debtor was eligible for it to be a debtor in

the chapter to which he seeks conversion, then an 
evidentiary hearing would be required.

 If -- the fact that there was no evidentiary 
hearing in the particular case here, I think, I think we 
have to go back to recognize the fact that most issues 
in bankruptcy court are decided summarily on motion 
practice.

 And it is my feeling that, the 

jurisprudence of rule 56 has to apply.  If a court 
sees that there are disputed issues of fact, the court 
must schedule an evidentiary hearing.  It cannot, it 
cannot simply grant summary judgment without furtherance 
issue of fact.  So this is why I say that, 
that on these two -- the two particular points -- and 
obviously, the question of whether it has been 
previously converted is very easy to determine.  But as 
previously discussed, the issue of eligibility, whether 
the claims and the debt is within the statutory 
limitation, is an issue of fact that ultimately might 
require an evidentiary hearing.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But your case as I 

understand it, your case does not turn on the question 
whether there was or was not, should or should not have 
been a hearing in this case, an evidentiary hearing in 
this case; is that correct?

MR. BAKER:  That's correct.  That's correct, 
because in our view the schedules -- excuse me -- in our 
view the schedules in this case clearly indicate that it 
-- that he was within the statutory limitations, at 
least as far as the schedules go.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. -- Mr. Baker, I have -- I 

have a question on a matter that really upsets me 
and causes me to wonder how, you know, how much we can 
rely upon your description here.  You claimed in the 
petition that the reason your client filed under Chapter 
7 rather than 13 was that he was unemployed at the time. 
And that he decided to go to 13 after he became 
employed.

 Yet, on -- as shown in the supplemental 

appendix, when he filed under Chapter 7, under penalty 
of perjury, he said that he was employed, and at 
the meeting of the creditors, he confirmed under oath 
that he was employed.

 What was it?  Was he employed or not 

employed?

 MR. BAKER:  On the petition date itself, he 

was not.  And if you look at schedule I, which is at 
page 30 of the supplemental joint appendix, at the 
bottom line, bottom of the -- and it indicates that he 
was in the process of having a second tenant in his

rental property and that he was beginning a job at about 
the time the petition --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It says employment, 
occupation, name of employer:  Capital Carpet and 
Flooring.  How long employed, five months.  Address of 
employment:  Woburn, Massachusetts.  It also says the 
same thing on page 18 of the supplemental appendix.  And 
also with the meeting of creditors.  If you look at the 
joint appendix at 64a, he says the same thing that he 
was employed.  Was he employed or not employed?

 MR. BAKER:  Right.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does he go around swearing 

he was when he wasn't?

 MR. BAKER:  No, he was -- he was not employed 

at the time.  If you look at his page 18, as you 
point out, it says at the bottom the income given is 
estimated based on a new job which is about to start. 
He had -- he had been the principal of a company called RLM 
Flooring, which had been closed by Citizens Bank.  So he 
was, in fact, unemployed because Citizens Bank had taken 
all of the assets of the corporation and shut it down. 
And this put him of course behind on his mortgage so he 
was very concerned about finding employment so he could 
in fact, keep -- get his mortgage current and then 
retain his home.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Look on page 64a of the 

appendix, the meeting of creditors.  Trustee says okay, 
and you now work for another entity, Capital Carpet and 
Flooring, sir?  And Mark Marrama says yes.

 MR. BAKER:  Right.  And between the -- between 

the time of petition at the meeting of creditors which 
was approximately six -- six weeks later, he became 
employed.

 As I say, he had a mortgage.  He had children 
to whom he has to pay child support.  At the time he had 
a wife he owed a lot of money to.  He was concerned about 
having employment so he could in fact meet those 
obligations.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask, I may have 

missed some of the colloquy here -- is it correct that 
he would not be eligible to file a-- to have a, 
institute a Chapter 13 proceeding if he had unsecured 
debts of over a certain amount?

makes the motion to convert, which you say he has an 
absolute right to make, what if the record then

 MR. BAKER:  He should deny conversion.  If in


fact --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  So he does not have an 

absolute right in all cases to convert, then.

 MR. BAKER:  It's absolute except in the 

two circumstances stated in the statute. 
One of which, is as Your Honor is pointing out, the 
eligibility, the other is that if it has been previously 
converted he does not have that right.

 If the Court has no further questions, I'll

Official 

 The bankruptcy court need not sit idly by 
and grant a motion which is part of an abusive scheme. 
The power of the court is there to deny such a motion. 
It is there by statute under section 105; it is there 
because the courts have always had power.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Under -- you think 

105 is an affirmative grant of power?

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  I think the second sentence 
of 105(a) supports the traditional powers that courts 
have had to grant relief, to prevent or to deny relief 
to prevent abuse or to remedy bad faith conduct.  The 
fact that the debtor has the authorization under section 706 
to convert a case cannot be construed to prevent the 
court from sua sponte taking action to prevent abuse --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  105(a) is much more 

limited than that.  It is only if you take the second 
clause of that out of context and quote it, as has been 
done, that it looks like an affirmative grant.  It says: 
"No provision of this title providing for the raising of 
an issue by a party in interest shall be construed to 
preclude the court from taking sua sponte other action." 
That's a much more limited, narrow provision telling you 
not to imply a negative pregnant from a requirement 
that a particular party raise an issue.  I -- as a

source of sweeping powers to, to basically act as a 
roving commission in equity, I think that's a 
mis-citation.

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, Chief Justice Roberts, 
I think that in order to understand 106(a), the second 
sentence, completely, I think it is important to 
understand it was added to 105 in 1986 in response to a 
number of decisions that were holding that the courts 
did not have the -- the bankruptcy courts did not have 
the authority to sua sponte take action to prevent abuse, 
to monitor their own calendars, to make sure that 
inappropriate things weren't happening, and that Senator 
Hatch when he introduced this legislation which was 
ultimately enacted, the goal was to overturn cases like 
the Second Circuit's decision in Grissom to provide 
expressly and perhaps not as clearly as perhaps they 
intended, to give the courts this power.  But I --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was that Second Circuit's 
decision a decision that said the court didn't have the 
power because it had not been moved to take that action 
by the party who had the responsibility for raising the 
issue?  Was that the basis for the Second Circuit's 
decision?

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  In part, yes.  The court also

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Then -- then you haven't 

contradicted what the Chief Justice suggested.

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, I think -- I think 

105(a), the second sentence is worded the way that it 
is.  It doesn't say exactly that the courts may take any 
action of sua sponte.  It says shall not be construed; 
the fact that a party has the right to make an action shall 
not be construed to deny the court the right sua sponte to 
take an action.  But I think that the implication of the 
statute is clear.  There is this background principle which 
applies not only in bankruptcy cases but in trial court 
cases in the district courts everywhere, that this Court 
recognized in Chambers, that it has specific application 
in this Court's jurisprudence in bankruptcy in Pepper 
versus Litton and other cases, that the bankruptcy 
courts may take action to prevent abuse.  And in fact, 
they must do so.  Because by granting a motion, by 
sitting back and allowing the court to grant relief that 
furthers an abusive scheme in essence makes the court 
complicit in the fraud or misdealing.  We can't have that.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What do you do about 

the different structures, wording between 706(a) and 
706(b)?  I mean, this provision says debtor may.  The 
other provisions say that a debtor may ask a court to 
order, and it suggests a difference in who has the

primary responsibility, whether it is a motion of the 
Court or whether it is an independent action.

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Mr. Chief Justice, I think 

that the drafting conventions between the two subsections 
is key.  706(a) says the debtor may convert.  Whereas 
other sections of the code, like 1307(b), other 
provisions, provide that upon request of the debtor, 
the court shall take some particular action.  Here the 
use of the "May" -- I think the word "may" properly 
signals discretion in the court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think under 

those other provisions the court doesn't have this 
inherent power or the implicit power from 105(a) that 
you're arguing for here?

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, if you look at section 

1307(b), upon request of the debtor the court shall 
dismiss the case, that is an absolute right.  And for a 
clear reason.  Nobody can force a debtor to continue in 
Chapter 13 against the debtor's will because Chapter 13 
requires the debtor to work to pay off creditors.  That 
would violate the 13th Amendment.  So there would be no 
circumstance where someone could block a debtor from 
getting out from Chapter 13, for constitutional reasons. 
That's a special case.  That is why Congress drafted 
1307(b) the way that it did.

Contrast that with section 706 where the 
court said the debtor may convert.  Now, there are, 
there are requirements that the debtor has to comply in 
order to convert, statutory, but there is also, a debtor 
cannot have an absolute right to convert if it would be 
part of an abusive scheme.  I think the direct analogy is 
this Court's decision in Pepper versus Litton.  There a 
fraudulent party wanted the Court to allow a claim as 
part of a fraudulent scheme, and this Court unanimously 
said no we're not going to allow that, even though there 
was a subsequent remedy further on in the process.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If you, if given 

that the court has express statutory authority to 
reconvert from 13 back to 7, why should we take the leap 
of conferring inherent equitable authority to do 
something, when the statute addresses it in a much more 
specific way?

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Two primary reasons, Your 

Honor.  The first reason is that it would be just 
pointless wheel spinning.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, maybe, maybe 

not.  I mean, they convert.  He comes up with a plan 
under 13 that looks better to creditors.  I mean, just 
because there's fraud that offends the court and prompts 
it to take action prior to conversion doesn't mean that

that's going to be the same situation after conversion.

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  But the debtor could argue in 
the context of the motion to convert, well, I would like 
to propose a Chapter 13 plan, perhaps the misconduct 
wasn't that severe, and the court can take that into 
consideration allowing the debtor to proceed.  But where 
as here you have a clear case of abuse, the court should 
be entitled to nip it in the bud at that particular 
point in time.  Allowing the court to senselessly say, 
"Oh, go ahead and convert -- "

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even if it might 

injure the creditors.

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, the court can take that 
into account.  The court is not -- is not shackled under 
section 706 to deny conversion, it can consider various 
factors.  If all the creditors were to come up and say: 
"We know the debtor has been abusing the bankruptcy 
system, but we think you should allow the conversion to 
a Chapter 13 case because perhaps that will work for the 
particular circumstances."  But whereas here there was 
no such thing, the creditors were saying don't allow 
conversion, this is part of an abusive scheme.  The 
trustee was saying don't allow conversion, this is part 
of an abusive scheme, the bankruptcy court -- if the 
court had signed the order, then that affects the

 Is the court itself now not participating by 

allowing it to happen, this sort of fraudulent scheme? 
The court should be able to nip it in the bud.  Debtors 
who are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What limitations 

would you recognize on this inherent authority to take 
action?  Where do they come from?

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well I think that --

Mr. Chief Justice, I think that they're the same sorts 
of limitations that require the district court, when it 
is considering invocation of its inherent powers, 
whether to exercise them or not, we have always sort of 
recognized a special situation for bad faith conduct and 
clearly abusive schemes.  Where those occur as in this 
case, the bankruptcy court looks at the circumstances, 
holds a hearing as was held this case, considers the 
views of the parties who are involved, and then decides.
 Now it is a relatively high bar.  You know, 

bad faith -- it is a continuum.  Where you have the 
honest but unfortunate debtor, abides by all the rules, 
clearly no bad faith implication would apply.  At 
the other end of the spectrum where you have a debtor 
who conceals assets, doesn't disclose, it's found out in 
bankruptcy and then as soon as the trustee finds out and

is hot on the debtor's trail, then seeks to convert to 
get out from bankruptcy, well, there you have a 
clear-cut case of abuse that can't be tolerated.

 Now I think that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Brunstad, are you going 
to address the mootness point?  Do you think the case is 
moot?

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, Justice Scalia.  I think 
candidly, the case is not moot.  There is a good reason 
why we do not allow in our system two separate 
bankruptcy cases to be pending at the same time.  Once a 
first bankruptcy case has started, the court 
jurisdiction attaches its exclusive jurisdiction, and I 
think the second bankruptcy case that was filed while 
the first bankruptcy case was still pending was filed 
without jurisdiction and there was actually no 
jurisdiction, because of the prior existing case.

 Additionally, I think we have to recognize 

that there were different debt levels at different 
times.  I don't know exactly what they were, but for the 
first case there was debt level A. About three years 
later, there was debt level B, which may well have been 
higher.  On remand if the debtor were to succeed, which 
I hope the Court does not allow the debtor to proceed, 
or succeed here, but on remand if it were determined

that with the first case the debt levels were properly 
below the limits under 109(e), then the debtor would be 
eligible to convert as far as that criteria is 
concerned.  We do not know absolutely that that would 
not be able to be satisfied in the existing case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did you make the 

jurisdictional objection before the second bankruptcy 
court?

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  We did not participate in the 

second case and make that objection, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  How so?
 MR. BRUNSTAD:  I think that it was 

primarily, it was, the debtor was litigating and we did 
not make the jurisdictional argument.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I find that extraordinary.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So it wouldn't be 

before the First Circuit.

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  That particular issue, I 

think the appeal of the second case is pending before 
the district court.  I think that the bankruptcy judge 
disposed of the case pretty summarily and decided that

schedules, does not have the eligibility requirements 
for the second case, and therefore dismissed it.

upon the facts in the first case which is still pending, 
that it could be converted.  I think candidly, I need to 
say that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's hardly a summary 
disposition.  The opinion goes on for pages and pages.

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, this particular 

bankruptcy judge obviously had a lot of experience with 
this particular debtor, having presided over the first 
case as well, Justice Ginsburg.  So I think the 
bankruptcy court was very fully apprised of the facts 
and circumstances surrounding the case, with the record 
and having written several opinions already in the first 
bankruptcy case which was still pending.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  This case, your case?
 MR. BRUNSTAD:  The current case today, yes, 

Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this question. 

If the remedy of not allowing them to convert to Chapter 
13 is denied, are there other remedies that the 
bankruptcy court can impose against the debtor who 
engages in misconduct of this kind?

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, Justice Stevens, but 

they're not tailored to this particular problem or 
abuse.  They are remedies, for example, the denial of 
the discharge for concealing assets under section 727.

Official 

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Are there any criminal 

sanctions?

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  There might be criminal 

sanctions for willful -- basically, in essence, it's 
sort of an idea of theft, you know, by not disclosing 
assets, but it's a relatively high bar for criminality. 
But that won't protect the creditors in the Chapter 7 
case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Then how are the creditors 

hurt by this series of events?

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, the creditors are hurt 
because in the chapter 7 case, once the bankruptcy case 
is filed, the trustee takes possession of all the 
debtor's property, which becomes property of the estate. 
The trustee's role is to liquidate the property and 
distribute the proceeds to creditors.  When the case is 
converted to Chapter 13, under 1306, the property 
revests in the debtor, including any concealed property. 
At that point, under section 348, upon conversion, the 
Chapter 7 trustee is disenfranchised.  His services 
terminate.  What debtors in bankruptcy who are 
perpetuating this kind of concealment scheme want you to 
do is say oh no, you can go ahead and convert, and then 
maybe we'll deal with it later, because maybe later on

in the proceedings something will happen.  The Chapter 
13 trustee might not be apprised of it.

 The case might go to a different bankruptcy 
judge.  In some jurisdictions, the Chapter 13 docket is 
heard by an entirely separate bankruptcy judge.  They 
would like to get the benefit of delay in conversion, 
because perhaps they can get away with it in the 
subsequent Chapter 13 case.  Or alternatively in the 
Chapter 13 case, if the debtor doesn't file a plan, then 
the Chapter 13 trustee, who may have hundreds and 
hundreds of Chapter 13 cases he or she is responsible 
for, on a check list might simply check off no plan 
filed, case dismissed, in which case the creditors don't 
get the benefit of the liquidation, they don't get the 
benefit of the assets being recovered, they don't get 
equality of distribution under the Chapter 7 scheme, and 
the debtor's fraud is in essence gotten away with.  So 
that is why, when a motion to convert comes up and the 
bankruptcy court sees --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Wouldn't a Chapter 7 case 

be refiled immediately?

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Not necessarily, Your Honor. 

Not necessarily.  The debtor could move to another 
jurisdiction.

going to let him just run away with the assets, are 
they?

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, Justice Stevens, in 

many many Chapter 7 cases, in many many bankruptcy 
cases, you have creditors, most of the creditors may 
hold claims of $500, $1,000, $3,000.  This case is 
unique because there happened to be a creditor, Citizens 
Bank, who was owed hundreds of thousands of dollars who 
had an interest in pursuing the case.  In many other 
cases -- that's why -- one of the reasons why we have a 
Chapter 7 trustee, to represent the interest of myriad small 
claimants who collectively have no individual incentive 
to really incur all the costs to monitor the system.

 By converting the case from 7 to 13, 
disenfranchising that representative of all the 
creditors, the debtor who wants to play the game of 
concealing the assets, and catch me if you can, can in 
essence get away with it.  This bankruptcy judge 
understood this.  This bankruptcy judge denied the 
conversion so we would keep the case in Chapter 7, the 
Chapter 7 trustee could do his job, collect the assets 
--

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could the Chapter 7 

trustee be appointed the trustee in the Chapter 13, the 
same trustee who has now been -- he's terminated because

the Chapter 7 has been converted.  Could the court in 
the Chapter 13 format appoint the same trustee?

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  No, Justice Ginsburg.  There 

is a standing Chapter 13 trustee in Chapter 13 cases 
that handles all the Chapter 13 cases, unless for some 
reason that Chapter 13 trustee must recuse him or 
herself.  Under section 348, once the case is converted 
from 7 to 13, the Chapter 7 trustee services are 
terminated.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What does the trustee do? 

He's not really a trustee under 13, is he?

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  The Chapter 13 trustee --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, the property 

doesn't vest in him, you've told it.  It remains in the 
ownership of the debtor?

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, Justice Scalia.  The 

Chapter 13 trustee is probably characterized mostly an 
administrative person, who supervises to see that the 
Chapter 13 procedures are complied with, has the debtor 
filed the Chapter 13 plan.  If not --

MR. BRUNSTAD:  In practical reality, that's 

correct, Justice Scalia.  What the Chapter 13 trustee 
does is, if a plan is not filed, moves to dismiss the case. 
If a plan is filed, may look at the plan.  If the 
plan is confirmed, acts as the disbursing agent.  The 
debtor typically makes payments under the plan to the 
Chapter 13 trustee.  The Chapter 13 trustee then makes 
distributions to creditors.  And on Chapter 13 day in 
many jurisdictions, one day a week or every other week, 
the Chapter 13 trustee will come to court with hundreds 
and hundreds and hundreds of files.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's called Chapter 13 day?
 MR. BRUNSTAD:  In many places it is, Your 

Honor, and they have a Chapter 13 bankruptcy judge. 
Often it's assigned to the most junior bankruptcy judge 
sitting in the particular jurisdiction.  With hundreds 
and hundreds of cases, the Chapter 13 trustee has 
neither the incentive nor the resources to do the things 
that a Chapter 7 trustee does every single day.  And not 
only that, the Chapter 13 trustee does not have the 
power to go after collecting all of the property and 
liquidating it.  It's denied that power under the 
statutory scheme.

 So it makes no sense.  It's pointless to say 
we must -- the bankruptcy judge must idly sit by, grant

a motion that's part of this abusive scheme, allow the 
case to be converted to Chapter 13, hold another 
hearing, have a second set of papers perhaps, only to 
send the case back to Chapter 7.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The sense it makes 

is that that's what the statute provides, and rather 
than relying on this alleged inherent power that 
apparently is not boundless, and that the bounds of 
which will have to be articulated in case after case 
after case, the statute provides a very clear mechanism 
to address the issue of fraud which allows him to 
reconvert it back to Chapter 7 promptly.

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, I think, Mr. Chief 
Justice, in the Link case, the Court rejected that 
argument in construing section 41(b), where the Court 
said, quote, "neither the permissive language of the 
rule, which merely authorizes a motion by the defendant, 
nor its policy requires us to conclude that it was the 
purpose of the rule to be abrogate the power of courts 
acting on their own initiative to clear their calendars 
of cases that have remained dormant because of the 
inaction or dilatoriness of the parties seeking relief." 
Likewise in Chambers, I think the same principle 
applied.  The Court said, we don't need to wait and deal 
with these subsequently occurring procedures to remedy

the problem.  We should do it now.

 And that is the -- that is the clear import 

of this Court's unanimous decision in Pepper versus 
Litton.  There was a remedy of equitable subordination 
for the fraudulent claim that could have been invoked 
far later in the proceeding.  And this Court unanimously 
said no, you don't have to wait for that proceeding 
later.  Where it's clear that there has been fraud, the 
creditor's scheme has been fraudulent, a fraudulent 
claim, the court can act at the time of allowance of the 
claim and simply deny the claim.  The reason for it, I 
think, is the reason articulated in Chambers.  The 
integrity of the court itself is implicated if it has to 
sit back idly by and watch the abusive process unfold.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I still 

haven't gotten an answer, I think, on what the prejudice 
is.  Who is prejudiced by the procedure set forth in 
the statute?  The conversion takes place.  The judge 
then says, because of this fraud, I'm going to reconvert 
it to Chapter 7.  Who suffers under that?  You say sit 
idly by, but I don't see the long passage of time.

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, the creditors suffer, 
Mr. Chief Justice.  And they suffer because there are 
additional administrative costs that are incurred that 
compete with their distributions.  We're already talking

about dividing up an inadequate pie to satisfy all 
claims in full.  Having a second set of procedures 
prejudices the creditors.  It prejudices the court. 
Bankruptcy judges can have thousands and thousands of 
cases on their dockets.  To have to have a second set 
of procedures, a second hearing, it burdens the court 
unnecessarily.  And again, it also implicates, again, 
and I think this is fundamental, the integrity of the 
process.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it true or not what I 

said, because I don't know the area, that if in fact you 
had a dishonest debtor, the present -- the proceeding is 
dismissed on 7.  He gets the papers back.  The papers 
permit him access to a hidden source of resources, and 
he steals them basically.  Is that possible or is that 
fanciful?

 MR. BRUNSTAD:  Justice Breyer, that is 

certainly possible, and I think that is why Congress has 
said you don't have an absolute right as a debtor under 
section 707 to dismiss your Chapter 7 case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

 SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS

 MS. BLATT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 A bankruptcy court has the inherent 

authority to sanction a debtor who has acted in bad 
faith by denying his request to convert a Chapter 7 case 
to Chapter 13.  Courts have the inherent authority to 
take appropriate action to prevent an abuse of process. 
Nothing in the Bankruptcy Code or section 706 purports 
to impair or limit the bankruptcy court's power to 
police the integrity of its own proceedings.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why isn't the power to 

reconvert sufficient?

 MS. BLATT:  The power to reconvert under 
section 1307(c) is in this case, where the court is 
already confronted with an adjudicated bad faith 
litigator, it's indirect, it's inefficient, and it's 
inadequate to protect the bankruptcy process.  The 
potential for abuse is very significant if the case 
languishes in Chapter 13 for any period of time because 
the bad faith debtor gets control over the very asset he 
fraudulently sought to conceal.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what are the 

odds that that's going to happen if you have a judge 
who's exercised enough by the fraud to exercise inherent 
authority to deny relief?  He's not going to let it 
languish under Chapter 13.

 MS. BLATT:  Well, he may or may not. 

Bankruptcy courts have thousands of cases, and if there 
is an absolute automatic right to convert, a court with 
thousands of cases may put off that Chapter 13 
reconversion to another day.  Moreover, there may be 
individual creditors without a sufficient stake to raise 
the issue, and the Chapter 7 trustee who typically will 
uncover the fraud cannot oppose conversion if there's a 
right to convert in bad faith, and the Chapter 13 
trustee or the United States --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why wouldn't 
that trustee recommend to the bankruptcy judge that he 
reconvert it to Chapter 7?

 MS. BLATT:  Well, the Chapter 7 trustee is, 
he's terminated on conversion.  It doesn't raise Chapter 
13 issues.  The much more likely scenario is the Chapter 
7 trustee will tell the United States trustee or the 
Chapter 13 trustee, but they may or may not learn about 
it until after the case converts.  In jurisdictions

 MS. BLATT:  Well, we're talking about a case 

the court may or may not know about the fraud, and 
the trustee may or may not tell someone in time.  If 
there's --

absolute right, and bad faith is not a grounds for the 
conversion --

motion, he must know about it.  He must have a reason to 
deny.

 MS. BLATT:  We're by hypothesis talking 

about an absolute right to convert, and what I'm trying 
to say, in jurisdictions where there is an absolute 
right, the practice of bankruptcy courts is not to 
simultaneously convert.  It does happen on occasion, but 
the more likely scenario is that a significant period of

time passes.  But the other point is that if there's a 
simultaneous conversion it's a completely pointless and 
burdensome process, and here's why: A conversion and 
simultaneous conversion causes the termination and 
reappointment of the Chapter 7 trustee, the appointment 
and the immediate termination of the Chapter 13 trustee, 
and to the extent there's already pending Chapter 7 
proceedings for dismissal or denial of discharge, the 
conversion would appear to us to moot those proceedings 
and require their reinstatement.  And this is a completely 
unnecessary waste of everyone's time and energy.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I just clear up one 
detail that's confusing to me.  The -- are there two 
judges?  Does the same judge rule on both the motion to 
convert and the motion to reconvert?

 MS. BLATT:  Yes, in the majority of 

jurisdictions.  There are one or two jurisdictions where 
there are different judges, but the vast majority it's 
before the same judge.  But a -- if a -- if there's a --
if there's a right to convert in bad faith, all you have 
is a notice of conversion and, assuming the eligibility 
is met and it hasn't previously converted, a court may 
say, well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I wouldn't call it a 
right to convert in bad faith.  If it's a right, it's a

right to convert despite the allegation of bad faith. 
It's not a right to convert in bad faith.  No one is 
arguing for that.

 MS. BLATT:  Well, I think that our point is 
that the absence of bad faith is implicit in the statute 
because there is this background rule.  When a litigant 
comes to a court that's already abused the court's 
process or seeks relief of bad faith, it is a core 
element of a court's inherent authority to simply deny 
relief.  You can toss out an entire complaint when a 
litigant seeks it in bad faith.  If there was an 
apparent benefit to this, go to 13 first or deny it, the 
United States trustee wouldn't be here.  We see no 
benefit to the debtor to require the court to convert 
and then reconvert.  All it is is an unnecessary waste 
of everyone's time, and this is a core element of an 
inherit authority.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about the idea 

that the debtor can come in and say under 13, look, 
whether the facts bear this out in this case or not, 
I've got a job now.  I can pay off my debtors -- my 
creditors according to this plan, and, as the statute 
requires, the creditors get more under 13 than under 
under 7.  That's a benefit to everybody.

Official 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And he says, I'm 

sorry about that bad faith business.

 MS. BLATT:  Sure.  Right.  And there's 
nothing to stop a debtor who truly converts and has 
found religion and wants to come clean for arguing:  Let 
me convert, it's in the interest of everybody if I do 
convert.  This is a discretionary right to deny relief. 
The court is free to allow conversion.

 But under the plain terms of section 

1370(c), the court has the power to dismiss or reconvert 
a case to Chapter 7 without waiting for a plan to be 
filed.  There's no requirement that the court has to sit 
there for 15 days and see if there's a plan.  A Chapter 
7 -- excuse me --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If the statute 

didn't provide that a Chapter 13 plan could be 
reconverted to a Chapter 7, would the court have the 
inherent equitable authority to do that?

 MS. BLATT:  To reconvert to Chapter 7?
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.
 MS. BLATT:  I don't know if that would be an 
appropriate remedy.  It might be because you can have an 
involuntary Chapter 7 case.  But on this point about a

debtor files a plan in bad faith, the debtor can say: 
Please wait, I've got a plan, I'm working on it, give me 
a couple extra weeks, and the court can say:  No, I have 
the authority to throw it out.  And what's particularly 
odd about this proposal is that in 2005 a court is 
categorically prohibited from allowing a Chapter 13 
debtor to proceed under Chapter 13 if the petition is 
filed in bad faith.  The court can't confirm a plan.

 So Congress had no interest in protecting 

bad faith debtors after 2005 and they didn't before 
2005.  There's no policy preference in the code for bad 
faith debtors or allowing a debtor either proceeding in 
Chapter 13 or moving from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13, and we 
think this is a modest exercise of a court's inherent 
authority simply to deny relief when the court is already 
confronted with a clear case of abuse while the case is 
in Chapter 7 or the debtor has otherwise abused the 
bankruptcy process.

 The last thing I'd like to say is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what about the 

difference in language under 706(a) and the other 
provisions?  706(a) says the debtor may.  The other 
provisions call for action by the court, which suggests 
at least that the authority to convert is greater under 
706(a).

MS. BLATT:  I think section 706(a) is fairly 
read as granting a statutory right to convert absent the 
two statutory exceptions or the court's proper exercise 
of inherent authority.  But the 706(b) and (c) just 
explain that the court may do something or the court may 
not, or the court shall do something. 
So we think our 
position -- section 706(a) isn't even addressed to the 
court at all.  It just gives the debtor the right to 
convert, and it doesn't purport to limit or speak to the 
situation when the debtor seeks that relief in bad faith 
or has otherwise abused the bankruptcy process.  And I'd 
just like to end by saying that a debtor's bad faith 
concealment of assets or misrepresentation of financial 
affairs is really the most serious abuse you can have in 
a chapter 7 case.  It threatens the very structural 
foundation of the code and its integrity.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does the government have 

any position on the mootness question here?

 MS. BLATT:  Well, our position is that it's 

not moot because it's on appeal.  If that decision is 
affirmed, it would in a sense practically be moot 
because there would be an alternative grounds and the 
debtor wouldn't be eligible under Chapter 13 in any 
event.  But we didn't see that as necessarily an Article 
III mootness problem.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess I've been 
assuming -- but the eligibility under Chapter 13 even 
under the present case is a present day question, right? 
In other words, we don't go back and see if he was 
eligible for Chapter 13 when the conversion was denied? 
The question would be whether he's eligible now?

 MS. BLATT:  We have not compared the two, 
the two chapters -- well, there was never a Chapter 13 
petition.  We have not compared the Chapter 7 petition 
with the -- after this case, this Court granted 
certiorari, then the Chapter 13.  But it is on appeal 
to the district court, so it's not presently moot.

 We would ask for those reasons that the 

First Circuit's decision be affirmed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Ms. Blatt.

 Now, Mr. Baker.
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID G. BAKER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BAKER:  Thank you, Your Honor and 

Mr. Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  You have

having been counsel to a Chapter 13 trustee many years 
ago, I can assure the Court the Chapter 13 trustees 
exercise all of the powers and authority that a Chapter 
7 trustee does, with the exception, as was said, of 
possession of property of the estate.  The property of 
the estate remains vested, however, in the Chapter 13 
trustee throughout the length of the case.  It does not 
revest in the debtor until the case is either dismissed, 
a discharge is issued, and the case is closed.  So the 
concerns about leaving a debtor to do anything it wants 
to with property of the bankruptcy estate simply is not 
a reality, and I think it does a disservice to the many 
fine Chapter 13 trustees that there are around the 
country.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not sure I understood 
what you just said.  You said until the plan is filed 
and approved the property remains in the possession of 
the Chapter 13 trustee.

 MR. BAKER:  No, it does not remain in her 
possession.  The Chapter 13 trustee technically never 
has possession.  The title remains vested in the Chapter 
13 trustee.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So is it possible if it's 

in 13 that then the debtor, let's say a dishonest 
debtor, could get back pieces of paper which would admit

that debtor to the possession of certain property which 
he could then take and hide in a way that that couldn't 
happen in 7?  Is that possible or not possible?

 MR. BAKER:  It's certainly possible.  But 

then again, there are statutory and rule-based remedies 
for that sort of activity.  And our position is that those 
rules and those statutes are what should control in the 
case.

 Thank you very much, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Baker.

 The case is submitted.
