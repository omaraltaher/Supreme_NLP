CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

(11:01 a.m.) 

next in Case 08-538, Schwab v. Reilly. 

Mr. Goldblatt. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG G. GOLDBLATT 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  Thank you.  Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

The debtor in this case claimed, in the 

third column of Schedule C, a $10,718 exempt interest in 

her kitchen equipment.  That claim of exemption was 

fully proper.  The trustee did not object to it because 

it was unobjectionable. 

The debtor's position here is that because 

of what she wrote in the fourth column, where she 

estimated the value of the equipment as the same amount 

of the exemption, that her claim of exemption itself 

should be read to say something different from and 

greater than what it actually says. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Goldblatt, I thought 

that what she said -- I'm looking at Schedule C, 

property claimed as exempt.  She lists, as property 

claimed as exempt, "See attached list of business 

equipment."  And then we have an inventory going for

several handwritten pages of all these items of kitchen 

equipment.  And that's what she says is the property 

claimed as exempt. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  With respect, Justice 

Ginsburg, that's incorrect.  If you turn to her Schedule 

C, which is in the joint appendix at pages 57 and 58a, 

the first column is a description of the property, and 

the third column contains the value of the claimed 

exemption. 

The property claimed as exempt here is the 

$10,718 interest in the asset listed in column A.  And 

the reason that's clear, Your Honor, it's clear from the 

language of the statute itself because the statutory 

language of 522(l) provides that the debtor files a list 

of property that the debtor claims as exempt and that, 

unless a party in interest objects, the property claimed 

as exempt is exempt. 

522(l) refers to the property claimed as 

exempt under subsection (b), and subsection (b) in turn 

references subsection (d), which is the basis for the 

claim of exemption here. 

And 522(d), when it describes the exemption, 

says the following:  "The following property may be 

exempted:  One, the debtor's aggregate interest, not to 

exceed $18,450 in property" -- it goes -- and it

enumerates a series of exemptions. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But she -- in her 

inventory, she gives figures, and they add up to the 

amount that she's claiming, so she evidently thinks that 

those numbers will cover all of her business equipment. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  Justice Ginsburg, it may --

that may well be true.  She may -- the debtor here may 

well have believed that the value of the equipment here 

was equal to the amount of the exemption.  But no one 

contends in any serious way that the trustee is required 

to object to the debtor's valuation of the equipment. 

After all --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. -- Mr. Goldblatt, 

this is -- this is really my concern.  It seems what she 

wants is her cooking equipment, not the money 

equivalent.  And if the trustee had objected, she could 

have said:  Well, if they think that this cooking 

equipment is worth more than the value that I put down, 

I'll cut out the coffee maker, I'll cut out the 

microwave; but what I want is the equipment, not the 

dollar -- dollars for it. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  Your Honor, the debtor here 

may well have wanted the equipment.  The question here 

is, did she make a claim on her schedule that the 

equipment was itself exempt in kind?  There are a number

of ways that debtors can do that.  They can write, "I 

claim an exemption in the full amount."  Here, take --

take a debtor who is saying:  Look, all I want is the 

exemption that Congress gives me.  I understand that all 

I'm entitled to here is a $10,718 interest in my 

equipment.  I think my equipment is worth that.  If it 

turns out that I'm wrong and it's worth more, I don't 

want any more than the Bankruptcy Code gives me. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that would be 

a remarkable coincidence if her equipment happened to be 

worth exactly what Congress said she could exempt, which 

is a very odd way of reading what she's put in the 

schedule. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  We -- Mr. Chief Justice, we 

think the most natural way to read what she has said in 

the schedule is that she's claiming exactly what she 

says, which is that she is claiming a $10,718 interest 

in the property.  To get to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would have thought 

the most natural way of reading it is that she's 

claiming the equipment because she thinks that's the 

value of the equipment. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  If she wanted to claim the 

equipment itself as exempt, there were a number of ways 

that one could do that.  She could say:  I claim 100

percent interest in the equipment; I claim an in-kind 

interest.  Here it would be odd to read that, because 

there is no suggestion that has been made by anyone that 

she has any entitlement to an in-kind exemption in the 

equipment. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where would she say that, 

100 percent interest in the equipment?  Would she say 

that in -- in column 3? 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  In either column -- yes, in 

column 3. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Column 3 says "Value of 

claimed exemption." 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  Debtors can certainly list 

in the schedule.  They can list an asterisk and say:  I 

claim an interest in the property itself.  Here the --

because --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I mean, you say that. 

But, boy, I wouldn't read -- I wouldn't read the -- I 

wouldn't read the -- the chart that way. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  There’s a --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It has a column that says 

"Value of claimed exemption." 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  Correct, and the value of 

the claimed exemption here was $10,718 --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

MR. GOLDBLATT:  -- which is exactly what the 

trustee proposes to give her. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  That claim of exemption was 

proper.  In response to Justice Ginsburg's fair 

question, which is what -- what is a debtor to do here 

if she wants equipment itself, the debtor is surely 

entitled, Justice Ginsburg, to -- if the trustee seeks 

to sell the equipment at auction, to participate in that 

auction and to credit-bid her exemption.  And no -- no 

one disputes that.  So if the -- if the debtor wants to 

come to the auction and say, look, I'm bidding my 

exemption, and that will buy me as much of my equipment 

as it will buy me, the debtor is fully entitled to do 

that.  And in that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then you're going through 

all the administrative expenses of having an auction 

where if the trustee had tipped her off, it would be 

like amending your pleading. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  Well, in fairness, in this 

case itself, the trustee happened to come to the section 

341 meeting and say:  I believe that there's value here 

for the estate.  I think there's value in excess of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And she was so --

so upset, she said:  I'll get out of the bankruptcy; I

MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's right, but –-

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It was very clear that 

that's what the debtor wanted. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  And it was equally clear 

that the trustee took the position that she was entitled 

to the exemption that Congress permits and no more than 

that.  And the debtor didn't say --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The question is whether 

-- the question is whether the trustee had to make an 

objection, when it seemed really as clear as could be 

that what she was seeking was to keep her equipment, not 

to get the -- some monetary equivalent for it. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  With respect, Justice 

Ginsburg, imagine you had a debtor who -- who came into 

court and said:  Look, I believe my equipment is worth 

something equal to the amount that is permissible, that 

I may permissibly claim as exempt, but I don't mean to 

make an improper in-kind exemption.  I don't -- I don't 

want more value than Congress intends me to keep.  If it 

turns out to be worth more, that belongs to my 

creditors.  All I want is what I'm entitled to by 

statute. 

That debtor would have no alternative way to 

express that but to do exactly what this debtor did

here.  And we think the most plausible way to read it is 

-- is to read it to have this debtor be expressing an 

intention that is consistent with law and not one that 

is improper.  There is -- there is no basis under which 

this debtor is entitled to keep more than a $10,718 

interest, and under the ordinary presumption that you 

presume parties --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, then she has -- on 

your reading, her claim is improper because she's 

claiming more than she's entitled to.  If her claim is 

improper, then the trustee has an obligation to object 

to it. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  Justice Ginsburg, it's only 

improper if it's read to mean something different from 

what it says.  What she said here in the schedule is:  I 

claim an exempt interest of $10,718 in the equipment, 

and I believe the equipment is worth that amount.  The 

question is, should that be read to be making an 

improper claim that the equipment itself is exempt in 

kind, a claim that would be -- would be clearly 

improper, or --

JUSTICE ALITO:  When I look at that number, 

I -- and maybe I don't understand this, so maybe you or 

your adversary can clarify it for me.  But when I look 

at that number, it seems to me there are two ways to

interpret it.  One is that she is saying:  I want the 

full amount that I'm allowed by law.  And the other is: 

That I want the value of my equipment, and it just so 

happens to total exactly to the dollar the amount that 

I'm entitled to by law.  Am I correct that those are the 

two possible readings of that? 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's -- that's certainly 

-- we think that that's right. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  And the question is which of 

those is the more plausible reading? 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  Right, and we -- we think 

that -- that for a number of reasons, the more plausible 

reading is to say:  All I want is what the law permits 

me.  The -- the principal reason is that as a general 

proposition you wouldn't presume someone to be making a 

claim for which there would be no legal basis.  And in 

any --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Except that the -- that the 

last column does -- it’s very clearly entitled "Current 

market value of property" without deducting exemptions. 

There's no way to read that last figure of 10,718 except 

as her assessment of the market value of her cooking 

equipment. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's exactly right, 

Justice Scalia, but the critical point is that there is

no requirement that any trustee come in and object to a 

valuation if the valuation is improper. 

Imagine she had –-

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you -- can you --

that was -- what you've just said, no requirement that 

the trustee object to valuation, one of the briefs --

it may have been wrong, but it's the NACBA brief at page 

27 -- said "Challenges to valuation are the most common 

types of objections to exemptions." 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  Let me -- let me explain 

this for a moment, if I may.  Imagine the debtor here 

had listed the value at $15,000 and her exempt interest 

as 10,718.  In that case, the debtor -- the trustee 

would surely be entitled to sell the asset.  The debtor 

themselves acknowledges that on page 30 of the 

Respondent's brief.  In that case, what the value that 

the equipment would obtain would be whatever a willing 

buyer and willing seller would pay.  It could be 

$15,000, it could be $30,000, it could be $130,000.  And 

the fact that the actual value of what -- what a buyer 

would pay for it was different from the debtor's 

valuation would be of no moment.  Whatever value the 

trustee was able to obtain for the asset --

JUSTICE BREYER:  In that case -- in that 

case, I guess there wouldn't be a -- a lawsuit.

MR. GOLDBLATT:  No.  That's exactly right, 

Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, in that case, the 

debtor is never going to object.  So we're never going 

to have that one. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's exactly right.  But 

-- but the point here is that there is no requirement 

that the -- when a debtor files an individual 

bankruptcy case, on Schedule B the debtor lists the 

valuation, their estimated valuation of all of their 

assets.  There is absolutely no requirement in the 

Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, or anywhere else 

that a trustee go through and say whether they agree or 

disagree with the debtor's positive valuation.  Instead, 

what a trustee does is they liquidate the asset, they 

generate the value that is there, and they distribute 

that value to creditors. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, they don't always 

liquidate the asset, if they -- if they elect -- if 

everybody agrees that they get the asset itself, they 

don't have to sell it. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's exactly right.  The 

trustee may determine to abandon an asset to the debtor 

if there's no --

are doing there, you -- you argue that ambiguities are 

construed against the person that made the form.  I 

think that's a little harsh when the trustee is a repeat 

player and knows -- and knows the rules. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  Well –-

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  On the other hand, I think 

what you have going for you is that the trustee is going 

to always be at risk that the asset is worth more than 

what's listed and is going to have to take steps to 

value it in every -- every case. 

In this case, it's -- it's clear that she –-

she knew that the Honda was worth more.  She was only 

claiming $2,900, $2,950 on a Honda. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  That's right, and that was 

subject to a security interest here. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and if you take 

that together with -- and -- and the kitchen equipment 

comes next, and she -- and the value is the same in each 

column.  So that indicates that she was claiming the 

full value. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  With -- with respect to 

the -- the automobile, there's -- there’s a claim of 

exemption and the rest is subject to a security 

interest.  Here -- I mean, the critical point is if a 

debtor wants to -- to put to -- to the issue and say,

listen, I really want to keep the equipment itself, I 

don't think there's any value here for the estate, there 

is a statutory mechanism to address that.  Section 

554(b) says quite clearly that if -- if a party in 

interest believes that there is an asset as to which 

there is inconsequential value, they can seek an order 

compelling the bankruptcy -- compelling the trustee to 

abandon that asset to the debtor. 

So there is -- I mean, Justice Ginsburg's 

question -- there is a mechanism for addressing the 

concern that Your Honor has with a debtor who wants a 

determination that they keep a particular asset, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  My concern is keeping it 

simple, giving fair notice to people.  She's got the 

same amount under exempt -- the last two columns.  A 

rule is proposed.  It says when the two columns have the 

same amount, that's a clue to the trustee that the 

debtor is claiming all of the -- that particular 

property.  That's a nice, simple rule.  It tells the 

trustee when he has to object, and the end of the 

matter. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  With respect, Justice 

Ginsburg, a -- a simpler rule would be that if a 

debtor wants to say, I have an in-kind exemption in an 

asset, the debtor should say that.  They should use a

term that is understood to mean that. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's not in kind in 

the sense that she keeps the asset no matter what. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  Well, that's exactly what 

the debtor is contending here.  She -- the debtor here 

is saying that this -- this said even if I'm wrong 

about the value --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  She is contending that 

she would like to keep her cooking equipment and she was 

entitled to notice before it's going to be sold at an 

auction. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  With respect, Justice 

Ginsburg, that's not right.  Here the debtor was told at 

the 341 meeting that the trustee intended to sell it. 

Her claim is that even -- even if he can get more value 

than she said it was worth, she keeps all of that value, 

regardless of what it's worth, because -- because her 

schedule told us unequivocally that she got to keep it 

regardless of its actual value. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then -- then her claim is 

wrong, her claim is objectionable, and the trustee 

should have made an objection. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  But the best reading of her 

schedule is not to make such a claim, but rather to read 

her schedule to -- to mean what it says, which is that

she claimed to have a $10,718 exemption in the property, 

and insofar as the property is worth more than that, 

that that's -- that -- that is a question of valuation, 

which isn't the subject of an obligation to raise an 

objection. 

Also, to the point of simplicity, Justice 

Ginsburg, if I may, the -- the virtue of the rule 

that we urge here is that -- that it does provide for 

simplicity.  A debtor can clearly put the trustee on 

notice. 

The consequence of the debtor's rule would 

be to require trustees, whenever schedules happen to use 

the same number, to come in and file pro forma 

objections.  And it doesn't seem that there is any 

reason as a matter of bankruptcy policy or statutory 

construction to simply require more paperwork to get to 

the same result. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Has that happened in the 

two circuits that apply a rule similar to this, the

with the creditors, and you look at the list and you try 

to work things out.  That meeting goes on as long as you 

want.  And if it appears there’s an argument about 

valuation, you file an objection. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  And --

JUSTICE BREYER:  If it appears everybody can

is the rule where -- where there remains disagreement? 

And as --

JUSTICE BREYER:  The rule is -- and that's

If you have an objection to the list, then 

it says:  Here's what you do, trustee.  Meet with the 

creditors, try to work it out.  And if in fact 30 days 

thereafter and you don't need any more time, so you 

don't ask the judge for more time, file an objection. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  No, Justice Breyer.

the property claimed as exempt becomes exempt.  And if 

you look at 522(d) and see its description of the 

property that becomes exempt, that language is clear 

that it is the debtor's interest up to a dollar amount 

in an asset.  The term "property" here is subject to 

monetary caps.  It's not the asset itself.  And the 

statutory language in that regard couldn't be clearer. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If it's not the asset 

itself and it's just about money, here I have a piece of 

property and it wouldn't matter whether it was a case of 

widgets or my grandmother's diamond ring.  But 

Congress -- this is a peculiar list it has.  It has 

personal jewelry, tools of trade.  It sounds like --

even though those have a dollar cap, it sounds like 

Congress said these are the kinds of things a debtor 

would want to keep in kind. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  Well, but those have always 

been subject -- as this Court explained in Owens v. 

Owens, those types of -- of -- of assets have always 

been subject to monetary caps, and the same is true 

here, and 522(d) makes that clear.  Insofar as the 

debtor would like to keep it, the debtor is entitled to 

credit-bid at an auction. 

I see my time has expired.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Wall. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

MR. WALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The government is not saying that it's a 

coincidence that these numbers in the third and fourth 

columns are the same.  It is a common practice.  A 

debtor will often estimate what she believes to be the 

market value of her property and then divvy up a wild 

card across items in hope -- hopes of keeping them. 

The government's and Petitioner's only point 

is that where a debtor does that, as Respondent did 

here, she's still claiming the fixed exemption of what 

she believes to be the market value. 

Now, I take your concern, Justice Ginsburg, 

this might be unfair to debtors who wouldn't be 

tipped off.  That is not true here, where the trustee 

came to the creditors’ meeting and said:  I construe 

your exemption as limited, and I think the property is

worth about $7,000 more, and I intend to sell it. 

And at that point, a debtor who really 

believed that her schedule claimed full value would, it 

seems to me, have said:  You're misreading my schedule. 

She didn't do that.  She didn't do that until after the 

30-day period had run when the trustee moved to sell 

the property.  Now, she --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What she did do, she 

said:  That unsettles me so much that I'm going to 

withdraw from this bankruptcy proceeding; beyond 

anything, I want to keep that -- that property. 

MR. WALL:  That's right.  But she -- but 

she -- she did walk in.  She didn't say:  You're 

misreading my schedule.  She said:  I don't want you to 

sell the property if indeed it's worth more than the 

exemption I've claimed, and so I want to dismiss my 

bankruptcy.  Which she doesn't have a right to do under 

Chapter 7.  She has to show cause under section 707(a). 

The Bankruptcy Court found that she had not shown cause, 

and the debtor didn't appeal that determination, which 

is not before this Court. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the -- but the 

Bankruptcy Court did that simultaneously with saying: 

And I'm going to deny the trustee's motion to have an 

auction.

MR. WALL:  That's right.  And on remand, it 

would certainly be open to her to attempt to convince 

the Bankruptcy Court again that she had shown cause 

under 707 to dismiss. 

I think the government's point is that there 

is a process for sale.  So even beyond the facts of this 

case, when the trustee wants to sell property, he has to 

give 20 days' notice to the debtors and the creditors 

under section 363 of the code and Rule 2002.  So if the 

trustee here had not even said anything at the 

creditors’ meeting but had moved to sell, he would have 

had to give notice to the debtor, who at that point 

could always amend her schedules under Rule 1009. 

If she had any exemption left to claim, she 

could walk in and say:  I'm going to amend my schedule, 

and I'm going to increase my exemption, because I 

underestimated the property value.  The reason she 

didn't and couldn't do that here is because she had 

maxed out her wild card.  But it's -- indeed, even on 

remand --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What she could have done 

is trimmed some items from the list. 

MR. WALL:  And she still could on remand. 

Even on remand, she could walk in and amend her schedule 

and say:  I'm going to itemize exactly the equipment

that I want to keep with my wild card.  And I'm going to 

say which of my kitchen equipment I want to keep with my 

$10,225, and which I don't. 

So, it's not that -- there's nothing about 

Petitioner's approach that denies the debtor the fresh 

start to which she is entitled under the code.  She –-

she can always claim right up to the legal limits.  What 

-- 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That sounds very 

complicated.  I -- I mean, the thing that sort of 

persuaded me so far on this is this is what Collier 

says, the other side -- it's what all the bankruptcy 

judges.  Ambro is a bankruptcy judge.  This is a simpler 

thing. 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  Well --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Look at the procedural 

rule.  It's just what I’ve said.  It says:  If you have 

an objection to the list of property -- the list of 

property is C, okay?  So here's what you do, trustee: 

Sit down with the creditors.  See if there's really an 

argument.  Now, if there's no argument, fine; they'll 

let you do what you want. 

If there is an argument and it has to do 

with that list, C, particularly valuation, which is what 

these things are all about, then file your objection.

That's so simple.  And it seems in most places they do 

it. 

So why do we want to run around Robin's barn 

or something to get somewhere we can get to much 

simpler? 

MR. WALL:  Well, there are a number of 

questions there, Justice Breyer.  But with all respect, 

that is not what the statute and the rules say.  What 

the statute and the rules say is if you have an 

objection to the property claimed as exempt on the list 

-- and as a historical matter over time, Schedule C has 

required debtors to put additional information besides 

their exemptions. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But Rule 403 doesn't say 

that.  My Rule 403 says:  "A party in interest may file 

an objection to the list of property claimed as –- as 

exempt within 30 days after the meeting."  Okay? 

MR. WALL:  That's right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It says “the list.”  So 

that's where I think you're becoming awfully legalistic, 

to try to distinguish between the list and the property 

in A and B. 

I mean, what do you -- these are about 

valuation, says Collier.  That's all we're interested 

in.

MR. WALL:  Well, it says the list of 

property claimed as exempt.  So, for instance, for 

nearly the first 100 years after they set up the system 

in 1898, on Schedule C and its predecessors the debtor 

put down the location and present use of property.  But 

no one thought that the location was part of the claim 

of exemption, such that if the trustee believed the 

property was in one place than another, he had to 

object. 

The idea was we'll provide some useful 

information to the trustee beyond the claim of 

exemption, so that if he wants to file a turnover 

complaint to get the property into the estate, he knows 

where it's located. 

But it just isn't true, as a historical or 

logical matter, that everything that shows up on 

Schedule C is part of the claimed exemption. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it also true –-

tell me about this:  One of my concerns is that the 

trustees simply don't have time in every case to have a 

creditors’ meeting and go through every asset. 

If they did, then Justice Breyer's 

suggestion, where they'd sit down and talk about all 

this stuff, would be -- would be fine.  Am I right or 

wrong in making that empirical assumption?  I mean, I

Official 

MR. WALL:  I think that's entirely fair. 

They do have to have a creditors’ meeting, so they do 

have to -- you know, within 20 to 40 days of the filing 

of the petition.  But I think what will happen on 

Respondent's approach as a practical matter is the world 

will look no different; it will just have a lot more 

litigation. 

Whenever the numbers in columns 3 and 4 

match up, the trustee will file a pro forma objection or 

extension request.  Cases will proceed exactly as they 

do now.  Property can be sold.  Some will be returned to 

the debtor and some will not. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  He has to.  Otherwise, he 

is at risk that it might be worth $400,000 or whatever. 

MR. WALL:  Exactly.  And I think the reason 

that it's odd to set up that kind of presumption is 

because you're basically presuming that the debtor is 

acting to claim an exemption in kind to which he is not 

entitled under the code. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So what does she put 

down if she thinks this is what the property is worth, 

but she doesn't know for sure?  I mean, I don't know how 

you would accurately value a bunch of kitchen equipment. 

What is she supposed to do?

MR. WALL:  Well, the debtor would do 

exactly what she did here, and if the trustee went to 

sell and she had remaining exemption left, she could 

come in and amend her schedules and say --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that goes 

through -- I think as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, you 

have to go through a long process if you're going to 

have an auction, and for this sole proprietorship, it 

seems like a waste of money and time. 

MR. WALL:  Well, if the debtor actually 

wanted to claim, say, full value or 100 percent of value 

-- there are debtors that commonly do that.  Since at 

least Taylor 20 years ago, debtors on the form have been 

writing down, in the third column --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's right. 

I mean, this is a government form, and you say, even 

though it says "Value of the claimed exemption" and 

"Current market value," that these debtors should know, 

oh, you should put in, as your friend said, put in an 

asterisk and write something else in there. 

MR. WALL:  I don't even think it has to be 

an asterisk.  It's -- debtors commonly will put in on 

these forms where they want to claim full value, even if 

they're not entitled to it under the code, full value, 

100 percent of value.  The debtor in Taylor wrote down

"Unknown."  Some contingent term that places the trustee 

on notice that says:  Hey, whatever the value of the 

property is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's much less 

informative than if she said -- I mean, here she -- she 

has one list that’s showing what she paid for it.  She 

makes her best guess.  It's -- you're suggesting that 

she would be entitled to the notice if she put down 

"unknown," "value unknown" or "value 100 percent." 

So your -- on your theory, in order to do 

what she obviously wants to do, preserve her kitchen 

equipment, she has to give no information or inaccurate 

information. 

If she said -- I think what you're saying is 

if she said a 100 percent, instead of saying what she 

thought was the -- the value, or if she said unknown, 

she would be entitled to notice from -- to an objection 

from the trustee.  But because she has tried her best to 

put down what the form calls for, she doesn't get any 

objection from the trustee. 

MR. WALL:  Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, 

the debtor does have a duty to report the market value 

in the fourth column, what she believes it to be, but 

the third column supports her claim and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That -- is that where she

would write 100 percent -- in the third column, 

rather than the fourth? 

MR. WALL:  Well, no.  She’d write it in 

the third column because what she’d be saying is --

the third column is just subjective.  It's just what you 

want to claim, and, under “Value of claimed exemption,” 

she’d say 100 percent of value. 

And then, in the fourth column, she would 

make an estimate as to what she believed that value to 

be.  And, in the event that she underestimated, she 

could always come in and amend her exemptions. 

I think it would be odd to read a form where 

she cited statutory provisions that allow her to claim 

interest up to a dollar cap and then she had put down 

definite and fixed numbers to say to the trustee, you 

should assume, despite the statutory text she is citing 

and the numbers she is giving you, that she is claiming 

an unauthorized, in-kind exemption, despite the very 

statutory provisions on which she's relying as the bases 

for her exemption. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would she --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, now, wait.  Why would 

the trustee object?  I mean, he would still be objecting 

to the valuation.  You say that he has no -- no 

obligation to object to the valuation.

But if she writes 100 percent of value 

in the third column, that's what she's claimed, and then 

values it at something above the exemption, right? 

Above the permissible objection, he's still objecting to 

the valuation, isn't he?  No? 

MR. WALL:  Justice Scalia, wherever the 

debtor lists a contingent term in the third column, 

whether it's unknown or 100 percent of value, the 

trustee absolutely has to object. 

It -- but -- but where the trustee doesn't 

object is where the debtor does what she did here and 

lists a fixed sum.

full.  The district court looked at this, the court of 

appeals looked at this, all to the same conclusion. 

Now, I think it's important to underscore 

the purpose of the statute and the rules.  They address 

a very practical problem.  We need to know, right away, 

at the beginning of the case, is this property the 

debtor gets to keep, or is this property of the estate, 

which the trustee can sell? 

We need to know this because, under section 

363(b), a trustee cannot sell property if it is not 

property of the estate.  And if the property is claimed 

as exempt and nobody files an objection, it is exempt 

under 522(l).  The trustee cannot sell it.  Now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if it turns out 

that this business equipment was worth $100,000 and the 

trustee looks at it and says, oh, she's only claiming --

you know, less than she's entitled, $10,000, and doesn't 

object, she gets that dramatic windfall. 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  Just so I'm clear, Chief 

Justice Roberts, if she claims that she -- $15,000, but 

she puts a value of $100,000?  Is that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, no, no.  She --

she -- and it may be even in good faith or -- or bad 

faith, depending on the rule we -- we adopt, but she 

gets that incredible bonus because it turns out her

business equipment is worth a lot more than she put 

down. 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, if she undervalues her 

equipment, for a hundred years, Chief Justice Roberts, 

that has been grounds for objection.  For a hundred 

years, the practice has been --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, this -- the 

trustee doesn't know.  He doesn't know.  He looks at it 

and says, oh, that sounds like kitchen equipment might 

be worth that, and so he doesn't object. 

What you're doing is, I think Justice 

Kennedy pointed out, you're requiring the trustee to 

object to everything, lest he lose the $100,000 that it 

turns out this is worth. 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  Not quite, Chief Justice 

Roberts, and here's why:  The trustee gets the form, and 

then there is the meeting of creditors, and the trustee 

gets to ask questions before the deadline actually 

occurs. 

Here, the trustee went and asked somebody 

else, do you think this is worth more than she's 

claiming?  And, apparently, somebody said, perhaps it 

is. 

Then the trustee could ask the questions of 

the debtor directly, and if the debtor -- if the trustee

needs more time, the trustee can do one of two things: 

move for an extension of time to object or simply 

adjourn the meeting of creditors. 

The timing is completely in the trustee's 

control.  They have plenty of time. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but the point 

is, that drags out the whole process.  You're imposing a 

burden on the trustee.  He loses everything if he 

doesn't object, and I think the idea is that these 

things move as quickly as you can, and you don't want 

the trustees -- you know, I may be severely prejudiced; 

the creditors might if I don't object, so I'm going to 

object to everything; we'll sort it out later. 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, Your Honor, but that's 

what the statute does.  It poses the burden on the 

trustee.  The rule, Rule 4003, imposes the burden on the 

trustee to object if the trustee has any grounds for 

thinking what the debtor has done is improper. 

Now, these schedules are signed under 

penalty of perjury.  There are criminal sanctions under 

18 U.S.C. sections 152 and 157 if the debtor is engaged 

in fraud.  There are penalties under section 727 or 707. 

The case can be dismissed.  The debtor can lose her 

discharge.  This is very serious affair, stating this 

information.  The debtor here very thoughtfully itemized

all of the property, she filled out all the information 

on the form, and she did something else, Chief Justice 

Roberts.  On page 28a of her schedules, she checked a 

box that's required, and that box that the debtor 

requires -- is supposed to check basically tells the 

trustee:  This is a no-asset case; there's not any value 

left over for anybody else after you account for my 

exemptions. 

It's very clear from the box she checked 

off, from the information that she provided, she was 

claiming the property in full, the very property that 

she wanted, her tools of trade to engage in her 

business. 

Again, thousands of these forms are done. 

Here, the bankruptcy court looked at this and said she 

was exempting the property in full.  The trustee knows 

this.  The trustee sees thousands of forms.  He had the 

information that he claims forms the basis of his 

objection well before his deadline passed, yet he 

allowed the 30-day period to go by without presenting an 

objection.

MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes.  She very carefully 

listed it, and a debtor in bankruptcy --

JUSTICE ALITO:  It wasn't $10,717?  It 

wasn't $10,719?  It was $10,718?  That's what she meant? 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  That was her valuation of the 

equipment, Justice Alito. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it's not a realistic 

valuation.  Nobody thinks that that's an honest 

valuation of the equipment.  It's simply adding up the

MR. BRUNSTAD:  No, Justice Scalia, because 

she didn't exhaust --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It’s just -- her valuation 

just happened to be exactly the amount that the two 

exemptions she had would add up to.

MR. BRUNSTAD:  No, Justice Scalia, she did 

not exhaust her exemption availability.  She had 

additional exemption availability left over after she 

took for her equipment.  She detailed, she listed the 

assets, she listed a value.  And under our law, debtors 

in bankruptcy who own property are considered experts 

with respect to the valuation of their own property. 

Shane v. Shane, 891 F.2d at 872, the owner of property 

is competent to testify as to its value, is competent to 

testify to it. 

Here, the trustee offered nothing.  There’s 

nothing in the record to rebut her valuation that she 

swore under penalty of perjury was accurate. 

She did -- again, Justice Scalia, she had 

more exemptions she could have used.  And if --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But that's a -- that's a 

totally different question.  It’s just -- it is –- your 

submission is that it is a pure coincidence that her 

good faith estimation of the current market value of 

this property just happens to add up, to the dollar, to 

the amounts that she was entitled to exempt under the 

specific statutory provisions that she cited in the 

previous column?

of value that she could have claimed.  She properly did 

what all debtors have to do.  They are required to do 

this under the forms.  They are required to inventory 

their property in Schedule B; they are required in 

Schedule C to state a value, if in fact they know it. 

And in good faith --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Now, can you elaborate on 

this additional -- she -- you said she could have listed 

something that came to a higher number.  Are you talking 

about the part of the leftover of the wildcard exemption 

that she -- she used it for food, didn't she? 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  She used it for perishable 

food items.  She didn't have to use it for perishable 

food items. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but she was maxed 

out.  Once she used it for that, she was maxed out, but 

she wanted to have her cake and eat it too.  She wanted 

to get the exemption for the food and she wanted to get 

the exemption for the -- for the equipment.  And so it 

just so happened that the equipment valuation added up 

to precisely what was left over after she took the 

exemption for the -- for the food. 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  Actually, the other way 

around, Justice Scalia.  She valued the equipment first. 

Then she determined she had leftover, leftover exemption

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But how do you know that 

from the form?  Number one, I think both sides have --

have an argument as to what the form means.  I don't 

think it's at all clear-cut.  As I say, I'm looking for 

some kind of a rule to tilt the case one way or the 

other.  All right?  I don't put a lot of credence in the 

fact that she -- the ambiguities are construed against 

her. 

I am concerned that in every case, under 

your rule, the trustee is at risk unless he makes an 

objection, and I think that's just going to make 

bankruptcy proceedings much more protracted and much 

more complex. 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  Actually, I think, Justice 

Kennedy, the opposite.  After Taylor, after this Court's 

decision in Taylor, trustees understood if they had a 

valuation objection, if they had concern that the debtor 

might be getting a windfall, they needed to make an 

objection. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but therein -- the 

problem was triggered when they put in the word 

"unknown."

that particular asset, an unliquidated lawsuit.  When 

we're talking about tangible property such as cooking 

equipment, where you can figure out -- you look at the 

pot and you have an idea of what it's worth, you are 

required to state that amount. 

Now, I think, Justice Kennedy, a good rule 

of decision is -- or a good principle of decision here 

is that the exemptions are part of the fresh start in 

bankruptcy, and we construe exceptions to that fresh 

start against creditors, against the trustee. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you have any sense of 

how it works in practice?  I'm a little worried by 

Justice Kennedy's question, because the government says 

in practice what's been happening is that in most 

places, trustees don't -- they don't object to these 

kinds of valuations problems, and now suddenly when the 

rule has changed in some circuit, they do object as a 

matter of form, which is unnecessary paperwork. 

The impression I had from reading Collier, 

and it was -- the opposite was so, that normally when 

you have the creditors’ meeting, things would appear, 

what was a problem or what wasn't, and the creditor 

would then file an -- or the trustee would then file an 

objection.  Well, what is the case?  How does the

the valuation.  I'm sure that happened. 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes.

rules, the trustee has the burden of objecting if the 

trustee has any basis for objection, including 

valuation, and -- but the trustee has to have a good 

faith reason for objecting, and how that is determined 

is the trustee looks at the schedules, asks questions at 

the meeting of creditors, a section 341 meeting, and 

then if the trustee has any objection at all, present 

it.  If the trustee doesn't present it, you move on.  We 

have -- finality is very important here. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, under your rule, 

the trustee has 30 days to get this good faith basis. 

Does that mean that he or she has to get a valuation on 

everything that's listed at full value, that that is 

really the burden we're talking about? 

It's not the burden of filing a piece of 

paper that says I want an a exemption, or even one that 

says I have an objection.  It's what it takes to support 

that objection and how much effort goes to that 

activity. 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, Justice Sotomayor, and 

the trustee has had that burden for about a hundred 

years.  And under the former Bankruptcy Act, they had 

much shorter deadlines -- 20 days, 15 days.

actually go after this information in a formal way. 

If someone's claiming only the exempt amount, then I'll 

go ahead and I'll administer the estate, and over time 

I'll talk informally to people and get a sense of 

whether the valuation is right or not, but I won't 

actually -- actually have to get a formal appraisal 

because I'll just use my judgment. 

Your rule would require something else. 

They would have to get the appraisal to lodge the 

request for an extension or to lodge the request for an 

objection. 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  But they’d have to do 

that in their motion to sell anyway, Justice Sotomayor. 

And also in most cases it's going to be simple.  The 

most common asset that this is about is a car.  You take 

the car and you check the book value of the car, and the 

trustee can do a simple, easy, expedient comparison. 

It's a little more complicated when --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You mean in every single 

case where an asset is sold, there has to be a valuation

Official 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  Well, if the debtor claims 

the whole property is exempt, then it's not property of 

the estate unless the trustee interposes a timely and 

successful objection, because section 362 of the 

Bankruptcy Code, which authorizes sales, only 

specifically authorizes sales of property of the estate; 

and if someone claims property as exempt, if no 

objection is interposed under 522(l), then the property 

claimed as -- is exempt. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My question was –- I 

thought I understood your remark to say anytime there’s 

a sale, there has to be a valuation or an appraisal 

before the sale. 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  If, in fact, the debtor 

claims the property as exempt, that's correct.  Unless 

the debtor concedes, the trustee can sell it.  That has 

to happen anyway, Justice Kennedy. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we know what -- what’s 

-- 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that -- but the very 

fact that it’s -- that there's going to be a sale may 

indicate that your premise is not true most of the time.

that the court is going to determine in the first 

instance whether the objection claim is valid, if there 

is in fact an objection.  How do we know this?  Because 

section 522(a) says value is determined as of the date 

the debtor files for bankruptcy. 

We do not have sales to determine whether, 

in fact, the property is what it's worth.  We determine 

whether the -- that the claim of exemption is valid. 

First, there's a judicial determination of value.  It's 

geared towards the date of the petition date.  Why? 

Because Congress understood that debtors want this 

property, not just a check from the trustee.  It's part 

and parcel of their fresh start.  As this Court 

explained in Rousey and in Owen, that the fresh start 

policy embraces the exemption.  That is very plain. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm very confused because 

of your answer to Justice Sotomayor.  I thought what you 

were saying -- she said, well, you only have 30 days; 

you get all this value.  That doesn't say very much. 

You said, well -- you -- you said less.  Okay? 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  I'm sorry, Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You said less time. 

Which isn't much of an answer, but it's something.  Now,

postponing it.  You can go to the judge and say, Judge, 

give me an extension, which he'll do.  So there's no 

problem here.  But you didn't say that. 

So the fact that you didn't say that

reality is that there are over a million bankruptcy

page 28a is a key piece of information for the trustee. 

When the debtor says, this is basically a no-asset case; 

after you take account of my exemptions, there's no 

property left over for unsecured creditors –- the 

trustee looks at that.  And as a practical matter, the 

trustee makes a judgment -- a judgment call:  Hmm.  I 

look at all the things, does it look right?  If I feel 

like I need to ask questions, I will ask them at the 

meeting of creditors. Which is what happened here. 

If the trustee then is still suspicious in 

some way, then the trustee can seek an appraisal, and if 

the trustee wants to get that appraisal, then the 

trustee can ask for additional time to do it.  If the 

court thinks that there's perhaps merit to it, the 

trustee will give -- the court will give the trustee 

additional time.  More --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Here I thought that the 

trustee got the appraisal before the creditors’ meeting, 

because at the creditors’ meeting he said to her, you 

put down, what, 10,000; I have an estimate that says 

$17,000. 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes.  The facts of this case 

are exactly that, Justice Ginsburg.  The trustee here, 

before the meeting of creditors, went and talked to an

little bit differently, where the trustee will look at 

the schedules, and perhaps before the meeting of 

creditors, the trustee might inquire with someone else, 

but oftentimes the trustee might ask questions at the 

meeting of creditors.  And then if the trustee wants to, 

if the trustee thinks it's worth it to get an appraisal, 

then the trustee will ask for the -- for the additional 

time to do -- do the appraisal, by either asking the 

court for an extension or by adjourning the meeting of 

the creditors. 

But it's very important at the beginning of 

the case -- there's a very important finality question 

here, a finality principle.  The debtor needs to know as 

soon as possible -- and this is why we have an objection 

deadline.  The debtor needs to know as soon as possible: 

Is this my property?  Can I take this cooking equipment 

and can I use it?  Am I the one who is to insure it? 

Can I conduct my business?  Can other creditors lend me 

money now, now that I'm going through bankruptcy and I 

have my discharge?  Or is this something that the 

trustee is going to take and sell? 

That is why we have this objection deadline, 

to basically say to the trustee, if you have any 

objections whatsoever about the debtor keeping this 

property -- whether their value, or the statutory basis

under 522(d) is incorrect -- whatever reason it may be, 

make your objection and we'll have a quick determination 

by the court. 

It cannot be true, as the trustee would like 

it, that the trustee can sell at any particular point in 

time in the future without having to make an objection, 

because that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Brunstad, do we know 

what is the division among bankruptcy judges on this 

issue?  I mean, you are urging that when those columns 3 

and 4 match, that's a tip-off that the debtor is 

claiming the entire property is exempt.  Do we know what 

is the lay of the land among bankruptcy judges? 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  Not precisely, Justice 

Ginsburg, because many of these issues are resolved by 

unpublished orders.  That it is very difficult to 

evaluate and get a hold of.  But I think by and large 

the vast majority of bankruptcy courts follow Taylor in 

this -- in this area and will say, well, when you list 

the value of the asset, if the trustee has an objection 

as to value, then the trustee must make the objection. 

If the trustee doesn't make the objection --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, once again, Taylor 

had the word “unknown,” and this doesn't.  And that's 

the problem.

MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, Justice Kennedy, so the 

courts have to apply the holding in Taylor to a slightly 

different factual context.  But most bankruptcy courts 

say this is really the same situation.  Because after 

all, in Taylor, what the trustee was saying was that I 

think the debtor is getting too much -- was getting too 

much at the end of the day.  And the same thing here, 

the trustee is saying:  I think the debtor is getting 

too much; it may be worth more. 

But if the debtor thinks there’s a 

problem with the valuation -- again, make an objection, 

because we need to have that finality.  Finality was a 

key concept in --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You mean if the trustee 

thinks there's a problem?

that finality taken care of, and then we can move on.

have to see what has happened and see what has happened 

between the parties to determine in one situation rather 

than another what the intent was. 

It's not an irrational rule.  Why shouldn't 

we be considering that as an alternative?  Because once 

we make an announcement like the one that you're 

proposing, it is an inducement to undervalue your 

property, for a debtor, because -- in the hopes that an 

overly worked trustee won't have either the time or 

opportunity or wherewithal to understand that the value 

is off and that they're going to lose something that the 

estate is entitled to. 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  I can see that, Justice 

Sotomayor, but I think that here are much worse 

incentives with the trustee's rule, and much worse 

problems, much greater harm to the statutory scheme. 

Now, Your Honor's question about these court 

of appeals’ decisions -- I think a lot of them are 

driven by the following, which has since been cured by 

an amendment to the rule.  A lot of them involve 

situations where the court of appeals was thinking –-

and looking at the record and thinking the debtor was 

engaging in some kind of misrepresentation or 

manipulation.  And, as Justice Stevens pointed out in 

his concurrence in Taylor, you know, there is this –-

what about this  problem?  Are there 105 powers?  Are 

there -- is there authority for the bankruptcy court to 

basically act, if you have a basically bad-acting 

debtor? 

Now the current version of Rule 4003 makes 

an exception for fraud.  If there were bad things that 

happened, that's been taken care of now under the rule. 

But we shouldn't assume that and certainly not in this 

case.  Ms. Reilly was perfectly honest and 

straightforward.  She set forth everything that the 

forms required.  The really --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  There are 

comparable circuit court opinions and situations very 

analogous to this one, where the circuit courts have 

looked at what the trustee and the debtor have done 

during the process. 

And if the debtor has not made it clear that 

they're seeking the full value of the property, as 

happened here, there was a conversation that the value 

was off, the debtor did not tell the trustee that she 

was claiming the full amount of the property.  And there 

are analogous situations where the circuits have said, 

no, that doesn't show your intent because you didn't 

articulate it to the trustee in the informal meetings. 

That's not an irrational conclusion by those

Official 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  It's not an irrational 

conclusion, except it is one that is contrary to the 

statutory scheme.  It basically says to the trustee, you 

need not object by the 30 days, if you want to sell the 

property. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No.  What it says is, if 

you're engaged in good faith negotiation over a value or 

over the claimed exemption, you should -- both sides 

should be open about it. 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  Yes, but, Justice Sotomayor, 

it is the filing of the objection that triggers the 

negotiation, and this is key.  This is -- this is really 

quite key because the practice is that, if the trustee 

exempts to the -- exempts -- sorry -- objects to the 

valuation, then there is a court hearing, and the court 

will resolve the objection if the parties can't 

negotiate it afterwards. 

And if you look --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Most of these cases, the 

objections are -- the discussions are not at the time of 

objection.  They are at the time of the creditors’ 

meeting.  It is part of the discussion.  That's what the 

courts are looking to.  What's happening between the 

parties?  Have they made their intent clear, and what

does that intent reflect? 

Official 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  But if there is no objection, 

then is no involvement of the court, and the 

conversation stops.  And the reason why you have the 

objection is because the trustee has the burden of 

coming forward and demonstrating that the debtor's 

valuation is wrong.  And that's important because when 

the trustee is now saying, oh, I just need to sell, I 

don't have to object, the trustee is evading his burden 

of proof. 

By just simply saying, I'm authorized to 

sell, I am going to sell, as long as it is not the 

debtor who doesn't object.  The trustee's proposal 

inverts the burden of proof. 

It's now under the trustee's proposal, when 

the trustee files a motion to sell, the debtor has to 

come forward and object and now say, wait, I have a 

valuable exemption here. 

What -- what the trustee then has done is 

simply said, I don't have to comply with my burden of 

proof that's set by the rule and the statute.  After 

all, section 522(l) puts the burden on the trustee, as 

well, to object. 

So they are inverting the burden of proof, 

and Congress and rules have put the burden of proof

completely in the opposite way.  And, again, we need 

that -- we need that finality. 

The trustee would basically have, under his 

proposal, an ability to file a motion to sell a year 

later, 2 years later, 4 years later, by reopening a 

case that's been closed, if the trustee thought that. 

Our whole point about finality, which was a 

key principle animating the decision below and also this 

Court's decision in Taylor, where the Court made the 

observation that, although these deadlines may yield, in 

some situations, unwelcome results, they serve very 

important finality interests. 

The debtor needs to know, is this my 

property?  Can I use it? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this debtor did know 

at the creditors’ meeting -- she certainly knew that the 

trustee was claiming the property was worth more than 

what she listed it as being worth. 

She could have, at that point -- so she had 

the notice of what he was thinking.  She could have, at 

that point, said, I will remove as many items as 

necessary to bring me safely within the limit.  She 

didn't do that. 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg.  Instead she said, this -- the trustee wants

to sell all of the property.  He's filing -- he filed a 

motion to sell all of it. 

The trustee did not give her an opportunity 

to do that allocation, which she would have had if the 

trustee had filed an objection. 

In responding to the objection, she could 

have said, well, I'm only going to allocate something, 

because the objection would have been under the 

exemption rules; whereas, the trustee, when the trustee 

filed the motion to sell, it was under 363, which is the 

motion to sell rules, where the debtor would then have 

had to come forward and object to the motion for some 

reason, but, again, you don't have that allocation 

option under section 363. 

And, again, the trustee puts the cart before 

the horse.  The trustee cannot sell property, unless it 

is property of the estate, and under section 522, if, in 

fact, the debtor claims property as exempt, if there is 

no exemption -- no objection, it is exempt, and, 

therefore, it's not property of the estate.  “Exempt” 

means exempt from property of the estate.  A trustee 

cannot sell. 

Congress set up this regime purposefully, to 

have judicial determinations of exemptions right away, 

and that, again, is triggered by an objection being

filed.  That way, we know, at the beginning of the case, 

does the debtor have the property?  Can she use it?  Can 

she continue?  Third parties -- can they rely on that? 

Or is this something the trustee is going to be able to 

sell? 

Now, it's important also because the 

practice, in bankruptcy, as reflected in the Collier 

forms, is that the bankruptcy court can make a judicial 

determination.  Say, for example, the bankruptcy court 

here had said:  I think there is some merit to the 

trustee's objection; the property is worth $12,000. 

The practice, as reflected in the sample form, is for 

the court then to say to the debtor:  Debtor, if you 

want to keep this property, give the trustee a check for 

the difference between what you're entitled to claim and 

what I'm establishing the value to be. 

That can happen if an objection to the 

exemption is filed, and we're under section 522 

exemptions.  That can't happen if we're under section 

362 sales. 

So, again, the trustee's rule eliminates 

that established practice and that established option in 

favor of the debtor.  Also, the debtor could say --

could reallocate -- the debtor has the right, under the 

rules, under Rule 1009, to reallocate her -- her

exemptions after the trustee has -- she could have 

sacrificed some other area or something and taken --

taken her additional exemption availability somewhere 

and applied it. 

All those options are foreclosed, where the 

trustee doesn't file an objection and the trustee moves 

to sell instead. 

Now -- I see my time has not expired.  If 

there are no further questions? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

MR. BRUNSTAD:  Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, Mr. Goldblatt,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG G. GOLDBLATT 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. GOLDBLATT:  Thank you.  I have two 

points, one practical and one about what the forms here 

mean.  First, as a practical matter, the task of 

liquidating and selling the -- the assets of the 

estates is the work that is done throughout 

bankruptcy case. 

Mr. Brunstad's suggestion that, 

historically, that there was -- the deadline applied to 

the work of liquidating the estate is simply incorrect. 

And, in response to Justice Breyer's

question, you asked, where do I turn to find out how 

hard it is to simply extend the deadline?  The answer to 

that question, with respect to the 341 meeting, is page 

7-7 of the U.S. Trustees’ Manual, which says, quite 

clearly, that such extensions should be granted only 

under exceptional circumstances, and the trustee should 

not continue the 341 meeting when the debtor appears at 

that meeting. 

So that we have a real practical problem 

of basically undermining Congress's judgment about 

giving the trustee adequate time to liquidate the assets 

for the benefit of creditors. 

With respect to what these schedules mean 

and whether the debtor was claiming an in-kind 

exemption, Chief Justice Roberts, you had it right when 

you said -- you know, when the debtor files what the 

value of the property is worth is unclear, the debtor 

doesn't know, when they file, what this will obtain at 

auction. 

The debtor is giving an estimate.  The 

question is whether one should read these forms to say, 

if it turns out that my estimate is wrong, I want that 

anyway, or if the -- or if you should read these forms 

to say, if it turns out that my estimate is wrong, all I 

want is what Congress gave me.

And we think that one shouldn't lightly 

impute to the debtor a claim to be making an improper 

and unlawful claim to keep the thing itself, when 

Congress quite clearly gave the debtor a monetary 

interest. 

And, finally, with respect to the question 

of allocation, the debtor can, at any time, Justice 

Ginsburg, reallocate, including after the motion to 

sell, their schedules.  Rule 1009 says you can amend as 

a matter of course.  So there is still the opportunity to 

give the debtor exactly what Congress intended. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
