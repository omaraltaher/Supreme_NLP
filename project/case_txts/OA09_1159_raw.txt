Trustees of Stanford v. Roche Molecular Systems. 

 Mr. Ayer. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. AYER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

 The Bayh-Dole Act sets forth a comprehensive 

disposition of rights in inventions made by nonprofit 

organizations and small business organizations under 

Federal funding agreements.  That disposition 

specifically defines the rights of inventors and it puts 

them in the third position behind the contractor, the 

nonprofit contractor, and behind the government, and 

specifically says that the inventor may only receive 

rights -- that is to say, take title -- when the -- when 

the contractor has declined to take title or defaulted 

in some respect, and the government itself has -- has 

likewise declined to take title. 

 In this case Roche's sole claim rests on an 

24 

assignment from an inventor who was at that time I think 

25

without question a Stanford employee who was working on 

3

a project under a Federal funding agreement.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What if the inventor had 

not been an employee?  If it had been an independent 

contractor who was working in combination with the 

university, how does this automatic vesting -­

 MR. AYER:  Well, Your Honor, the act deals 

specifically with independent contractors, and -- the 

regulations at least do.  And they indicate that the -­

that the contractor in that instance, if in fact working 

on a Federally funded project, would step into the shoes 

of the contractor.  But I don't believe it would affect 

the outcome in terms of whether it would be a Bayh-Dole 

invention. 

 The -- the critical fact here is that the 

inventor was working on a project that was already 

funded, his work at Cetus was part of that project.  And 

then that result was -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That seems to be a 

19 

factual dispute, so maybe you can be clear on that. 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

According to Cetus or Roche, at the time that this 

scientist came to Cetus to work, there was no Federal 

funding; that that Federal funding for this project, the 

Stanford project, came about after the scientist had 

spent his 9 months at Cetus.  At least that's the 

picture that -- that they draw, that the Federal -- that 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

they got their assignment from the scientist at a time 

when there was no Federally funded project. 

 MR. AYER:  That's what they say, Your Honor, 

4 

and I would submit that is plainly not correct.  We deal 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13

with this at pages 21 and 22 of our yellow brief, and we 

specifically talk about the fact -- there's several 

critical facts here.  One is that the article which was 

written about the work at Cetus, the JID article at page 

135 of the joint appendix, specifically has a footnote 

indicating that the work reported on -- that is the work 

at Cetus on the assay -- was funded by the two specific 

grants in issue. 

 Dr. Merigan, who is the head of the lab at 

14 

Stanford that Dr. Holodniy worked in, talks in his 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

declaration at 98 and 99 of the joint appendix -­

specifically talks about how Dr. Holodniy's work was 

part of the AIDS research center at Stanford and part of 

an AIDS clinical trial at Stanford, and all of that work 

was federally funded.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just -- just as a 

hypothetical, suppose -- suppose it was as Justice 

Ginsburg suggested; or indeed suppose this individual 

even before he was employed by Stanford at all, much 

less employed by a Stanford project funded by the 

Federal Government, entered into this kind of an 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

agreement with somebody that he had been working for. 

How -- how would it -­

 MR. AYER:  Well, I think you have to look 

4 

very carefully at the facts, and I don't want to speak 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

loosely and categorically about the facts, but what -­

what I will say is that in a situation where -- and this 

is very clearly true -- in a situation where prior work 

is done by persons who are, to start with a clearer set 

of facts, not affiliated with the university, and 

they -- let's say that person conceives of an invention, 

and that later the university takes that conception of 

an invention and reduces it to practice.  The conception 

by a person who is not a university employee, if -- if 

there's no university person involved in the conception, 

then it can't be an invention of the contractor, because 

you can't be an inventor without being part of the 

conception. 

 So that's a variation on Your Honor's -- on 

19 

Your Honor's question, but it's a -- it's a clear 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

example where Bayh-Dole would not apply. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  How does that change when 

you -- when you alter the hypothetical so that he was 

already an employee of Stanford, but was not working as 

an employee of Stanford when he was at this other 

company?  You could still say that -- that Stanford was 

6

not the inventor.

 MR. AYER:  Well, you would -- you -- I think 

you are now in a zone where one of the things that has 

to be considered is the equitable character of any 

assignment of a future interest, that is to say a future 

invention.  Because if in fact what was assigned was, as 

here, the possibility that there might at some future 

time be an invention, then equitable considerations come 

into play; and one of the equitable considerations we 

think the one that is of paramount significance, is the 

fact that the Congress of the United States has said in 

the context of Bayh-Dole that when the United States 

invests money in research, it wants certain things to 

happen that are very carefully set out in the -- in the 

Bayh-Dole Act. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you tell me, assume 

no Federal act, let's just talk about two -- or parties 

that are not involved with the Federal Government. 

Inventor agrees to assign to A; then inventor -­

inventor in fact assigns to B; then A gets the patent -­

 MR. AYER:  Well, it depends what's assigned, 

Your Honor.  If -- if B is a bona fide to purchaser 

under 35 U.S.C. 261, then B would prevail.  If B is not 

a bona fide purchaser, and that can only apply under 

261, where you are dealing with an assignment in law of 

7

1

5

a patent or a patent application, then I think you are 

in the difficult zone where there are two competing 

interests in the future possibility of an invention; and 

I don't know that I can, without knowing all the facts, 

even intelligently try to tell you what would end up 

6 

happening.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In this case, if you do 

not prevail on your principal argument, have you 

preserved the point that the assignment to Cetus was 

contrary to public policy? 

 MR. AYER:  I think we have, Your Honor.  I 

think -- essentially I would say, frankly that that 

is -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the court of appeals 

didn't seem to discuss that. 

 MR. AYER:  Well, I think that is at the 

heart of -- of our -- of our core argument and of the 

government's argument, and it is that, as the trial 

court here held, and as we've said in our brief several 

times, the inventor, because he is working here at the 

time of the assignment on a Federally funded project as 

an employee of Stanford University, is essentially 

working on something covered by Bayh-Dole; and being 

covered by Bayh-Dole means that he lacks the power to 

transfer title to this future invention to someone else 

8

because the statute has already spoken for it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Ayer, it seems the 

Federal Circuit emphasized a distinction between the 

scientist saying "I will assign," which was the language 

used in the agreement with Stanford, and "I hereby do 

assign," and it seems that that was critical to the -­

to the Federal Circuit's decision. 

 They say -- they cite a whole bunch of 

9 

cases.  The suggestion seems to be that if Stanford had 

10

said "I hereby do assign," there would be no case 

11 

because Stanford would have been first in time.

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. AYER:  Well, one interesting thing about 

that discussion is that the very first case that we know 

anything about, that we're aware of, making that 

distinction and relying upon the immediate effect of an 

assignment using the words "I hereby assign," was the 

FilmTec case in 1991.  That was 2 years after the events 

in this case, so how was Stanford supposed to know that 

that fine distinction was going to be made?

 We think the critical -- the critical issue 

here is whether the inventor, while working on a 

federally funded project as an employee of the 

contractor -- and there's no doubt that his work at 

Cetus was part of his Stanford research.  All you have 

to do is look at pages 16a to 18a of the petition

appendix for the court of appeals decision or pages 62a 

and 69a for the district court opinion.  It's perfectly 

clear that everyone knew he came to Cetus to advance his 

work on his Stanford research, which was in fact funded, 

as we show at pages 21 and 22.  And the Bayh-Dole -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What have universities been 

doing for the last 30 years?  Have they been proceeding 

on the assumption that title to inventions vested in 

them automatically or have they been very careful about 

getting assignments from all of their employees? 

 MR. AYER:  Universities, and -- and I think 

everybody engaged in research, is generally careful. 

They have policies in place to get assignments, and 

there are lots of reasons why that would be true.  It 

was true before the Bayh-Dole Act.  It's a -- it's a 

wise and prudent practice to have an understanding with 

your employees about who is going to own what. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do those policies ever 

19 

distinguish between Federally funded projects and 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

Non-Federally funded projects? 

 MR. AYER:  I don't -- I don't know about the 

universe of them.  I -- I know that the -- that the 

Stanford policy in this case relevant at this time was a 

policy that indicated employees could retain title in 

many instances, but not where Federal law, applicable 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

law, says that they can't retain title; and in that 

sense they do. 

 But those policies I think are very 

4 

clearly in virtually every case I know anything about 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13

policies that are signed by an employee pretty much the 

day they walk in the door, as I think was the case here 

with Dr. Holodniy back in 1988.  And it's a general 

understanding of what the expectations are, and I don't 

want to here be heard to say at all that we think this 

is an unwise thing or that it isn't a good thing that it 

goes on.  It's a very good thing that it goes on, 

because people need to understand what the situation is. 

 The critical issue is whether, in the event 

14 

that that fails to happen for some reason or that there 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

is a slip-up here where a fellow going to visit 

somewhere on the first day there has something put under 

his nose called a visitor's confidentiality agreement 

which he happens to sign, and down in paragraph 2 it 

talks about assigning away everything that he ever might 

do as a consequence of this. 

 The point is that in that situation you 

can't have the interest of the United States, which is 

the critical paramount interest in this case -- I want 

to make that very clear.  It's the interest in the 

United States when it spends millions and billions of 

11

dollars on research in having that research handled in a

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, in theory -- I 

mean, you're cloaking yourself in the interests of the 

United States, but we're going to hear from their lawyer 

shortly. 

 MR. AYER:  Right. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you ever have 

different arrangements with respect to the assignments 

depending upon who the researcher is?  I mean, I suppose 

-- I would have supposed there are very prominent 

researchers that you would like to have at Stanford, and 

you would be willing to negotiate less than a 

requirement of full assignment of their inventions in 

order to -- to get that person there.

 MR. AYER:  I don't know -- I wouldn't tell 

21 

you categorically -­

 MR. AYER:  Well, we would not, I think, be

to break the law.  And we would submit that that's 

what's going on here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but I thought 

the law meant that the United States got whatever 

interest the contractor got, right?  And if -- it 

doesn't say what the contractor can or can't do with 

respect to the employees it has.

 MR. AYER:  The statute -- the statute 

defines a universe of covered cases which are inventions 

of the contractor, which we think the other side uses 

those words to argue that -- that inventions of the 

contractor are only the ones the -- the contractor 

already owns by virtue of -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Plus the word "retained," 

17 

don't forget that, too. 

18

 MR. AYER:  Right.  Those two provisions are 

19 

essentially their argument for narrowing the universe of 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

inventions that is covered. 

 And I want to just say at the outset, the 

critical thing about narrowing the universe of 

inventions covered is that it narrows the universe of 

inventions in which the government's rights to, number 

one, itself receive title under several provisions of 

13

the act; number two, itself to enforce a whole series of 

requirements under 202(c)(4), (5), (6), (7) and a 

variety of other provisions, to itself march in and do 

things.

 When you define out of that category 

instances where inventions exist and were produced with 

Federal money, then you're limiting the coverage of the 

government's interests.  But on the two provisions at 

issue, we think clearly they do not mean what the other 

side says they mean.  The word "invention of" someone is 

conventionally understood, if you hear the light bulb 

was an invention of Thomas Edison, you don't think 

Thomas Edison owns the patent; you think he invented it. 

The same thing is true.  Even though -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  There are two things that 

cut very strongly against your argument.  I mean, there 

are many things that cut in favor of it, but the two 

things that seem to me to cut pretty strongly against 

your argument are:  First, that it has long been the 

rule that inventors have title to their patents 

initially, even if they make those inventions while 

working for somebody else. 

 And the second is that you are relying on a 

24 

provision that says that the nonprofit organization may 

25

elect to retain title, which means hold onto a title,

that the -- the organization already has.  There's just 

no accepted definition of the word "retain" that 

corresponds to the meaning that you want to assign to 

that word.  "Retain" does not mean obtain.

 MR. AYER:  Thank you, Your Honor.  Can I 

answer?  Basically, what I would say is, on the first 

point:  You're quite correct, obviously, that that's the 

general rule, that inventors receive title.  However, 

just in this case, in this fact pattern, the array of 

so-called vesting statutes that predated the Bayh-Dole 

Act throughout the 30 years in between are statutes that 

specifically, in most instances without any discussion 

of an assignment, simply vested title directly in the 

United States.  So Congress clearly had the power to do 

that, and they did it, and no one ever seriously argued 

16 

that they couldn't. 

17

20

22 

23

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But this isn't vesting it 

in the United States.  This is -- this is speaking of 

the -- the university retaining title.  If -- if the 

government was going to make such a huge change from 

normal patent law where the inventor owns his invention 

until he assigns it to his employer, why wasn't that set 

forth clearly?  All they needed was one paragraph. 

 MR. AYER:  Well, Your Honor -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It says when you're working 

15

Official - Subject to Final Review

3 

4 

5

on a -- on a government-funded project, you have no 

right to your invention as an -- as an employee.  It 

automatically vests in the -- in the university.  I 

would have expected that to be set forth very clearly 

if -- if they were making such an immense change in 

6 

patent law.

 MR. AYER:  Well, Your Honor, I would take 

exception to how immense it is, given the prior history 

in which the government simply took title to these very 

same inventions. 

 But on the issue of the meaning of the word 

"retain," that's actually a word that has a lot of 

potential connotations.  The one thing we can be sure of 

here without any doubt is that it doesn't mean that you 

had to have ownership before, because in section 202(d) 

of the act, the act specifically talks about the 

inventor's opportunity to itself be considered for 

retention of title, and everyone agrees that that phrase 

is one that never applies when the inventor already has 

title.  So "retain" doesn't mean that. 

 We would submit that what the word "retain" 

22 

means is -­

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  I lost you.  Go 

24 

over that again.

25

 MR. AYER:  Okay.  202(d) -­

And it says that if a contractor does not elect to

retention of rights by the inventor." 

12

13 

14 

15

 On 38 of the red brief, you will see the 

other side vehemently arguing that that only applies 

when the inventor doesn't have title to start with.  So 

you can't have "retain" mean one thing in one place and 

16 

place -- and one thing in the other.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART, 

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 As the Chief Justice's question suggests, 

although Stanford and the government's interests are 

aligned in this case, that won't invariably be so, and 

the government has perhaps different reasons for 

supporting the same position that Stanford is 

6 

supporting. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Stewart, could I ask you 

8 

just a factual question? 

9

10

11 

12 

13

 When the Federal Government contracts with 

universities or other nonprofits, does it require those 

universities to get assignments from their employees? 

And if so, how? 

 MR. STEWART:  The government-wide regulation 

14 

that -- which was promulgated by the Department of 

15

16 

17 

18

Commerce and which identifies certain things that should 

be in the funding agreements, it does not require an 

assignment of title from the university's employees. 

 The regulation does require the university 

19 

to make assurance -- give assurances that it has 

20

21 

22 

23

contractual obligations from its employees to cooperate 

in filing the documents necessary to process a completed 

patent application.  But that would be necessary -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So why doesn't the Federal 

24 

Government just require assignments from employees to 

25

the university?

 MR. STEWART:  Well, under our theory -­

first, under our theory it wouldn't be necessary, 

because the statute itself would give the university 

title.  And second, under Respondent's theory I think 

there is a substantial doubt whether it would be 

permissible.  That is, Respondent's vision of the 

Bayh-Dole Act is that Congress imposed elaborate 

requirements on inventions as to which the contractor 

has obtained title from the researcher, but that 

Congress left entirely to private ordering, was 

indifferent as to whether the contractor took title in 

the first instance. 

 And if that view of the statute were 

14 

accepted, there would at least be a substantial doubt 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

whether the Commerce Department could promulgate 

regulations that would validly require the contractor to 

do something that, in Respondent's view, Congress left 

to private ordering. 

 Now, I don't want to argue that point too 

vigorously, because certainly, if this Court holds that 

assignments from the inventors are required, we would 

like to have the opportunity to require the contractor 

to get them, but it isn't clear to me how you would get 

there if Respondent's view of the statute were accepted.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand that.

Why can't the Federal government just say:  We're not 

going to fund your project unless you get assignments of 

inventions by all the employees working on it?  What's 

the problem?

 MR. STEWART:  We would certainly like to 

have the opportunity to do that, but to use an analogy, 

the Bayh-Dole Act is triggered by voluntary choices of 

small businesses and nonprofits to accept Federal funds. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And by -- and by the 

Federal 0 voluntary decision to provide funds.  I mean, 

certainly you can condition your grant of funds on that. 

I -- I really don't see the problem. 

 MR. STEWART:  If -- certainly if this Court, 

14 

as I say, holds that the -- an assignment from the 

15

16 

17 

18

inventor is required, then we would like to be able to 

have regulations that would require that to be done.  As 

I say -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does the -- as a

20

21 

22

their -- proof of their assignment before it can claim 

ownership of the patent? 

 MR. STEWART:  Well, typically it would -- it 

24 

would certainly have to identify the inventors on the 

25

patent application, and typically the university 

20

 MR. STEWART:  It would -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does the Patent Office 

require the assignment for purposes of showing ownership 

of the patent? 

 MR. STEWART:  Not -- in most cases, but not 

necessarily.  There's a provision of the Patent Act, 35 

U.S.C. 118, which says that if an inventor refuses to 

execute an assignment or cannot be found after 

reasonable diligence, a person to whom the patent 

application has been assigned or to whom the inventor 

has promised to assign it, or some other person with a 

sufficient proprietary interest in the invention, can 

file its own patent application.  It will identify the 

inventor as the inventor, and it will provide 

documentation that establishes its own interest in the 

invention. 

 And this is the kind of thing that we might 

in some instances have to do with respect to Federal 

employees.  That is, there's an executive order that 

says basically as a condition of Federal employment, if 

you conceive -- if you create or conceive an invention 

21

on the job, it -- the Federal Government is entitled to

assignments, even in the patent law, that you -- the 

section that you just recited to me says a promise to 

assign will get you an assignment if the inventor won't 

give it to you. 

 MR. STEWART:  It could be a -- I mean, there 

are two different things.  It could be a promise to 

assign at the formation of the employment arrangement, 

where the employee is not -- doesn't necessarily have in 

mind any particular invention, but he exercises a 

contractual commitment to assign to the -- to the 

employer at a later date. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that what we're 

dealing with in this case?  I mean, there was a -- an 

agreement, a standard Stanford agreement, that said I 

will assign any -- any patent.

 MR. STEWART:  He agreed to that, and he also 

agreed that he would not enter into any other 

arrangement that placed him in conflict with the 

agreement he had made -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So why isn't that the 

beginning and end of this case?  I mean you -- there are 

22

important questions presented.  But the Federal Circuit 

said everything turns on the difference between "I will 

assign" and "I hereby assign."  Cetus would have come 

second in time, therefore would not have prevailed over 

Stanford, but for, except, the Federal Circuit said, one 

is a future conveyance and one is an immediate 

conveyance.  You know -­

 MR. STEWART:  Leaving aside the question of 

9 

whether that is right or wrong is a matter of contract

law, our view is it was not within Stanford's power to 

essentially convey to the inventor or allow the inventor 

to retain title, and that's clear in a couple of 

different respects.  The provision that Mr. Ayer was 

reading, section 202(d), says that if the contractor 

does not elect to retain title, then the inventor can 

make a request for retention of title, which the agency 

will consider after consultation with the contractor. 

So the statute doesn't say to the contractor -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but Justice 

Ginsburg's question, and I have the same concern, is 

that why can't we resolve this case in a simple way? 

What you're asking for, based on submissions to us of 

amici, of amicus briefs, means a very great change in 

how -- how -- how patents are held.  If we can resolve 

this case on a simple contract basis, why not do it?

 MR. STEWART:  Well, I -- if the Court were 

to hold that the agreement made with Stanford took 

precedence over the contractual commitment to Cetus, 

based either on general contract law or on the view that 

Bayh-Dole would prohibit the enforcement of the -- of 

the agreement with Cetus under these circumstances, that 

would satisfactorily resolve the case from the 

government's perspective.  The one -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Stewart, do you know, is 

this a Stanford-specific problem or is it a more general 

problem?  In other words, are there many universities 

that have agreements like Stanford's that would be 

subject to the Federal Circuit's ruling?  Or is this 

just an example of one university that unfortunately has 

a bad agreement? 

 MR. STEWART:  I think there are probably a 

lot of universities that use this language, and indeed, 

as one of the amicus briefs points out, it's very 

natural to distinguish between a present assignment and 

a promise to assign in the future with respect to an 

invention that now exists.  It seems a little ethereal 

to distinguish between a present assignment of an 

invention that has not yet been created and an agreement 

to assign that in the future.

 Now, certainly universities could change 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

their contracts if that was what was necessary.  I think 

one of the concerns that the government has, and this 

was hinted at by the Chief Justice's question, is that 

we're -- we're worried not just about what can be done 

to universities, but what universities could do to us. 

That is, it's standard university practice to say 

employees agree to assign their inventions to the 

university, and the two parties will divide the 

royalties; and if that is done, then even under 

Respondent's view it becomes a subject invention; and 

the university's commercialization of the invention is 

subject to all the requirements of Bayh-Dole.  The 

government -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it the case that at 

least some components, possibly many components, of the 

Federal Government for the last 30 years have been 

proceeding on that assumption that assignments were 

necessary?  The grants here were -- were from NIH, isn't 

that right?

 MR. STEWART:  Right. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And one of the amicus briefs 

points out that the NIH compliance guidelines say by law 

an inventor has initial ownership of invention; however, 

awardee organizations are required by the Bayh-Dole Act 

to have in place employee -- employee agreements

requiring an inventor to assign or give ownership of an

 MR. STEWART:  -- well, the -- the NIH

7 

8 

9

11 

12 

13

the beginning that title passes automatically to the 

university, but then, as you say, it states later on 

that an assignment is required, but that the contractor 

is required to get it. 

 And I think some people have proceeded on 

that assumption because it never -- so long as 

assignments were in place and were enforceable, it never 

really mattered whether they were needed. 

 But to continue my answer to Justice Kagan, 

14

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

universities could make a conscious, calculated decision 

that, rather than obtain an assignment for their 

inventors, they would simply agree with the inventor 

that royalties would be split in -- in the same manner 

as previously, but that the inventor would retain title 

and, perhaps with the assistance of the university's 

technology transfer office, would negotiate with 

commercial entities.  And the effect would be to 

contract around Bayh-Dole; commercialization could occur 

without complying with any of the prerequisites.

 The Bayh-Dole Act had the laudable objective 

of taking inventions off of government shelves and 

putting them into the market, and it succeeded; but it 

did not change the long-standing rule dating back to 

this Court's decisions in Hapgood and Dubilier that 

title to an invention vests in the inventor, subject to 

assignment, not in the inventor's employer.  We submit 

that, in light of this long-settled rule which Congress 

nowhere purported to change, the Act should be given its 

16 

straightforward meaning.

that the Federal Government can't just say, from now on 

we're not going to give any money to Stanford or anybody 

else until they have an agreement making clear that the 

inventor is going to ensure sure that title rests with 

the university, which then triggers the Bayh-Dole Act? 

 MR. FLEMING:  Mr. Chief Justice, I know of 

24 

no reason why the Federal Government cannot make that 

25

requirement.  In fact, in the case of FilmTec v. 

27

client, but you're comfortable with the idea that the 

government could impose that, even though there's 

nothing in the statute that requires it, and even though 

somebody could argue that the statute's somewhat 

inconsistent with it, in the -- in the sense that it 

wants to promote commercialization. 

 MR. FLEMING:  As far as I know that has 

never been litigated, but I know of no reason why a 

Federal agency couldn't say to a contractor, we want to 

be absolutely certain that the assumption that underlay 

not only Bayh-Dole contracting, but contracting going 

all the way back to Attorney General Biddle's report in 

1947, that everyone assumed was in place, which is an 

assignment from an employee, whether it's a Federally 

funded invention or a privately funded invention -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, though -­

 MR. FLEMING:  -- would go to the contractor. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's where I 

exactly am.  I mean, the -- the brief that I found very, 

very interesting is that filed by the Association of 

American Universities and the Advancement For Science

and the Council on Education, and they seem to take the 

line that you are -- I don't know how far you want to 

pursue it. 

 They say the strongest analogy is with 

government employees, and if you look at government 

employees the basic rule is, the Federal Government paid 

for it, they should have the invention.  And the way 

they do it is not to deny the employee the right to have 

the invention, but they insist upon an assignment, 

assignment of an exclusive license. 

 And there are cases which are cited here 

that suggest that, even if the employee tries to run his 

way around that and simply goes and before the 

government can get it assigns the interest to a third 

party, that that third party assignment is void as a 

matter of public policy; and that the assignment to the 

government of the exclusive right is valid as a matter 

of law, a legal implication from the executive order in 

the circumstance.

 That brings me back to where Justice 

Ginsburg was, and Justice Kennedy.  The analogy is so 

strong.  The government has paid for it.  There is a 

statute here that really seems to assume, though not 

explicitly say, that the universities will have title -­

that we simply copy what happened in this other area and 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company

say that an effort to assign by the employee in 

contravention of what this statute takes as its basic 

assumption, and a contract, is void as a matter of 

public policy, because the exclusive license is assumed 

to be assumed -- to be assigned to the university, 

though I don't need the second part; for this case, the 

first part suffices. 

 MR. FLEMING:  Justice Breyer, let me begin 

9

about the situation with respect to government 

employees.  Actually, I think the situation of 

government employees supports our side, because, as this 

Court ruled in Dubilier, just because the government 

pays for an invention does not mean that it 

automatically owns it. 

 In Dubilier, there were employees of the 

Bureau of Standards who came up with particular 

inventions and they got patents on them, and the 

government said:  We own that because these are 

government employees.  And this Court ruled that's not 

the case.  Government employees are in no different 

position from employees of private entities with respect 

to ownership of their inventions. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that before the 

executive order or after?

 MR. FLEMING:  The executive order simply 

says that there can be regulations where the employment 

agreement, which is essentially regulatory between the 

government agency and the individual, can result in an 

assignment from the individual to the government, just 

as the same applies in private industry.  Employees sign 

either an agreement to assign, as happened with 

Dr. Holodniy and Stanford here, or, as happened with 

Cetus, there's a present assignment of future expected 

interest.

that there was no rule of automatic vesting of title, 

which is what -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  I understand that.

 MR. FLEMING:  There's a requirement of an 

assignment.  And the regulations actually give the 

government employee the right to refuse to assign an 

invention to the government, and there are appeal 

procedures, as set out in many of the regulations.  We 

quote the Air Force regulations in our brief, but there 

31

are many others, where it's possible that the employee 

will wind up retaining his rights to an invention that 

was made, even though he's a government employee. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And if the employee seeks 

to assign to a third party in contravention of his 

agreement, rules and regulations, et cetera, what 

happens to that assignment? 

 MR. FLEMING:  Well, there can be -- it

there is, is an agreement with the government that says 

any invention you will assign to the government.  That's 

the agreement. 

 MR. FLEMING:  Uh-huh.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And now, in violation of 

that agreement, he assigns it to a third party.  What 

happens to that assignment? 

 MR. FLEMING:  The question will be whether 

24 

that assignment can be void under ordinary equitable

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But frankly, every act 

before this one -- actually, the IPA -- required that 

the contractor seek assignments from inventors.  Why 

would this act omit such a critical term if it didn't

intend to vest title in the contractor?

 MR. FLEMING:  The answer, Justice Sotomayor, 

is given by the IPA, which is:  There was no need for 

such a requirement.  Universities had shown that they 

were perfectly able under existing law -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The government just 

said -- if we say that the contractor and the inventor 

can do what they want, what sane university wouldn't 

enter into agreements with employees letting the 

employees retain title to their inventions and just

sharing royalties thereafter?  It wouldn't make any 

sense for universities to do what you're saying -- get 

assignments -- because they could just continue taking 

the bulk of the royalties.

 MR. FLEMING:  If that were to happen, 

Justice Sotomayor, the remedy that Mr. Stewart kept in 

his pocket, which is that the agency would say to the 

university:  You're not getting any more Federal money 

until we are assured that the assumption that has 

10

underlaid Federal contracting since 1947 and before is 

11 

in place, namely, that -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that might lead 

to the same thing that the Bayh-Dole Act was intended to 

get away from, which is a variety of different 

arrangements across the vast array of government 

agencies, because they will have differing degrees of 

interest, differing leverage with respect to what they 

insist on from the different contractors. 

 MR. FLEMING:  Well, Congress, Mr. Chief 

Justice, in the Bayh-Dole Act, was considered with a 

particular type of uncertainty.  It didn't do anything 

and everything that could be argued to create 

uncertainty in tech licensing. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you -- are you 

aware of situations where the universities enter into 

35
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

different types of arrangements with different types of 

professors and researchers? 

 MR. FLEMING:  Certainly. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Presumably some of 

them have greater degree of leverage than others and can 

say:  Look, you've got to make sure I get this much of 

the royalties, and I'm only going to give you that much. 

 MR. FLEMING:  Well, certainly there are 

1

different approaches, and that is the system that

Bayh-Dole left in place, which is that the relationship 

between the contractor and the inventor would be 

governed under ordinary patent contract law principles. 

MIT and Caltech, for instance -- I'm sorry, I was going 

to answer the question with examples, but -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, go ahead. 

 MR. FLEMING:  MIT and Caltech get present 

assignments of future interest.  We cite those policies 

in the brief.  Stanford, for its own reasons -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The whole thing that was 

wrong here is that Stanford, instead of drafting the 

agreement "I agree to assign," should have said "I 

hereby assign" and then there would be no case.  Is 

that -- the Cetus agreement said "I hereby assign," and 

the Federal Circuit said for that reason, even though it 

was second in time, it takes precedence.  Stanford just 

36

said "I will assign."

 So if Stanford had instead used exactly the 

formula that Cetus used -- "I agree to assign and hereby 

do assign" -- would you have any case?

 MR. FLEMING:  The question presented before 

this Court would not be presented.  There would be other 

arguments we might have as to whether that earlier 

assignment was enforceable as against Cetus in light of 

representations that were made at the time Dr. Holodniy 

came in. 

 But Justice Ginsburg, your question is -- is 

sound, which is that there is this distinction between 

an agreement to assign and a present assignment of 

future expected interests.  That has been the law for 

decades.  There are plenty of settled expectations based 

on that.  That has not been challenged, not in the 

petition for certiorari, not in the opening brief of 

Stanford, and it only comes up in a footnote on the 

penultimate page of the reply brief.  So I would 

submit -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So if the Cetus agreement 

that came second in time had said "I will assign," then 

again, you would have no case? 

 MR. FLEMING:  The question presented here 

would not arise, because the only effective assignment 

37
 

Alderson Reporting Company

5

of the invention would have been the assignment that 

Stanford got subsequently from all three coinventors and 

filed in the Patent Office in 1995, recognizing that it 

couldn't simply say:  Bayh-Dole Act vests title in 

Stanford, but rather, we need an assignment, and it got 

6 

one. 

7

10

11 

12 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We -- we have a number of 

sample clauses in this record, and some say "I will 

assign."  Some say "I hereby do assign."  The notion 

that the -- that answer, who is it who loses, should 

turn on whether one drafter says "I agree to assign" and 

the other says "I hereby assign" does seem very odd. 

 MR. FLEMING:  That's a distinction, Justice 

14 

Ginsburg, that goes back to the Federal Circuit decision

in Arachnid by Judge Giles Rich, who is a notable 

authority on the patent act.  He relied on the Curtis 

treatise from 1873.  But if that were an issue that the 

Court wished to reconsider, I think -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that patent law or is it 

regular contract law?  Doesn't it apply in other fields 

as well?  I mean, I'm -- I'm not aware that this is a 

peculiar doctrine applicable to patent law. 

 MR. FLEMING:  No, not in particular.  An 

24 

agreement to assign is specifically that.  It's an 

25

agreement to do an assignment in the future.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  To do it in the future.  If 

somebody else gets an assignment before that agreement 

is -- is executed, the assignment prevails. 

 MR. FLEMING:  That's -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then we're talking about 

nonexistent property; property that may never, in fact, 

exist? 

 MR. FLEMING:  That comes from the FilmTec 

9 

decision, which relied on Justice Storey's decision in 

10

11 

12 

13

Mitchell, and it's used, again, by universities like 

Caltech and MIT that rely on the validity of a present 

assignment of future expected interest. 

 I mean, I know that the issue of the 

14 

interpretation of agreements to assign was addressed in

the cert petition in ProStar v. IP Venture, which this 

Court denied cert on three terms ago.  But if this Court 

were to wish to reconsider that doctrine, I would submit 

it can be done in an appropriate case where there is an 

amicus briefing on that issue.  That's not been 

considered here at all. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So in the future, the 

universities would be protected against a third party 

simply by changing the form of contract with their 

employees to say "I hereby assign," so we would have no 

continuing problem?  Is that all this -­

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 MR. FLEMING:  I -- they -- they would be 

protected from this particular constellation of facts 

that came up in this case.  There might be other 

problems -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, and then your clients 

would be out there arguing, oh, but you, see you can't 

assign a future interests in the fruits from black acre; 

I mean, you can promise to do it, but black acre isn't 

even around yet.  And so when somebody ran in and got 

those fruits, well, then now we have a fight; and in law 

the second person wins, and in equity maybe the first 

person can get an injunction.  I don't know.  But I 

guess people would raise that kind of argument, wouldn't 

they?

 MR. FLEMING:  The point, Justice Breyer, is 

that all these questions are resolved in the exactly 

same way when we're not talking about a federally funded 

invention.  The Bayh-Dole Act has nothing to say about 

this.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So if fact -­

Senator Dole passed a law which could so easily be

subverted by individual inventions and third-party 

companies that there might be a large class of cases 

where neither the university nor the government would 

actually get much of a benefit from research that the 

taxpayer had funded. 

 MR. FLEMING:  I don't think that's a fair 

7 

inference, Justice Breyer. 

8

9

10

11

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Because? 

 MR. FLEMING:  The fact that this has not 

happened at all in 30 years of the Bayh-Dole Act. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Because most people perhaps 

12 

thought that they had made a valid assignment. 

13

 MR. FLEMING:  Well, in most situations there 

14 

will be a valid assignment, but the fact that Stanford

Congress did not intend to draft it.  And -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it's just -­

 MR. FLEMING:  -- it that it doesn't -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- it's not just 

that there may or may not be an effective assignment. 

The problem is you may get together, you the inventor 

get together with the university and say, look, the one 

-- we share an interest in making sure none of this goes 

to the government.  Why would we want to do that?  So 

41

you make an arrangement. 

2

3 

4 

5

 Your theory -- your theory is that whatever 

the contractor gets is what the government can get and 

nothing more, so the contractor and you work out a deal 

to make sure that the contractor doesn't get the 

6 

invention or the patent, it just gets royalties. 

7

8

 MR. FLEMING:  I think -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And they're happy 

9 

because they're -- the value of the patent is not 

10

diluted by the fact that the government is going to be 

11 

doing something with it. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 MR. FLEMING:  I think in that situation, Mr. 

Chief Justice, there would be other doctrines that the 

government or a bona fide third-party purchaser could 

invoke, including section 261 of the Patent Act or a 

lawsuit for a reassignment, as is happening in Fenn v. 

Yale or a -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So at the end of the 

19 

day, though, your theory is that Congress passed a law 

20

21 

22 

23

that could -- I guess this is Justice Breyer's point -­

be easily circumvented not only by the inventor but by 

the inventor and the contractor working together. 

 MR. FLEMING:  It's not that it can be 

24 

circumvented.  It's -- there are efforts, there are ways 

25

in which if there is an inequitable assignment, it can

be attacked in equity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There's nothing 

inequitable about it.  It's a perfectly fair deal 

between the university and the inventor.

 Mr. Fleming:  In that event the government 

has all the remedies that Mr. Stewart was talking about. 

As a matter of leverage, it could take the patent by 

eminent domain, and just compensation might be quite low 

if in fact it has funded all of the research.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It could refuse to fund. 

 MR. FLEMING:  Absolutely, Justice Scalia. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It could refuse to fund 

13 

without a clear assignment upfront. 

14

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

 MR. FLEMING:  That's quite right.  What it 

can't do is relitigate Dubilier and just say that 

because we funded it, we own it.  It doesn't make that 

rule even for Federal employees.  An assignment is 

required.  I mean, I think -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you have an explanation, 

Mr. Fleming, of why it is that Congress left such a big 

21 

problem off the table? 

22

23

 MR. FLEMING:  I -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  In other words, clearly 

24 

Congress was thinking about how to protect the 

25

government's interests with respect to these patents,

Alderson Reporting Company

and to say, well, we have these interests with respect 

to patents that the university owns, but we don't have 

those same interests with respect to patents that the 

individual researcher owns, just seems bizarre.

 MR. FLEMING:  There is an explanation, 

Justice Kagan.  Which is that the universities had shown 

they didn't need a vesting rule in order to get title 

from their inventors, just the same as private industry 

does not need a vesting rule to get title to 

10

nonfederally funded inventions.  This was something that

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sorry.  They -- they do. 

I mean, the general rule is that the inventor owns the 

patent.

 MR. FLEMING:  Correct, Justice Sotomayor. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And there -- there is 

proof that they can go into court, an employer can go 

into court and show that the inventor was hired for this 

specific item and the law would presume or recognize the 

employer's rights; but why would Congress leave all of 

that up to the nature of the contract that the 

university entered into with its inventors? 

 MR. FLEMING:  That's precisely what happens 

24 

in the context of Federal employees, it's governed by 

25

the employment relationship between the Federal

Government and the employee, and it was shown in the IPA 

system, in the system that Attorney General Biddle 

talked about in '47, that the assignment came under 

ordinary patent law.  There was no need for a new -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the -- but the 

question I started with and Justice Kagan has picked up 

on, why would Congress create this act relying on 

assignments and not have a provision requiring one? 

Nothing in the Act, nothing in its regulations, nowhere 

10

is there a requirement that Federal contractors seek 

11 

assignments.

 MR. FLEMING:  Because there was no need for 

such a requirement.  The universities and industry were 

able to do it without the vesting rule.

 I think in order for Stanford to prevail 

here, to Justice Scalia's point, the Court would have to 

be satisfied that -- that Congress worked a highly 

transformative change in the law of patent ownership and 

assignment and did it in a very obscure and indirect 

way.  It didn't do it through an express provision, like 

it does in section 201 of the Copyright Act, which 

expressly says that an employer can be treated like an 

author for purposes of the copyright.  It didn't do it 

in the way that was done under the IPAs, which is it was 

left entirely up to private contract.

 Supposedly it created this brand-new vesting 

rule, not through a clear provision, but through a 

questionable implications from the preamble or other 

provisions of the Act that don't directly apply, and it 

did it without a peep in the legislative history that 

Congress was trying to do this.  I think it's remarkable 

that for 30 years of Bayh-Dole, no one noticed this 

supposedly all-encompassing vesting rule until this case 

arose.  As Justice Alito -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  But it's also remarkable 

the other way, that here we have many statutes that took 

the principle that when the government pays for an 

invention, the invention vests in the government.  Now, 

there's that statute, that background.  Not all of them, 

but some.  NASA, various others.

that happens to only to inventions in those areas that 

are inventions of the contractor who, by the way, 

invents nothing.  Human beings invent things, not 

entities like universities.

 MR. FLEMING:  That's quite so. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And on your view what that 

means is it applies to nothing.  It only applies to 

those things that the contractor freely or not freely 

decides to get from his employee -- if he uses the right 

words and so forth. 

 That also seems a little surprising, that 

there could be such a hole in what used to be public 

ownership of such matters.  I'm not -- I don't mean to 

be -- I started off sounding a little sarcastic.  I 

didn't mean to be.  I mean to be -- serious question. 

 MR. FLEMING:  No, no, I -- I appreciate the

important to make a distinction between statutes that

statutes under which the government was entitled to ask

 MR. FLEMING:  Thank you. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And -- okay.  Now. 

 (Laughter.) 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What about -- what about 

the provision that says there shall be -- this is a 

provision of the law, that the universities are supposed 

to enter into contracts, funding contracts with the 

government to make this thing effective. 

 Hmm -- effective.  Effective for what? 

Effective just to apply to some of the things that 

universities got money to pay for?  Or to a lot of them, 

to all of them? 

 MR. FLEMING:  Effective in terms of

the right to retain title.  Try as Stanford may, 

"retain" does not mean "get."  It doesn't mean to take 

away from somebody.  An invention of the contractor for 

exactly the reason you say, Justice Breyer, is not an 

invention created by a contractor employee.  Contractors 

don't invent. 

 When Congress wanted to refer to employees 

in the Act, it did; in section 202(c)(7), it refers to 

contractor employees.  In 202(e), it refers to employees 

of Federal agencies.  If -- if Congress had wanted to 

pass a law that completely wiped out the practice of

leaving the relationship between contractor and inventor 

to private contract, it had plenty of examples of how to 

do so.  It had the NASA statutes, it had the Copyright 

Act, or it could have just written something clear that 

said that. 

 It did none of those things because it 

didn't need to.  Over $200 billion of -- of funding 

comes from the private sector to -- to technology and 

inventions like this without the benefit of a vesting 

rule.  If there's any lack of clarity or lack of 

certainty in this world, it is worked out through the 

patent law, ordinary provisions, or through the common 

law, and that is exactly the way Congress envisioned it 

would be done in -- in the federally funded situation.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, isn't there a -­

 MR. FLEMING:  There's no need to state a 

separate rule for Stanford for -- for inventions that 

funded out of its endowment, versus inventions that are 

funded out of a Federal grant.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't there a big difference 

between the statute and the prior vesting statutes?  The 

prior vesting statutes said if the government pays for 

the research, then the taxpayers ought to get the 

benefit of the patent.  But this statute says if the 

taxpayers pay for the research, if the research is 100 

49

percent funded by the taxpayers, taxpayers don't get the 

first priority.  The first priority goes to the 

universities. 

 So it's totally different from the vesting 

statute.  This is a Federal subsidy for universities and

other nonprofits, isn't it?

agrees not to demand title, and in return the contractor 

takes on certain obligations.  It isn't -- the 

obligations are not opposable against a noncontractor,

like Cetus or Roche in this case.  And that's exactly 

the same as the situations that we cite on page 35 of 

our brief, which we've offered to lodge with the Court, 

where Stanford co-owns patents with noncontractor 

companies like the -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What are the 

obligations -- what are the obligations that the 

contractor undertakes? 

 MR. FLEMING:  The contractor agrees to give 

the government a nonexclusive paid-up irrevocable 

license.  It agree to be subject to march-in rights if 

the government feels that the invention is not being 

sufficiently commercialized. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All things -- all 

things that the government had and more under the prior

system?

 MR. FLEMING:  Yes.  That's -- well, that's 

certainly right.  It will all depend on what the 

individual Federal contract has, but yes, in many ways 

the government was giving up rights in the Bayh-Dole 

Act, and that was deliberate, because it was felt that 

the -- that private entities would do a better job of 

commercializing inventions than the Federal government 

was doing, and that's not disputed, but it has nothing 

to do with the rights that apply to a third party that

has not taken on obligations from the government, like 

Cetus, that simply invited Mr. Holodniy in, in order to 

collaborate, but before it did so, said:  We need an 

agreement to protect our intellectual property.

 One of the hypotheticals that underlies 

Mr. Ayer's presentation here is that Dr. Holodniy was 

some kind of rogue, faithless employee who was out on a 

frolic of his own and simply decided to assign away all 

his inventions in satisfaction of a personal debt.  But 

the record is quite the contrary.  He showed up because 

he did not know how to do the PCR technique that is at 

the core of this invention.  The Court only needs to 

read pages 55 to 57 of the Joint Appendix, where he has 

marched through each of the steps of this invention 

that's ultimately claimed in the patents and admits that 

16 

he had not done any one of them.

 He went to Cetus, he took the -- he had the 

benefit of a free flow of information from Cetus 

scientists, and he also got confidential, proprietary 

materials that were not available in stores, including, 

particularly, the RNA standard, which is used every 

single time one of these assays is run.  It's the thing 

that gives you the standard curve against which you can 

measure the data from your unknown sample and figure out 

what the quantity of HIV is in your patient's sample.

That was, you know, not available at Stanford.  It was 

designed by Alice Lang of Cetus.  It was built by 

Clayton Casipit in the Cetus lab.  It was named after 

him, using his initials, CC 2, and Mr. Casipit handed it 

to Dr. Holodniy in a tube for free. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think that Cetus 

would have let the doctor in absent the agreement 

between Cetus and Stanford?  Wasn't that the primary 

reason they permitted the doctor in?  It wasn't for this 

ephemeral assignment of an unknown invention.  It was 

because the university and the company had entered into 

a share agreement of what would happen if they 

contributed to a Stanford invention. 

 MR. FLEMING:  I wouldn't quite agree with 

the end of the question, Justice Sotomayor.  What 

happened is that Dr. Holodniy's supervisor at Stanford, 

Dr. Merigan, sat on Cetus's scientific advisory board. 

When it became clear that Dr. Holodniy could not figure 

out how to do a PC assay that would quantitate HIV at 

Stanford, he arranged for Dr. Holodniy to visit Cetus in 

21 

order to learn how to do that. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they had a 

23 

preexisting cooperative arrangement, correct? 

24

25

 MR. FLEMING:  It was a materials transfer 

agreement, that's right.  So when Dr. Holodniy went

there, he signed a separate assignment, the one that 

assigned his inventions, as a result of the 

collaboration or as a consequence of the collaboration, 

to Cetus.  And that was the consideration.

 To this day, Stanford has not explained what 

Cetus could have done to protect its intellectual 

property so that it could have been able to practice its 

invention without having to go to Stanford for a license 

and pay a royalty.  As far as I know, the only thing 

under Stanford's theory that Cetus could have done is 

told Dr. Holodniy to take a hike, because they couldn't 

have any assurance that his employer would subsequently 

say, You know what?  There was a thousand dollars, ten 

dollars, one dollar -- we don't know -- of Federal 

funding under an agreement that has never been produced, 

that is of indeterminate scope, and they suggest, simply 

by averring in a patent application, that this is all of 

a sudden a Bayh-Dole invention, even though it was -­

indisputably now, under the findings of the District 

Court, conceived before Dr. Holodniy left Cetus and 

subject to this agreement, and it was done at a time 

when Dr. Holodniy was being paid not by a 

Bayh-Dole-related grant, but by a National Research 

Service Award, which the Bayh-Dole expressly exempts 

from its provisions in section 212.

 So the notion that Cetus somehow has lost 

the private right to the invention conceived using its 

proprietary materials and information simply by the 

subsequent use of an unknown amount of Federal funds, 

that that works as a divestiture -­

 MR. FLEMING:  This, Justice Ginsburg, is a 

question that was raised in front of the Federal 

Circuit.  The Federal Circuit didn't reach it.  It is 

open on any remand.  Of course, we don't think there 

should be a remand, but it's certainly not before this 

Court.  But to answer the question, here's the record on 

this point.  The salary was not paid by NIH grants.  It 

was paid by a National Research Service Award that is 

exempted.  The grants were never produced.  The grant 

titles, on their face, do not apply to the work that was 

done at Stanford.  One of them deals with establishing a 

center for AIDS research.  Of course, this is work that 

was not done at the Stanford Center; it was done at 

Cetus. 

55
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 The second one deals with AIDS clinical 

trials, and it's undisputed that there were no clinical 

trials at Cetus.  The clinical trials only happened when 

Dr. Holodniy went back to Stanford.  Dr. Merigan's 

declaration, which Mr. Ayer referenced on JA98, says 

only that Dr. Holodniy's research at the lab at Stanford 

was covered by Bayh-Dole Act.  It says nothing about the 

work at Cetus. 

 And if there was any doubt, Stanford argued 

repeatedly to the Federal Circuit that the federally 

funded research started in 1990, and this issue was 

decided on summary judgment against Roche when all 

factual inferences should have taken in our favor.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. AYER:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

 The -- I think the place to start here is 

with the fact that Congress, faced with a history under 

which the Federal government had taken ownership 

outright of federally funded inventions in approximately 

80 percent of the cases, enacted a statute to change 

56

that because the government wasn't any good at getting 

the stuff developed.  And so they -- they defined the 

coverage in terms of -- to cover these two phrases, 

inventions of the contractor.

 There is no question, if you look at section 

200 on 1A of the blue brief, you will see in the middle 

of this initial policy and objective section a reference 

to what they thought they were talking about.  At the 

very bottom of that page, on the bottom line, they talk 

about ensuring that inventions made by nonprofit 

organizations and small business organizations.  That's 

the universe they wanted to cover.  The same words -­

"inventions made by those organizations" -- are in the 

heading of the regulations, and they appear elsewhere 

throughout the regulations.  So they meant to cover the 

16 

universe of inventions that those institutions create. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 We talked earlier about the word "retain." 

The word "retain" cannot, consistent with its usage in 

202(d), mean that whoever is retaining it must have 

owned it before they started, because it's a hundred 

percent clear, just from thinking about the statute and 

from reading page 38 of the red brief, that when an 

inventor is allowed to be considered for retention of 

title, he never has ownership of it.  And so the word 

"retain" can't mean that.

 What does the word "retain" mean?  I would 

submit the word "retain" means what it often means.  It 

means that sometimes in a situation, someone is allowed 

to continue holding something subject to conditions that 

may change, and perhaps in spite of realities that make 

you think that's surprising.  For example, a parent may 

be allowed to retain custody after a disputed custody 

hearing.  That's a temporary thing, perhaps.  The court 

may allow it to change.
