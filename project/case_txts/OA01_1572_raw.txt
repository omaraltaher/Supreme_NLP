CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 01-1572, Cook County, Illinois versus United


States, Ex Rel. Janet Chandler.


Ms. Lach.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONNAL M. LACH


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. LACH:  Thank you.  Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The question today -- presented today turns on


whether Congress intended to include local governments


within the meaning of the False Claims Act's undefined


term, person, which this Court determined in Stevens has


remained unchanged since the original enactment in 1863. 


The indications are that Congress did not subject local


governments to liability under the 1863 act,


As this Court observed in Stevens and in Hubbard


versus United States, the 1863 act was enacted as a


criminal statute.  It imposed criminal fines or


imprisonment in addition to civil damages and forfeitures. 


As this Court noted in Marcus v. Hess, any language that


the civil portion shares in common with the criminal


portion must be given careful scrutiny lest those not


intended are brought within the act's reach.

 The word, persons, subject to liability, is


shared by both the civil and the criminal provisions of


the 1863 act, thus, a person that could be held liable


civilly must, under the 1863 act, necessarily be capable


of being subject to the criminal provision as well.  This


Court, in City of Newport, noted that municipal


corporations were not considered capable of doing a


criminal act or a malicious or willful wrong -- excuse me.


The -- the criminal nature of the statute in


itself is a strong indication that Congress did not


include local governments within the purview of the


statute.


QUESTION:  Ms. Lach, on that point, am I correct


in thinking that the Sherman Act does apply to


municipalities?


MS. LACH:  This Court determined that the -- the


antitrust statutes, under the antitrust statutes the term,


person, does include municipalities, local governments.


QUESTION:  And isn't it true that in the


original Sherman Act, imprisonment was authorized for


every person who violates the act?


MS. LACH:  That is true, but we are unaware of


any case in which a local government has been prosecuted


as a criminal.


QUESTION:  But the interpretation of the law on

the civil side --


MS. LACH:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- was not nullified because there


was a provision that said, every person is subject to


imprisonment.


MS. LACH:  That is correct, Your Honor, and this


Court in the City of Lafayette and City of Boulder, in


analyzing the term, person, and determining that


municipalities were included within that term, were also


faced with the treble damages of the -- of the Clayton


Act, and subsequent to those two decisions, Congress


enacted the Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984, in


which Congress specifically took local governments out of


the range of the treble damages, and now local governments


are subject to injunctive or declaratory relief.


QUESTION:  My -- my simple point is that by


putting a clearly penal provision in the statute, that did


not make municipalities out of the act, and I thought


that's what you were arguing, that the 1863 act is penal


in part --


MS. LACH:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- and therefore, it could not have


in -- covered municipalities.


MS. LACH:  Yes, that is -- that is what we're


arguing.

 QUESTION:  But that's not true of the Sherman


Act.


MS. LACH:  It does not appear to be true of the


Sherman Act, but again, we are not aware of any case in


which a local government was prosecuted under that act.


QUESTION:  Any more than this is a case of


prosecution.


MS. LACH:  Any more -- that's true, but now,


ever since 1878, the False Claims Act has been bifurcated. 


The criminal provisions are separately codified from the


civil provisions.


Also, as this Court noted in Stevens in 1863,


the False Claims Act was enacted to combat fraud during


the Civil War by private contractors, and there is no


indication that in 1863 the Federal Government was buying


anything from local governments, or that there were any


Federal contracts with local governments, and without a


practice of Federal funding to local governments, Congress


would have no reason to envision a local government


submitting a false claim for payment, nor were local


governments firmly established as persons in 19 -- excuse


me, in 1863.


QUESTION:  Well, Ms. Lach, you don't dispute


that the word persons extends to some corporations under


the act, do you?

 MS. LACH:  Not at all.  Not at all, and in fact,


in -- in 1863, the term, person, presumptively included


private corporations, and there is language in the 1863


act, and given the context of the act, it is reasonable to


assume that private corporations were included in the


provisions.


QUESTION:  Well, but there -- there are also


cases from about that time that say that a -- a


municipality is included in the -- in the term,


corporation, at any rate.


MS. LACH:  The -- the cases at that time were --


came from State courts, and the State courts were not


consistent throughout -- throughout the Nation as to when


local governments could be held liable.  Some State courts


held they could be held liable in contract, others in


tort, and even when held liable in tort, there was


sometimes the distinction between proprietary and


governmental function.


QUESTION:  Well, what about Louisville and


Letson?


MS. LACH:  Louisville and Letson, though, only


applied to private corporations, and private corporations


were established by that 1844 case, but in -- this Court


did not extend that principle until the 1869 decision in


Cowles, and that was the first time --

 QUESTION:  Didn't -- didn't we recognize it in


the Amity case in 1826?  We -- we quoted Sir Edward Cook


in including municipal corporations as -- as persons.


MS. LACH:  Yes, but still, in terms -- this


Court, in the Cowles decision in 1869, believed that it


still was not a settled issue and -- and settled the issue


once and for all.  In the Amity case, it was not -- it was


not -- the issue that was before the Court that needed to


be decided, whether local governments were persons unlike


in the Cowles case --


QUESTION:  Oh, we -- we thought otherwise in --


in Monell, certainly.  We said in Monell, and I'm quoting


it, the Letson principle in 1869 was automatically and


without discussion extended to municipal corporations.


MS. LACH:  Yes, but by saying that, this Court


in Monell dated the presumption as firmly established as


of the 1869 Cowles decision, rather --


QUESTION:  So you think there was a -- a major


change between, when, 1863 and 1869?


MS. LACH:  I think that --


QUESTION:  In that 6-year period, there was


suddenly, whap, it applied to municipal corporations,


before that it didn't?  It seems to me most implausible.


MS. LACH:  Well, it doesn't -- it wasn't an


automatic or a dramatic change, but nonetheless, there was

a progression.  There was -- there was a transition in law


within the States.


QUESTION:  In 6 years?


MS. LACH:  Those 6 years, of all 6 years in this


country's history, of course, were the most significant,


but -- but in terms of dating a presumption that one can


firmly rely on, there is no firm date, other than 1869, in


which acts of Congress were determined to include person


as a -- include municipality within the word, person.


QUESTION:  Ms. Lach, the decision, the opinion


in Cowles was very brief, right?


MS. LACH:  Yes, it was.


QUESTION:  And it was sort of like, well, of


course.  If this was establishing something that hadn't


been just taken for granted, don't you suppose the Court


would have engaged in a little more reasoning?


MS. LACH:  Perhaps, but nonetheless the Court


did decide the issue, and made -- made it clear that for


once -- once and for all, this issue was being decided,


and it was at that point that no ambiguity was left.


The first case that ever -- that -- in which a


local government was ever brought before this Court was in


1861, in the Aspinwall case, and there the issue did not


arise, and subsequent to the 1863 act, yes, there were


other cases in which local governments were brought before

this Court, but the issue never arose.  It wasn't until


1869 that we can firmly date when, in -- in Federal --


in -- in congressional enactments, we can presume that the


word person included local governments.


And this Court in Monell observed that it took


years of judicial conflict before corporations of all


sorts, including municipal corporations, were established


as persons that could sue and be sued in Federal court.


QUESTION:  Ms. Lach --


QUESTION:  Well, if we think that it -- that the


word, person, includes municipal corporations, as, indeed,


I think I do, based on Cowles and Monell, then what


changed it in your view?  Why would we now have a


different view?  Just because of the change in the


punitive damages, the treble damages provision?


MS. LACH:  If this Court determines that the


word, person, in 1863 did, in fact --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. LACH:  -- include local government, that --


QUESTION:  Yes, on that assumption, then what


would change that?


MS. LACH:  The -- the -- what would change it is


Congress' imposition of treble damages, which this


Court has noted --


QUESTION:  But without an accompanying change in

the definition of person, right?


MS. LACH:  Exactly.  Exactly, and the 1986


amendments were just that.  They were amendments.  What


was not changed in 1986 remained the same.  Nonetheless,


when Congress provided for treble damages, which this


Court has determined to be punitive, Congress knew what


this Court said in City of Newport.  This Court reiterated


a presumption that local governments are immune from the


imposition of punitive damages unless Congress


specifically indicates otherwise.


QUESTION:  Well, it seems to me you would have a


better argument if you simply said, the 1983 change does


not impose punitive damages on local corporations, than to


say it suddenly proscribes an entire escape hatch from any


sort of liability at all.


MS. LACH:  Well, under the 1863 act, there were


only double damages, which this Court concluded were


remedial, and they were not punitive, but there was a big


step made in 18 -- 1986, when Congress changed the remedy


to mandatory treble damages and, in addition to that,


increased the statutory fines.


QUESTION:  But it didn't make it clear at that


time that the change made them punitive.  It was only in


the Stevens opinion that we decided they were punitive.


MS. LACH:  But there were indications prior to

that that -- that -- from which Congress understood that


the damages were punitive.  In 1981, this Court, in Texas


Industries, a case that was cited in Stevens, stated that


treble damages are meant to punish, and also in 1981, in


City of Newport, this Court cited an 1877 a Missouri


supreme court case that held that a municipality was not


subject to treble damages under a trespass statute,


notwithstanding that statute's general authorization for


such damages against any person, and the reason was,


treble damages were exemplary, and --


QUESTION:  Ms. Lach, didn't the Court also,


I think in the context of the Clayton Act, characterize


treble damages as, quote, remedial?


MS. LACH:  The Court -- the Court noted both. 


The Court said in -- in aspect, they are remedial, but


then, also they did have an intent to punish as well, but


as I stated, the -- the Clayton Act no longer applies to


local governments because Congress took affirmative


steps --


QUESTION:  Nonetheless, it used the word,


remedial to characterize treble damages, and one of the


difficulties that your -- your argument that you're now


making encounters is that this change in 1986, wasn't it a


dramatic expansion of qui tam liability?


MS. LACH:  It was a dramatic expansion, but as

this Court --


QUESTION:  And then -- then you think that at


the same time that Congress expanded it, it also cut back,


without any indication at all?


MS. LACH:  Well, we believe that Congress did


not cut back, that -- that local governments were never


subject to the act, but with this dramatic expansion,


there was also the dramatic increase in damages, and this


Court has made it clear that local governments have an


affirmative defense when punitive damages are at stake,


and in order to abrogate that immunity from punitive


damages, Congress has got to really say that it intends to


impose those punitive damages, treble damages in this


case, treble damages plus statutory fines in this case on


local governments, and there's no indication anywhere on


the face of the 1986 amendments that Congress intended to


impose such damages on local governments.


Local governments are mentioned twice in the


1986 amendments.  In one provision, it's the


jurisdictional provision, 3732(b), which allows local


governments and States to bring State court claims in


Federal court when -- when the transaction arises from the


same transaction as a False Claims Act action.  That


indicates that Congress was interested in -- in preventing


frauds against local governments, not in -- in imposing

punitive damages on local governments, and the other


provision is the CID provision which, as this Court noted


in Stevens, has a -- has a definition.  That definition


includes States and political subdivisions of States, but


that is for the purpose of investigation --


QUESTION:  I'm -- I'm sorry, I didn't fully


grasp the point you were just making.  Were you suggesting


that Congress was worried about fraud against


municipalities, but it didn't think that fraud would be


engaged in by municipal units?  I mean, I remember -- I'm


from New York, and I remember Tammany Hall.  I don't think


it was altogether so different in Cook County, was it?


(Laughter.)


MS. LACH:  But the -- but the point is that


where local governments are mentioned in the -- in the


False Claims Act in the 1986 amendment, there is no


indication that Congress was mentioning them because


Congress was intending to abrogate the immunity from


punitive damages.


QUESTION:  May I ask whether you think that Cook


County could bring a qui tam action?


MS. LACH:  Well, that's less clear under the


False Claims Act.  This Court -- I -- I know that Your


Honor, in the dissenting opinion, suggested that the term,


person, is different in 30 -- 3730(b) from 3730(a).  It's

less clear, I think, perhaps, but that was an issue that


this Court expressly declined to address in Stevens


because there was no need to discuss it or to decide it at


that point.


QUESTION:  And there's no -- there's no need to


decide it here.  I -- I was just curious if you did have a


position on it.


MS. LACH:  I think perhaps local governments


could bring qui tam actions, but -- but it is not clear.


There are also the -- the policy considerations


with respect to the imposition of punitive damages on


local governments.  Local governments apply for and use


Federal funds for the benefit of their residents and, as


this Court noted in Stevens, in City of Newport, the Court


was concerned with the imposition of punitive damages on


local taxpayers under any circumstances, and here we have


a statute that imposes three times the amount of damages


and imposes statutory fines, which get very hefty.


Punitive damages against a local government have


got to come from someplace, and there are only two places,


reduction in services, or an increase in taxes, and the


victims of punitive damages are not the wrongdoers. 


They're -- they're the innocent, and some of those


innocents are not even taxpayers or voters, such as


schoolchildren or homeless medically indigent.

 The United States significantly -- significantly


has other means to stop fraud by local governments, and to


deter local governments from committing fraud.  The United


States has common law causes of action to be made whole,


and the most effective deterrent is the threat of


debarment from participation in Federal funding.


With no indication that Congress ever intended


to include local governments in the -- in the 1863 act,


and with the Dictionary Act not being enacted until 1871,


where Congress for the first time created a statutory


presumption that the word, person, includes bodies politic


and corporate, this case is in a very different posture


from the Monell case.


In Monell, this Court did not just look at the


word, person.  This Court looked at the historical


environment in which section 1983 was enacted, it looked


at the legislative history, and it also looked at the


Dictionary Act, which was enacted just 2 months prior with


the same -- by the same Congress that enacted section


1983.


A review of the circumstances around the 1863


enactment, together with the text and the historical


context, leads the other way.  There was no concrete


presumption.  There were -- there were indications, yes,


but does that lead -- does that add up to a presumption?

There's no concrete presumption until this Court said so

There were changes.  There were articulations at that --


at that point in time.


If there are no further questions, I'll reserve


the remainder of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Ms. Lach.


MS. LACH:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Mr. Miner, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDSON H. MINER


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. MINER:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the


Court:


I really can't contribute much more to the


discussion of what Congress meant by a person in


section -- in 1863, other than to point out, as we did in


our brief, that in fact, the law in the States prior to


Letson -- and -- and indeed, Letson is the origin of


the -- of the doctrine, because in Letson, what the Court


actually said was, a corporation is a natural person for


purposes of the suit where it's incorporated or where it


does business, and the Court then goes on and says, and


that doctrine also applies to all corporations and body


politic.


QUESTION:  Before that, they looked at the

citizenship of the individual shareholders to decide


whether or not there was diversity jurisdiction?


MR. MINER:  The -- that's right.  They -- they


defined corporations by the -- by the members, and -- and


they could have jurisdictions all over.  That then gets


cleared up, and -- and the law was absolutely clear in all


of the States as we -- that we could find.  We found no


dissenting opinions that -- that held, that didn't hold


that a local government, whether it was a corporation,


whether it was a quasi corporation, a city, a county,


wasn't held responsible for any obligations it had,


whether by contract, whether by charter, whether --


whether by statute, wherever they came from, and they were


also responsible for all their wrongful torts.


So that then brings us to really what was


Ms. Lach's starting point, this whole question of the


implications of the criminal provisions and, in fact, not


only the Sherman Act, but the Elkins Act also includes


criminal provisions, and this Court has recognized that


person, in that act, includes municipal corporations, but


the -- the question of what is the significance of


including criminal penalties in 1863 has to be answered in


the context of what was -- what was the -- the view in


1863.


Unfortunately, this argument really doesn't

surface until the reply, and so we haven't had a chance


really to brief it, but the simple reality is, in -- in


the period of 18 -- in the era of 1863, indeed in the 19th


Century, local governments were treated just like private


corporations, and they were, indeed, subject to


indictment, and they were subject to criminal punishment


on the same terms as local governments, and they were


often found liable for acts that involved both fraud and


deceit.


Since -- since this was -- now, I'd like to read


to the Court from Dillon, who is cited repeatedly as -- as


one of the -- the scholars of the era, although we -- we


have not cited this passage because the issue hadn't come


up before, but in his treatise on the law of municipal


corporations he states, English law, and in this


country -- in the English law and in this country, quote,


all corporations, municipal as well as private, which owe


duties to the public are liable to indictment for


malfeasance as well as nonfeasance in respect to their


duties.  And, in fact, he goes on to explain that they're


responsible for palpable omissions, they're responsible


for willful and corrupt acts, and in a -- a leading case


at the turn of the century called Ludlow versus


Commonwealth, 56 S.W. 2d 958, the State supreme court made


clear that the purpose of holding cities liable criminally

was, indeed, to punish them and to deter future acts.


That really was the law and, in fact, in a


leading case from our own State, the Illinois supreme


court, in upholding a criminal conviction against the City


of Chicago for employing women for more than 10 hours,


states in the case of People versus City of Chicago,


100 N.E. 194, the municipality is held to the same degree


of responsibility as an individual.


In securing performance of specific duties


imposed upon municipal corporations, the State has the


same power of coercion and the same method of redress in


the case of individuals or purely private corporations. 


That was the law in that era.  That was the law when the


False Claims Act was passed and, in a battery of cases


which I can bring to this Court's attention, a case called


Howard versus Crawford County, 12 F cases 637, Chaplain


versus The Corporations of the City of New York, 3 Paige,


P-a-i-g-e, Chapter 573, or the Town of Plymouth versus the


Town of Windsor, 7 Vermont 325, all cases that predate the


1863 False Claims Act, local governments were sued in


lawsuits for fraudulent and deceitful conduct usually


involving bond issues, or trying to avoid bond


obligations, often in terms of their responsibilities to


take care of their indigent citizens, and they would then


engage in schemes to get their indigents into another

jurisdiction so the other jurisdiction would have to pay


for the wrong, sometimes they in fact had paid, gotten


paid, but they --


QUESTION:  Well, the fact that local governments


were sued in these cases under some sort of common law


theory, I take it, does not necessarily answer the


question of whether statutory language using the word,


person includes them.


MR. MINER:  Oh, I'm simply using these as


examples.  I understand it's part of the argument that was


made in the reply briefs by my opponent that local


government simply cannot have the mental state of showing


either fraud or intent to deceive, and -- and my point is


simply, it was not uncommon in those days for local


governments to be perceived as doing fraudulent or


deceitful acts.


QUESTION:  Well, I'm sure that's true, but


why -- why do you -- why is it that, in your opinion,


nobody apparently with -- just, perhaps no exceptions, or


one or two, has ever sued a local government before under


this act?


MR. MINER:  Oh, I think -- there were suits that


were brought, and we brought --


QUESTION:  I mean, a handful, virtually no --


none.  It's --

 MR. MINER:  I think the answer is two-fold. 


Number 1, as this Court recognized in Hess, it's really


not until the 1940s that money starts --


QUESTION:  Since 1986, that's already 16 years,


and there are billions and billions of dollars worth of


Federal programs that go to cities, and --


MR. MINER:  Well --


QUESTION:  I imagine somewhere in those billions


there are a few false statements being made by people.


(Laughter.)


MR. MINER:  But I think the answer is that the


money doesn't start coming in until 19 -- until the 1940s


and thereafter, and in -- in 1943, after this Court's


decision in Hess, the False Claims Act gets emasculated,


in the sense that it becomes very difficult to bring false


claims, particularly qui tam cases.  The damages are


substantially reduced, and there is dramatic fall-off in


false claims litigation, and that's the whole purpose of


the 1986 amendments, to generate new life into it --


QUESTION:  Why since 1986 have we seen virtually


no suits brought against municipalities?


MR. MINER:  Since 1986?  Oh, there are --


QUESTION:  There are lots?


MR. MINER:  Oh, there are lots of suits since


1986.

 QUESTION:  Against 19 -- against municipalities?


MR. MINER:  Oh, sure.


QUESTION:  See, what I'm worried about in the


back of my mind is, if the -- assuming that the history in


the 1860s is fairly inconclusive, which is the impression


the briefs have left me with, you can make a good argument


one way or the other, then I'd be worried about suddenly


unleashing potentially billions of dollars of liability as


lawyers comb through the vast number of Federal programs


that give aid to cities, looking for someone, somewhere,


who has made a false statement, and I'm sure there are


quite a few, at -- at which point the cities would


suddenly discover vast liability for treble damages that


their -- their citizens can't avoid.  You can't sell a


share in a city, and -- and so that's the kind of thing


that worries me practically, and I wish you'd talk about


it a little.


MR. MINER:  Well, I think there -- there are a


couple of answers.  Number 1, I think that's -- that was


Congress' decision that -- that it was important to


protect --


QUESTION:  I grant you, if the history of this


is clear, you win.  Just in case, though, I'm left


absolutely uncertain about what the right result is on the


basis of what happened in 1863, I want to, just in case

it's relevant, to have in my mind what's likely to occur


in the year 2003.


MR. MINER:  Oh, I -- I think what is going to --


first of all, let's understand that these cases are not


now brought on the basis of negligent statements, or


slight misrepresentations, but these cases involve -- this


is a statute unlike section 1983 or the Sherman Act, that


really does not involve itself in imposing any new


obligations, any new or unanticipated responsibilities on


local governments.


It merely says, when you entered into a contract


with us, we're going to hold you to the deal that you


made, and if you breach that deal in material ways, we're


going to try to get our money back, so there is -- there


are protections in the sense that it's not any statement


that gets litigated here.  It's got to be a serious,


essential misrepresentation about how that money was used


that is at the core of these lawsuits, so that --


QUESTION:  All right.  I mean, if that's the


only answer, though, I -- I begin to think -- I don't know


how much money is involved, but I was trying to make a


guess and say, leaving out social security, food stamps


and that kind of thing, which are individuals, my guess is


there -- probably it's in the range of hundreds of


billions of dollars that go to cities, leaving those

things out, and you have a few bad actors in every program


that maybe purposely make a lie in a statement --


MR. MINER:  Well, I think --


QUESTION:  -- to help preserve their job, I


don't know why they do it, and -- and there we have


suddenly a huge liability imposed on citizens.


Now, I'm overstating this perhaps, but I want


you to tell me what the true dimension of that problem is.


MR. MINER:  Well, I don't think that -- first,


as part of that answer, Congress has made a decision by


the -- by increasing damages from double to treble, there


will be a deterrent effect, and that one response of this


is going to be, in fact, less fraud.  There's going to


be -- the money will be used for the purposes for which it


was given to the states, and there will be a deterrent


effect in terms of government officials not actually


engaging in fraud and -- and a related interest in the act


is, in fact, promoting representative, responsive


democracy, and by disclosing frauds to the public, you can


correct them.  But the reality still is the contract, the


lawsuit is only brought if, in fact, there's been an


essential misrepresentation, something really basic about


what was done by a local government that has actually


misused the money.


Local government has gotten the money, and, in

fact, all the local government is giving back is, it's


giving back the money it wrongfully got, if it's shown


that it got it by -- got it falsely or -- or fraudulently. 


It's giving back prejudgment interest and, within the


statute of limitations of 10 years, that is always


virtually going to exceed the basic laws, and it's going


to have to pay back the -- give a share to the relator,


which is an important piece of this, because Congress has


also recognized that, in this area, where you do have


large amounts of fraud out there, there are no private


victims.


There is nobody who steps forward and says, I


was hurt, and therefore I'm going to bring a lawsuit to


protect myself and the Government will benefit, and the


Government, the Court -- the Congress recognized, doesn't


have the research -- the resources to deal with all this,


so it desperately needs the -- the private Inspector


Generals who are willing to step forward oftentimes, not


as bounty hunters, but as -- as really offended citizens


who, like Dr. Chandler, who brought it to the attention of


the county and said, you're not doing what you're supposed


to do, and they took responsibilities from him and he said


again, and you're not supposed to -- you're supposed to be


providing these services, and suddenly she wasn't


responsible for that.

 They need these people to come in and blow the


whistle, because otherwise, the Government's not going to


find it, and they -- they recognize that oftentimes


they're -- they're terminated, so we've got to pay them


something for coming forward, so what the Government is


really paying in many of the claims is not much more than


what, in fact, the government -- what the -- the local


government is paying is not much more than what the -- the


Federal Government paid in this case --


QUESTION:  Don't paint too rosy a picture.  I


mean, if qui tam actions were as desirable as you assert,


they would not have been eliminated in England totally,

an invitation to shakedowns.  That's -- that's why they've


been largely eliminated from our law.


MR. MINER:  That -- that's a --


QUESTION:  So you know, if -- if loving qui tam


actions is -- is what you need to win your case, you're --


you're --


MR. MINER:  No, I don't -- I don't want to


suggest that, and -- but I -- to be honest, I'm a little


offended, but the treatment their -- plaintiffs in here


are no different than plaintiffs in antitrust cases, or


securities cases.  Many are truly wronged and are


outraged, and there are always some who will take

advantage of it, but the reality is that --


QUESTION:  Most cases don't have a treble damage


situation, and most -- most cases don't deal with -- well,


as this one does, with municipalities, where it's


really -- you know, it's play money, right?  It's not


really money out of your pocket.


MR. MINER:  Oh, I don't --


QUESTION:  So better to pay this fellow off and


get on with the business of the city, and -- I mean, those


are problems with -- with a qui tam action.  Let's not --


let's not minimize --


MR. MINER:  We're here in the United States


Supreme Court because Cook County wasn't about to simply


say this is play money, and we're going to pay you.  That


isn't really what happens very often.  If they're wrong,


they agree and they -- they pay, but they -- they also


fight you tooth and nail, and -- and you have to prove, in


fact, they didn't do what they said they were going to --


what they committed themselves to do, but the -- the


reality is that there are no -- in 1863, I think persons


clearly included municipal corporations, as it included


all corporations.  There is nothing in -- in the act


itself that in any way suggests that Congress did not want


to apply it to -- to municipal --

mean, it may be kind of an academic question if, in 1863,


the Federal Government was not giving out money to


municipalities.


MR. MINER:  It wasn't, but that doesn't mean


that, first of all, again going back to Lafayette, this


Court recognized the fact that Congress in 1890 was


concerned about private corporations didn't preclude


including municipal corporations as persons under the


Sherman Act, and -- and the fact of the matter is, local


governments in that day did commercial activities.  They


built bridges, they took care of the indigent at the


request of States, and they were held responsible for


their actions and, in fact, when they didn't live up to


their responsibilities, they were routinely sued, and they


could well have been reached by Federal Government.


I guess my time is up.  Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM S. STEWART


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT


MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The False Claims Act is the primary mechanism


for addressing deliberate efforts to cheat the Federal

Government out of money and property.  Petitioner has


identified no legitimate ground for excluding local


governments from the coverage of the act.  Local


governments receive very substantial amounts of Federal


money, and fraud by local governments causes precisely the


same harms as comparable misconduct committed by a private


party.  Moreover, local governments are presumptively


encompassed by the term, person, and qui tam suits against


local governments raise no constitutional concerns.


Now, with respect to the 1863 act, to begin,


it's true that as of 1863, there was no square holding of


this Court to the effect that a municipal corporation


would presumptively be treated as a person for purposes of


Federal statutes.  However, given the materials available


at that time, Congress would certainly have reasonably


concluded that municipalities were covered.


As Justice Souter pointed out, as early as 1826,


this Court quoted with approval Lord Cook's observation to


the effect that the term, person, presumptively includes


both municipal and private corporations and, again,


because fraud by municipal corporations in the procurement


of Federal --


QUESTION:  There -- that -- that case, though,


was dealing with a private corporation, was it not?


MR. STEWART:  That -- that's correct.  There was

no square holding to that effect, but certainly all the 


indications in the Court's opinions would have supported


Congress in its view that the term, person, would include


local governments.


The -- the Court in Monell held that as of 1871


a clear understanding to that effect had been established,


and petitioner has identified no evidence that would


suggest that the prevailing consensus changed during the


years between 1863 and 1871.


It -- it may also be the case that, as Justice


Ginsburg suggested, the question would have been a largely


academic one in 1863, because local governments wouldn't


have received a significant amount of Federal money.  The


Congress deliberately drafted the act in a broad fashion


so that it would encompass spending programs that were


adopted in the future, even if they were unknown in 1863,


and -- and the Court --


QUESTION:  Now, aren't you gilding the lily a


little bit to say that Congress in 1863 contemplated that


there would be massive Federal spending programs in the


future?


MR. STEWART:  Oh, I'm not suggesting that


Congress contemplated that.  I'm saying Congress wrote the


statute in a way that would cover whatever spending


programs came to be adopted in ensuing years, and -- and

the Court addressed essentially that situation in U.S.


ex rel. Marcus versus Hess, in which it said the type of


financial assistance that we're dealing with here would


not have been undertaken in 1863, yet Congress drafted the


act broadly, and these funds are in -- as much in need of


protection as other Federal money, and Congress did, in


some significant, some relatively minor respects, continue


to amend the False Claims Act at intervals during the


period between 1863 and 1986, and during that period, it


became increasingly apparent that local governments were


beginning to receive enhanced shares of Federal money.


It also became increasingly apparent that the


term, person would be construed generally to encompass


local governments, yet Congress retained the word, person,


even as it amended other features of the act, and I think


petitioner's primary argument is that even if the statute


included municipalities up to 1986, the 1986 amendments


took local governments out of the act's coverage by adding


a punitive component to the damages available, and -- and


this seems implausible for, essentially for two reasons.


First, the whole thrust of the 1986 amendments


generally was to make the act more effective, to expand


its coverage, to give the Government greater weapons in


fighting fraud, so it seems very unlikely that at the same


time Congress would have removed from the act's

coverage --


QUESTION:  Well, we do have the presumption in


the City of Newport situation of not treating punitives as


applicable to municipal corporations.


MR. STEWART:  That's correct.  The City of


Newport involved a different sort of statute.  That is,


the statute at issue in City of Newport was 42 U.S.C.


1983, and it provided an express cause of action, but it


said nothing about the remedies that would be available,


and essentially this Court's holding was, where the


statutory directive is for courts to use their own best


judgment as to what remedies are appropriate, punitive


damages should generally not be imposed upon


municipalities, but here, Congress has spoken precisely to


the remedies that will be applied at the end of a


successful suit.


QUESTION:  Does it give the Government any


remedy that -- suppose that you think that the particular


qui tam action is causing a lot of trouble in a Medicare


area, or Medicaid area, and there are hospital grants,


or -- you know, there are vast numbers of grants.  Can you


do anything about it?


MR. STEWART:  Yes.


QUESTION:  What?

Government to intervene to take over the -- the


prosecution of a case and to settle or dismiss it, and at


least on occasion, the Department of Justice has


intervened --


QUESTION:  Okay, so then, in other words the


city would have to come to you and say, this is a real


mess here, there's nothing to it, and let's settle it, and


then you'd have to get involved and -- and deal with it.


MR. STEWART:  That --


QUESTION:  You could do it, though.


MR. STEWART:  That's correct.  I -- I don't want


to represent that this is done often, but it is an


available --


QUESTION:  Well, have there been a lot of cases


since 1986 against municipalities?


MR. STEWART:  Yes.  The figures I've been given


by the Civil Division are that 138 qui tam suits have been


filed against local governments since 1986.  In 13 of


those, the United States has intervened.


QUESTION:  And settled, or --


MR. STEWART:  I don't know what the disposition


of those -- sometimes we might intervene to settle,


sometimes we might intervene because we believe the claim


is meritorious and we want to -- to prosecute the suit to


its conclusion.

 QUESTION:  Do you have some dollar figures in


those?


MR. STEWART:  I don't have dollar figures with


respect to municipalities.  I know overall since 1986 the


Treasury has realized a little over $10 billion in


recoveries from False Claims Act suits.  That includes


both qui tam suits and suits that were initiated by the


United States.


QUESTION:  You sort of federalized this action. 


I mean, you're going to let the private plaintiffs go out,


sue all the cities, and if you think there's something


wrong here, you will step in and deal with it?


MR. STEWART:  Well, I don't -- I don't want to


represent we will do this on a regular basis.  I just want


to say, it is an available mechanism under the False


Claims Act in extreme situations, where public policy


concerns cause the Department of Justice to conclude that


it's not in the public interest for the suit to go


forward.


The other point I would make with respect to the


City of Newport is, again, if -- the City of Newport dealt


with a statute that didn't specifically address the


question of remedies at all.  Now, if we're correct about


the law as it existed before 1986, that local governments


were covered, and that they were subject to the double

damages remedy that this Court had held to be essentially


remedial, if Congress had wanted to exclude municipalities


from the act's coverage, it -- it really seems outlandish


to think that Congress would have attempted to achieve


that objective by leaving the word, person, in the act


unchanged, and by amending the act's liability provisions.


If Congress had believed that it was appropriate


either to take the municipalities out of the scope of the


act altogether, or at least to subject them to remedies


less than those available against private corporations,


the natural thing to do would have been to amend the act


so to provide.  It -- it seems unlikely that Congress


would have attempted to achieve that objective by so


indirect a means.


The other point we would make is that there may


be isolated situations in which an award of treble damages


under the act will far exceed the harm that was done to


the United States, but the alternative that petitioner


contends we believe is much worse, because it would leave


the act entirely unavailable for redressing all manner of


fraud committed by local governments against the United


States.


When we have a contract action, when we have an


ordinary suit of a dispute about money, and we regard it


as a good faith controversy, even if we prevail at the end

of the day, it's often the case that the United States


won't be made completely whole, because we incur costs of


investigation, costs of prosecuting the suit, we may lose


the time value of money.  When we're dealing with good


faith disputes, Congress and the executive branch have


been content to treat that undercompensation simply as a


cost of doing business.


QUESTION:  Do any Government grants or contracts


have attorney's fees provisions in them?


MR. STEWART:  I -- I don't know that any do.  It


certainly would not be the norm.  I mean, the -- the


American rule is that each party bears its -- its own


attorney's fees, and so absent some express statutory


authority, we would not be able to recover our fees, even


if we prevailed, and so again, Congress is willing --


QUESTION:  Well, if it's a problem, you can put


it in your grant.


MR. STEWART:  I don't think with -- certainly as


to municipalities I think we would have a hard time,


without express statutory authority, arriving at a


contractual agreement that municipalities would be subject


to such an unusual remedy and, as I say, Congress and the


executive branch are willing to live with that form of


undercompensation when we're dealing with a good faith


dispute.

 The False Claims Act is reserved for that narrow


category of cases that involve people who don't simply ask


for money that, in fact, they're not entitled to, but who


ask for it knowing they're not entitled to it, and


Congress reasonably concluded that different remedies were


necessary to address efforts to defraud and cheat the


Federal Government.


QUESTION:  Is a false statement a necessary


prerequisite to an action under these qui tam?


MR. STEWART:  There -- a false statement is one


category.  There -- there is a knowing requirement.  That


is, the individual entity has to knowingly submit a false


claim.  There -- there are instances in which the claim


may be false even if it doesn't contain an express false


statement.  For instance, if it's very clear that it's


necessary, for instance, that medical services be


medically necessary in order to be reimbursable, and

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONNAL M. LACH


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MS. LACH:  Thank you.


The first point I'd like to address is


Mr. Miner's point that local governments were sued in all

types of tort actions across the board.  Congress'


understanding of the suability of municipalities, and


municipalities as persons in 1863 was really dependent on


State law, because there had been no Federal expression up


until that time, and across the board in the States, local


governments were viewed differently.


Some -- some local governments were viewed as


quasi corporations and some as municipal corporations with


different levels of liability and, as I noted earlier,


some States made a distinction between proprietary and


Government functions, so Congress' understanding based on


State law at that time was not consistent enough to be


evidence that Congress understood person to include local


governments.


As for State criminal actions, in some States


there were misdemeanor actions against local governments


for nuisance actions such as failure to maintain a bridge,


but there is no common law with respect to -- to Federal


statutes.  When -- when Congress enacts a criminal


statute, the States' understanding of -- of who is a


person subject to State criminal statutes is not


dispositive of what Congress had in mind, and if it is


ambiguous and it is inconclusive, as Justice Breyer


suggested, it might be what -- what Congress was actually


thinking in 1863.

 Criminal statutes are interpreted narrowly,


and --


QUESTION:  Ms. Lach, there's one point that you


didn't cover in your opening argument --


MS. LACH:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- and I'm curious how you read this


statute.  With regard to Dr. Chandler, she claimed that


when she blew the whistle, there was retaliation against


her.  There is a retaliation provision in the False Claims


Act.  On your reading of it, would she have recourse to


that provision against the county?


MS. LACH:  Well, under the facts of this case,


the county was not her employer.  The -- our codefendant,


Hektoen Institute for Medical Research, was her employer. 


Cook County has been dismissed from that count, but --


but --


QUESTION:  Well, whatever, the municipal


employer, would -- you say that there is no municipal


liability for the allegedly ill-gotten gains, but what


about retaliation against the whistleblower?  Would the


act apply against the municipal unit to that extent?


MS. LACH:  Well, the term employer is not


defined in the False Claims Act, but just very recently,


2 weeks ago, on December 31, the Eighth Circuit reached


this issue and, without reaching the question of what

person means under the False Claims Act, the Eighth


Circuit determined that employer has a broader meaning,


and allowed an action to proceed against a local


government, in that case the St. Louis Housing Authority


under, only under the whistleblower provision, and so the


whistleblower provision in itself does not indicate that


local governments, even if an employee can sue a municipal


entity under the whistleblower provision, that does not


automatically mean that --


QUESTION:  If -- if the employer -- employee


could do that, the -- the retaliation provision refers to


retaliation against an employee for conduct in furtherance


of a False Claims Act action, so if there is no viable


False Claims Act claim against a municipality, then I


don't see how the retaliation provision could be


available.


MS. LACH:  The False Claims Act actions may be


caused by another party.


QUESTION:  But I'm talking about this very case.


MS. LACH:  Yes.


QUESTION:  I mean, if you're right that there's


no municipal liability --


MS. LACH:  But -- but in this case --


QUESTION:  -- especially by Dr. Chandler, do I


understand from your last answer that you are saying, no,

she's out of luck, the statute would not cover her?


MS. LACH:  Not against the county, but she still


has a retaliation claim against her employer.


QUESTION:  Under what law?


MS. LACH:  Under the False Claims Act.


There were two defendants in this case, Cook


County and the institution that administered the grant,


and that institution employed Janet Chandler, and so --


QUESTION:  And was that a private corporation?


MS. LACH:  It's a not-for-profit.  It's a


not-for-profit corporation, and so that defendant is in


the case, and --


QUESTION:  But as far as a municipal employer is


concerned, a municipal employer, having retaliated, would


be, on your reading of the statute, just as free from


responsibility as it would be for the underlying qui tam


action.


MS. LACH:  No, under the Eighth Circuit case a


municipality can be held liable under the whistleblower


provision, even though -- I mean to sound very exact --


QUESTION:  That's what I was asking you about.


MS. LACH:  Yes.


QUESTION:  That's what one court has said.  How


does that court say that the employee's action was in


furtherance of a False Claims Act action if there is no

False Claims Act action?


MS. LACH:  The cases that have addressed this


have noted there -- a local government can be in cahoots


with another -- another entity that submits false claims,


the -- the local government is aware of it, and the


whistleblower is an employee of the local government.


In that case, it is -- in that scenario, the


whistleblower is blowing the whistle on someone else and


yet is employed by the local government and, under this --


under the Court's reasoning in -- in the Eighth Circuit


case and in the two cases that we cited, Satalich and Erie


County, an action can still proceed against a local


government under 3730(h), even though a local government


is not necessarily a person subject to suit.


To get -- to get back to the points, a lawsuit


under the False Claims Act can be brought if a statement


is made in reckless disregard.  Mr. Miner suggested that


the statement has to be clearly false, deliberately false,


and under the 1986 amendments, the standard has been


reduced to reckless disregard.


As for deterrent, by the time some of these


actions are filed, the wrongdoer is not even in office any


more.  It is the local taxpayers, the local residents that


bear the brunt of -- of any False Claims Act action and


penalty, not -- not the person that actually perpetrated

the wrong.


When -- when in 1986 Congress expanded the


coverage of the False Claims Act, it did not expand the


fraudsters.  As this Court noted in Stevens, the False


Claims Act covers just all kinds of fraud, but it does not


cover all kinds of fraudsters, and there's no indication,


under our view, that local governments were among


fraudsters that are included under this act.


In response to Mr. Stewart, we are not aware of


any dismissals of False Claims Act actions that are


brought against local governments.  The -- the Government


has not intervened, obviously, in -- in a number of these


False Claims Act actions, but we're not aware of any


situation in which the Government has actually dismissed a


claim against a local government.  These actions proceed


and, even if -- even if the United States wanted to


dismiss an action, they would have to justify their


dismissal before the court, and the same with a


settlement.  It has to be approved by the court.


In sum, I would like to say that Congress knows


what language it needs to impose punitive damages.  If


this Court finds that local governments are included in


the 1863 act, Congress did not use the requisite language


to indicate that it meant to impose punitive damages on


local governments in 1986.
