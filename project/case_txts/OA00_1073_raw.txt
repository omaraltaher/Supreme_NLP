CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 00-1073, Jerry -- correction, Owasso


Independent School District No. I-011, also known as the


Owasso Public Schools, v. Kristja J. Falvo.


Mr. Richardson.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERRY A. RICHARDSON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. RICHARDSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The issue presented by this case is whether


Congress, in enacting the Family Educational Rights and


Privacy Act, intended to prohibit the common and


longstanding practice of peer grading of routine homework


papers, quizzes, and tests.  Congress did not intend FERPA


to apply to such routine classroom activities, because


Congress was concerned only with information that might


have a long-term negative impact on a student's academic


or career opportunities.


QUESTION:  Mr. --


QUESTION:  Did you take the position in the


court of appeals that there is no private contract?


MR. RICHARDSON:  We did not raise that issue in


the court of appeals, Your Honor.  No, we did not.

 QUESTION:  The court of appeals discussed it.


MR. RICHARDSON:  The court of appeals raised it


sua sponte, and it has been raised in amicus briefs


submitted -- in fact, three amici have discussed it.


QUESTION:  Why didn't you raise the issue?  Why


isn't that more important than what you did raise?


MR. RICHARDSON:  Candidly, Your Honor, we didn't


raise it for a number of reasons.  Number 1, because in


the district court there was a Fourteenth Amendment claim


which clearly was actionable under section 1983.


Number 2, quite honestly we believe the merits


argument regarding FERPA was stronger than the section


1983 argument.  Remember --


QUESTION:  Well, I just don't know if it's a


good practice for you to force us to reach an issue you


think is important if there's no cause of action anyway. 


That just doesn't seem to me an orderly way to proceed.


MR. RICHARDSON:  Well, in hindsight I would


agree with the Court that we should have approached it a


different way.  Please recall, however, that at the time


this case was filed, at the time the court of -- at the


time the district court entered its decision, and at the


time the briefs were submitted in the Tenth Circuit, the


Christiansen decision had not come down.  We did not have


the benefit -- we were under the impression, I should say,

that we -- that the family policy compliance officer's


letter would be accorded Chevron deference, as the


district court did.


We did not know that the Court was going to


decide Christiansen and hold that such opinion letters


were not entitled to such deference.  We made a tactical


decision to focus on the merits rather than focus --


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. RICHARDSON:  -- on the 1983 aspect of it.


QUESTION:  -- you also certainly had some


justification on the private cause of action.  Seeing a


number of decisions from this Court which have come out 5


to 4 one way and then 5 to 4 the other way --


MR. RICHARDSON:  That's very true, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  -- you're not sure that you're going


to prevail on that.


MR. RICHARDSON:  That's very true, Your Honor. 


Both the decisions of this Court, with all due respect,


are sometimes difficult for a practicing attorney to


discern a clear line of --


QUESTION:  They're hard for us, too.


(Laughter.) 


MR. RICHARDSON:  And the other factor I would


say is that the two decisions that the Tenth Circuit cited


from other courts of appeals, the only two decisions that

we were aware of from the Second Circuit, the Fay v. South


Colonie School District decision, and from the Fifth


Circuit, Tarka v. Cunningham, both of those courts of


appeals had held that FERPA was actionable under 1983, so


again, we made a strategic decision --


QUESTION:  Well, what if we think there's a real


problem with that notion under this scheme, where the


whole object was to have it administratively determined


and it was funding mechanism, and under the act, the


penalty for not following it is a cut-off of funding. 


Now, what if we're quite concerned about that.


MR. RICHARDSON:  Oh, I --


QUESTION:  Do we send it back and let it be


briefed and argued below?


MR. RICHARDSON:  No, I don't believe so, Your


Honor.  The Tenth Circuit did rule on it, and we not only


have -- three amici in support of the petitioners


addressed it.  Respondent herself did address it in her


brief.  The only party that really hasn't briefed the


issue is petitioners.  We would be the only one that would


suffer any prejudice.  We have endorsed the position


argued by the amici in the three briefs that have raised


the issue.


I believe it's perfectly appropriate for the


Court to decide that, and I believe that the Court -- that

the Court's decisions do indicate that FERPA is not


actionable under 1983.  If you focus on the -- go back and


look at the language of the statute, of course, which is


the ultimate issue, there is no rights creating language


in FERPA the way there is, for instance, in title 9, that


the Court focused on in Canon.


Also, this is a Spending Clause case.  There is


no -- the Spending Clause, as the Court has indicated


repeatedly, is in the nature of a contract and there is no


unambiguous indication here that Congress --


QUESTION:  You didn't raise this in your


petition for certiorari, though, did you?


MR. RICHARDSON:  We didn't raise it -- no, Your


Honor, we didn't.  We didn't raise it in the petition for


certiorari because we had not raised it in the court below


and, frankly, we believed that the odds of persuading the


Court to grant certiorari on an issue that we had not


raised and briefed below were not very good and, again,


our focus had always been on the merits of the case, and I


believe we should win on the merits, but I also believe


that section 1983 is not -- does not provide a cause of


action under FERPA.


FERPA says -- it uses the language, no funds


shall be available to an educational agency or institution


that has a policy or practice of allowing the disclosure

of education records.  That is clearly talking about a


systematic practice on the part of an educational agency


or institution.


If a section 1983 remedy were allowed, then what


about an individual teacher who, in violation of the


district's own policy or practice -- the district, say,


has a policy that we will not release it, yet an


individual teacher makes a deliberate choice to release


the information.  Under 1983 that teacher would have to be


held liable, it would seem to me, even though the district


had done exactly what Congress commanded.  The district


had enacted a policy saying, don't do that, so that


clearly militates against a 1983 cause of action.


In addition, FERPA --


QUESTION:  Do you know anything about how this


act is enforced on the Federal side?  Have there been any


fund terminations, because the only thing in the statute


itself is fund termination, isn't that right?


MR. RICHARDSON:  That is correct, Your Honor,


and I'm not aware of any decisions.  There is certainly


nothing in the record to indicate that there's ever been a


funding -- well, I may have overspoken.  I do not recall


from the record.  There might be something in the lodging


of those extensive letters from the FPCO, but I do not


recall, and do not -- cannot represent to the Court that

there's anything in the record regarding there ever having


been a funding cut-off.


QUESTION:  Well, I guess we are taking you away


from the question on which we granted certiorari.


As I understand the position of the respondent


here, and tell me if I'm incorrect, if the respondent is


correct, the teacher would have to keep a record of all of


these quizzes as part of the permanent record, is that the


necessary result of the respondent's argument?


MR. RICHARDSON:  The respondent seems to take


the position, which is contrary to what the Tenth Circuit


said -- the respondent seems to take the position that


only records, only grades or scores that are recorded in


the teacher's grade book are education records.  The Tenth


Circuit clearly said that's not the case.


The Tenth Circuit clearly said, even if the


grade is never recorded in a teacher's grade book, the


mere fact that the teacher receives it and uses it for


some purpose, maybe even just to evaluate her own teaching


performance, and determine whether the class is ready to


move on to the next lesson, that makes it an education


record.


Respondents have backed away from that.  They


argue in their brief at least, or she argues in her brief


at least that it has to be recorded in the teacher's grade

book, but we believe that even that is a far more broad


definition of education records than what Congress plainly


says in the statute.  The statute defines education


records with a two-part definition.  It's those records,


files, documents, or other materials that contain


personally identifiable information and are maintained by


an educational agency or institution, or by a person


acting for an educational agency or institution.


Now, maintained has to have some substantive


meaning, because it's half of the definition.  Clearly,


homework papers are personally identifiable.  There's no


doubt about that.  But if maintained doesn't mean anything


more than what the Tenth Circuit said it meant, simply


possessed by a teacher for some brief period of time, then


that's really writing that word out of the definition. 


Any document that comes across a teacher's desk would be


an education record.


In fact, chalkboard work would have to be an


education record.  If a teacher asks a student to come to


the chalkboard, do a math problem, that's personally


identifiable information.  The entire class can see this


student working a math problem.  That math problem is


maintained on the chalkboard until the teacher directs a


student either to erase it, or erases it herself, or


himself.

 QUESTION:  What's your definition of maintain,


what, a week, a month?


MR. RICHARDSON:  I don't think that --


QUESTION:  Make me an offer.  What's your --


(Laughter.)


MR. RICHARDSON:  Your Honor, I think that what


Congress is getting at with the word maintained, it goes


back to what I said in the opening statement, which is,


information that could have a long-term effect on the


student's career.  I think Congress was talking about --


and the legislative history bears this out.  I know Your


Honor is not particularly persuaded by that --


QUESTION:  Some of my colleagues like that


stuff.


(Laughter.)


MR. RICHARDSON:  -- by that argument, but


Congress was concerned about things that would have a


long-term effect.


What I would suggest the Court focus on, is this


the kind of document that's going to be looked at by a


college admissions officer?  Is this the kind of document


that's going to be looked at by a potential employer, or a


governmental agency at some point down the road?


QUESTION:  Is there a difference between your


position and -- the Government said, it means, educational

records means institutional records.


MR. RICHARDSON:  No.


QUESTION:  The kind that would be in the


principal's office and not in the teacher's drawer.


MR. RICHARDSON:  No.  No, Your Honor.  Our


position and the Government's, with that regard I believe


the Government's current position, as reflected in the


brief of the United States, are consistent.  I don't


think --


QUESTION:  It's not been the position that the


Government, that this FPCO has taken consistently, because


wasn't there -- didn't they say that the teacher's grade


book --


record?


MR. RICHARDSON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- did count as an educational


MR. RICHARDSON:  Yes.  The FPCO had previously


taken a much broader interpretation of education records,


and had taken the position which essentially seems now to


be adopted by the respondent, that once the teacher


main -- once the teacher receives possession of the grade,


or the score, it becomes an education record.  The United


States has disavowed that position and said that is


clearly more broad than what the -- but the key point --


QUESTION:  But if your definition is correct,

and it's that limited that it's only the stuff the school


keeps that will go on into the permanent record of the


student, what would be the reason for that exception that


the statute contains for, you know, personal notes that a


teacher makes?  You wouldn't need that exception.  That


stuff never goes down to the central office, much less is


kept for, you know, for future reference.


MR. RICHARDSON:  Well, not necessarily, Your


Honor, and that -- you're referring, I believe, to the


sole possession notes exception --


QUESTION:  Sole --


MR. RICHARDSON:  -- but that's not limited to


grade books.  In fact, that --


QUESTION:  Where is it?  Can we look at that? 


What's the section?


MR. RICHARDSON:  Yes, Your Honor.  That's


section (a)(4)(B)(i).


QUESTION:  Where is it, in the briefs?


QUESTION:  Appendix page 4 of your brief?


MR. RICHARDSON:  Yes.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  B,


capital (B), then small (i), the term education records


does not include -- there's nothing in this definition


about grade books.


The reference to the grade books, and it's


really not a reference to grade books, it's a reference to

record books, is from the legislative history, where the


Court -- where the Congress said, this exception was meant


to apply to things used as memory aids.  I would argue


that a grade book is not something that is intended as a


memory aid.


QUESTION:  But my point is, you wouldn't need


that exception.


MR. RICHARDSON:  Well --


QUESTION:  If -- that -- I mean, that exception


suggests that other things that are only -- only held in


the sole possession of the maker --


MR. RICHARDSON:  I disagree that you would not


need that.


QUESTION:  -- could be within the statute.  Why


would you need that exception?


MR. RICHARDSON:  Well, for instance, a


document -- a counseling record, for instance, perhaps the


student had experienced some emotional problems, or


something --


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. RICHARDSON:  -- that has come to the


attention of a counselor.  The counselor writes a


confidential memorandum to her permanent file.  That is an


institutional record.  It's not something that's going to


be thrown away, but it's also, as long as the counselor

doesn't put that document, that memorandum in the


institution records, or doesn't show it to another person,


that's a sole possession notes exception, and would not --


QUESTION:  And you think that's the kind of


thing that would come within your definition of permanent


records, the kind of things that go on to college


admissions offices, and so forth?  That's what I thought


you were saying.


MR. RICHARDSON:  Well, I think that's --


QUESTION:  But now you're saying, even the


notes, personal notes kept by a counselor come -- would


come within this statute but for that exception, right?


MR. RICHARDSON:  Well, but for that exception. 


I think that's why the exception is there, is to keep


materials like that from coming into the possession --


QUESTION:  Exactly.


MR. RICHARDSON:  -- because materials like that


are maintained by an educational agency or institution. 


They are a -- counselors that have a record of a student


with emotional problems --


QUESTION:  So are a teacher's grade books.  Why


in that respect is a teacher's grade book different from


the counselor's notes?


MR. RICHARDSON:  I believe because a grade book


is, in my opinion, Your Honor, more of an evaluation

instrument rather than a record.  A transcript shows what


the student earned in a grade, or in a group of grades


during the course of his academic career.  A grade book is


more than simply a dry record of the percentages that a


student achieved during his time in his class.  For


instance, during a relevant grading period a student might


start out doing very average C work.  The student then


might near the end of the grading period suddenly get it,


and start doing B and A work.


The teacher would, I think any teacher in


America would look at a grade book containing those


records and would not simply go, okay, the total average


for this grading period is a 78.5, he or she gets a C. 


the teacher would look at the improvement shown in the


student's performance and would in all likelihood round it


up and give the student a B.  The grade book is an


evaluation instrument.  It is not simply a collection of


records.


QUESTION:  And the counselor's notes aren't? 


The counselor's notes aren't?


MR. RICHARDSON:  Well, that argument might very


well apply to counselor's notes as well.


QUESTION:  I mean, that's the problem.  Your


notion of what are records maintained just does not square


with the existence of that exception.  I mean, sometimes

Congress does more harm than good by putting in an


exception, because the exception suggests that if it had


not been there, the stuff would have been covered.  Maybe


Congress didn't want this stuff to be covered, but --


MR. RICHARDSON:  Well, I think that's an


alternative possibility, Your Honor, is that it's a belt


and suspenders approach that Congress never intended grade


books to be covered, but just in case somebody happened to


be inclined to read them that way, we're going to put this


exception in as well.


QUESTION:  We usually don't interpret statutes


that way.


MR. RICHARDSON:  Well, I can understand --


QUESTION:  You started out by referring to


maintain as implying some significant period.


MR. RICHARDSON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And it would be consistent with that


argument that you say, well, a teacher's grade book is


kept for the year, but it doesn't become normally part of


the institutional records of the school, so it's not


maintained for a substantial enough period of time to


qualify, whereas -- and I just don't know factually about


this -- maybe the guidance counselor's records are simply


kept forever.  I don't know.  I mean, is that kind of a


durational criterion something you want to stand on here?

 MR. RICHARDSON:  Not in a -- no, not a pure


durational criteria.  I don't think that is the key. 


Again, many grade books are not -- I don't think Congress


meant to draw a line and say, okay, you keep it 6 months,


it's maintained, if you keep it 5 months and 3 weeks and 6


days it's not maintained.  I don't think Congress intended


to do that, and I'm not asking the Court to do that.


I think Congress again intended to get at


records that are, as a practical matter, maintained over a


long period of time that are institutional records.


QUESTION:  But what is the definition of


maintain, then, that you're using?


MR. RICHARDSON:  The definition of maintain that


I would ask the Court to adopt is its common meaning, to


preserve, to retain.


QUESTION:  Yes, but don't -- doesn't that force


us into some kind of a durational -- and I'm not saying


this is an objection to your argument, particularly, but I


mean, doesn't this force us into some kind of a durational


criterion?  The record of the quiz which student A


corrects the student B and calls out to the teacher, the


number that student B puts on top of the quiz is a record


for a short period of time.


MR. RICHARDSON:  But it's not the kind --


QUESTION:  I mean, something is recorded, and

you're saying, well, sure, they can't be getting at that,


but if they're not getting at that, then it's either got


to be for one of two reasons, either the kid who does the


correction isn't a person who maintains, who makes a


record by definition --


MR. RICHARDSON:  Correct.


QUESTION:  -- or a record is something that has


got to be maintained longer than the period that it takes


for some kid to call a number out to the teacher, which is


a durational criteria.


MR. RICHARDSON:  That's true, and that's the


same reason that a chalkboard, work on a chalkboard would


not be maintained in the meaning of FERPA, even though it


might be up there not only for a minute or two -- I mean,


in some college --


QUESTION:  May I ask you --


MR. RICHARDSON:  -- courses you may have


chalkboard work that's up there for a week or more.


QUESTION:  -- do you concede, or do you not,


that the announcement by one student of another student's


grades within the classroom and not outside the classroom


is a release of information within (B)(i)?


MR. RICHARDSON:  No, absolutely not.


QUESTION:  Because?


MR. RICHARDSON:  Because it's not an education

record.  You can only have --


QUESTION:  Assuming it was an educational


record, would you say that it's a release when it's


revealed by one student to another within the classroom?


MR. RICHARDSON:  No, I don't believe -- in the


context of pure grading, it would make no sense to say


that one student, that it's not a release if the student


grading the paper records the grade.  I mean, in that


context, the Tenth Circuit's analysis would be right.


If it is an education record, then the fact that


one student sees it is just as damming as the fact that


the entire class sees it, it seems to me, but it's not an


education record, therefore there's no question of


release.


The other point I would make, going back to the


grade book --


QUESTION:  I'm slightly worried about that,


because suppose that -- I take it attendance records are


also -- they probably are maintained, and they are


records, aren't they?


MR. RICHARDSON:  Attendance -- well, again I


would say that attendance records are not the kind of


information --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Richardson.


Mr. Kneedler, we'll hear from you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act


does not prohibit the common classroom practice of one


student grading another student's paper, or other common


classroom and teaching practices.  FERPA regulates the


records maintained by an institution, not the homework and


classwork of students.  Congress did not intend for FERPA


to intrude into the day-to-day activities of hundreds of


thousands of classrooms across the Nation, or the way in


which teachers conduct the educational process in those


classrooms, or the way in which students interact with


each other.


QUESTION:  Does the act cover a teacher's grade


book that she keeps during the term?


MR. KNEEDLER:  It addresses the grade book, in


our view, by including it -- we think ordinarily it would


come within the sole possession exception in the act.


Now, I think it's important to recognize that


even a grade book -- there may be no one uniform practice


about the way a grade book is handled.  It could be that a


particular school would regard the grade book as an


22

official school record from the outset, where the


principal always has access to it, and the teacher is


really maintaining a record on behalf of the institution


in keeping the grade book.


You could have other school systems in which the


grade book is essentially used by and for the future as a


memory jog, and all that she ever discloses to the front


office is the semester grade.  In that event, we think


that the grade book would fall within the sole possession


exception, so that this is one of the things about FERPA,


is that it addresses the situation in which actual record-


keeping practices may vary, or let me change that, actual


pedagogical practices may vary widely from school district


to school district, and that's why we think importantly


this act did not enter the classroom by addressing the way


teachers handle papers, give feedback to students, have


students grade each other's --


QUESTION:  What about posting the results of the


exam, the big exam, mid-term exam, and the student posts


the results on the board.


MR. KNEEDLER:  I think under the position we've


espoused here, that would not be a violation of the act. 


FPCO has taken the position in the past that it would be. 


I think it would depend, though, or may depend on the way


in which the grades were assembled.

 I think if the teacher or professor, let's say,


in college, the only grades probably ever, ever assembled


or marked down for a college course may be the final exam


grade.  The professor may have a grade sheet, a roster in


which the professor marks down the grade for everyone in


that class and sends it to the registrar, and from that


list puts a list of final grades for the course.  I think


at that point, the fact that the grades would be derived


from something that would be regarded as an institutional


record, in that instance I think the posting of the grades


may well be a violation.


QUESTION:  But if he posts it before he sends it


on to the administration office --


MR. KNEEDLER:  If it's posted -- and this may


sound technical, but this is where the two categories we


think intersect.  If a grade is divulged from the paper,


he takes the grade book and puts A or B or C on the paper,


we don't think that the student work itself is an


institutional record, and it's not --


QUESTION:  But you're also, I think, saying that


the disclosure has got to be of the record, not merely of


information that may ultimately end up in a record?


MR. KNEEDLER:  That's exactly true, and there


are analogous situations in which that's true, for


instance the attorney-client privilege, that the attorney

can't disclose something that he's learned from the


client, but that doesn't mean that the same information in


the possession of the client is privileged.


QUESTION:  How is this -- the more I hear, I --


there used to be schools in any case that would say, the


following 10 percent of the class graduates with honors,


the next 40 percent, okay, and sort of honors, and the


last 60 percent, well, they graduated, didn't they.  I


mean, they didn't put it quite like that, but it was all


public, in the newspaper.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Now, is that all forbidden now?


MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  Quite aside from the issue


in this case, this statute contains an exception for


what's called directory information, which includes common


information about a student, the fact of their attendance,


et cetera, and that includes honors awarded to a student. 


That information can be released.  The school district or


higher education institution has to announce a policy.


QUESTION:  What are we dealing with here?  You


don't have much time, and I am concerned.  Are we dealing,


do you think, just with the student grading and the


knowledge obtained thereby, or are we dealing with the


teacher's grade book, or both?


MR. KNEEDLER:  All that is strictly presented in

this case is the practice of one student grading another's


paper before the teacher has gotten the papers themselves


or entered them in the grade book.


QUESTION:  And as to that, what is your succinct


explanation of why it's not covered by the statute?


MR. KNEEDLER:  There's no educational record


maintained by the school.


QUESTION:  Because it isn't maintained, or


because it isn't a record?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, whether it's maintained is


part of the definition of educational record.  An


educational record is a record or document containing


information directly related to the student that is


maintained by the school and, in our view, maintained in


that situation means maintained as an institutional


record, and we think that the act generally draws a


distinction between the institutional records and the


classroom records of the teacher, and I --


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, do you have a position


on the threshold question?  Is there a claim for relief, a


private claim for relief?


MR. KNEEDLER:  We do not have a position on


that.  That was not presented in the petition and


therefore we did not address it in our brief, and under


this Court's Air Couriers decision, the existence of a

cause of action is not jurisdictional and may be assumed.


We -- I would point out, though, that the


ability of the Department of Education to cut off funds is


not the sort of factor that has in other situations been


thought to be sufficient to preclude a 1983 cause of


action.  In Blessing v. Freestone and other cases, this


Court has said that that is a different sort of remedy and


does not preclude a private right of action.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, you said it doesn't


include the teacher's classroom records.  Why, by reason


of that exception that we were talking about earlier --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- the sole possession exception?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Two different questions.  One is


whether it covers the student's work, and we think that


that --


QUESTION:  Yes, I understand that.


MR. KNEEDLER:  That that's not covered.


By teacher's records, if you mean the grade


book, yes, we think that that would fall under the -- or,


what we commonly call grade book, some way in which the


teacher keeps track of the student's progress during the


marking period or --


QUESTION:  It's covered by the sole possession


exception?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  Which means it would have been


embraced by the statute, but for that.


MR. KNEEDLER:  That's probably true, but it's --


one thing to bear in mind here is, this act was passed in


one form early in 1974.  Some difficulties were


identified, and it was amended and revised and elaborated


upon later in 1974, and there is a description by Senators


Pell and Buckley describing the original version of the


act, in which they indicated that personal records were


not the sort of thing that was intended to be included,


because the act then used the definition of official


records that were intended to be for school use, and they


said that these informal notes, and I think teacher notes


would be include din that, were not intended to be


included in the act to begin with.


So I think that there is a way in which that


gives emphasis to something that may well have been


excluded anyway, but they do fall within the coverage of


the act, because the act was revised to meet some concerns


that had been raised by local school districts.


I did want to point out two things in response


to Justice Kennedy's question.  This act does not require


a school district to retain any records.  It may destroy


records at any time.  It only addresses rights of parents

while the records are actually retained.


The other point is, we don't think that there is


anything talismanic about the duration --


QUESTION:  But they don't have to be retained


for 45 days or anything?


MR. KNEEDLER:  If a request is made for them


they have to be retained until the request is resolved, a


request to inspect them, but if the parent or student,


adult student has not requested it, nothing in this act


requires the school district to keep them.


We don't think that duration is dispositive.  We


think because the act was designed -- we point this out at


pages 20 and 21 of our brief, and page 23 of our brief --


was intended to reach records that the school was going to


be -- use to make decisions about the student in an


institutional way, institutional decisions about the


student, which we think are different from what goes on in


the classroom in the day-to-day learning experience, and


so we think that that could include records, or some


materials that are kept by a principal that wouldn't


necessarily go into the permanent record, but would be


part of the school's overall supervision of the student


for that school year, so we do not think that the duration


of the period is dispositive.


Having said that, what gave rise to this act was

concerns about the sorts of things that were in the

of things that would follow the student, or that law


enforcement officers or probation officers or others would


have free access to when parents did not, and there was


concern that there might be irrelevant information, or


inaccurate or anecdotal information in records that would


make a real difference in the child's life, and that's


what this act is directed towards.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Kneedler.


Mr. Wright, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILFRED K. WRIGHT, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. WRIGHT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act


was drafted by Senator Buckley, also known as the Buckley


Amendment. 


Senator Buckley in 1974 stated that most


conscientious teachers would have no problem gaining the


consent of a parent, provided the teacher has demonstrated


the worth of his proposal.  In other words, Senator


Buckley did intend the Family Educational Rights and


Privacy Act to reach out into the record keeping process

that included the teacher's work or the -- or the records


that were being maintained by the teacher. 


What the petitioners are requesting of this


Court is to have unfettered and unshackled right to


disclose exam grades to whomever they choose.  If in fact,


only the cumulative or the permanent or the transcript


record is the only record that is an education record,


then a teacher like Justice Scalia mentioned could post


the exam scores in the local newspaper, if she wanted to,


prior to handing them in to the central custodian.  Such a


result was not intended --


QUESTION:  Well, but has that ever happened? 


Had any teacher ever posted exam scores in the local


newspaper? 


MR. WRIGHT:  Under the facts of this particular


case --


QUESTION:  No.  I say, was there any -- any


incident of that sort that had ever been called to the


attention of Congress?  I mean, was that really what


Congress was trying to prevent? 


MR. WRIGHT:  Not that particular action, but


that would be a consequence of -- of finding that the


education records would be just a permanent --


QUESTION:  Well, it would be -- the consequence


you describe would allow a teacher to do something that no

MR. WRIGHT:  Contrary, Your Honor, I believe


that the teachers, not only in this particular case, but


in many cases, especially in the -- the Krebs v. the


Rutgers University case, were disclosing exam scores --


QUESTION:  They were posting them in newspapers?


MR. WRIGHT:  No.  They weren't posting them in


newspapers.


QUESTION:  Well, that was what I asked you about


because you mentioned it. 


MR. WRIGHT:  That's correct, Your Honor.  They


weren't posting them in newspapers. 


QUESTION:  If -- even if we -- we take the --


the expansive definition that you would use, what is your


response to the point that came out in -- in my exchange


with Mr. Kneedler, that the -- that the mere disclosure of


information, which may ultimately end up in a record, but


a disclosure before that information is, in fact, recorded


would not be prohibited by the act?


MR. WRIGHT:  Here we have a situation, the facts


of this case, that happened simultaneously.  The teacher


is gathering --


QUESTION:  Well, do -- I don't want to cut off


your answer there.  But as -- as a general proposition --


it may not apply here, but as a general proposition, do

you agree with Mr. Kneedler? 


MR. WRIGHT:  If it doesn't make it into the


teacher's maintenance of the record.


QUESTION:  No.  I think the assumption is it may


well make it into.  It simply hasn't made it into the


record yet.  At that point, before it makes it into the


record, is the disclosure a violation of -- of the act?


MR. WRIGHT:  I believe that the teacher is


disclosing the information that she is intending to


collect.  It would be no different than a doctor sitting


five patients down in front of them, having them exchange


their diagnostic test, and saying, please call out that


information to me. 


QUESTION:  Well, yes --


MR. WRIGHT:  That would not be permitted. 


QUESTION:  -- we -- we don't know whether


there's a statute that covers that, and we've got a


statute here. 


You're saying that the words of the statute


would -- would make it an -- a violation to disclose the


information that may ultimately be recorded, even before


it is in fact recorded and made part of a record, as you


define record.


MR. WRIGHT:  No.  As I define record, here we


have a gathering of the information, and that's as far as

I'm going.  And that is, the teacher is gathering the

simultaneous.  They're having the students call out the


grades.  Ms. Falvo's children were having to call out the


grades without her consent. 


QUESTION:  Is the calling out a record?  What --


what does the record consist of? 


MR. WRIGHT:  That's gathering the information. 


The teacher writing --

 QUESTION:  A.  You know, I say, A.  The child


shouts out, A.  That is a record?


MR. WRIGHT:  And I write it down as you shout it


out. 


QUESTION:  Oh, after you write it down, maybe


when the teacher writes it down -- at most when the


teacher writes it down in her grade book, you say it -- it


then becomes a record.  But she doesn't disclose that


grade book.  The only thing that's been disclosed is the


child's, after he grades that paper, shouting out A.  What


-- what is the record that has been disclosed when the


child does that? 


MR. WRIGHT:  That is the record that has been


disclosed because the teacher is making the record.


QUESTION:  So you're saying the information


before it becomes a -- before it becomes a record, because


it doesn't become a record until the child says it, and


then the teacher writes it down.  You're saying the


information even before it becomes a record cannot be


disclosed. 


MR. WRIGHT:  If she's collecting it, yes.


QUESTION:  Suppose a child --


QUESTION:  Where do you get that from the


statute?


MR. WRIGHT:  (B)(i).  It would be illogical for

a teacher to have a legal obligation to protect the


confidentiality of that grade that she just created in her


grade book, yet have the student call out the grade.  It


is no longer --


QUESTION:  It may well be illogical, but I don't


see anything in the statute that -- that prohibits it,


anymore -- you could say it's just as illogical to


prohibit the teacher from disclosing that information, but


if somebody else happens to know it, for that person to be


perfectly free to say, you know, Jack Smith's kid got a D


in that test.  Does that violate the statute?  No, of


course, it doesn't because the statute only covers certain


things, and what it covers is records.  I don't see what


record has been disclosed here. 


MR. WRIGHT:  If a teacher has a legal obligation


to protect the information in the grade book, if the grade


book is an education record --


QUESTION:  It isn't in the grade book yet.  Your


-- your objection is the child grades the paper and says


to the class, says to the teacher, A.  What -- what is the


record that is being disclosed then? 


MR. WRIGHT:  She's making the record.  The facts


of this case --


QUESTION:  Ah, yes.


MR. WRIGHT:  -- where she's making the record.

 QUESTION:  The teacher is making the record


after the child says, A.


MR. WRIGHT:  That is true. 


QUESTION:  What about a child who -- I remember


in my third grade, my teacher, who thought it was her job


to teach, had problems sometimes with discipline.  And I


might talk too much.  I used to. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  And -- and so the teacher would say


that's reasoned self-discipline.  You lack it.  And I'd


get a check.  And you'd get three checks, and you get a


mark on your report card.  All right?  And say, Stephen,


that's the third time.  You now have a mark on your report


card. 


All right.  Now, she did that in front of the


class because she felt that this is the way I keep my


class in order and it helps me teach.  She did the same


thing with her grades, many of them.  She did the same


thing with attendance, by the way.  We all said, here,


here, sometimes present. 


All right.  In your view, are all those things


now forbidden by Senator Buckley's statute that the


teacher cannot run her class that way? 


MR. WRIGHT:  Not all of those items are


forbidden, Your Honor.  The Socratic method is not

forbidden, Your Honor.  Going to the chalkboard is not


forbidden. 


QUESTION:  No, no.  Let's use my examples.  My


example was I act up in class.  The teacher says you get a


check for reasoned self-discipline.  She says to the whole


class -- that's how she keeps order in her class.  That


used to be true in the third grade.  My teacher, Miss


Rosmond --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  -- whom I recall with fondness,


did --


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  All right.  But now -- now, what


about my example?  I'd like an answer to that example.


MR. WRIGHT:  If she's making a record, I would


say that would be a disclosure. 


QUESTION:  Okay. 


My next question is each morning we came in and


said, present or here, and she'd keep a record.  Now, is


that also forbidden by this statute, unless you go through


the elaborate procedures in the directory section, which I


don't know any school that would have done for something


like that?  But is that, in the absence of that, also


forbidden? 


MR. WRIGHT:  No.  That's part of the directory

information. 


QUESTION:  No, no.  If they don't go through the


procedures.  In other words, they -- the teacher doesn't


announce to every parent, now we want to have a hearing


for you to see whether we say to your child, here or not


here. 


MR. WRIGHT:  Under your --


QUESTION:  That would be a violation in your


view on the same theory. 


MR. WRIGHT:  It'd be a violation, but it's not


under the statute. 


QUESTION:  Well, all right. 


My question ultimately then, given our examples,


is do we really think that Senator Buckley intended to so


interfere with the way in which a teacher would run his or


her classroom --


MR. WRIGHT:  Senator --


QUESTION:  -- for teaching and disciplinary


purposes. 


QUESTION:  And -- and if so, do we think that


the Congress agreed with Senator Buckley? 


(Laughter.) 


MR. WRIGHT:  That's correct, because in answer


to -- to Justice Breyer, Senator Buckley specifically


stated, some may argue that my amendment will create too

much additional work and red tape.  To that argument, I


must reply that I am no -- not so much concerned about the


workload or convenience of the educational bureaucracy. 


He was not concerned about what type of convenience. 


Another way --


QUESTION:  So no -- no gold stars on the -- on


the paper that goes back to the student that any other


student can see, or in these days, a Post-it with a happy


face? 


that.


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  The Federal Government prohibits


MR. WRIGHT:  He's intending to give the parent


the right to consent to the release of information.  We


believe the grade book is information.  Handing back a


paper, it could be handed back to the child upside down if


it has a grade on it.  There are a hundred ways to skin


this cat. 


QUESTION:  If I -- if I don't agree with you on


this -- and I thought my examples that I gave are extreme


instances, and it doesn't cover that.  Can you give me any


help at all as to how this statute might be interpreted to


keep its basic point, which -- which might be a desirable


one, but not to cover my extreme cases? 


MR. WRIGHT:  Senator Buckley said another

statement.  Simple forms could be mailed to parents to


obtain their permission for certain activities with regard


to their children. 


I would also further note that many schools


already require the prior written consent of parents on a


number of matters, including testing, special projects,


drug programs, sex education, not to mention permission


slips to go on field trips, permission slips to go play on


the football team, permission slips to sell candy. 


Parents are bombarded with consent forms.  What the


consent form does is it informs the parent as to what is


happening to their child with respect to their education.


The teacher does not have the fundamental right


to educate the child.  Ms. --


QUESTION:  But it gives the individual -- it


gives the individual parent a veto, and that's what you're


saying.  You have a school district.  Education is one of


the -- the areas that is most traditionally handled


locally.  Right?  And your -- your scheme is that any one


parent in any classroom is going to have a veto over how


that classroom operates. 


MR. WRIGHT:  Not necessarily, Your Honor.  One


parent has a veto with respect to their one child because


they have the fundamental parental right to educate their


child.  The teacher does not; they do.  And that's exactly

what Senator Buckley was -- was intending with the Buckley


Amendment. 


QUESTION:  So the rules -- any parent can make


the rules for that parent's child, what that parent wants


them to be, not the teacher, not the school district.


MR. WRIGHT:  With respect to --


QUESTION:  You think that's what Senator Buckley


meant.


MR. WRIGHT:  Yes, with respect to education


records, that is correct, especially scores on exams.


We're dealing with a special ed student here that was


being mainstreamed in the classroom and having his grades


called out loud. 


QUESTION:  As long as the teacher records them,


you say that.  But I think you said all this could go on,


the teacher could give a spot quiz and say, I'm not


counting it today, but everybody wants to know how


everybody performed, so we're going to have the grades


called out. 


MR. WRIGHT:  That's possibly true, but there are


other means.  Even the district court found --


QUESTION:  But what is the answer to that?  Is


it -- is it -- the teacher gives a quiz, has the grades


called out, but doesn't record in her grade book. 


MR. WRIGHT:  If she's not recording it in her

grade book, that is not a violation. 


QUESTION:  And if she says, class, I want to


give you an incentive to do better, so I'm going to write


down these grades but I'm going to discount -- at the end


of the term I'm going to discount the lower two-thirds of


them.


MR. WRIGHT:  It's an education record.  The fact


that the teacher only uses three exam scores that she's


written in her grade book as opposed to five exam scores


does not nullify the parent's right to consent to the


release of that exam grade in the classroom. 


QUESTION:  Is it perfectly clear that the


disclosure of information within the classroom setting is


a release of education records within the meaning of


(B)(i)?

MR. WRIGHT:  Within the meaning of (B)(i) --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. WRIGHT:  -- our interpretation is it has to


QUESTION:  Why do you say that if -- if it has


the more formal concern about release to the public and


law enforcement and so forth?  It seems to me that there's


an awful lot of information about special students and


others that -- that the student's classmates are


inevitably going to learn about just by being in class

seeing what goes on in class.  It isn't, though, the --


his general performance is a secret to the -- to the other


-- to his classmates.


MR. WRIGHT:  That -- that's correct, Your Honor. 


In fact, FERPA is not a panacea for all performances.  In


fact, the directory information exception to the education


record specifically says that participation in school


activities is fine.


QUESTION:  But this particular school activity,


it's not fine.  I'm reading off the answers in -- in the


presence of no one else except your classmates who


generally have a pretty good idea of who the good students


are and who -- who the bad students are.  But you still


say that's -- that's clearly a release within the meaning


of the statute in your view. 


MR. WRIGHT:  The grade that's going in the grade


book is a release, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  You think it's especially --


especially mean with respect to this special -- special ed


student who's being mainstreamed.  What -- what do you say


to the petitioners' footnote in their reply brief that the


record establishes that the only special education service


Philip received was 45 minutes of speech therapy once a


week?  And that was discontinued, with respondent's


consent, prior to the end of Philip's seventh grade year.

That's not as appealing as your description of this -- of

MR. WRIGHT:  The fact that a special ed --

special ed student, a student who is receiving 45 minutes


of speech therapy once a -- once a week?


MR. WRIGHT:  Yes.  I think that's --


QUESTION:  That's what you mean by a special --


special ed student. 


MR. WRIGHT:  He was.  He was IEP.  He was in an


IEP program under the IDE Act.


QUESTION:  45 minutes a week.  Did he get


anything else other than that?  Of speech therapy.  What


did he have?  A stutter perhaps? 


MR. WRIGHT:  No.  He was slow in reading, Your


Honor.  He was slow in reading the exams, the pop quizzes,


Your Honor.  I mean --


QUESTION:  Well, how would speech therapy help


that? 


MR. WRIGHT:  I don't know, Your Honor.  Those


questions were not raised.  None of those material facts


were part of the record. 


QUESTION:  Well, I suggest you not paint your


client as more sympathetic than he is.


MR. WRIGHT:  I am just trying to be sensitive

not only to just that one child, but even to her other


children who are also part of this case with respect to


their A's.  They were straight A students.  So rather --


whether one child receives low grades or whether one child


receives stellar performance in the classroom, it does not


matter.  It is still a release of a grade.  Those children


know the grade.  The parents of those children know the


grade. 


When a parent goes to the parent-teacher


conference and she shows up and the teacher says, all


right, these are the -- we're going to keep this private,


it's not private information.  It's already been


disclosed.  That information is not private.  How can the


teacher keep concealed that which she already revealed? 


And even the district court found that hard to believe.


And -- and that's -- that's the logic of the


Tenth Circuit.  The Tenth Circuit didn't prohibit the


practice.  The Tenth Circuit merely suggested that the


statute on its face, the plain language of the statute,


says, give the parent the right to consent.  That was the


intent of Senator Buckley:  give the parent the right to


consent to the release. 


QUESTION:  If it's an educational record as


defined under the act and maintained as such -- and that's


really the issue, whether it -- it's covered at this stage

of a fellow student calling out a grade.


MR. WRIGHT:  It's covered because in the facts


of this case, the teacher is using that protocol to


collect the information. 


QUESTION:  Well, but that is not the text of the


statute.  You have to overcome the fact that the literal


language wouldn't cover it.


MR. WRIGHT:  The literal language interpreted in


the context of the parent's right to consent, in other


words, keeping that information confidential.  If there is


a legal obligation on the part of the teacher to keep that


grade confidential once it's in her hands --


QUESTION:  She had -- they have no right to keep


information confidential.  They have a right to keep the


record confidential.  If the information is obtained from


some source other than the record, the statute does not --


does not address its release. 


MR. WRIGHT:  I respectfully disagree.  The


statute specifically says, which has a policy or practice


of permitting the release of education records or


personally identifiable information contained therein --


QUESTION:  Contained in the records. 


MR. WRIGHT:  She's making the record.  She's


maintaining the record.  That has to be interpreted in the


context of what we're doing here.  And if we look at

Whalen v. Roe --


QUESTION:  I'm way out-of-date probably, but


again, when I used to be in school, grades were thought


of, to some degree, as an incentive, that they weren't


totally private.  One of their functions is they should be


at least told to other people in the class in order to get


them to work harder or to strive harder. 


Now, in -- the term of records, when they talk


about records, which I don't think defines itself, is


there any indication in this history that that idea that


if a teacher wants to use grades as a kind of incentive


device, that that should not be up to the teacher?  She


isn't able to do it? 


I mean, is there -- see, records doesn't define


itself, and I'm looking for a line.


MR. WRIGHT:  Congress intended that --


QUESTION:  In -- in the absence of some other


line, I might tend to think a line should be drawn to give


the teacher maximum freedom to run his or her class the


way the teacher feels is best educationally.  That's


different from having a record in an office somewhere in


the clerk's office in the school.  See, that's where --


that's where I'm sort of looking for, and I'm trying to


get some help from you with that. 


MR. WRIGHT:  The line is the grade that is going

in the grade book with respect to this particular case. 


If the grade is going in the grade book, what she is


creating, she is maintaining.  If -- if that -- if


maintain does not mean that she is making the record or


creating the record, if we subscribe to their view that


maintain means the central custodian, then the central


custodian doesn't have any record either until it's


actually in their hands.  And then we can disclose, we can


access, we -- everything. 


QUESTION:  So what -- so what if you could? 


Suppose you were to say that.  Suppose you were to say


before it becomes part of the permanent records of the


school, you can disclose it to other people.  You can. 


That's right.  The teacher can tell other students.  The


teacher can tell the parents.  The teacher can have a


discussion about it.  They can do a lot of those things if


the teacher feels that's good educationally and the school


approves.  What would be so terrible about that in terms


of this statute? 


MR. WRIGHT:  It would be terrible.  It would be


disastrous.  Students, parents would not have the right,


that privacy.  That interest in keeping that information


private would not be there.  Everybody would have access


to that information.  In fact, that reads out of the


statute (B)(i).  You wouldn't have confidentiality.

 Education records, by its plain language in the


statute, means information directly related to the student


and maintained by the institution or somebody acting on


behalf of the institution.  And clearly, by the plain


language of the statute, that includes the teacher.  So,


yes, the teacher grade books -- the teacher grade books


are education records, subject to the Family Educational


Rights and Privacy Act, the privileges and the obligations


that come with this particular statute.


QUESTION:  Mr. Wright, this goes all the way


through, I take it, in your view that -- take a college


student.  The college student can say, oh, I don't want to


participate.  I don't want anybody else to know what my


grade is, and I'm not going to exchange papers with


another person. 


MR. WRIGHT:  Precisely.  We don't engage in this


practice at college because we would have mutiny at all


colleges.  They have the capacity as adults, I'm not doing


this.  I'm out of this class.  I don't want people knowing


what my --

use, to have students prepare and present each other's

colleges and professional schools.

other's papers.

That is not prohibited by FERPA.  The teacher is not


collecting that information.  The students are making the


evaluation or assessment of each other for their sole


purpose, not for the purpose of the teacher recording and


making --


QUESTION:  The teacher writes down -- the


teacher writes down in the book the comments that the


students made and she takes that into account in the final


grade in the course. 


MR. WRIGHT:  Outside of the facts of this case,


that may be a violation if, in fact, she's making a record


and that was the intent of the teacher to make a record.


QUESTION:  A -- a good alternate name for this


statute would have been the Anti -- the Prevention of


Mutiny Among Students Act? 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Suppose -- suppose that a school

district received $100 a year in Federal funds, and this


act were applied in the way you said, would that to you


raise any serious concerns of federalism? 


MR. WRIGHT:  I think the funds need to be


available under an applicable program, and I think the


lower cases have -- have deemed that certain programs are


applicable and certain others are not.  Federal funding


through a State agency would be an applicable program. 


Those facts were never raised in this particular case,


never defended by petitioners as to whether or not there


was any applicable Federal funding involved in this


particular case. 


The solution to the problem with respect to this


issue that is before the Court, provide the parent the


right to consent -- in fact, that's what they're doing in


many schools or they're just, like the Tenth Circuit said,


do it anonymously or don't do it at all.  Have the student


grade their own paper.  Encourage the parent to come and


-- and be informed as to what is happening --


QUESTION:  To have the student grade their own


paper might have some problems with it too. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. WRIGHT:  I cross examined the principal with


respect to that particular issue, and he said, well, we


exchange papers because the students cheat.  I said, well,

the neighbor grading the other neighbor's paper -- they


don't have an opportunity to cheat?  Oh, yes, you're


right, Mr. Wright.  They do cheat.  So that doesn't


preclude the students from cheating, does it?  No.  Well,


no, they could cheat even during the exam because they


could write the answers on their hand. 


QUESTION:  Well, you need two cheaters for that


to work, whereas if you grade your own paper, it only


takes one.  Right? 


(Laughter.) 


MR. WRIGHT:  We believe that the plain language


governs what is an educational record and it does not mean


the permanent transcript.  If Congress had intended for


education records to mean a permanent transcript, they


could have easily placed language in there that said only


the permanent or cumulative record of a child is an


education record.  They didn't say that.  They even


excepted out sole possession notes, which are notes of the


teachers.  They excepted out directory information.  The


Family Policy Compliance Office has consistently over the


last 25 years held that the grade book is an education


record.


A parent would like to access it.  Here's the --


here's another consequence, that a parent doesn't have a


right to access if it's merely the permanent education

record of the grades.  The teacher could -- could say, no,


you can't see your child's grades.  A parent has to have


that information available to her for the purpose of


making some important decisions with respect to her child,


and that's exactly what Ms. Falvo went to the school


district and argued.  She argued that those are my


children's grades.  Those are between me and the teacher. 


I have a right to consent to their release, and I have a


right to access. 


QUESTION:  Well, but a moment ago, from what you


said, I thought the school district was telling her that


she couldn't see her children's grades.  That never


happened, did it? 


MR. WRIGHT:  No, that never happened.  But that


happened in a particular case that has been cited by the


petitioners in the State of California where a mom with a


special ed child was having a hearing and needed the


information in the grade book, and they said, no, FERPA


doesn't apply.  The grades in the grade book -- she had no


evidence available to her to make an informed decision


with respect to whether or not her child belonged --


QUESTION:  But that -- that wasn't what happened


here, was it? 


MR. WRIGHT:  That isn't what happened here, but


that has happened, Your Honor.

we submit. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Wright.


The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
