 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

12  that Texas would be allowed to use a specified quantity 
13  of water that is located in Oklahoma.  Oklahoma is now 
14  trying to back out of that bargain. 
15
16  of its position is essentially that the Court should 
17  disregard language that appears in the Red River Compact 
18  because that language is superfluous, that the Court 
19  should read into the Compact language that does not 
appear there, and that the Court should not give the 
20
21  text of the Compact what Oklahoma in its brief describes 
22  as "talismanic significance."

 Mr. Rothfeld? 

 Our very different view is that the plain 

Now, in the Red River Compact, Texas and

 But in the section of the Compact which is 
at issue here, Reach 2, Subbasin 5, the Compact uses a 

Oklahoma, along with Louisiana and Arkansas, agreed to 
allocate among themselves the waters of the Red River 
Basin.  The Compact divides that basin into large areas 
called reaches and subdivides the reaches into 
subbasins.  As to some of those areas, the Compact 
expressly allocates entitlement to water by State line. 
It says that the States may use the water within their 
boundaries exclusively.

11  very different and unique language.  That section --
12  that subbasin includes the territory of all -- three of 
13  the four compacting States.  The boundaries of that 
14  subbasin are drawn not by State lines, but by reference 
to the -- the last downside dam sites before tributaries 
15
16  to the Red River Basin -- Red River flow into the river 
17  itself. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Rothfeld, we are told 
18
19  that in other compacts when they really mean to give one 
State the right to take another State's water, the 
20
21  provision in the compact is much clearer, much more 
22  definite. 
23
24  kind of sketchy, isn't it?  Doesn't say how they're 
25

 This clause, the one that you rely on, is 

going to get it, if they're going to pay for it.

Alderson Reporting Company 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is the exact language? 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, the provision that we 
are relying on, I would say is not sketchy at all.  It 
is quite clear that all four of the compacting States 
are in the language of the Compact, have equal rights to 
the use of water, defined water in a defined area of the 
subbasin, so long as no State uses more than 25 percent 
of the water.  That -- that is quite express as to what 
is required.

In -- it's difficult to read that language

11  to mean anything other than that the States can take --
12
13  Do you want to read the exact language just to refresh 
14  our recollection? 
15
16  -- it is reprinted on page 8 of the blue brief in the 
17  indented text, and it says, "Within this -- within this 
18  subbasin, the signatory States have equal rights to the 
19  use of," and then it defines the water that they have the 
rights to the use of, "at times of normal flow" -- with 
20
21  the flow of the Red River at 3,000 cubic feet per second 
22  at the Arkansas/Louisiana border -- "provided that no 
23  State is entitled to more than 25 percent of the water in 
24  excess of this amount." 
25

MR. CLEMENT:  The exact language -- it appears 

There's a lot to be filled in.

rights to the use of --

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I have to disagree with 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It doesn't say that.  It 
says, "No State is entitled to more than 25 percent." 
It doesn't say -- I mean that language doesn't say what 
happens if in fact there's a State that because of 
cliffs or something can't get the 25 percent to which it 
is entitled.  It just doesn't say anything about it.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  It says that -- the section

14  is designed to allocate the water of the subbasin, and 
it says, "Within the subbasin, States have equal rights 
15
16  to use of the runoff."  That's the first part of it. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes. 
17
 MR. ROTHFELD:  The second part of it then 
18
19  says, "provided that no State is entitled to more than 
20
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Does that mean 
21
22  that a State can, when it can't get its pipeline to the 
23  river, go into some other State and take the water out 
24  of that other State?  I mean, I would have thought, if 
that was their intent, there would be a mechanism for

25 percent" --

that.  First of all, it is not at all a complex job. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's not at all complex 

doing it.  That you'd have some authority set up by the 
Compact that would decide where, whether it's really 
true, and how are we supposed to do it, and there is no 
such mechanism, rather if there is such a right, which 
it doesn't say anything about, it's left to the State 
courts in different States to try to do what is an 
extremely complex and controversial administrative job. 
 MR. ROTHFELD:  A couple points to say about

12  the south of the Red River, and Texas is going to say, 
13  I'm sorry, we can't get there, there's too much cactus. 
14  And then they're going to say, don't you know that, in 
fact, when you put your pipeline into Oklahoma, you are 
15
16  going to be taking part of the 25 percent that belongs 
17  to us. 
 And Texas will say, no, we aren't.  And then 
18
19  we'll have to have a way of measuring how much goes into

21  different pipelines are going to take out.  You 
22  understand what I'm saying.

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Right.  But --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I would have thought a 

mechanism would be set up to do that and there is none.

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine.  But they do say 

expressly, and I don't know what the terrain is like in 
the other areas.  And here it does not say anything 
about it.  That's why I think we're here in the Court 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Okay.  Again, several things 
about that.  First of all, in all these other compacts 
to which Justice Ginsburg alludes that are cited by our 
opponents, which expressly allow for cross-border --
virtually none of them provide any of the kinds of 
details that you are describing. 

1

11  because all it says is you can't take more than 
12  25 percent.  It doesn't say what happens when Texas is 
13  unable to get its 25 percent from the south.  I'm now 
14  repeating myself, but you point to the language that 
15
16  language. 
 MR. ROTHFELD:  What I say -- I guess I will 
17
18  say two things about that.  One, I think what you just 
19  say is, in fact, with respect, is not consistent with 
20
21
22  consistent with? 
23
24  specified water.  It -- the -- the subbasin is defined, 
25

again, not by State lines, it's defined by -- by 

says what I just say is not consistent with the 

the language.  I think that --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Which language is it not 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Equal rights to use of

Alderson Reporting Company

It seems to me that on the face of it, that 

is saying State lines are not relevant and that what we 

are looking at is a pool of water the States can come 

and get it.  And it is particularly so --


downstream dam sites.  So it has created a pool of water 

in the -- in this subbasin, and it says that all four 

States have equal rights to use of this water, provided 

that none takes more than 25 percent.

11
 MR. ROTHFELD:  And I think to the extent 
12
13  that there could be any ambiguity in the -- in that 
14  language viewed in isolation, in the context of the rest 
of the Compact, there are places where the drafters of 
15
16  the Compact, in fact, did refer to State lines.  They 
17  said that States are entitled to use the water within 
18  their State boundaries, in the respective States may use 
19  the water within their boundaries.  They did not -- the 
20
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think under your 
21
22  argument, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, that 
23  Louisiana could decide it doesn't want to wait for the 
24  flow of water to come to it, and it could just go right 
into Oklahoma, in which it shares no border, and I don't

to that --

about that. 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, let me make two points 

 First of all, I think that not only does it 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I will say two things 

know how it's going to do that, and take its 25 percent. 
Does that make sense in terms of the language? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, you're talking 
about Texas, but Texas shares a border and so it may be 
a little easier to cross the borderline.  But what's 
Louisiana going to do?

11
12  make sense in the language, it's compelled by the 
13  language because the language says within this subbasin 
14  all four States have equal rights.  Separately, there is 
another separate reach.  Reach V of the -- the Compact 
15
16  is Louisiana's, and so the water flows into Louisiana. 
17  When the water gets to Louisiana, it's no longer within 
18  the subbasin, it's somewhere else. 
19
20
21  could take its water from within the subbasin. 
22
23  through to Arkansas to Louisiana, so it could go to 
24  Louisiana --
25

 So the plain language of the Compact compels 

the reading -- compels the -- the point that Louisiana 

 Now, could it do that?  The subbasin runs

 And if I just heard that, then I might say 
okay, I think yours is a little better.  But -- but we 
have this enormous administrative mess that would seem 
to be created, and both those interpretations seem 

because what you have done is you've pushed me back to 
the equal rights.  And now if I am going to fight you on 
it, I have to say the equal rights to water means equal 
rights to water arising within its boundaries.  And all 
you have to say is equal rights to water arising 
anywhere in the subbasin.

 So let's go back to that and let me hear

13  quite clearly, now that I've focused it, what's the 
14  answer? 
15
16  Justice Sotomayor and I will turn to that? 
17
18  is, the States are going to take the water from the 
19  closest point where they can get it.  And so Louisiana

22  across the State line.

MR. ROTHFELD:  If I may just finish with 

 I think the second answer to the question 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How -- how does it do it? 

MR. ROTHFELD:  It has to apply to

Alderson Reporting Company 

whichever --


Official 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  To Oklahoma. 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  If it's going to Oklahoma, 

and this is partially responsive to Justice Breyer, it 

would have to apply to the water authorities within 
Oklahoma.  So what is going on here, Tarrant, the Texas 
water district, is applying to the Oklahoma Water 
Resources Board.  It will seek a permit.  This will 
operate precisely in the same way as if an Oklahoma 
applicant is seeking a permit.

17
18  that.  If Tarrant needs to obtain rights of way, 
19  Oklahoma law provides for exercise of eminent domain, or 
20
21
22  understanding that there is a place where Texas can put 
23  a line into the river, and then a subset of that 
24  question is, the main stem of the river, through --
without going through Oklahoma property, other than

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you say entirely 

within Oklahoma, just because of ownership of the bank? 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that I think is not 
correct as a factual matter.  The -- the Red River lies 
entirely within Oklahoma, and so Oklahoma, in order to 
get water out of the main stem, if -- if Texas were to 
do that, it would have to go into Oklahoma.  And -- and 
in fact, this is in response to -- in part to what --

11
12  some intervening property between Texas and the bank

14
Oklahoma and Texas is the south vegetation line of the 
15
16  Red River, so therefore it is out of the river past the 
17  bank to the vegetation line.  So in order to get water 
18  out of the main stem, Oklahoma and -- Texas would have 
19  to go into Oklahoma.  Now, there is --

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Right.  And that -- if I may, 

Justice Alito, that is -- that's a very misleading way 

laws that Tarrant is challenging here are laws that are 
discriminatory Oklahoma laws that prevent any use of 
water originating in Oklahoma outside. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  When you say Texas has the 

right to go into Oklahoma, just -- just think about that 
phrase.  That's -- that's very striking.  I mean, it 
sounds like they are going to send in the National Guard 
or the Texas Rangers.

14  contemplated. 
15
16  Oklahoma -- that Texas has the right to force Oklahoma 
17  to take private property in Oklahoma by eminent

there is normal priorities and they will get

two points there.  One is, if there is enough water to

13
14  applying a presumption against preemption to determine 
whether the challenged Oklahoma laws conflict with the 
15
16  Compact.  The rationale for that presumption where it 
17  has been applied is one of federalism, but the States 
18  themselves created the terms of the interstate Compact, 
19  and respect for the States as sovereigns in that context

Official 

provisions of the Compact make clear that a State's 

regulation of water has to be consistent with the 

allocations made under the Compact, and each State's 

obligations under the Compact. 


JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I am not quite 
sure I agree with your reading of the Court of Appeals' 
opinion.  It seems to me the Court of Appeals' opinion 
is consistent with the Respondents' argument that they 
looked at the terms of the Compact.

And it seems to me that you may be right 
10
11  that the Compact either says you get the water or you 
12  don't, and the dormant Commerce Clause is just 
13  irrelevant.  But I read the opinion of the court of 
14  appeals as being quite consistent with that proposition. 
You win or you lose, up or down, under the Compact.  The 
15
16  dormant Commerce Clause doesn't -- just doesn't have 
17  much to do with it. 
 MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, we agree with that. 
18
19  We don't think that the dormant Commerce Clause comes 
20
21  the water in Oklahoma through the Oklahoma permitting 
22  process depends entirely on whether the Compact gives 
23  them that right or not.

into play here.  We think that whether Texas can access 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's the way I 

read the analytic approach of the court of appeals at 

19
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

39A, when it starts talking about the point of --
Section 5.05. 

 MS. O'CONNELL:  Right.  And we don't 

disagree with that, that the -- that the commerce clause 
shouldn't come into play here. 

is with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that, 
regardless of whether a State law would frustrate the 
purpose or pose an obstacle to a State obtaining its 
share of water under the Compact, that that State law 

1 
2 
3
4 
5
6
7 
8 
9 
10
11  should prevail under the Compact.  So the Compact makes 
12  clear that those general provisions preserving State 
13  water law need to be consistent with each State's 
14  obligations under the Compact. 
15
16
17  you're relying on the Compact and its language, where do 
18  you come up with this idea that States first have to try 
19  to get their 25 percent from water within their borders? 
20
21
22  that that's an issue that, if the Court decided that --
23  that there are errors in the Court of Appeals' opinion 
24  that should be corrected, we think that's something the 
25

I don't see that anywhere. 

 MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, first of all, we think 

And if I could --

 Where we disagree with the Court of Appeals 

court of -- that the lower courts could consider on

Alderson Reporting Company 

remand. 

Official 

 But I'll tell you where it comes from, which 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it seems to me 

is Sections 2.01 and 2.10(a) of the Compact, which 
preserve the application of State water law.  Section 
2.01 says that, "Each State may freely administer water 
rights and uses in accordance with the laws of that 
State, but that such -- such uses shall be subject to 
the availability of water in accordance with the 
Compact."

5
6 
7 
8 
9 
10
11  that you like some provisions of State law, but not 
12  others. 
13
14  that if there's a State law that conflicts with the 
allocation or poses an obstacle to the allocation of 
15
16  water under the Compact, then it's preempted. 
 But, for example, if Texas could access 
17
18  25 percent of the water from within its State, then 
19  the -- the application of a State law that would bar 
Texas water users from obtaining a portion of its water 
20
21  in Oklahoma wouldn't necessarily be preempted because it 
22  wouldn't pose an obstacle to the allocation. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What do you do --
23
24  what do you do with a situation -- let's say there's 
25

Oklahoma water available to Tarrant that is closer than 

 MS. O'CONNELL:  No.  What we're saying is

the water they would get from somewhere else in Texas. 
Do they have to incur the additional expense to get 
Texas water, or can they take the cheaper route and get 
Oklahoma water? 

1 
2 
3 
4 
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, we think -- again, we 
5
think this is a -- an issue for the court of -- for the 
6 
lower courts to look at on remand, but we think there's 
7 
a -- there's a good argument to be made that, so long as 
8 
Texas could access 25 percent of the water within its 
9 
boundaries, then application of an Oklahoma law that 
10
11  would prohibit Texas from going through the Oklahoma 
12  permitting process wouldn't necessarily be preempted. 
 And again, we -- these -- these -- there are 
13
14  lots of issues, as we point out in our brief and we did 
15
16  addressed, perhaps, in further proceedings or perhaps 
17  before the --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. O'Connell, isn't that a 
18
19  reason why we shouldn't accept your basic view?  I mean, 
if -- if you think of all the issues that you laid out 
20
21  that are going to have to be decided and the difficulty 
22  of those issues -- I mean, you read this brief that you 
23  submitted, it gives you kind of a headache.  That --
24  that -- you know, and it -- it suggests how difficult 
25

at the invitation stage, that would need to be 

the process is. 

22
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MS. O'CONNELL:  Justice Kagan, I'd like to, 

maybe this provision can be read as an entitlement, but 
it can just as easily, as -- as Justice Breyer 
suggested, be read as a cap, "no more than 25 percent." 
So as between those two possible readings, 
the complexity of your way of reading this, which would 
have -- why? 

1
2 
3 
4 
5
6 
7 
8
if I could, go to the second point, which is on the --
9 
the -- whether you read this as a 25 percent entitlement 
10
11  or a cap, and I would like to point the Court, not just 
12  to the language of the Compact, which we think weighs in 
13  favor of the idea that each right -- each State has an 
14  equal right and that the -- the equal right to use the 
water in the subbasin implies an equal right, not just 
15
16  an opportunity. 
 But the interpretive comments that follow 
17
18  Section 5.05(b) -- this is at page 30 of the is Joint 
19  Appendix -- refer to a "right."  The first full 
20
21  it's the -- the second line.  "If the States have 
22  competing uses and the amount of water available in 
23  excess of 3,000 cubic feet per second cannot satisfy all 
24  such uses, each State will honor the other State's right 
25

paragraph there says, "When the flows" -- I'm sorry, 

Official 

 And then you look at this provision, and 

to 25 percent of the excess flow." 

23
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 The Red River Compact Commission also 

approved rules and regulations, and those say -- they're 
on page, I think, 19 of the Joint Appendix.  I might 
have that page -- yeah, I have that page wrong. 

But the -- the Red River Compact 


Commission's rules and regulations say that when the 

flow is above 12,000 cubic feet per second, so that 

Louisiana could get its 3,000 cubic feet per second, 

"each of the signatory States shall be entitled to 

25 percent of the total runoff in undesignated flow." 

1
2 
3 
4 
5
6 
7 
8 
9 
10
 So I think it -- it's pretty clear that 
11
12  based on the -- both the text of the Compact and the 
13  interpretive comments in the rules that the Red River 
14  Compact Commission came up with, that there is not just 
15
16  that doesn't amount to 25 percent, but -- but that each 
17  State is entitled to 25 percent of the water, and that 
18  if that involves going into another State within this 
19  geographic area that's not defined with respect to State 
boundaries, then that is permissible under the Compact. 
20
 And as the Petitioner pointed out, when the 
21
22  States wanted to impose a State boundary restriction in 
23  the Compact, they did so.  There are several subbasins 
24  that span more than one geographic -- or more than one 
25

State, and the Compact in those provisions says that you 

that you can take whatever is in your borders even if 

24
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And what does that mean? 

What would Oklahoma do? 

 MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, the Oklahoma Water 

can take whatever you want within your boundaries. 

 And I also don't think that this is going to 

be particularly troublesome to administer.  I mean, 
there may need to be some further proceedings on that, 
but Oklahoma law provides the backdrop for what would 
happen when a Texas water user goes in to -- to ask for 
a permit to appropriate and divert water from within 
Oklahoma.

21
22
23  the board is sitting there and it gets lots of 
24  applications from Oklahoma users.  And let's say it also 
gets multiple applications from Texas users.  That it's 
25

 MS. O'CONNELL:  Well --

just apply whatever laws they would apply to any 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, people keep on saying

 And I -- and I -- the Court shouldn't be 

concerned.  I know all -- I know there are amicus briefs 
submitted by other Texas entities that would like to 

not just one county, it's four counties.  What does 
Oklahoma do to -- to decide who gets the water? 

Petitioner's counsel pointed out, there's a -- a 
priority in water law, where whoever submits the 
application first would -- would get the water if it's 
available and they can put it to beneficial use.

receiving 25 percent of the water, then Oklahoma would 
not have to give it any kind of special priority.  But 
if it -- if it was not, then the Oklahoma Water 
Resources Board would treat it just like an Oklahoma 
applicant.

 MS. O'CONNELL:  Yes.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  And --

11
 JUSTICE ALITO:  And what if Texas didn't --
12
13  what if Texas could get -- could -- could release that 
14  water and increase the flow of the river, but it chose 
not to do so, so it could take other water out of the 
15
16  river? 
17
18  point made in the Respondent's brief --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah. 
19
MS. O'CONNELL:  -- and -- and the response 
20
21  to that would just be that all of the States would have 
22  the opportunity to do that.  In fact, the whole subbasin 
23  is defined by the last major dam site on the tributaries 
24  that are running in.  So Oklahoma could do the same 
25

 MS. O'CONNELL:  This -- this is the last 

thing.

 And also, when the reservoirs are full, 

they're full.  It's not like Texas could keep all of the 
water that's -- that's there from flowing into the 
bottom portion of that tributary. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, we're only 

considering the instance where there isn't enough water 
to meet the 25 percent in Texas.  And in that instance, 
I guess there are 50,000 places, not just in Oklahoma, 
but also in Arkansas, where they might get some.

16
17  of Appeals made in applying a presumption against 
18  preemption and in concluding that a Texas water user 
19  could never divert water from outside of its State.

Clause has always been read as equal rights to the use

favored Texas, so the math didn't come out that way. 

 But what's interesting about the Tarrant's

14  clause gives you an absolute equal right to a fixed 
25 percent, no exceptions.  But then you have this 
15
16  provided clause which does no work for them.  The

18  25 percent, they are saying, well, by definition, if you

would have to do, which no one else -- no one has

ultimately impossible because of Arkansas and Louisiana,

is call for an accounting and actually figure out what 
10
11  the total was, figure out what the excess was, divvy up 
12  the 4 shares, do exactly what Tarrant wants I guess to 
13  happen, which has never happened, and it's not clear to 
14  the drafters of the compliance rules that it could in 
15
16  Arkansas and Louisiana. 
 But -- so in other words, if we lost this 
17
18  case, which is probably why Tarrant is disavowing the 
19  United States' view, is Texas would be in quite of a 
20
21  25 percent.  And so I read Tarrant as saying, don't you 
22  dare send us back to try to prove that.  We want to be 
23  able to go whole hog into Oklahoma.

 The first is prior appropriation.  There are 

4 Texas entities that have signed up for permits:  The 

would not have agreed to this, and it would have been 
carefully articulated in a Compact. 

and why Oklahoma would have never agreed to this type of 
cross-border right because what Tarrant is doing is 
exploiting Oklahoma's law, which proceeds on the 
assumption that water in Oklahoma is a public trust 
that's held for the exclusive benefits of Oklahoma. 
 And there are three ways where Oklahoma

11  Upper Trinity, the North Texas Municipal Water District, 
12  Irving and Tarrant.  And poor Oklahoma City got 
13  sandwiched in the middle.  It beat -- it beat Trinity to 
14  the permit office by 24 hours. 
And so not surprisingly, it's open season 
15
16  for Oklahoma water, all of north Texas has come in and 
17  sought a permit and there's priority. 
18
19  problem.  Even if you take within State, all of these 
people, if they were applying for water in Texas as 
20
21  well, there'd be the same issue there.  One of them 
22  would beat the other one.  It's a question of priority. 
23  You're just claiming that everybody from Oklahoma should 
24  have -- well, not absolute priority, but --
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's the same 

MS. BLATT:  Well, I have two points.  First,

Alderson Reporting Company

had -- had Oklahoma seen this coming, since they hadn't 
heard about this until Tarrant filed its application, 
Oklahoma City certainly would have gotten in line 
faster.  And second of all, the whole point of this 
Compact -- and if you think about your equitable 
apportionment doctrines, which whoever gets to the water 
first gets a prior -- gets a priority permanently --
this was the point of the Compact.  Louisiana and 
Arkansas wouldn't have to develop their water, Texas and 
Oklahoma were much more economically developed States,

11  and the equal rights prevented a race to the permit 
12  office. 
 Let me get to the second aspect what's a 
13
14  problem, and that is, compacts usually spell out the 
points of diversion.  The last place Oklahoma would have 
15
16  picked as the point of diversion is the Kiamichi River,

18  desirable.

22  and thus can exercise a core sovereign power, and

 And this -- their view would make complete

they're basically saying there's 1 percent of this 
Compact that's unconstitutional. 

 And not only is it 1 percent, the minute it 
drops below 3,000, all of a sudden, it became.  And on 
this, we'd like to talk to the Russello principle.  I 
also hope you ask them, this is on page 15A of -- 14A of 
the 15A brief.  There are border references arbitrarily 
and they're missing, they're there.  It's completely 
inconsistent.

Tarrant thinks that there's some heretofore

functioning provision, and it's missing the border 

reference.  And I -- you don't have time now to ask the 
United States' view, but I think the United States would 
agree with us that if you give this border thing kind of 
the magical meaning, borders kind of appear and 
disappear with the water flow, which is very strange.

14  minute, which is 402, I want to walk you through this --
I'm sorry, 401(b).  This is a provision that -- this is 
15
16  water wholly within Texas.  And you don't have to 
17  understand much to know that Texas keeps 60, Oklahoma 
18  gets 40. 
19
is allocated 60 and Oklahoma is allocated 40.  Now, 
20
21  under Tarrant's view, because this is silent as to 
22  borders and because Oklahoma is not in this Reach, it's 
23  not actually located within the subbasin, Oklahoma 
24  either is entitled to or has to go get all of its water 
from Texas.  And this pattern repeats itself -- this is

the Compact is silent as to borders, and under their

I can't tell if they think Louisiana can go 
into Oklahoma or has to move one inch up to the border 
to take it out as opposed to just waiting, but under 
this view -- and again, it repeats itself throughout the

Texas itself has never asserted.  They're saying well,

13  there --
 MS. BLATT:  Well --
14
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- than it would be here? 
15
 MS. BLATT:  -- the disaster --
16
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And that argues against you 
17
18  because your main point, really, is that this is all too 
19  complicated --
MS. BLATT:  Justice Breyer, the disaster 
20
21  would be and the affront to sovereignty is throughout 
22  the Compact, not so much the measuring that's a problem. 
23  Oklahoma would be able to insist on crossing Texas's 
24  borders to draw that 40 percent.  And no one has ever, 
25

ever envisioned any of the Compact as not applying 

52

borders.  It's not so much the measurement. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought that 

 MS. BLATT:  Okay.  But if their view -- I 

mean, it is that they have to -- again, our view is that 
if they had wanted, like all the other cross-border 

was what your -- the other side does envision, that it 
doesn't -- it's not bound by the borders, but it's bound 
by the agreement, the Compact.  Compacts compromise the 
individual State sovereignty.  That's the whole point of 
them.

11  rights, to allow for an extraordinary right, they would 
12  have made an explicit statement and then spelled out 
13  exactly what that meant, most importantly the point of 
14  diversion.  Here, at most you have silence on the issue. 
15
16  sometimes because they say you do have borders unless 
17  there is a need.  Under Tarrant's view, which I think is 
18  the most jarring and remarkable view, this is all a 
19  borderless common, and every State could have 
criss-crossing pipelines into every State because you 
20
21  don't have an exhaustion requirement.  So Texas, even 
22  though it's got plenty of water in its fresh water 
23  streams and currently uses them, could take their whole 
24  25 percent from Oklahoma.  Oklahoma could take its whole 
25

25 percent from Texas.  Arkansas could come into 

Now, the government reads into borders 

53
 

Alderson Reporting Company

But the provision -- the Compact doesn't say 

Oklahoma -- and that's their view of the world. 


 And I think the United States thought, no, 

that doesn't make too much sense.  Let's at least make 

Texas exhaust. 


this.  Again, the United States and Tarrant proceed on 
the assumption that there is a numerical share, that 
it's equal rights to an exact 25 percent, exact 
25 percent.  Well, that's not what it says.  It just 
says equal rights to the use subject to a cap, and we 

1 
2

6 
7

9 
10
11  think a cap by limiting the use is not a guarantee that 
12  you can reach the cap, much less that you can cross 
13  borders to reach the cap. 
14
15
16  general here today spoke of lots of different examples 
17  where the language of entitlement and rights was used. 
18  Do you have a view as -- as to that?

21  say -- that's what I was saying that was sort of sad is 
22  because what they cited disproved what they were trying 
23  to assert it for.

 MS. BLATT:  So they -- you mean the two 
compliance rules they cited?  They cited -- so they 

 And if I could just make one more sense --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Blatt, the solicitor 

 So if you -- you don't even have to read 

the -- you don't even have to read the compliance rules. 

54
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 I don't know why they -- it's inexplicable. 

I can't tell you why they did that. 

Just read page 19 of their brief.  They say in the same 
sentence that we have an equal -- there's an equal right 
to one-fourth of an excess above 3,000.  So that means 
you take whatever is above 3,000 and divide by four 
equally.  And then they cite a provision that only 
divides by 3.  And then the next provision they cite 
didn't divide the excess, it divided the total water.

And the only other thing I want to say on 
10
11  the extrinsic evidence, and I do think -- if you think 
12  there's any ambiguity in here, which I think there 
13  clearly is, you have 30 years of post ratification, 
14  which the States immediately did long-term water 
planning without so mentioning of this right.  And 
15
16  Tarrant actually offered to buy the same water for 
17  $1.7 billion in 2002, which is a little bit inconsistent 
18  with the notion that they had this right all along. 
19  They just, in 18 months of negotiating history, never 
mentioned that they thought they owned the water, they 
20
21  were actually offering to pay 1.7 million.  And the 
22  amicus brief filed by the Tribes, on page 4, says we 
23  were at the negotiating table and we never heard Tarrant 
24  mention this right.
25

 And the other thing, I do think the water 

55
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

planning documents are highly significant because not so 

much Louisiana and Arkansas, but Oklahoma and Texas take 

water planning very seriously because of their prior 

appropriation systems.  There are hundreds of thousands 

of pages on the Internet and none of them mention this 

right.  Again, they cited something in their reply 

brief, but if you go look at it, it doesn't come close 

to mentioning a right of Subbasin 5.  Again, ironically 

it mentioned a portion of Oklahoma where Texas would 

have to actually buy the water. 

 We'd ask you to affirm.  Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
 Just a couple of points.  First, my friend, Ms. 

Blatt, said that it would make mincemeat and a complete 
mess out of the Compact to apply its terms as they were 
written.  We think that this Compact was negotiated over 
a period of 25 years.  If you look at the Joint 
Appendix, you will very painfully see that there are 
reams and reams of commentary on the -- on the 
negotiations.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do you deal with 

all the provisions she was mentioning with respect to 
the 60/40 division?  I can't make rhyme or reason of 
those provisions that don't use within State boundaries, 

 I think the Court has to assume that when 
the drafters of the Compact used language and referred 
to State lines in one place and not in another place, 
they had some idea of what they were doing and they made 
these different choices intentionally.  So I think the 
Court simply should read the terms of the Compact --

1
2 
3 
4 
5
6 
7
8 
9 
10
11  but it has to mean that. 
 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I don't think that it 
12
13  has to mean that.  If Oklahoma wants to enter Texas to 
14  take -- if it makes more sense for them to do it, they 
can.  If not, they can just wait for the water to flow 
15
16  down. 
 I think one thing which -- which Ms. Blatt 
17
18  did not address is the practicalities of how Subbasin 5 
19  operates.  If you look at the map that was pointed out 
to you, Subbasin 5, which is what we're talking about 
20
21  here, is a very wide -- hundreds of miles wide, but 
22  extremely narrow.  It's 10 to 20 miles wide -- north to 
23  south for most of its length. 
24
25

the States all take -- the assumption was all of the 

 The reason the drafters drew this is because 

57
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

water in this Subbasin was going to be surplus water, 

1 
literally excess water.  The States all take the water 

2 
that they want to use outside of Subbasin 5, and so 

3 
the -- the allocations that Ms. Blatt was referring to 

4 
by Oklahoma are all in Subbasin 1, they are not in 
5
Subbasin 5.  The water that flows into Subbasin 5 is 
6 
water that the States assumed was going to be surplus. 
7 
And so it would make no sense, having divided this water 
8 
evenly between the compacting States, to think that the 
9 
drafters would have required a water user in Texas at 
10
11  the far west end, which would get its portion of the 
12  25 percent share two miles across the border in 
13  Oklahoma, instead to have to go 200 miles to the east to 
14  get it out of Texas. 
15
16  accomplish by this.  They created, by the plain terms of 
17  the -- of the language, a common pool of water defined 
18  by dam site, not by State line, and gave each State 
19  equal rights to access that water so long as they did 
20
21
22  by Justice Kagan both to me and Ms. Blatt, I think the 
23  practical application of this is very simple.  One 
24  simply has to apply to the permitting authorities, 
25

wherever you're submitting your application from, they 

That is not what the drafters intended to 

not use more than 25 percent. 

 Your response to a question which was raised 

58
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

will apply their ordinary standards.  The Oklahoma Water 
Resources Board does that now for applications from 
within Oklahoma, it can do it just as well for 
applications from Texas or other from other States. 
And, again, the practicality of this is, 

1 
2 
3 
4 
5
water users are going to want to use water as close to 
6 
where they are located as they can.  They're going to go 
7 
right across the State line within Subbasin 5 if that's 
8 
the place to get the water.  It makes no sense to 
9 
require them to go hundreds of miles distant to get it. 
10
 Ms. Blatt suggested that we are reading the 
11
12  25 percent limitation out of the Compact.  I think her 
13  reading reads the equal rights language out of the 
14  Compact.  They read the Subbasin 5 language as being all 
15
16  gives equal rights to the water, and then says that you 
17  can't take more than 25 percent within your State.  So 
18  it's designed to do two things.  It's designed to give 
19  you an entitlement and to say you can only use 
20
 And finally, Ms. Blatt raised questions of 
21
22  -- of sovereignty and political concern.  As the Chief 
23  Justice suggested, this is a Compact that's an agreement 
24  between coordinate sovereigns.  They have decided what 
they want to do.  And the thing that gives respect to 
25

capped and no entitlement.  It does two things.  It 

25 percent of it. 

59
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

sovereignty is to write -- is to read the plain language 
of the Compact as the framers wrote it.  Again, they spent 
25 years writing it.  They took considerable care, as 
you can tell if you look at the negotiating history, in 
using the words for each provision.  Those words should 
be given meaning. 

 If there are no further questions.
