 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next this morning in Case 09-223, Levin, the 

Tax Commissioner, v. Commerce Energy.

 Mr. Mizer.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN C. MIZER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MIZER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Respondents are natural gas suppliers who 

object to the way Ohio taxes them.  Their suit belongs 

in State court rather than Federal court for two 

independent reasons.  First, principles of comity and 

federalism dictate that the State court should resolve 

challenges to the validity of their own tax laws.  And 

second, the Tax Injunction Act squarely prohibits 

Federal courts from issuing declaratory judgments 

holding State tax laws unconstitutional.

 Although either of these grounds would 

independently support reversal of the Sixth Circuit 

here, the analysis can really begin and end with the 

comity doctrine, because that is where the lower courts 

have shown confusion in the -­

have a question that there may be an obvious answer to, 

but I haven't found it.  My understanding is -- it's a 

standing question.  My understanding is that they are 

asking as relief, and the only relief they ask for, is 

to raise the taxes of a competitor.  Am I right?

 MR. MIZER:  That is how they have -- that is 

the case, correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  If that's correct, I 

have found no case that -- I haven't looked that hard, 

but certainly no case in this Court -- that said there 

is standing for a firm to challenge the taxes of a 

competitor where the remedy is:  Raise his taxes.  If 

there were standing for such a thing, it would -- I'm 

surprised that there aren't competitors all over the 

country doing business out of State bringing diversity 

cases in Federal court, saying:  My competitor's taxes 

should increase; it's all very complicated, but the 

Commissioner didn't properly follow State law.

 Now, I have found no case, certainly not in 

this Court, which said:  Where all you want is to raise 

the tax of a competitor, you have standing.  So perhaps 

this is well-settled that you can do it, but I thought I 

would raise that for both of you at the beginning in 

case there is something you want to say about it, which 

might save me a little time looking it all up.

MR. MIZER:  Well, I think there is a good 

reason that there -- there aren't cases in the Federal 

courts to that effect, but it's not a standing problem. 

And to address the standing point directly, it's because 

they do claim an injury that is cognizable.  Under 

Dennis v. Higgins, they are claiming a dormant Commerce 

Clause injury.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I have no doubt, and the 

standing rule I think is clear, that if we're saying 

because I am injured, and they have injury, you can't -­

you must give me reduction in my tax.  That's what those 

cases say.  I have no problem with that.  Absolutely 

clear.  You can do it.

 But where all you want is to raise somebody 

else's taxes, that I had thought -- and probably 

wrongly, but I had thought there is a prudential 

standing rule that says you cannot bring such a lawsuit. 

And I don't see why you should be able to.  It seems to 

me it would be a nightmare if you could, which doesn't 

surprise.

 So there we are.  That's the question.  And 

you will tell me:  No, it's all clear; they can do it. 

And I would like some citation or something and explain 

why they should be able to do it.  But you don't want 

to, anyway.  It's really for them.

MR. MIZER:  I am not aware of any prudential 

standing rule, Your Honor, any case, but that's because 

the Tax Injunction Act and the comity doctrine have 

always prohibited such a case.  And so that's why 

there's a lack of citation in the -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I suppose in 

discrimination cases, if there is a discrimination men 

versus women one way to resolve it would be to have 

either -- either rule apply to both sides.

 MR. MIZER:  That's right.  And the Court has 

said that in cases like Davis and McKesson, where a tax 

credit has been struck down as unconstitutional for 

either dormant Commerce Clause or equal protection 

reasons.  And this Court, in Davis and McKesson, said: 

Well, you can extend the credit if you wish or you can 

also contract the credit, but either way -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  On the other hand, until 

the Administrative Procedure Act was enacted, which -­

which eliminated all prudential bars to standing -- it 

clearly was the law that you could not complain about 

preference, unlawful preference, being given by the 

government under regulatory provisions to a competitor. 

The law was:  That's tough.  There was no standing.  And 

that was a prudential law, I assume.  And I don't know 

why it's any different from the tax law.

MR. MIZER:  And cases would have existed 

challenging State tax laws, regardless of the APA for 

Federal challenges, because the -- and those cases all 

would have been adjudicated in the State courts, because 

that is where State tax laws and State administrative 

procedures are best challenged.

 The -- the rule of comity holds that the 

Federal courts should not entertain a challenge to a 

State tax law where that challenge would either disrupt 

the operation of the State tax regime or would intrude 

into the meaning or application of the State tax law. 

Both of those elements are true here.  This suit is 

disruptive because the suit goes to the very core -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- State law is unclear 

here that would require Federal interpretation?

 MR. MIZER:  At pages 27 to 33 of the blue 

brief, we identify all of the ways in which the parties, 

the State and the Respondents, dispute the application 

and meaning of State tax law, particularly as to what 

taxes should be compared for apples and oranges 

purposes.

 And the tax -- the Ohio tax question that's 

at issue is:  What is a franchise tax versus what is a 

State tax?

 There is also the disruption of the

application of State tax law here, because any remedy 

that would be afforded would necessarily alter the way 

that the State can -- can tax.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why can't the Pullman 

doctrine or the Burford doctrine, abstention doctrines, 

be enough to counsel Federal abstention in this case? 

Why do we have to create another exception to Hibbs and 

not go to another established abstention doctrine?

 MR. MIZER:  The Court doesn't have to create 

anything, Your Honor, because Fair Assessment and Great 

Lakes already say that the Burford and Pullman 

principles get sort of bonus points in the tax context. 

And then -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why did you -- did 

you argue Pullman in the court below?

 MR. MIZER:  Yes, the principles of 

abstention were argued in the district court and -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no, no, no.  Did you 

cite Pullman and did you argue it on a Pullman 

abstention basis?

 MR. MIZER:  To be frank, I don't know if 

Pullman was -- was specifically cited, but that's 

because Fair Assessment itself, which was heavily cited 

in the lower courts, incorporates the principles of 

Pullman and Burford and says that these tax questions

raise -- that these tax challenges raise questions about 

the meaning of State law, about the operation of a 

complicated regulatory regime, and so they are better 

left to the State court.

 The -- the application of the State law here 

is particularly disruptive, because the tax laws being 

challenged intersect integrally with the regulatory 

regime.  Just to give one example, among the taxes that 

Respondents are objecting to is the gross receipts tax, 

which public utilities, the local distribution 

companies, pay, but the non-public utilities like 

Respondents do not pay.

 The gross receipts tax is relevant on both 

the tax and regulatory side of the ledger, because it's 

a tax but it's then also a cost that as we explain at 

page 6 of the blue brief, may be included in the gas 

cost recovery formula for the rate that the public 

utilities may charge their customers.  And those rates 

are approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.

 So if the gross receipts tax is eliminated, 

it will affect the regulatory side of things as well. 

And that distinguishes this case from Hibbs.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think it's -- it's 

correct -- in relation to Hibbs, is it accurate to say 

that you think that this case is different from Hibbs

for essentially three reasons:  That this one involves a 

complicated analysis of State law and Hibbs did not; 

that this one would potentially have a substantial 

financial effect on the State and in Hibbs that would 

not happen; and this case involves claims under the 

dormant Commerce Clause and equal protection rather than 

the Establishment Clause?  Does that -- are those -­

does that capture it or is there something more?

 MR. MIZER:  The first two especially capture 

it, Your Honor.  And I think the third point is really 

just an additional explanation of the first two points, 

because in an establishment clause challenge like Hibbs, 

the remedy is often going to be very simple.

 In Hibbs, for example, there was a credit 

being challenged.  And the Federal court could simply 

pull the thread of that credit, and the rest of the 

fabric of the Arizona tax scheme would remain intact. 

Here, by contrast, if the thread of the gross 

receipts -- sorry, of the sales tax and the commercial 

activities tax is pulled, the fabric of the State's 

taxation and regulatory regime will unravel.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose if this -- you 

have the dormant Commerce Clause claim and it doesn't 

require a complicated analysis of State law.  You have 

different rates of taxation, let's say, for two

different categories of entities, and it's really not a 

very important tax credit, so pulling the thread isn't 

going to have much effect.  And this case -- then the 

case would come out differently?  Comity would not bar 

that action?

 MR. MIZER:  I think it would be a much 

closer case, Your Honor, but still there would be an 

interest in allowing the State courts to resolve that 

challenge, because as the Court has explained, when a 

State court is -- is trying to address a constitutional 

challenge that involves the application of State law, it 

can engage in constitutional avoidance in ways that the 

Federal courts cannot.

 The State courts also have greater 

competency, of course, with their own tax law, and they 

have a greater remedial panoply available to them.

 So, in your hypothetical, Justice Alito, 

the -- the Federal court could not order a decrease in 

the taxes of the challenger because that, as Hibbs 

explains, would be revenue depleting, whereas if it were 

in State court, the State court could decrease the 

revenue -- sorry -- decrease the taxes of the 

challenger, and then that would allow the State courts 

most naturally to remedy the -­

have a law that said, we are going to do different tax 

schemes for African Americans than from whites.  And 

they do exactly what is done here.  They are going to 

tax on one thing but not on another.  They are going to 

give an exemption in one area, but not another.

 Is that a case that would have to be -- an 

equal protection challenge that would have to be decided 

in State court?

 MR. MIZER:  Fair Assessment says in footnote 

4 that if it doesn't -- if such a challenge doesn't 

require scrutiny of the meaning and application of State 

laws, then it may -- Fair Assessment suggests that such 

a case might be able to proceed in Federal court.

 But if the -- if the challenge does require 

scrutiny of State law or resolution of -- of unclear 

State law questions, then it should be in State court, 

and there is no reason -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know if that is 

an answer to my question or not.  I -- I -- the only 

thing I changed in the hypothetical was that the 

challenge was an equal protection challenge race -­

based on a suspect classification.  But the credit 

system is no different.  Would or would not that

were equally complicated, then it is a challenge that 

should go to the State courts, because there is no doubt 

that the State court can handle Federal constitutional 

questions and along the way, they might be able to 

construe the State law in a way that avoids the 

constitutional shoals -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you reach that 

conclusion under the comity principles of Fair 

Assessment?

 MR. MIZER:  I do, but also because the Tax 

Injunction Act would exclude the case if it would have 

revenue depleting effects -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Revenue depleting.

 MR. MIZER:  -- on the State coffers.  And 

the remedy might, in that case, have such an effect 

if -- if the -- if the result is to tilt the balance 

heavily against a party who then needs to have its own 

taxes assessed.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I am curious to know why 

neither opinion in Hibbs addressed the comity principle 

and I would like your view on that.  I know what you are 

thinking.  Your answer is:  Well, you tell me, -­

(Laughter.)

MR. MIZER:  Well, it was fully briefed in 

Hibbs, and that is I think why the Court addressed 

comity in footnote 9.  And footnote 9 of Hibbs simply 

says that the comity doctrine doesn't cover such a 

challenge.  And the explanation, I think, of footnote 9 

is that the Court cited both Fair Assessment and Great 

Lakes.  And those cases stand for the proposition that 

when a -- a tax challenge has a disruptive effect, for 

all practical purposes, on the collection or 

administration of the State tax regime, then comity bars 

it.

 And so when the Court in footnote 9 of Hibbs 

said challenges are barred by comity if they arrest or 

countermand State tax collection, it was -- it was 

speaking about the kind of cases at issue.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It wasn't brought up -­

comity wasn't brought up in Hibbs because if the -- if 

there was an alleged constitutional violation, then 

there was only one way to go.  The parochial -- the 

payments to the parochial schools could not be -- had to 

be eliminated, so there was no question of abstention 

versus invalidation or doing something else that was 

fancy.  That's -- that's why this case is nothing like 

that, because there was only one way -- only one cure.

things.  What -- the Federal court could -- is -- is 

being asked to increase somebody else's taxes.  That's a 

very strange notion.  But what could the State court do? 

The same case in State court -- and let's assume there 

is a constitutional violation, either the Commerce 

Clause or the equal protection.  What could the State 

court do that a Federal court couldn't?

 MR. MIZER:  I think there are three options 

available to the State court.  First, it could decrease 

the -- the taxes on the challengers, even if they don't 

ask for such a decrease.

 They could also increase the challenges -­

the taxes on the local distribution companies, or they 

can do what the Ohio Supreme Court has done in the 

education context, for example, which is to declare 

unconstitutionality and then leave it for the General 

Assembly, the Ohio legislature, to fix the problem and 

then come back with a remedy.

 If -- if that kind of relief were ordered by 

the Federal court, it would mean Federal court oversight 

essentially of Ohio budgetary processes, which this 

Court has repeatedly discouraged.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  May I come back to your 

answer to Justice Ginsburg's question?  Would it be 

beyond the ability of the Arizona courts, had that case

been -- had Hibbs been brought in Arizona, to hold that 

under whatever principles of severability Arizona has, 

the tax credits for some private schools could not be 

stricken without striking the entire provision?

 MR. MIZER:  I think the entire provision 

would have to be stricken in Hibbs because of the nature 

of the as-applied challenge there.  They were saying 

that all the money was going to private schools, private 

religious schools.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  The point is that -- that 

one possible -- if there was an Establishment Clause 

violation, one remedy would be to prohibit credits for 

payments made to religiously affiliated schools, but 

allow the credits for other private schools.  But under 

principles of severability, couldn't an Arizona court 

say that can't be severed from -- from allowing the 

credits for payments to secular private schools?

 MR. MIZER:  That's probably right, Your 

Honor, and the -- what it illustrates is that often 

State courts have available to them remedies that 

Federal courts may not, particularly when plaintiffs 

have pleaded the case in such a way as to tie one hand 

behind the Federal court's back.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Doesn't that suggest Hibbs 

should have come out the other way?

MR. MIZER:  Well, to be frank, Your Honor, 

the State of Ohio joined an amicus brief urging the 

opposite outcome in Hibbs.  But we are not urging the 

overrule of Hibbs here.  We think that, even on Hibbs' 

own terms, the Tax Injunction Act applies here to 

preclude this challenge in Federal court.  And to return 

to Justice -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If -- just one more.  If 

the remedy is likely to be we will leave it up to the 

legislature -- you had -- you had two or three different 

optional remedies -- would we say that that is an 

adequate State remedy?

 MR. MIZER:  Yes, I believe so, Your Honor. 

Because so long as the challenger would be able then to 

-- to seek some sort of contempt action if the -- if the 

remedy were not -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Contempt of the 

legislature?  Contempt did you say?

 MR. MIZER:  Of the -- of the tax 

commissioner.  If the tax commissioner is continuing to 

collect unconstitutionally unbalanced taxes, then I 

should think that there should be some enforceability 

there.

 But the adequacy of the challenge available 

is -- is measured, as this Court explained in Rosewell,

purely by procedural measures.  And so for -- in 

Rosewell the question was whether or not the parties 

could go to State court and would procedurally be able 

to get access to State court to resolve their claim and 

that is clearly true and no one contests that here.

 The -- to return to Justice Sotomayor's 

question about the -- the racial cases, that may seem 

troubling, if a racial challenge is excluded from 

Federal court, but -- but there is no doubt that State 

courts can resolve such claims and in fact the Ohio 

Supreme Court handles tax cases as a routine matter.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where is -- the cases 

running up to Hibbs, those were all cases that involved 

racial discrimination, and they were in the Federal 

courts.

 MR. MIZER:  They were, Your Honor, and in -­

in every case that we have examined one of two things 

was true:  Either the party was claiming standing not 

based on the fact that he himself was subject to 

unconstitutional taxes; or the party was not -- did not 

have an adequate remedy in the State court.  For 

example, in the Griffin case this Court said that the 

problem was that in Virginia nothing was being done to 

remedy the -- the unconstitutional burdens imposed 

there.  And so the lack of an adequate remedy both under

the comity doctrine and under the Tax Injunction Act 

allowed the plaintiffs there access to the Federal 

court.

 And so the comity rule that we are 

advocating, which is clearly laid out in both Fair 

Assessment and Great Lakes, would not have any effect on 

those cases because of the lack of an adequate remedy.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there anything -- I see 

in their complaint, they ask for "such other relief to 

which plaintiffs are entitled," and therefore the judge, 

despite what they say, might just say:  Well what you 

are entitled to is you are entitled to pay fewer taxes.

 Is that a plausible thing, in which case it 

would interfere with the revenue collection of the 

State.

 MR. MIZER:  We think -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  What is -- what's your -­

you better give me your accurate assessment, not just 

agree with me, because I would like to know what you --

I want to know both sides.

 MR. MIZER:  The Tax Injunction Act would bar 

the Court, I think, from entering an order that says the 

taxes on the challengers are decreased, which 

illustrates the reason that the State of Ohio with its 

sovereign interest in its own tax policy -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  But I have no idea -- why I 

am asking the question is I have no idea or little idea 

of the underlying State law merits.  And my suspicion is 

in about 10 or 15 minutes I will hear that the State law 

merits are such that it's virtually impossible that they 

are going to say to us:  Pay fewer taxes.  Rather they 

will say to our competitors:  Pay more taxes.  So now is 

your chance to reply to that hypothetical argument just 

in case they make it.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MIZER:  Well, first of all, Your Honor, 

the -- the merits of this case are very much like the 

merits of General Motors Corporation v.  Tracy, which 

this Court decided about 13 years ago.  But the merits 

also illustrate the complexity of any remedy that -­

that would be ordered in this case, because if it's so 

simple as the Federal court simply saying that the local 

distribution companies, the public utilities, now must 

pay the sales tax and the commercial activities tax, 

then suddenly those entities would be subject to five 

taxes, a -- a much greater burden then is imposed on the 

Respondents.

 And then the General Assembly would have to 

go back to the drawing board to adjust the taxes on the 

local distribution companies.  So even if the simple

remedy that they ask for is entered by the Federal 

courts, still the State of Ohio has to respond by 

readjusting its sales tax and its commercial activities 

tax; and in that event it first of all could easily end 

up in a net revenue loss for the coffers of the State of 

Ohio.

 It also would mean that the regulatory side 

of thing would be affected, which brings us back to the 

Burford principles we discussed earlier, because the 

taxes, as I said, are integrally connected to the way 

Ohio regulates public utilities.  And those public 

utilities have obligations to a captive market that the 

Respondents don't have to meet.  They serve customers in 

their area no matter what, whereas Respondents don't 

have to -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but this -- but this 

doctrine, I -- I am not very sympathetic to that 

argument because this is a doctrine that is directed to 

the State collecting taxes, not to interfering with 

State regulation.  That -- that's a different doctrine.

 MR. MIZER:  But Your Honor, I think that 

Great Lakes and Fair Assessment stand for the 

proposition that when a Federal court issues an order 

that invalidates a State tax law, that has a disruptive 

effect on the collection of taxes; and that would be

true here because the State of Ohio would no longer be 

able -- would not be able to collect five different 

taxes from local distribution companies without being -­

turning around and facing a new challenge on -- on 

unconstitutionality of that burden by the local 

distribution companies.

 And so the -- the complicated nature of the 

tax-regulation interplay here is all the more reason 

that this case belongs in State court, for the State 

courts to resolve those interconnected questions in ways 

that they are fully equipped to answer.

 The other factor that was relevant to the 

Court's analysis -­

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'm just a little puzzled. 

I think you are giving the State court an awful lot of 

power.  Can it do it without new legislation?  They have 

to adjust these other taxes, maybe the expenses they 

deduct in their regulatory filings and all the rest. 

But I don't know that the State court has any more 

authority to grant a judicial remedy than the Federal 

court would have.

 MR. MIZER:  The State court might be able to 

enter a remedy, Justice Stevens, that is so simple as 

enjoining the sales tax exemption and the commercial 

activities tax exemption for local distribution

companies, and then also saying that because the LDCs 

have to pay those taxes they no longer have to pay the 

gross receipts tax and the other two taxes that are 

imposed on them.  That's an order that the Federal court 

couldn't issue because under principles of both the Tax 

Injunction Act and the -- and comity -­

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But the Tax Injunction Act 

goes to the authority or the jurisdiction of the court 

to entertain the case in the first place.  I'm not sure 

the Tax Injunction Act prohibits the remedy that you 

describe, because there is a difference between filing 

the suit and entering relief after the suit's been 

filed.

 MR. MIZER:  With respect, Your Honor, I 

think that Great -- that Grace Brethren squarely stands 

for the proposition that a Federal court shouldn't enter 

an order that says that the State tax law is -- that 

declares the State tax law unconstitutional and then 

enjoins it.  And that is exactly what would be required 

in order to eliminate the additional taxes on local 

distribution companies.  And that analysis is done at 

the front end, not at the end after the Court has 

resolved the constitutional merits and then says, well, 

I guess I am not able to enter the order that makes the 

most sense here to resolve the constitutional question.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN C. FITCH

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. FITCH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Justice Breyer, if I can go directly to your 

question with respect to standing.  Standing has never 

been raised in this -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's all right.  It's in 

the jurisdictional amount.

 MR. FITCH:  I understand, Your Honor.  But 

because it has never been raised.  I do not have a good 

answer for you.  What I can say to the Court is that in 

Hibbs -- recognizing Hibbs was an Establishment Clause 

claim -- the Court struck down the credit.  There is a 

recent case out of the First Circuit in Coors where 

Coors reversed their prior case out of -- involving the 

Butler Act out of Puerto Rico, and that involved beer 

distributors challenging a credit or an exemption that 

Puerto Rico was -­

I don't care; either make them pay or give me my money 

back.

 MR. FITCH:  Well -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  So that -- that should be 

your case, I would have thought.  But you're not saying 

it so you can get into Federal court.  Now, that's how I 

read it.  And that seems -- that's worrying to me.

 MR. FITCH:  Well, Justice Breyer, so -- what 

I would say is that -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  The Establishment Clause, I 

would add, there is a lot of reason for thinking it's 

special in respect to standing, because there is no 

other way to challenge the Establishment Clause.  And 

that is a long-festering disagreement within this Court, 

but I'm not sure you can apply these rules to everything 

else.

 MR. FITCH:  And I understand that, Your 

Honor.  And I guess the point that I'm trying to make is 

because that issue was not raised, based upon Hibbs, 

based upon the decision in Coors, we did not see a 

standing issue based upon this competitive situation 

you're talking about.  If in fact that is an appropriate 

question for additional briefing, we would obviously 

welcome that opportunity.

worrying me.  What's worrying me is, is there are 

businesses all over the country and there's Federal tax 

law, too.  And suddenly people begin to think:  Hey, 

this is a terrific idea; I am going to go through my 

competitor's tax returns and I will discover taxes they 

should have paid but didn't, and all of a sudden we will 

face a lot of lawsuits challenging other people's taxes. 

That's what is worrying.

 MR. FITCH:  Okay.  And I would disagree with 

you, Justice Breyer, for this reason.  There are already 

substantial limitations on when this type of case can be 

brought.  We start with the TIA.  It says if we are -­

we can't restrain the collection of taxes.  We have the 

abstention doctrines that have been mentioned.  We have 

the fact that the Court in a merits situation has to 

give deference to the States.

 And so the point I'm trying to make is that 

we believe this is a very narrow window.  There is only 

a very narrow window open.  What we are doing is 

challenging an exemption granted to a competitor.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And this is not true of the 

other cases.  What do you think of the other half of 

their argument?  I'll have to think about the standing 

thing to see if I want to press it or not.  But the 

other half is:  Look at your case.  Your case would just

be like -- just like the other cases, if you just said: 

Give us a refund, as they did in the other cases.

 But you haven't said that, because that 

would run afoul of the Tax Injunction Act.  Rather, what 

you have said is:  Raise their taxes.  So the point of 

the State is:  Now, wait a minute.  Leaving all of the 

things aside, you asked for other appropriate relief, 

and it's highly probable in such situations that a Court 

could -- would say:  Give them the exemption.  And if 

it's going to say, give them the exemption, hey, this is 

now not within Hibbs.  So what's your response to that?

 MR. FITCH:  Your Honor, I don't -- as my 

friend Mr. Mizer said, I don't believe a court could 

say:  Give them an exemption.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?

 MR. FITCH:  It would be in violation of the 

TIA.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  There's a lot of 

things they could say -­

MR. FITCH:  It would interrupt -- interrupt 

-- it would impede the collection of taxes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Of course.  Of course. 

Absolutely right.  That's what worrying me.  That isn't 

the answer.  That's the question.  And -- and the -­

discrimination problems.  Usually, either remedy is at 

issue.  You can't control the remedy because you asked 

for all other appropriate relief.  Ergo, it falls afoul 

of the Tax Injunction Act.  What's your response to 

that?

 MR. FITCH:  And I -- I'm -- I'm sorry, 

Justice Breyer.  We are saying that if we ask for the 

other relief, if we ask for us to get the exemption, 

that would impede State taxes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You didn't ask only for the 

other relief.  You asked for such other relief to which 

plaintiffs are entitled.  And what they say -- now I 

repeat the argument.  Okay.

 MR. FITCH:  We did include that phrase.  The 

relief we are seeking, Your Honor, is the declaratory 

relief and injunctive relief that we have spelled out 

with respect to the exemption.

by your plea.

 MR. FITCH:  And that was not what we were 

seeking.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Makes sense to me.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, there's another 

little problem.  Do you know of any case where a benefit 

that A enjoys is taken away from A in a suit where A is 

not a party?  I mean, you are fighting the Ohio tax 

commissioner.  You want to take a benefit away from 

these LDCs, but they are not in the suit.  Don't -­

isn't there a little due process problem with that?

 MR. FITCH:  The response, Justice Ginsburg, 

is this.  Number one, in part it takes away a tax 

benefit from the LDC; in part it takes away a tax 

benefit from the customers of the LDC.  I know that 

doesn't make us any more sympathetic.  But the sales tax 

is paid by the customer.

 Now, with respect to the joinder of 

necessary parties, the motion that was filed by the 

State, which started all of this 3 years ago after a 

complaint, also included a motion to dismiss for failure 

to join necessary parties.  That has also never been 

addressed.  We responded to that.  The court decided not 

to refer to it.  We made an argument that it was not 

necessary in this case to join the LDC's.  The Court has

deferred and did not rule.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was that argument? 

That you're taking a benefit -- you're saying:  The only 

relief we want is to take this benefit away from people 

who are not in the lawsuit?

 MR. FITCH:  Well, our argument was simply, 

Your Honor, that we are challenging the exemption issued 

by the State.  If the -- two points, quickly.  If the 

LDCs -- at that time, four; now two -- were -- wanted to 

be involved, they could certainly move to intervene. 

The second point was if the Court, of course, ruled that 

they were necessary parties, then we would have the 

opportunity to adjoin them.

problem there, Your Honor.  There is an issue that has 

been raised by several of the justices I'd like to 

address, I think Justice Stevens in particular, with 

respect to:  What if this went to State court?  And I 

would disagree with my friend.  If this went to State 

court, we believe that under State law in the education 

cases that Mr. Mizer were referring to.  It's called the 

Duroff case, and we have the citation if the Court would 

like it.  What the Court said was, once we declare the 

matter unconstitutional, our job is at an end; that it 

had to go back to the legislature.  We challenged the 

proposition raised in the amicus brief and raised today, 

the notion that if this was in a State court, that a 

State court could go rewrite this statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You conceded -- I'm 

sorry.  You conceded below, to quote footnote 2 of the 

opinion below, that there is an adequate State court 

remedy available.

 MR. FITCH:  In State court.  We conceded 

that we could bring this action in State court.  We 

could seek the injunction in State court.  We could seek 

the declaratory judgment in State court.  But when we 

speak to remedy, the point that we are trying to make, 

Your Honor, because it is the remedy where the Federal 

court interference becomes the greatest.  What we are

saying is:  We do not believe a State court has 

necessarily brought our remedies.  And our -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you are claiming that 

the Federal court could only power -- only power would 

be to declare it unconstitutional and send it back the 

State legislature to decide what to do?  Or you are 

claiming the Federal court has a power the State court 

doesn't have, which is to order the exemption to be 

rescinded?  I'm not sure what your point is.

 MR. FITCH:  Okay.  The point, Your Honor, is 

this:  We believe the Federal court and the State court 

would have the power to declare under the dormant 

Commerce Clause and Equal Protection Clause, that this 

exemption is unconstitutional, that either court could, 

at that point, enjoin prospectively the operation of 

that exemption.  The question then becomes:  What 

happens then?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So then, in your opinion, 

your next-door law firm, next to you, brings a case and 

says:  Mr. Fitch should pay $1,000 more taxes next year 

because he deducted $2,000 that was illegal.  You see 

that?  You see?  Now I'm trying to bring it home.  There 

is something wrong with this picture, and I can't quite

Justice Scalia.

 MR. FITCH:  If I could try to bring that 

point home, Justice Sotomayor.  What we say is we are 

asking the Federal court to rule on the 

constitutionality on our Federal claims, enjoin this 

exemption and the court's work is at an end at that 

point.  What we believe will happen at that point is 

that the legislature will be faced with a choice.  How 

to deal with this -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why should -- why should 

the Federal court make that choice?  I mean, in the -­

in the Federal cases where extension versus invalidation 

has come up, those were all Federal laws and the court 

said in the interim, we are going to extend the benefit,

we are not going to take away benefits from anyone. 

Every one of those cases they extended a benefit 

until -- unless and until Congress acts, but there was 

some comfort there because they were dealing -- the 

Federal court is dealing with Federal legislation.

 It seems to me that -- that there is that 

choice, the State courts are much better equipped to say 

what should happen in the interim until the legislature 

acts.

 MR. FITCH:  We do not believe that the 

Federal court could extend that benefit.  I think we are 

in agreement there, Justice Ginsburg.  We -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The State court could.

 MR. FITCH:  We questioned whether the State 

could.  We questioned whether if the State court found 

it constitutional, whether under Ohio law the State 

court could extend that benefit.  We think this is a 

legislative issue.  And there is a point I need to make, 

because in the briefs and in the argument today you are 

saying there are two choice.  The two choices are you 

either extend the exemption to everyone or you eliminate 

the exemption.

 I need to make this point tying into 

Mr. Mizer's comments about regulation.  There is another 

option which is the regulatory option.  What we are

dealing with here is our utility mandate.  It may be 

that the legislature opts on a regulatory basis to 

eliminate this problem and that goes to footnote -- the 

footnote we have in the brief -­

JUSTICE STEVENS:  That raises another -­

another problem for me.  Your basic standing is 

similarly situated competitors, one is being taxed and 

the other is not.  But you are not similarly situated 

competitors because they are regulated utilities and you 

are unregulated.  Isn't that right?

 MR. FITCH:  No, Your Honor.  No, Justice 

Stevens, that's -- that is not correct and that is the 

whole basis for our filing this complaint, if you looked 

at the complaint.  That is what the Court said in 

General Motors v. Tracy.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.

 MR. FITCH:  And what our -- what our 

complaint lays out is sea change of change, we have gone 

from a regulated situation to essentially an unregulated 

situation on the gas commodity piece.  There are two 

pieces.  There is delivery, there is gas commodity.  The 

gas commodity piece has been essentially deregulated and 

that is what the Court was focused on in Tracy.

 What our complaint very clearly lays out is

circumstance that will result in a different ruling in 

Tracy.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Counsel, I -- I hate to 

introduce another procedural glitch into this thing, but 

as I -- as I understand it, the State's motion to 

dismiss was under -- under 12(b)(1), which is a motion 

to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and 

that was granted by the court.  The TIA is assuredly a 

jurisdictional statute, but I had never thought that the 

comity doctrine was a doctrine of jurisdiction.  In 

fact, by -- almost by definition it says the court has 

jurisdictions but nonetheless should decline to exercise 

any.  You didn't make that objection, though.

 MR. FITCH:  I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You did not make that 

objection.

 MR. FITCH:  We did not -- we did not make 

that objection, I do not believe.  That is the entire 

discussion of Justice Brennan in his concurring opinion 

in Fair Assessment, and we think it is an -- an 

extremely important point.

 The district court has jurisdiction in this 

case.  It has jurisdiction.  The question is, does 

comity -- should comity tell it not to use that 

jurisdiction.  And what we are really fighting about

here is what are those standards that a district court 

is going to use to decide whether to -- to use comity to 

not exercise that jurisdiction.

 And what we are saying -- what we are saying 

in our case is Hibbs did address comity.  The issue was 

before the Court in comity and Hibbs said, and now four 

circuits have followed that ruling in Hibbs as well as 

lower courts and have said, if you are not seeking to 

impede State tax collection, comity does not bar -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's because there 

was only one way to go.  Either the benefit is removed 

or it's not.  There wasn't the other possibility of 

decreasing the taxes on your client.  There wasn't an 

extension versus invalidation.  It was if the 

constitutional claim was good, it had to be invalidated, 

the credit had to be invalidated.

 MR. FITCH:  And -- and I think what we are 

trying to say, Justice Ginsburg, in our -- in our case 

is we are not trying to seek invalidation.  We -- we -­

we are not going to seek the benefit for us.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It is not up to you to 

make that decision, if the State can go either way.  I 

mean in the extension versus invalidation cases this 

Court made it very clear, you could go one way or the 

other, and that was a decision for the court to make,

not the litigant.

 MR. FITCH:  But, Your Honor, the point we 

are making is that some court somewhere has to make the 

decision whether this exemption violates the dormant 

Commerce Clause in the equal protection case.  And it 

was our judgment that the best forum for that was in 

Federal court.

 And again, and I -- and I -- if I am not 

responsive to your question, I apologize, but what we 

are saying is that, we want to reach the merits on that 

question of constitutionality.

 And once that is done, the remedy is going 

to lie with the State.  We are not going to ask the 

Federal judge to decrease our taxes.  We question 

whether a State judge could decrease our taxes.  We want 

that declaration and we want that injunction.  That's 

what -- that's what we are seeking in this case.  And 

we -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you -- do you recognize 

that comity is broader than the Tax Injunction Act, and 

if it is, how do you justify your argument that would 

essentially limit the comity doctrine to the contours of 

the Tax Injunction Act?

 MR. FITCH:  Justice Alito, what the court 

has said, not only this Court but the First Circuit said

in Coors, is what the Sixth Circuit says is that comity 

extends broader than the TIA.  What they point to 

repeatedly is Fair Assessment, because Fair Assessment 

got damages and it was on a comity basis that the Court 

held in Fair Assessment that you couldn't get around 

your own liability by bringing a damage claim.  So 

there's one example.

 We believe to some extent, National Private 

Truck Council is an example.  Because in National 

Private Truck Council, recall we are dealing with a 

State court action, not a Federal court action.  In a 

National Private Truck Council what the court held was 

under 1983, a State court -- a -- a -- a Federal court 

would not order -- a State court was not obligated to 

grant injunctive relief to grant attorneys fees under 

1988, and that was based on comity.

 In that case there was still an issue of tax 

collection and impeding tax collection, but certainly 

that appeared to us to be at least an example of where 

comity would be brought in to TIA, because the TIA 

didn't apply in -- in National Private Truck Council.

 There was reference to Burford before, as 

Justice Scalia mentioned.  This is not an abstention 

case.  There is no question of State law that has to be 

interpreted here.  There is no doubt who pays the tax

and who doesn't pay the tax.  There is no doubt who is 

an LDC and who is not an LDC.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me just go back to my 

question before.  I understand your point about 

regulation and nonregulation, but -- but your 

competitors are subject to a different taxing regime 

than you are; is that correct?

 MR. FITCH:  They are, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And isn't -- is not the 

reason they are subject to a different tax regime is 

historically they were in regulated utilities?

 MR. FITCH:  To -- to -- to some extent I 

believe that's correct, Justice Stevens, but my response 

would be this:  If we want to get into them, what taxes 

do they pay, versus what taxes do we pay -- that's a 

merits question.  That's a merits question.

 Is this a compensatory tax?  I mean, have we 

made our case -- do they have a defense because they pay 

different taxes than we do -- that we do, and therefore 

the State should be permitted to do that?  We would like 

to reach that question.  But that's a merits question, 

that's not a -- not a jurisdictional question.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And you don't think that 

the very question of what taxes you compare and don't 

compare is a matter of interpreting State law?  You

don't think that the meaning of State law in terms of 

what is comparable or not, is not implicated by any of 

these questions?

 MR. FITCH:  We -- we believe it is not, 

Justice Sotomayor.  You can -- you can look at the taxes 

and see who they apply to.  It -- it is not a matter --

I -- I strongly disagree with -- with my counterpart. 

This is not a matter of interpretation.  And one of the 

justices asked the question about, was extension -- was 

Pullman -- was Pullman ever raised?  Pullman was never 

raised.  My recollection is that in the original motion, 

they raised Younger, but they quickly dropped Younger 

because there is no, you know, pending State -- pending 

State proceeding.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the other view was 

the Federal court should abstain.  Abstention doctrines 

are not the most easy to grant, so -- but they did bring 

up abstention.

 MR. FITCH:  Well, but -- very early on they 

raised it.  They dropped it.  It was -- it was not 

followed up on, Your Honor.

 So -- so the point we are -- we are -­

here's the point we are trying to make, as we see it. 

We believe the footnote in Hibbs was correct; in all of 

the Court's prior cases there has been an issue of a

taxpayer trying to avoid their own tax and thus impede 

State tax collection.  We read Hibbs to say under the 

TIA or comity, you are not precluded from original 

Federal court jurisdiction if you are not attempting to 

impede State tax collection.

 We do not believe there is any significant 

difference between our case or that analysis and the -­

the case in Hibbs.  As I said, that -- we now have four 

circuits that have followed that.

effect, whether you are talking about the credit in 

Hibbs or whether you're talking about the exemption in 

our case, is if the Court puts on that order and the 

legislature does not come up with a remedy, is that the 

State would have more money.  In fact it is a question 

to us, why -- since we have chosen to limit our remedies 

by seeking a Federal court forum, it -- it -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Or why isn't this a Hibbs? 

You read the -- clearly the other side says to read the 

footnote, not as destroying the comity principle.  You 

know, this is right on the merits.  It still exists, 

comity.  And you say a strong case for withholding the 

-- the Federal court's jurisdiction on grounds of comity 

or withhold -- not hearing the case, is the natural 

remedy -- which is to give you a refund -- is available 

in State court.  Go apply for a refund.  No problem.

 And that --- and the answer, you know, and 

then you don't get into all the problem of trying to 

assess somebody else's liability, et cetera.  What is 

wrong with that, precisely?

 MR. FITCH:  What's wrong with it, Your

three taxes to deal with.  One of them is the sales tax, 

that's what is paid by the consumer; that would require 

all the consumers to seek, you know, refunds.  It's much 

cleaner in our view to simply go and get a determination 

whether this exemption was unconstitutional.

 We have forgone the --the request for 

damages, we have forgone request for attorneys fees 

because we have not alleged the 1983 claim.  We are 

trying to fix a problem.

 Justice Breyer, if I can in wrapping this 

up.  We recognize -- we recognize that this Court has 

competing interests that it has to weigh in resolving 

this question.  What we are trying to say is that as I 

said a minute ago, if you put that in context, the 

context is there are numerous protections that are 

already in place for the State to protect them from 

Federal court interference, and we believe that the 

decision in Hibbs and the circuits that have followed 

Hibbs strikes a proper balance for this reason:  You -­

you -- first of all you protect State tax collection, 

which has been the historic concern of this Court. 

Second, the broad jurisdiction that Congress has given 

in 1331 in a declaratory judgment statute, is harmonized 

with the historic comity concerns.  Third, the Court -­

as opposed to some vague intrusion test, you have got a 

clear test that the Court can apply early on to decide 

whether I got jurisdiction or not.

 And finally, the historic right of a 

plaintiff, which this Court has long recognized -- if 

there is concurrent jurisdiction, the historic right of 

a plaintiff to choose the forum in which to have their 

claims adjudicated is preserved.

 If there are no further questions I -- I 

yield my time.

question about the 12(b)(1) dismissal motion.  This 

Court, just a couple of terms ago in the Sinochem case, 

said that the -- that a Federal court can answer 

questions of Younger abstention before answering 

questions of Article 3 abstention.  And so both of 

these, both the comity and TIA questions in this case, 

are threshold non-merits questions that can be reached

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  All threshold non-merits 

questions are jurisdictional questions?

 MR. MIZER:  No.  The point isn't that they 

are jurisdictional; the point is that in Sinochem -- the

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and that is not a

to state a claim, I guess, on which a Federal court can 

grant relief.  But I -- anyway.

 MR. MIZER:  Well, in any event, Your Honor, 

we do submit that the Tax Injunction Act and the 

jurisdictional doctrine which would prevail.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That is so -- okay.

 MR. MIZER:  And on Justice Stevens' question 

about the similarly situated or not similarly situated 

nature of public utilities and nonpublic utilities, 

Mr. Fitch has pointed to the continuing deregulation in 

the wake of General Motors Corporation v. Tracy.  But as 

the Ohio Supreme Court just explained in the Columbia 

Gas case that we cite in our brief, that continuing 

deregulation does not change the -- the fundamental 

holdings in Tracy:  That when there is a regulatory 

burden imposed on a public utility to serve a captive 

market, that makes that entity not similarly situated to 

other entities.

 And the other point about Tracy and Columbia 

Gas is that both of those challenges came up to this 

Court through the lower courts, through the State courts 

of Ohio.  And so the State courts are perfectly capable 

of handling this case.

that's a -- even in State court, that would not be a 

remedy that could be ordered.

 MR. MIZER:  I disagree with that contention, 

Your Honor.  The -- Ohio's courts have struck down tax 

credits on dormant Commerce Clause and equal protection 

grounds, and so there is precedent for Ohio courts 

dealing with a challenge like this.  It provides no
