CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-1580, Richard Vieth, et al. v. Robert


Jubelirer. 


Mr. Smith.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


This Court held 17 years ago in Davis v.


Bandemer that a claim of partisan gerrymandering is


actionable under the Federal Constitution.  But the lower


courts have since effectively overruled Bandemer by 

requiring factual showings of plaintiffs in these cases


that are both impossible and, I submit, irrational.  As a


result, the state -


QUESTION: Well, do you - do you - do you think


the lower courts then didn't follow Bandemer?  I mean,


Bandemer set a very, very high standard.


MR. SMITH: Well, the standard that I think was -


the proper reading of Bandemer does not require that you


show that your members of your party have been completely


disenfranchised, to the extent that African-Americans once


were in the South, or that - that your party has

effectively been banned.  The standard that was applied


here required that you show that you're being prevented


from registering to vote, from raising money, from


campaigning, from showing up at the polls.


Those kinds of constitutional violations don't


make sense as an element of a partisan gerrymandering


claim, because they're not about gerrymandering, and of


course, they never occur.  So if you're going to say the


claim is justiciable, it doesn't make sense simultaneously


to require people to establish those kinds of independent


violations.


QUESTION: Three of us in Bandemer thought the


claim was not justiciable.


MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, and I would submit 

to you that - that - that history suggests that - that it


- the Court should not go that direction, because -


QUESTION: I was thinking history showed that was


the way to go.


MR. SMITH: Well, what - what we've seen, Your


Honor, because of the - the fact that the lower courts


have effectively read - rendered -


QUESTION: They couldn't - they can't reach a


decision under that Bandemer standard.  It's impossible. 


So maybe the way to go is to just stay hands off these


things.

 MR. SMITH: Well, we've never had a - an


opportunity for the lower courts to actually apply a


standard that says when does the map become so unfair that


it's anti-democratic?  What they have done instead is


apply this shut-out standard, which doesn't allow any real


scrutiny of the map.


QUESTION: Let - let me tell you my concern with


- with fairness.  If - if you look at British


parliamentary history, begin with Walpole and go to


Disraeli and Gladstone and Pitt and Churchill, and then if


you come to this country and you think about Dirksen and


Cannon and Webster and Clay, I don't recall any of them


ever talking about this issue from a standpoint of


fairness. 


I don't know what I'm supposed to look to. 

Legislate - there's just no sources on which we could -


from - from which we can draw.


I would concede that what happens here is unfair


in some common - common parlance.  It - it - it looks


pretty raw.  But I don't recall legislators talking about


what neutral standards ought to be.  Now, we have in our


own juris - people talk about contiguity, geographical


compactness, but I just don't think we have a - a large


source on which to draw.  We know about numbers, one - one


person, one vote.  But beyond that, I - it - it seems to


me that we're at sea.

 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, what we - what we


try to do is articulate a standard which is tied to the


basic democratic values that are at stake and to the - and


to the article I standard that says the people should


ultimately be deciding who's going to be representing them


in Congress, not the states.  The one thing that's clear


from the constitutional -


QUESTION: Well, since we're talking about


article I, it also says that the times, place, and manners


of holding elections for Senators and Representatives


shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature, but


the Congress may, at any time, by law, make or alter such


regulations.  That suggests to me it's none of our


business.


MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, this Court held in


Wesberry v. Sanders, and has since twice done - applied


that again, both in Cook v. Gralike and the - and in the


Term Limits case, that there are judicially enforceable


limits on the extent to which a state, in exercising the


procedural power to establish the times, places, and


manners of congressional elections, can create an uneven


playing field and attempt to try to dictate the outcome of


an election.


QUESTION: All right.  But then the problem is


that I think I have and others is, what are these

standards?  Now, you propose, one, look to the mind of the


legislature.  We'll do that.  They'll always want party


advantage, always.  Look to the extent to which they


depart from historically drawn lines.  Well, the


historically drawn lines themselves are random.  Third,


history.  Why is history the key?  Third, look to see


whether or not the minority party might get the majority


of votes, but the minority of seats.  Whether they might


in the future, that depends how people vote in the future. 


There's no set of lines where you couldn't


imagine results that could come out that way.  So how do


we do it?


MR. SMITH: Your Honor, that's - with - with all


respect, I - I - first of all, we don't suggest that you 

should somehow look at the departure from historical


lines.  That's not part of our -


QUESTION: You said look to see whether the


traditional criteria are predominantly ignored.


MR. SMITH: That's -


QUESTION: That's what I'm referring to.


MR. SMITH: Okay.  That's part of the intent -


yes.


QUESTION: I've read it.  I understand it.


MR. SMITH: Our - our standard on effects is that


- does not suggest that politics should be taken out of

this process.  As this Court recognized in Gaffney -


QUESTION: No, no.  I - my question is, how do


your standards possibly work?


MR. SMITH: The standard would be, under our -


under our submission, can you demonstrate that it is


absolute - that it is very clear that you could get more


than half the votes and have no chance.


QUESTION: Always can.


MR. SMITH: No.


QUESTION: You can't draw a set of lines such


that I couldn't imagine a voting pattern such that that


wouldn't happen.


MR. SMITH: But, you see, our standard is


precisely the opposite.  You have to show that it would -


under any voting pattern, it would happen.  There is no


possibility that with more than half the votes you could


get anywhere near half the seats.


QUESTION: You're - you're just pulling this -


you're just pulling this thing out of a hat, so to speak. 


I mean, you've got phrases in the Constitution that


Congress may do it or the states may do it.  You've got


the Equal Protection Clause, which was - came into being,


you know, in 1868, not in the original Constitution.  And


they - they just don't intimate anything like what you're


talking about.

 MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, we - we focus on


this 50/50 point, this majoritarian standard for two main


reasons.


QUESTION: What - what -


MR. SMITH: One is a - is a matter of principle,


which is to say, when does consideration of politics go


too far?  It goes too far when we're no longer operating a


democracy -


QUESTION: Well - well -


MR. SMITH: - we're having a minority party


control the majority of seats.


QUESTION: Well, when you say, you know, the -


the Constitution doesn't ever use the word democracy.


MR. SMITH: Yes, but we - but we have a - we have 

a -


QUESTION: Not to mention party.


QUESTION: Yeah.


MR. SMITH: We have a commitment though to the -


to the fact that the House of Representatives is supposed


to mirror the people and is supposed to be -


QUESTION: Well -


MR. SMITH: - representative of the people.


QUESTION: Well, you - but -


MR. SMITH: And we -


QUESTION: The - the - the Constitution

originally provided that the - the standard for the state


vote would be the standard for the Representatives in


Congress.  And in other - it - it was simply left up to


the states.  And there were property qualifications for


many years, so it didn't represent the people in that


sense.


MR. SMITH: The reason we are focusing on the


majority standard, the 50/50 standard, is in part because,


as this Court has recognized in Wesberry and it's


recognized in - in - in Cook and it's recognized in


Thornton, the states are not supposed to be deciding for


themselves who's going to be representing the people.  The


people are supposed to decide.


The second reason is that 50/50 you don't have 

these problems of distortions, which, as an empirical


matter, happen in a winner-take-all, single-member


district system.  When you get to 60/40, the party that


has 60 percent of the vote ordinarily would expect to get


more than 60 percent of the districts.  That's why you


don't - you don't ever want to have a rule of proportional


representation.


QUESTION: It happens under a system of


presidential electors too, as we recently saw.  Is that


unconstitutional also?


MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor.  The electoral

college is not a majoritarian standard in the same way


that we - we have here.  Because of the Great Compromise,


it includes two Senators are counted, two votes for the


Senators in every state across the board, so there - that


- that is the disparity between the popular vote and the


electoral college.  But in the - but the House of


Representatives was supposed to be the mirror of the


people and the - this Court has constantly policed the


efforts by the states to encroach from procedure into


substance, to try to decide in advance, as Pennsylvania


did here.  We would rather have two out of three of our


Representatives be Republicans, even though we're a 50/50


state, and regardless of how people vote, we're going to


determine -


QUESTION: Yeah, but it's not - let - let me -


you've got me up to the point of this 50/50 business.  Now


I'm thinking.  Let's use party names.  It helps for


clarity.  Suppose the Democrats have, under the


districting, they're - they're the ones who are the


victims.  Now, let's suppose that they did get 55 percent


of the state vote for Congress in the next election.  Now,


you're saying that if it were true by this map that


they're getting that vote, 55 percent, meant that


nonetheless, they had to get fewer than half the


Congressmen, then it's bad.

 And my problem with that is, I don't see how


we're going to know in advance, unless this is going to be


done by some experts coming in and measuring prior votes


and getting into an argument.  And if that's what's going


to happen, I keep thinking of Ken - John Kenneth


Galbraith, who says, I'd rather be governed by 400 people


chosen at random from the telephone book than the Harvard


faculty.  All right, now -

QUESTION: That's a joke, but nonetheless, is a


serious point.

Jr., not - not - not Galbraith.


QUESTION: Now, do you see my -


(Laughter.)


MR. SMITH: Other side of the aisle.  Your Honor


-


QUESTION: Now, I've exposed the entire problem. 


I want you to respond to it.


MR. SMITH: Your Honor, experts will in all


likelihood be involved as we - we have an example of the


kind of expert testimony that can be given here.  But this


is not, to use another expression, rocket science. 


Experts testify in voting rights cases about how districts


will behave.  They use prior election returns plugged into

those districts to make estimates about how they will


behave, and it'll be the burden on the plaintiffs to


establish - they have the burden of proof - that, in fact,


it is true that if you get - that - that the - this


favored party, with more than 50 percent of the vote, will


have essentially no chance of getting half the districts. 


That is -


QUESTION: Were the experts on which you rely,


were they presented as witnesses in the district court?


MR. SMITH: We had a trial on the one person, one


vote claim, Your Honor, after the partisan gerrymandering


claim was defeated, was dismissed.  And the - the state


tried to justify the deviation by talking about neutral


principles that governed this map, and so we had the 

opportunity to put a kind of preview of our partisan


gerrymandering evidence on -


QUESTION: Yes, but Mr. Smith, isn't it true that


what the issue is sufficiency of your complaint?


MR. SMITH: That's - that's correct, Your Honor. 


At this point -


QUESTION: And may I ask you a question that -


that troubles me about the complaint?  It seems to me your


complaint was drafted on the theory that you agreed with


Justice Powell's position in Bandemer, but the position


you've come up with in this Court is entirely different

and not the one that I read into the complaint.  Your


majority analysis theory is - is really quite different


from - from that theory.  You - you seem to have abandoned


Justice Powell. 


And I - what I wanted to ask you is, under the


theory of the complaint, as opposed to the theory on which


you're arguing in this Court, if you were - you allege


that there were no neutral justifications whatsoever for


any district line.  And if you put in proof to that effect


and the - and the other side prove there were neutral


justifications for half the districts, say, but the - that


there were a half that did fit your allegations, would -


would - in your view, would the district court have the


authority to review the districts that were totally 

unjustified without meeting your majority analysis claim?


MR. SMITH: I think the court does have to look


at the effects of the deviate - departures from


traditional district criteria -


QUESTION: Assume the effects, say you've got two


plaintiffs, one from district 6 and one from 16, I think.


MR. SMITH: Yes.


QUESTION: If, for example, the - the court


thought that district 6 had absolutely no justification,


it's wildly, you know, the shape is so terrible and so


forth, but the rest of the map was okay.  Under your

complaint, could the judge do anything about that?


MR. SMITH: I - I think it - the - certainly


under our complaint and under the - our conception of the


case, you don't look at one district in isolation and say,


this district is too ugly or too much of a departure -


QUESTION: I know your complaint is drafted as a


all-or-nothing, but I'm just wondering, within the -


within the allegations, would - would it be open to the


judge to say, well, they lose on the total picture, the


majority theory is - is just too - too novel for me, but


what they've said about district 6 pans out 100 percent. 


Is that -


MR. SMITH: That - that's not our case, Your


Honor, and - and the reason for it is, I don't think that 

this Court is going to come in and start imposing,


particularly districting criteria, when an ugly-looking


district -


QUESTION: In particular districts?


MR. SMITH: - an ugly-looking and odd -


QUESTION: They did that in the racial


gerrymandering context - situation.


MR. SMITH: Only when - only when it's talking


about race on either side of the line, and - and it could


be that the Court would ultimately get to the point of


saying a district that's too ugly and - and divides

Democrats from Republicans ought to be viewed in the same


way.


But our submission is more like the racial vote


dilution case, that not only are there departures would


show partisan intent, but you have to look, as the Court


said in Bandemer, statewide and see whether, in fact, the


- the - the legislature has created a situation where a


Republican votes counts twice as much as a Democratic vote


in this state because -


QUESTION: Race does not change.  You - you are


the race you are, and you're not going to change it next


year.  Political party doesn't work that way.  How do -


how - how - how do you decide what, you know, what - what


is the Republican vote? 


Is it just registered Republicans 

-


MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor -


QUESTION: - and is everybody that's registered a


Republican now have to stay - maybe we should make them


stay registered Republicans so that we can have good


districts, right?  I mean, it - it - I just don't


understand how you run this scheme.  You cannot really


tell until after the election is done how many Republicans


and how many Democrats there are in each district. 


MR. SMITH: Well -

 MR. SMITH: - the way you identify -


QUESTION: - count on party registration?  Is


that the basis for divvying it up?


MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor.  It's how people have


voted and how -


QUESTION: In the last election.


MR. SMITH: Yes.  And it - it would again be the


burden of the plaintiff to show that there are predictable


voting patterns, that there's a large chunk of people who


are consistent Democratic or Republican supporters who are


being injured in their voting rights by means of a - of a


deliberate scheme by the legislature.


Now, the idea that these people are hard to


identify is a little hard to square with a map, in which 

you have these incredibly complicated peninsulas going out


to find -


QUESTION: Any particular election, they are very


hard to identify in any particular election, which is why


the parties go about selecting their candidates very


carefully.  If it didn't make any different, they'd pick


any old body -


MR. SMITH: What the evidence -


QUESTION: - and run them and - and you'd get all


of the same Republican and the same Democrat votes. 


That's not the way the world works.

 MR. SMITH: Well, what the plaintiff would have


to show in such a case is that there's a sufficiently


consistent pattern of voting in the state that a racial -


that a political gerrymander is possible and it has


occurred and it - and that it will - and that, in fact, in


the future there will be an injury to one class of voters


who have been packed into a small number of 90 percent


Democratic districts, while there's a much larger number


of relatively safe Republican districts.


Now, you can say that's not true or we can't


know it, but we all sit here knowing - know that's what


they did.


QUESTION: Mr. Smith -


QUESTION: Well, what is it -


QUESTION: To - to what extent - what - to what


extent, Mr. Smith, does your - does your theory depend on


the registration of the voters?


MR. SMITH: Registration might be an indication


of voting patterns, but our theory is - is you look at


voting patterns and decide in advance of the next


election, will there in fact be a - a situation where it's


impossible for - if the Democrats got half the votes or


the Republicans got half the votes, it would be impossible


for them to get close to half the seats.


QUESTION: Well, what is the -

 QUESTION: The point is it -


QUESTION: - particular vice of - of


redistricting, just on the basis of politics?  Suppose you


did it on the basis of isolating or - or fracturing union


votes, or - or the gay vote or the environmentalist vote


or farm subsidies?


MR. SMITH: Well -


QUESTION: Where - where - where does your - your


- your principle particularly elect political parties?  In


- in - in fact, it seems to me that parties might - might


well conclude - include some of these groups that I've


mentioned.


MR. SMITH: This Court has - has made clear in a


number of cases that the Government has no business


discriminating against people based on their partisan


affiliation or their political viewpoint, in contracting,


in jobs.  And it seems to us it would - it should be clear


that at some point, a level of discrimination in designing


the machinery of democracy, the electoral process itself,


a - a form of discrimination that's equivalent to saying,


in two-thirds of the district we're going to count all the


Republican votes twice, in one-third of the districts


we're going to count all the Democratic votes twice.


QUESTION: But certainly you allow for some


discrimination?  I mean, that - that's the way

legislatures go at it.


MR. SMITH: Well, as this - this Court has made


clear, both in the race area and the politics area,


redistricting is a little different from other areas.  It


doesn't make any sense to demand purity and a complete


non-consideration of these factors, but there has to be an


outer boundary.  If there's no outer boundary, then -


QUESTION: Mr. - Mr. Smith, you're - you're


essentially asking how much is too much.  You say you have


this decision that said people have this claim that they


can bring, Bandemer.  But that was a case where the bottom


line was, and you have no claim on the merits.  Now, if a


judge, a district judge, in - in one of these cases said,


well, here's the Indiana plan and the court said that that 

was okay, and this one doesn't look any worse to me.  Is


there a difference between the Pennsylvania plan and the -


a significant difference between those two? 


MR. SMITH: There's a -


QUESTION: With our precedent, I mean, you have


to take the whole of it, not just half.  The half standing


to sue you like, the bottom line, but the Indiana plan,


egregious as it may look, is okay.


MR. SMITH: Well, the facts shown in the Indiana


case, in the Bandemer case, were much less severe than


those we alleged here, in terms of - here we had

allegations which were ultimately supported by expert


testimony in the one person, one vote trial, that they


would get a large super-majority of the districts with


only half the - with half the votes or less. 


And in - in Bandemer, the facts as they were


presented, there was no such expert analysis. Instead,


they relied on the results of one election in which one of


the bodies actually came out the right way and one of them


came out slightly the wrong way.  They had not supplied


the Court with the same kind of evidence that we would


propose to supply, and - and did not meet, at least as an


evidentiary matter, the standard that we propose here.


It might be that, in fact, if somebody looked at


that Indiana map, it might have met that, but nobody 

studied it in that way.  They were simply saying, look,


it's really ugly, they've got these unfair, multi-member


districts in certain cities, and, in fact, the way the


vote came out in the House, the Democrats got more than


half the votes and got only 43 percent of the seats.  That


I - that, I submit, is not a sufficient basis to establish


the outer boundary that we would suggest you have to meet.


QUESTION: But if you're going to say it's not


fair, fairness in what sense?  If we say it's not fair to


draw lines that will pack and crack one party or another,


you're going to end up with no geographical boundaries,

because all geographical boundaries do that.  A random


system in Pennsylvania would give the Democrats no


Representatives -


MR. SMITH: What -


QUESTION: - purely random.


MR. SMITH: Well, that's -


QUESTION: So - so it's, I mean, my point is that


politicians and the public, in fact, in form has one idea


of what's fair and it's very hard for a judge to turn that


idea into judicially administrable rules. 


MR. SMITH: Your Honor, with - with respect, I -


I think that it is perfectly possible for somebody to look


at a map and decide whether or not it does or does not


unfairly discriminate against one of the political 

parties.  Courts draw maps themselves fairly - fairly


frequently.  They collect testimony from experts, the map


in Pennsylvania that was -


QUESTION: You - you can tell whether it


discriminates against one political party, I guess on the


basis of - of - of projections that may turn out to be


wrong.  You -nobody can say for sure.  But what - what you


can say, what you can guess about, is simply that it will


favor one party over another, yes.  But - but is it so


easy to tell that it will unfairly favor one party over


another?  And that's what you're arguing here.

 How unfair is unfair?  I don't know.  What is


it, 60/40?


MR. SMITH: If it gets to the point where one


party's getting two-thirds of the seats with less than


half the votes, in a democracy, I submit that's the place


where it crosses the line.


QUESTION: Okay.  Mr. Smith, you - is - is that


the - the - the force of your argument, I take it, is not


that this happens in one electoral year, because there may


be all sorts of reasons.  It's something, your argument


is, it happens over time.


MR. SMITH: It -


QUESTION: Let's - let's - let me start with that


assumption. 


Let's assume that we come up with a rule in 

which we - we come up with a wait-and-see rule, and we


say, it's not enough for you to prove a - a violation to


predict in advance.  You've in fact got to prove a


violation by looking back and establishing through the


course of three or four elections that - that this pattern


is emerging.  And let's assume we say, if you can do that,


you win.


My question, which then goes to the substance of


what you're going to win, and ultimately the substance of


what your claim must be is, what is the principle that the


district court must apply in a case like that to reform or

- or redraw the districts?  Does he - does he come up with


a principle that says anything that follows traditional


redistricting principles, you know, compactness, et


cetera, is okay?  That won't necessarily solve your


problem.


Has he got to come up with a scheme that says


there's a presumption that all districts have got to be


competitive?  If he does that, there's going to be a clear


break with tradition because there are loads of places


where you can't have competitive districts.  What is the


principle on which he's going to reform it?


MR. SMITH: Well, let - let - I will - let me


directly answer that question in a moment, but let me just


comment. 


I think the idea of a rule that says you have to 

wait three or four election cycles to - to prove your


case, it would essentially be - mean that the claim is


worthless, because you're going to redraw the districts


every 10 years, and there's an enormous amount of


irreparable harm, as you suggest.


QUESTION: Two elections.


MR. SMITH: As you suggest, there's already


irreparable harm.  Once you've thrown out all the


incumbents of the disfavored party, they have new


incumbents that have come in now.  It doesn't mean that

you can't have a remedy, and it would seem to me the very


first thing you'd want to do, just as you do in a race


case under section II is - is have a map which does not


inherently pack and crack the disfavored group to the


point where they don't have the opportunity to -


QUESTION: The - the trouble is, in the race


case, you have a relatively simple objective in mind.  And


that is, the relatively simple objective is that once you


identify the political party of the racial voter, the


minority voter, that minority voter ought to have, in


effect, the same opportunity as a non-minority voter of


that political party.


Here, we have a different problem.  What is the


force or power that a member of a given political party 

ought to have?  It's not as simple as the race case.


MR. SMITH: Well, I think the inquiry would


essentially be the same though.  They - the parties would


have to come with the remedial map, the - presuming the


legislature would have an opportunity to draw on in the


usual situation, in which they could show that it is no


longer the case that there is such packing and cracking of


Democrats that - that at 50 percent, they would have no


chance of getting 50 percent of the seats.


QUESTION: What - what if you have more than two


parties?  I mean, like Minnesota, where you have besides

the Republicans and the Democrats a very strong farmer


labor party?


MR. SMITH: I assume that the experts could deal


with that.  In - in reality, in this country -


QUESTION: I - well, I - I'm sure they can.  What


- what - what test do you want them to apply?


MR. SMITH: Well, the -


QUESTION: Each proportional representation for


each of the parties?


MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor.  The - the - the test


we're talking about here is - is if one of the parties


would get to 50 percent, would they have an opportunity to


- to have a majority of the delegation?


QUESTION: Do you take into account at all in -

in this picture, this is not something that could have


been adopted by the Republicans in the state legislature


alone.  It took quite a number of Democratic votes to put


it through.


MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor -


QUESTION: Is that - is that relevant?


MR. SMITH: It - it might be relevant at trial if


we ever get to trial.  Our claim was dismissed.  What we


would attempt to show at trial, and I think we would show


at trial, is first of all, not a single Democratic Senator


voted for it.  There were some Democratic House Members

who voted for it, and the reason for that is because there


are five Members of Congress who are Democrats in the


State of Pennsylvania who are real, real happy with the


districts they got.


And the General Assembly, the Republican


leadership said, well, if you guys want these districts,


you know what - you know what the price you have to pay


for, you need to get us some votes.  So that - there are


dynamics that take place, and in any partisan gerrymander


there's going to be some really good districts for the


disfavored party, just not enough, not - not a fair - fair


allocation, not one that would allow the party to have a


majority control.


QUESTION: Mr. Smith, over a period of years, can 

you identify any state where your test of partisan


gerrymandering has persisted over a period of time, five


years or more?  Can you give us examples of states where


it's persisted over a period of years?


MR. SMITH: I'm not sure that I - that I have


enough knowledge of political history going back decades


to be able to tell you whether that's the case or not.  It


certainly will persist through a decade as long as the


whole leadership of the state doesn't shift over to the


other party, as long as the party that committed the - the


crime, so to speak, maintains either the governorship or

one house of the legislature to be able to -


QUESTION: Because in how many states do we have


a situation currently where both houses of the legislature


and the Governor are of one political party?


MR. SMITH: There's quite a number of states,


including, as it happened in - in this round, a number of


very competitive states, the - which caused quite a - had


quite a consequential impact on the Congress, Florida,


Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and now more recently, Texas


has come into play and decided to play this game.


QUESTION: I suppose typically we would expect


that over any period of time that condition wouldn't


remain.  You'd - one branch would be in the hands of the


other party in time. 


Certainly if - if you had something 

like 50 percent of the voters -


MR. SMITH: Which, in order to fix the problem,


once it already exists, you have to get both houses and


the governorship back to - to pass a second bill. 


Otherwise, it's in place for the 10 years and then what


also happens in most states is the state legislatures, of


course, gerrymander themselves as well as the - the


congressional seats, in order to keep themselves in a


position where 10 - 10 years hence they'll still be around


and in control of the process again.


So there is a - a fundamental - fundamentally

anti-democratic part of this, which means in - in the long


run, you are - you do have very competitive states with


extremely skewed congressional delegations.  The - the


delegation from Florida is 18 to 7 in a state that has a


robust two-party democracy.  Now, that - that ultimately


is not democracy.  That's our submission.

Honor.


QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Smith.


Mr. Krill, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. KRILL, JR.


ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS JUBELIRER AND PERZEL


MR. KRILL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


Because politics is inherent in redistricting,


any test, including the appellants' proposed test in their


reply brief, requires inherent political choices to be


made, choices that we submit are inappropriate for the


judiciary to make.


Appellants' latest test, for example, has hidden


political choices in it that are outcome determinative. 


For example, they use 10 years of statewide races rather


than using a single base race, as recommended by the


source they cite in footnote 5 of the -

question?  Let's assume that them - that their theory


won't fly, this majority theory is just too impractical


and so forth.  But what about the theory advanced in their


complaint that the - some of the districts, and perhaps


all - they allege all - were - were drafted by relying


exclusively on a principle of maximum partisan advantage? 


And supposing the evidence shows that no neutral criteria


at all were used except let's do the best we can to help


our own party get as many seats as we can.  Would that


raise a question at all in your mind?


MR. KRILL: No, Your Honor.  First, because I


don't think that that's a question that should ever come


to trial.  The legislative process is so complex.  Every


legislator -


QUESTION: Well, what if - what if they narrowed


the allegation, said just district 6 or district 16 was


clearly drawn for this purpose and no other, no neutral,


no effort to be compact or contiguous or follow boundary


lines or rivers or anything, we just want to get the


maximum vote for one particular party here.  Would you say


that was permissible?


MR. KRILL: It - yes, I would, Your Honor.  And -


and I would also say that it - it is not only impossible


to prove at trial, but improper to even attempt to prove


at trial, because - and we'll - let's take district 6 in

Pennsylvania as an example.  Because it would require


inquiring into the legislative process in violation of


legislative privilege.


QUESTION: No, it would just -


MR. KRILL: Legislators are pulled in a million


directions.


QUESTION: It would just say to the - when you


have a - a really strangely distorted district, the burden


is on you to point out one neutral justification for it,


and we'll assume that if you - you won't have to go into


the minds of the legislature, just assume there is


something we can point to, such as a boundary line or if


it's fairly compact or it's - but you can't point to


anything.  You don't have to go into anybody's mind.  You


just say - you give them the opportunity to explain, and


they - they say, well, we have no explanation.  We did it


just because we want to get that to be a democratic


district.


MR. KRILL: If - if the entire legislature en


masse came forward and admitted that -


QUESTION: Yes.


MR. KRILL: - every legislator said, that's why I


voted for it, Justice Stevens, I would still say it's a


permissible legislative choice.  James Madison, after all,


in the Constitutional Convention, acknowledged that they

were giving to state legislators the power under article


I, section 4, quote, to so mold their regulations as to


favor certain candidates, closed quote.


QUESTION: Is there any duty at all to - any duty


at all in drawing districts to try to do it impartially? 


Your answer is no?


MR. KRILL: Not constitutionally, Your Honor, but


there are -


QUESTION: Yeah.


MR. KRILL: - political forces that pull them in


-


QUESTION: I understand that.


MR. KRILL: - in a multitude of directions.


QUESTION: But then on the Constitution, what 

about if the legislature decided that the salaries of the


majority legislature should be 10 percent higher than the


minority legislators?


MR. KRILL: I -


QUESTION: There'd be a good reason for it,


because they have more work to do.  They have to vote and


they - they get statutes adopted and programs enacted, so


would that satisfy the constitutional duty?  If there is a


duty to govern impartially, do you think it would?

certain that our supreme court in Pennsylvania would


address it.  Our - my - my individual clients, the


legislative leaders, in fact do have higher salaries,


precisely for that reason.


QUESTION: But that the - all the members of the


majority party?


MR. KRILL: No.  I - I don't think so, Your


Honor.  I - I can't imagine that even happening.


QUESTION: Suppose I have in my -


QUESTION: Why not?


QUESTION: Oh, sorry.  In - in my mind the, which


I don't - I want you to assume for the sake of argument -


that - that one thing the Constitution aims at, one thing


though, it wants to leave all this up to the legislature 

as much as possible, et cetera.  But one thing it aims at


is majority rule.  Therefore, if, over a period of time,


we have a districting system where the minority - the


majority who get the - the majority of votes end up with a


minority of seats in a serious way, that undercuts the


democracy that the Constitution foresees.  And with


computers, that might happen. 


Now, suppose I start with that assumption, and


I'm looking for a standard.  So suppose I combine Justice


Stevens' standard with the requirement to keep judges out

Harvard faculty.  It really happened.  And in fact, after


really happening once, then we also have the experts who


tell us it has to happen in the future.


Now, we have three things - three requirements


there that really are designed to police the outer fringe. 


And if I start with that assumption of what the


Constitution wants, why don't I say it imposes those three


requirements?


MR. KRILL: All right.  Accepting your


assumption, Justice Breyer, I - first of all, I - I think


that one would have to look at a lot of different things. 


The appellants' test, for example, assumes that Democrats


are evenly disbursed across the state -


QUESTION: Oh, I've rejected their test. 

MR. KRILL: Right.


QUESTION: I've rejected their test.  I've


borrowed from it, but rejected it.


MR. KRILL: But because -


QUESTION: All right.  So the test has the three


elements that I said.  One, they're experts.  Two, it


really happened.  And three, Justice Stevens' objective


version of there-is-no-other-explanation requirement.


MR. KRILL: All right.  It - it really did happen


in Pennsylvania in 2000.  The - and this was under a


judicially-drawn map.  All right.  The party that had a

majority of the popular vote got a minority of the


congressional seats.  The same thing happened again in a -


in another - in a subsequent election, but it was exactly


the reverse.  You know, the Democrats and Republicans


flipped.


So it - it can, in fact, happen, Your Honor. 


But if you allow the experts to control over the voters,


then you'll never know the truth of what would really


happen.  And let me give you an example in Bandemer


itself.  The aftermath of - of the Bandemer case in


Indiana is instructive, because two years after this Court


handed down its decision in Bandemer, the Democrats, who


would have had the Court believe that they were consigned


to an eternity of Republican tyranny, actually won 50 

percent of the state House seats in Indiana.  And only two


years after that, in 1990, they won control, and control


has flipped back and forth ever since in Indiana.


So, I believe that Justice O'Connor's concurring


opinion in Bandemer was - was quite on point.  The system


is self-correcting.  Now, the appellants test in using 10


years, instead of a base race as their own academic source


recommends, actually gives a lot of weight to the past


preferences of voters, dead voters, voters who have moved. 


Naturally, this is a political choice, because any party


that perceives this influence as waning over time will ask

you to adopt a test that gives weight to past choices.


They also use high profile offices in choosing


their races instead of low-profile statewide races, non-


charismatic races as their - as their academic source


recommends.  And, of course, we have such non-charismatic


races in Pennsylvania.  We call them statewide appellate


judicial races.  Nothing could be more non-charismatic.


QUESTION: Unkind of you to say it, sir, unkind


of you.


(Laughter.)


MR. KRILL: And, of course, it - they've made a


political choice in not using those races either, because


in 2001, the year that our legislature was considering


this plan, the Republicans took seven out of seven 

statewide appellate races.  They also, as - as - as I


mentioned, in their test assumed dispersion of Democrats


uniformly, when, in fact, Democrats, as we all know, are


compacted, self-compacted, into urban areas.  So, the -


the test is very tilted.


A curious thing that they do in their test is


turn real races into hypothetical races by normalizing


them so as to remove the popularity factor from those


races.  Well, that's curious, since politics is all about


trying to achieve that popular edge.  What they did not


do, and this is another political choice in constructing

the test, is to a use a very - a - a race that was


practically 50/50 in Pennsylvania in 2000, a race, by the


way, that's cited in their complaint.  It's - it's the Al


Gore race for President.  Mr. Gore won 50.6 percent of the


popular vote in Pennsylvania.


Now, the statistics show that he also would have


won a majority of the congressional districts under the


plan that's before this Court if he had been packaged as a


congressional candidate.  Actually, he would have won a


majority, 10 out of 19 districts.  The statistics are in


the joint appendix, page 273. 


QUESTION: May - may I again ask you just one


question about the complaint?  Do you think it states a


cause of action under the theory espoused by Justice 

Powell in his Davis against Bandemer concurrence in the


judgment?  And if not, why not?  And then the final


question is, and if it does meet that standard, why isn't


that adequate judicially manageable standards?


MR. KRILL: Yeah, I - I confess that I don't


clearly remember Justice Powell's standard for


justiciability in - in his concurrence, Justice Stevens. 


I do disagree, however, with - with his standard for - for


remedial action.  He called for a searching and sensitive


inquiry.  And I submit there really are no neutral -


QUESTION: Well, but the first question -

 MR. KRILL: - principles.


QUESTION: - before you reach remedy is whether


there's a violation.


MR. KRILL: Yes.


QUESTION: And his theory basically was, there's


a violation if there are certain wildly - wildly-defined


districts that have no neutral justification except to


give partisan advantage to the people who had the power to


draft them and who did not even consult the adversary


party in drafting them.  That was his standard.


MR. KRILL: Well, that's impossible to prove and


improper to prove.  For example -


QUESTION: It's a matter of burden-shifting, and


if they can't come up with any explanation whatsoever 

other than partisan advantage, that that's a violation of


the - of the duty to govern impartially.  And either there


is no such duty or it is a violation.


MR. KRILL: Justice Powell's standard would


require individual legislators to come in and say, here's


why I voted.  Here's - here's the - here's the -


QUESTION: Well, do you think - do you think it's


impossible to prove that race was the predominant motive


in a particular redistricting plan?


MR. KRILL: There are standards this Court has


adopted, the Gingles standards for - for making - making

that case, Your Honor.  However, I - I think -


QUESTION: Well, I mean, do you have to be a


really tricky, astute, very clever fact-finder to figure


out what was going on here?


MR. KRILL: Well, yes you would, in fact.  In


fact, I don't think - see how you could.  In - in this


case, for example, it's impossible for the appellants'


counsel to even say whether their clients were Santorum


Democrats or Gore Democrats.  Both won Pennsylvania in


2000.


QUESTION: But again, under Justice Powell's


standard, they wouldn't have to do that.


MR. KRILL: No.


QUESTION: They would just have to say, this is 

totally irrational unless you can come up with an


explanation.


MR. KRILL: That - that's correct.  Now, voters -


they would have to believe -


QUESTION: Of course, it doesn't - it doesn't


make much sense to find something justiciable that you


can't possibly devise a remedy for, does it?  I mean, to


separate the question of - of whether there's a violation


from the question of remedy, as though, you know, we'll -


we'll - we'll cross that bridge when we get to it, doesn't


seem to me very realistic.

 MR. KRILL: Oh, if, in fact, I agree, Justice


Scalia.  If the court ignores the remedial phase that


would necessarily follow -


QUESTION: But, of course, the remedy would be


that redraw district using some neutral criteria.


MR. KRILL: There are no -


QUESTION: That's certainly not an impossible


standard.


MR. KRILL: It is, Your Honor.  There are no


neutral criteria.  Name a criterion and I'll show you why


it represents a political choice.


QUESTION: Historical boundaries, contiguity,


compactness, maintaining incumbents of both parties. 


There are lots of neutral criteria available, and any one 

of them might justify an other - what seemed on its face


to be a very wild district.


MR. KRILL: Respectfully, Justice Stevens,


patterns of development over the last two generations, if


you - if you put them on a - on a map, they look like


splatters of paint on a canvas.  They're not pretty.


QUESTION: Not as much as some -


MR. KRILL: But -


QUESTION: Not as much as the one in Karcher or


the one in this case do.


MR. KRILL: Well, I would point out that -

 QUESTION: Of course, I guess if there are five

whatever, it's very much a political call which of the


five criteria you decide to - to use.


QUESTION: That's a - that's true, and the only


judicial call is you've got to use at least one.


MR. KRILL: Well, but - but by saying that - by


designating them as neutral criteria, the judiciary itself


makes a choice and takes that choice away from the state


legislatures.


Voters are not automatons in a matrix controlled


by supercomputers.  Voters continue to matter, and they


continue to prove it in election after election.  In fact,


they proved it in Pennsylvania in 2002 under this plan. 

The 17th congressional district, which the experts


predicted would go Republican did not.  Voters and good


candidates and good issues and good party organization


continue to make the difference, just as they did in -


QUESTION: How about the rest of their


predictions?  They got the others right, didn't they?


MR. KRILL: Not quite right. 


QUESTION: Nobody has to bat a thousand, do they?


MR. KRILL: Well, but we - if - if the plan had


been enjoined, we'd never know how right or wrong they


were.  And - and -

was very close.  It was a razor-edge race.  But voters

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. BART DeLONE


ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS CORTES AND ACCURTI


MR. DeLONE: That's all right, Mr. Chief Justice.


Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:


The Court should hold that political

gerrymandering, if it is justiciable at all, violates the


Constitution if and only if the disadvantaged group has


been shut out of a political process as a whole.  This is


the standard applied by the Court's unconstitutional vote


dilution cases, and it is consistent with our system of


electing Members of Congress from individual districts.


In a district system such as ours, there are no


statewide elections for a slate of candidates.  Rather,


individual congressional elections are defined by the


unique characteristics of each race.  That is why


statewide election results offer no meaningful standard


for judging congressional outcomes.  It is also why a


proportionality, the idea that some statewide level of


support should entitle a political party to capture some 

specified number of seats, is incompatible with the very


idea of districting, and it is why the Court has


repeatedly -


QUESTION: But Mr. DeLone, I - I think our rules


say we frown on people simply reading their arguments.


MR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor, I'm sorry.  And the


point, Your Honor, is that Mr. Smith and appellants' plan


will lead the Court to proportionality if - if the Court


does not consistently apply the - the vote dilution


standard that has - has applied in the past.  And that


standard is that you have to be shut out of the political

process -


QUESTION: Well, the - the - tell - answer - I'll


ask you a question and then you will get away from your

MR. DeLONE: Thank you.


QUESTION: But the - the - the - in - in my own


view, not - not the Court's - in - in my own view in the


positive discrimination race cases, I believed -


MR. DeLONE: The - the Whitcomb v. Chavis -


QUESTION: The positive discrimination cases, the


cases that say you cannot draw a racial district, racial,


minority district -


MR. DeLONE: The Shaw Line - the Shaw Line cases?


QUESTION: Yes, correct.


MR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION: I said you could, I thought that the


legislature could do that, primarily because if they could


do it in political party cases, why couldn't they do it


in race cases where it's meant to help the minority? 


Well, I lost that.  So believing what I thought, doesn't


the reverse hold true?  If this Court has found manageable


standards to use to control positive discrimination in


favor of racial minorities for drawing boundaries, then my


goodness, why can't it find standards to prevent the


Republicans from doing the same thing to the Democrats or

the Democrats from doing the same thing to the


Republicans?


MR. DeLONE: Because, Your Honor, in the Shaw


Line of cases, what they were doing is they were trying to


isolate race from all other factors, including politics.


QUESTION: And in here, we're trying to - to


isolate being a Democrat or being a Republican -


MR. DeLONE: Yes, Your -


QUESTION: - from all other factors, because


after all, as Justice Stevens pointed out, they've been


able to come up with no explanation other than we did it


because they're Democrats.


MR. DeLONE: Well, Your Honor -


QUESTION: That's what the word predominate means 

-


MR. DeLONE: Right.


QUESTION: - and you'd insist on that showing -


MR. DeLONE: But, but Your -


QUESTION: - just as you do insist on the


predominant showing in the race case.


MR. DeLONE: But, Your Honor, assuming that to be


correct, there's nothing wrong with them saying, we did it


just because they're Democrats.


QUESTION: Ah, yes, there is, because what's


wrong with it is if you carry it to an extreme with

computers, you prevent the majority of voters from


securing the majority of seats.  And that simple principle


that the majority should govern is the basic principle of


democracy.  So if you find that in the Constitution, it's


just as wrong.


MR. DeLONE: Well, I think you have to - you have


to look at what majority you're talking about, Your Honor. 


If - in a districting system, you're talking about the


majority in a particular district at a particular time.


QUESTION: Correct.  What we would do is look at


the state and we would look to see if in the - we could


even give a margin of error.  The party that got 53


percent of the votes ended up with 45 percent of the


seats, okay? 


Objective, contrary to majority rule, and 

produced simply by intentional gerrymandering for no other


purpose.


MR. DeLONE: But, Your Honor, if you're doing


that, you're - you're - you're going into proportionality. 


You're saying, if you're entitled to a - to a sum state.


QUESTION: No, no proportionality.  Forget the


proportionality.  I agree with you a perfectly random


system will produce 100 Republican delegation, so I agree


with you about that.  I'm only sticking to the majority


rule.

particular candidate because he's a Republican or - or -


or she's a Democrat?


MR. DeLONE: Absolutely not, Your Honor, and that


-


QUESTION: Of course not.  So you can't tell from


the Republican votes how many of those are Republican


votes and how many of them are, you know, Smith votes or -


MR. DeLONE: Exactly right, Your Honor, and


that's why the idea of comparing any sort of statewide


vote with the districting votes that you actually have is


inconsistent with -


QUESTION: Even if that's true, is it not obvious


from the configuration of some of the districts, that


those who drafted the districts thought they could predict 

what they were going to do?


MR. DeLONE: Again, Your Honor, assuming that


that's correct, there's nothing wrong with it.


QUESTION: Oh, okay.


MR. DeLONE: And as far as the - the - what level


you come to in a - in a majority/minority consignment,


Justice Breyer, I think the way that the Bandemer


plurality did it, again, applying what this Court has


consistently applied in vote - in the vote dilution cases,


by which I mean the Whitcomb v. Chavis line of cases, is


to say, all right, let's look at this and see if it's like

a diagnostic test, like a threshold.  Have we got a


problem here where, over time, and I'm not sure how much


time, but over a significant amount of time, it looks like


the majority overall is being consigned in some way.


But, once you do that, you must look elsewhere,


which is what Rogers says, Whitcomb says, all of the - the


vote dilution cases say.  You can't ever look at electoral


results alone.  That's never sufficient.  What you must


look to is whether or not there's been something else that


has caused a self-perpetuating breakdown in the democratic


process, because as soon as you - and -


QUESTION: Do you agree with your colleague that


there is no need for any neutral justification when you're


drawing districts? 


That it can be done solely for the 

purpose - granted it be an attempt that might not succeed,


nobody knows for sure how people are going to vote, but is


it permissible for a legislative body not even to consult


- I mean, the majority of a legislative body not even to


consult another party, not even to take anything into


consideration except trying to get the maximum results at


the - the election?


MR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor.  That's


permissible, and we think that was the whole point of what


we call the racial gerrymandering line of cases, that is,


the Shaw Line of cases, where they were saying, okay, we

have a special category here that relates to race, and


what we're trying to do is define the difference between


race, which is inherently suspect, and which requires


special scrutiny, and politics, which the Court repeatedly


said -


QUESTION: But if you take that position, then


you must be taking the position, I guess you are, that the


- the holding in Bandemer that this was a just -


justiciable issue is just erroneous?


MR. DeLONE: Your Honor, we think that -


QUESTION: That's your basic position?


MR. DeLONE: We certainly think that the Court


should take this opportunity to find that - that - that


political gerrymandering is non-justiciable.  We think


that would be the simplest and the cleanest way to frankly


get out of the political thicket.


But - but even if you don't do that, what - what


the Bandemer plurality was doing was simply applying what


this Court has - has always applied with respect to vote


dilution.  And we think it would be kind of strange if the


- excuse me, Your Honor.


QUESTION: May I ask you this?  Do you think the


complaint states a cause of action under Justice Powell's


opinion in Bandemer?

Honor.


QUESTION: That's why I thought I'd ask you.  You


had fair warning of the question.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION: Don't tell me you didn't read the


opinion.


MR. DeLONE: No, no.  Yes, Your Honor, I - I - I


think it would, because Justice Powell thought in terms of


neutral districting criteria and thought there was some


objective reality out there.  And frankly, we don't think


there is one, and if you start down the road of electoral


results, we submit that -


QUESTION: No, no.  He doesn't start down the


road of electoral results. 


He - he focuses on intent, 

that it's an intent to use nothing except a non-neutral


criterion in drafting the regulations.  And you're


suggesting that's permissible.  That would not require


counting votes after the election.


MR. DeLONE: With respect to intent, Your Honor,


we - we think it - it's - you certainly can assume that


there was political intent in a - in a political


gerrymander -


QUESTION: And nothing else.


MR. DeLONE: It - it certainly could be nothing


else, Your Honor.

 QUESTION: So is this a - an intent of a bare


majority or all of them?  What - what - what if -


MR. DeLONE: Well, I think you can presume that


as - as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, 42 of 98 in the


Democratic caucus voted for the plan.  I think you can


presume that they were in some way -


QUESTION: You can only - that's a matter of


defense.  You can't presume that based on the allegations


at the complaint.


MR. DeLONE: No, I - I was trying to address


Justice Scalia's question about -


QUESTION: I'm trying to get to how you - how you


determine intent.


MR. DeLONE: Well, I - I -


QUESTION: Or whether it's based on the majority


or -


MR. DeLONE: I - I think you can presume that


whatever the voting, there was some political motivation,


and I think you can presume that the political motivation


might be different for different groups, different


parties.  And - and frankly, we - we don't - we don't have


a problem with the intent -


QUESTION: Belling the cat.  I mean, it's


wonderful to use intent.  How do you find intent?  That's


- legislative intent is very hard to determine.

 MR. DeLONE: And - and - and I think the intent


would be - would different.  But it's - you can even


assume that it's political -


QUESTION: Well, how did you find it in the - in


the first racial gerrymandering case?  Didn't you find it


partly by looking at the shape of that district in North


Carolina?


MR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION: Didn't that shift the burden?


MR. DeLONE: Yes, Your Honor, you did.  But in


the - in the racial gerrymandering cases, you were looking


for something that was race-neutral.


QUESTION: You were also looking for predominant


motive, not what the exclusive motive is, which is the 

test that Justice Stevens is - is proposing.


MR. DeLONE: That - that's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION: The - the exclusive motive just is


easier to respond to, because all you got to do is come up


with one neutral justification and you use the neutral


justifications that the Court identified itself in the


racial gerrymandering cases, such as contiguity and


compactness and so forth.


MR. DeLONE: But again, Your Honor, your - your -


the premise of your question is that there's something


wrong with political motivation.

 QUESTION: Correct.  That's exactly right.  No,


no, the premise of the - what the question is that there's


a duty to govern impartially, and that if you have no duty


except partisan advantage, the case is just like saying,


we're going to pay the majority legislatures a higher


salary than the minority legislatures.


MR. DeLONE: Well, Your Honor, I - I think that


when you're - when you're dealing with a - a political


question like districting, you're - you're - I think no


political party worth its salt is going to be - not think


it's - it's doing what's in the public interest to give


itself as much advantage as possible.


QUESTION: It can do that as long as it has some


other basis for doing it, and that's history what we did 

over years and years and years, states have followed an


attempt to get compact districts, your neighbors are in


the same voting area as you are and so forth, not these


fancy designs that are really a recent product of


politics.


MR. DeLONE: But, Your Honor, in - in all of


these traditional districting criteria, they're basically


used as tools by the political parties to seek what kind


of political advantage they can.  And again, we submit


that that is - is - there's nothing wrong with that.  And


the question is whether or not you've been shut out of the

process, whether something else is happening that suggests


that the - the process itself is broken.  And if you -


QUESTION: For example, what would that be?


MR. DeLONE: Well, Your Honor, it's - it's


happened in the past.  It's - it's - it's happened with


Reynolds and Baker, and it's happened with -


QUESTION: But that isn't gerrymandering.


MR. DeLONE: No, it isn't, but it's the kind of


breakdown -


QUESTION: You're saying there's no


gerrymandering unless there's something else.


MR. DeLONE: Yes.


QUESTION: Which is to say there's no such thing


as cognizable political gerrymandering, period. 

MR. DeLONE: I - I think what the Bandemer


plurality was trying to do was to leave the door slightly


ajar for something that, frankly, in our political system


is too resilient to - to allow to happen, but it's


conceivable that it could happen.  And frankly, we think


that it's strange to try and change the - the standard,


which is well established in this Court's jurisprudence,


just because the political system doesn't allow it to


occur.


And we think that once you go down the road of


electoral results, you go down the road of

proportionality. And the - the references that - that


appellants' counsel keep making to majorities are


statewide majorities, and that is proportionality.  That


is a political judgement, and we believe that the Court


has properly rejected that and the Court should continue


to apply the unconstitutional vote dilution standard and


that that - if - if they find that it's justiciable at


all, and that the easiest and simplest thing for the Court


to do is to find that political gerrymandering is in fact


unconstitutional - excuse me, non-justiciable as a matter


of law.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. DeLone.


Mr. Smith, you have two minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  Let me


start off by saying I do think that our complaint


satisfies the standards of the Powell opinion in - in


Bandemer that it alleges that partisan maximization was


the sole driving force behind this map.  And indeed, we


had the opportunity in the district court, because of the


one person, one vote problem, for the state to come in and


try to come up with some justification for their line-


drawing other than partisan maximization, and the district


court found as a fact in that trial that the map

jettisoned every criterion that this Court ever identified


in Karcher, other than partisan maximization.


QUESTION: I take it the results you're urging on


us would require us to supervise local entities, city


councils, boards of supervisors -


MR. SMITH: They -


QUESTION: - water districts.


MR. SMITH: They - they - they as well can


violate the constitutional rights of the people who live


in those jurisdictions, Your Honor.


And let me just address the - the question of


whether it makes sense to wait and see how the elections


come out and see whether there is, in fact, this anti­


majoritarian effect from the line-drawing.  One of the


real practical problems with that is that the lines


themselves in a - in an extreme gerrymander like this, can


- can effect the statewide aggregate vote totals


themselves.


You saw that right here where, in - with the


history of votes very evenly divided in a - in a balanced


map through the '90s, a court-drawn map.  Suddenly with


this gerrymander you had five Republicans running


unopposed, you had a number of the Democratic incumbents


defeated in the primaries because they squared off -


QUESTION: I guess if it were the constitutional

rule, the party could adjust and try to run strong


candidates, even in overwhelmingly Republican districts.


MR. SMITH: Well, I suppose that that is in fact


the case, but you can't assume that the - the vote totals


under a gerrymander are independent of the effects of


that.  First of all, if they pair the incumbents, they're


just not there to run anymore, and there's a substantial


distortion caused by the map.


There was some discussion by Mr. Krill of


judicial races as the - the test of - of partisan balance


in the map because the - the supposition was that judges,


when they run, don't have any great personal magnetism, I


guess.  But he didn't mention the - the race that was


cited in our reply brief, which - this was 2003 - where 

Mr. Bayer ran as a Democrat, got 52 percent of the votes


statewide, and carried six out of the 19 districts.  That


is an indication of the basic fundamental packing and


cracking that's in the map, and is in fact a form of


severe discrimination, making some voters' votes count


much more forcefully than others.


Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Smith 


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
