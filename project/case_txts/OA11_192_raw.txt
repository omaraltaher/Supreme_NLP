This Court's decisions have long established 

Mr. Srinivasan. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 


 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Thank you, 


that Congress will be deemed to have waived the 
Government's sovereign immunity only if it unequivocally 
expresses its intent to do so.

17  statute, which always seems to be where you're pointing

19  sovereign immunity, then there’ll never be another

22  Justice Sotomayor.  Of course --

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, they would have two

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  There are such statutes, 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What would they look

obligations in the statute run against the United 

1  features consistent with this Court's decisions that 
2  have found the Tucker Act to be applicable.  One would 
3  be that the statute does not contain its own remedial 
4  mechanism, and the second would be that the substantive 
5
6  States, and the United States alone. 
7
 And an example of that type of statute is 
8  the one that this Court found to be supported by the 
9  Tucker Act in White Mountain Apache Tribe or in Mitchell 
II.  Those are the kinds of statutes as to which I think 
10
11  the Tucker Act was meant to apply. 
12
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So basically -- I'm not 
13  sure why we're even addressing the issue of Tucker Act 
14  jurisdiction.  We should have really just been briefing 
15
16  sovereign immunity --
17
18
19  to you, the operative question. 
20
21 
22
23  addressing Tucker Act immunity is because Tucker Act 
24  immunity is the basis for jurisdiction in this case 
according to the reasoning of the Federal circuit. 
25

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, of course --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- because that becomes, 

the issue of whether the statute at issue here waives 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  It does when they're 

dealing with the statute like this. 

 And, of course, the reason that we’re

adding the Tucker Act as a jurisdictional basis in the 

 And it's not at all clear why a plaintiff 

already concluded that the unequivocal expression test, 
the standard test applied for waivers of sovereign 
immunity, was not satisfied. 

 And the problem with the reasoning of the 

1
2  Federal circuit is it allows the litigant to readily 

3  circumvent the Court's strict test for sovereign 

4  immunity waivers by the straightforward device of 

5
6  complaint. 
7
8  couldn't do that for any claim under any statute, 
9  including a statute as to which this Court would have 
10
11 
12 
13
14  this, in Lane v. Pena, the court concluded that for 
Rehabilitation Act claims under Section 504 of the 
15
16  Rehabilitation Act, there was no unequivocal expression 
17  of an intent to waive sovereign immunity by Congress for 
18  purposes of damages claims; and, therefore, a 
19  damages claim can't be brought against the United States 
20
21
22  there’s no apparent reason why a plaintiff couldn't 
23  bring a damages claim against the United States for a 
24  violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by 
25

adding the Tucker Act to the jurisdictional bases in the 

under Section 504. 

 But under the Federal circuit's approach, 

 Now, to give the Court a concrete example of

detract from the ability of the Federal circuit to 
conclude that the statute, nonetheless, can be fairly 
interpreted to mandate the payment of money. 

1  complaint.  Because if the plaintiff were able to do 

2  that, notwithstanding this Court's decision in 

3  Lane V. Pena, the result would be that the plaintiff 

4  could say, the Federal circuit, you should look at the 

5  statute and ask the question whether it can be fairly 

6  interpreted to mandate the payment of money by the 

7  Government. 

8
 There’s no unequivocal expression of an 

9  intent to waive sovereign immunity, but that doesn't 

10 
11 
12 
13
 Now, of course, if that issue were to arise, 
14  we would make the argument that the statute can't be so 
15  read.  But the possibility that a plaintiff could make 
16  that argument, notwithstanding this Court's decision in 
17  Lane V. Pena, we think reinforces the need to 
18  conclude -- to conclude that the Tucker Act can't be 
19  applied in the way that the Federal circuit sought to 
20  apply it here. 
21
22
23
24  ask -- following up on my question --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could I ask you --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Srinivasan --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I’m sorry, I was going to

its own remedial scheme? 

a Tucker Act remedy. 

 Under your new approach, that holding is 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, the --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- because the FLSA has 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Sure. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- many courts have held 

1
2
3  that the FLSA has an express waiver of sovereign 
4  immunity.  And many of them have recognized, if not all, 
5
6
7  incorrect, I presume --
8
9
10
11
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  I think one -- one way to 
12  look at the FLSA, if we're looking at it in the first 
13  instance, would be to conclude that the FLSA itself has 
14  a waiver of sovereign immunity.  And so you wouldn't 
look to the Tucker Act as the basis for the waiver of 
15
16  sovereign immunity, and you would look at FSLA in the 
17  way that we think you should look at FCRA -- excuse me, 
18  the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA. 
19
20
21  necessarily view the statute in that way.  But if you 
22  apply the framework that we think is the correct one to 
23  apply, as we set forth in our brief, you might reach the 
24  same conclusion under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 
25

 Now, Your Honor is correct that there is a 

body of court of claims jurisprudence that doesn't 

although under a slightly different route.

go to --

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, it would depend. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It has the same language 
as here, in -- you can bring your suit in any Federal or 
state court of competent jurisdiction. 

1
2  circuit has no jurisdiction over those claims, according 
3  to you, because the waiver is in the FLSA, it has its 
4  own judicial remedy.  They’re not authorized, then, to 
5
6
7  There is a little bit of an anomaly in the FLSA because 
8  the FLSA doesn't necessarily point to any particular 
9  court as the basis of jurisdiction. 
10
11 
12 
13
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Right.  It says:  "In any 
14  Federal or state court of competent jurisdiction," but 
15
16  brought in district courts and a court of competent 
17  jurisdiction. 
18
19
20
21
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I think one way to 
22  potentially see the difference -- and I'm not going to 
23  quibble with -- with what Your Honor's saying, but one 
24  way to potentially see a difference is because the FLSA

1  doesn't have a free-standing provision that reversed the 
2  district courts -- it's possible to read that statute as 
3  essentially incorporating the Tucker Act as setting 
4  forth what the court of competent jurisdiction would be. 
5
6  and 14(a) of the appendix to the Government's brief, 
7  speaks specifically about actions being brought under 
8  FCRA in any appropriate United States District Court, 
9  and then only, it goes on to talk about, or in any other 
10
11
12  distinction between the two. 
13
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Srinivasan, what you say 
14  has a good deal to recommend it, and it's basically, you 
15
16  everything that we know about sovereign immunity, but 
17  it's really hard to get that from the text of this --
18  the Tucker Act. 
19
20
21  are asking us to reach? 
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Sure.  I do, Your Honor. 
22
23  The text of the Tucker Act, it's true, if you read the 
24  text to apply to its full potential reach, then the 
25

Do you have any textual argument for the result that you 

argument would be more difficult; but, the text of the 

 In fact -- I mean, I guess my question is: 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I guess --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- against any statute.  Not 

any statute except the ones with remedial provisions, 
but just any statute. 

1  Tucker Act has never been read that way, including by 
2  this Court itself, starting with Nichols v. United 
3  States --
4
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that's not really a 
textual argument.  That's an argument about how we've 
5
6  sensibly limited the reach of the Tucker Act.  But the 
7  Tucker Act does seem to include what your friend there 
8  says it includes --
9
10
11 
12 
13
14  -- if you read the Tucker Act to its full textual reach, 
15
16  argument is that when the statute refers to claims 
17  founded on any act of Congress, it was never intended to 
18  apply literally to any conceivable act of Congress. 
19  And, in fact, this Court's own test for money 
mandating -- the money mandating test that applies to 
20
21  the Tucker Act embodies that understanding because --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I assume you’re appealing 
22
23  to the textual principle that the specific governs the 
24  general.  Isn't that what's going on here? 
25

MR. SRINIVASAN:  We're appealing --

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Sure.  I guess you -- you 

I think we would have a more difficult case.  But our 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  We're certainly relying on 

Reporting Act into play, yes, we're absolutely relying 
on the specific versus the general proposition, as this 
Court has relied on in any number of cases. 

1
2  more general provision, and you are saying it's -- it's 
3  overcome by a more specific provision that provides for 
4  compensation, but excludes the Federal Government. 
5
6  that, Justice Scalia, when you're asking whether the 
7  Tucker Act can be used as the basis for waiving 
8  sovereign immunity for claims under the Fair Credit 
9  Reporting Act.  So when you bring the Fair Credit 
10
11 
12 
13
14  question to be talking about the Tucker Act and the 
Tucker Act alone, without bringing into play any other 
15
16  statute.  Now, I take Your Honor's point that it's hard 
17  to conceive of the Tucker Act in that kind of isolated 
18  fashion, because usually you'll be asking a question 
19  whether a claim can be brought against the United States 
20
21
 And so if that statutory regime includes its 
22  own remedial mechanism, as FCRA does, it's hard to avoid 
23  resort to the specific control as a general proposition. 
24
25

 But the other point about construing the 

text of the Tucker Act alone is that the Tucker Act is a 

 I guess I understood Justice Kagan's 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That the Tucker Act is a 

under some other statutory regime. 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 And so the Court has never construed the 

1  waiver of sovereign immunity.  And so the canon that we 
2  construe waivers of sovereign immunity strictly comes 
3  into play when we construe the terms of the Tucker Act 
4  itself.  And I think it stands to reason that when you 
apply that canon, you wouldn't read the Tucker Act to 
5
6  encompass fully any act of Congress, because the 
7  implications for waivers of sovereign immunity would be 
8  quite substantial. 
9
Tucker Act that way, and it shouldn't countenance that 
10
11  kind of construction now, which is effectively what the 
12  Federal Circuit's interpretation allows, because, rather 
13  than applying the strict standard under which Congress 
14  would have to be seen to have unequivocally expressed an 
intent to waive the Government's sovereign immunity in 
15
16  the terms of FCRA, it allows a plaintiff to avoid that 
17  by simply resorting to the Tucker Act in the 
18  jurisdictional basis of a complaint, and getting the 
19  real act by the Federal Circuit's own description 
20
21
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The United States -- the 
22  United States is governed by the substance of the Credit 
23  Reporting Act.  The Act applies to the Government, but 
24  your point is there's no sanction for 
25

noncompliance, even though the United States, a 

standard that applies to the Tucker Act. 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 And the reason I would say that is that, 

1  Government system, is supposed to conform to the 
2  standards in the Act. 
3
4  responses, Justice Ginsburg.  First, on the question of 
whether the United States is subject to the substantive 
5
6  obligations in FCRA, I don't know that's there's a one 
7  size fits all answer.  I think you'd have to go 
8  provision by provision and make an assessment. 
9
with respect to certain provisions at least, there are 
10
11  other statutes that, depending on the provision, have a 
12  specific obligation against the Government.  And I'm 
13  thinking in particular of the Debt Collection 
14  Improvements Act, the Privacy Act in certain contexts. 
15
16  with respect to the particular FCRA provision that's 
17  alleged to run against the United States, would the 
18  better basis for finding the United States' obligations 
19  be some other statute that speaks more specifically to 
20
21
 So I'm resisting the notion that the -- the 
22  FCRA's references to "person" in all of its substantive 
23  obligations would necessarily encompass the Government. 
24  Now, there's at least one provision as to which we don't 
25

And so you have -- you have to ask the question whether, 

the question. 

Official 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I guess a few 

deny that the Government is covered, and that's 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

the Government has entered into with credit card 
companies that allow the Government to participate in 
the credit card system.  As a condition --

1  1681(b)(b)(b), and that provision is set forth at pages --
2  at page 7a of the appendix to the Government's brief. 
 And with respect to the particular provision 
3
4  at issue in this case, the truncation provision, I guess 
we don't have to confront the question of whether the 
5
6  Government is bound by that provision.  It might well 
7  be, but we don't have to confront that question, because 
8  the Government acts as if it's in compliance with that 
9  provision because it has to.

14
15

17  at --
18
19
20
21  Government reports; the conditions for furnishing.  And 
22  then if you go to 7a -- that's also part of (b)(b) --
23  b(b)4 has an exception for national security 
24  investigations.  And it talks at (b)(b)(4)(A) about "in 
the case of an agency or department of the United States 
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You said 7a. 
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I'm sorry.  It starts 

at 4a.  And the -- 4a, permissible purposes of 

There's a series of network agreements that 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  1681b(b)(b),

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  1681(b)(b).  If you look 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right. 
MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- it stands to reason that 

answer.  But the other part of your question is, are we 
taking the position that even if substantive obligations 
run against the United States, there still wouldn't be a 
remedy, at least a remedy in damages against the United 
States?  And the answer to that is yes. 

1  Government which seeks to obtain and use."  And because 
2  there's a reference to the United States Government in 
3  that provision --
4
5
6  the term "person" in (b)(b) -- which starts at 4a; 
7  excuse me -- encompasses the United States Government. 
 I guess the short answer, Justice Ginsburg, 
8
9  is I don't think that there is a one size fits all

12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20

22 
 But Congress is very careful to cabin the 
23
24  circumstances in which the Government would be subject 
25

But that's not at all atypical under this 
Court's sovereign immunity jurisprudence, and it's not 
at all atypical for Congress to have fashioned a scheme 
that runs in that way.  And the Privacy Act at least is 
one example, where in the Privacy Act, which applies to 
the Government and the Government alone, there are 
certain obligations that the Government has to comply 
with in that statute. 

to liability and money damages. 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Still in all, your argument 
1
2  is -- is not just a straightforward specific governs the 
3  general argument.  I mean, that would be the case if --
4  if the other statute which the plaintiff is trying to 
run around through the Tucker Act specifically -- it 
5
6  clearly prohibits suit against the Government.  Then you 
7  would say, you know, the specific governs the general 
8  even though the govern -- the Tucker Act permits it; this 
9  statute prohibits it. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17
18  Justice Scalia, I think that's a distinction that 
19  ultimately doesn't make a difference in the context of 
this case.  In the prior cases in which this Court has 
20
21  applied the specific over the general canon in related 
22  contexts, it's true that the statutes in some situations 
23  contemplated liability against the United States, but it 
24  had -- that statute would have certain limitations. 
25

But you're saying this other statute here 
does not really prohibit it.  You're just saying this 
other statute does not permit it under our usual rules 
about waiver of sovereign immunity being strictly 
construed.  So, you know, it's a -- it's a -- it's a 
difference -- it's an odd sort of a specific governs the 
general argument. 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  I think, with respect, 

And I'm thinking, for example, of Hinck, of 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

to a different statute, the Tucker Act, to circumvent 

Okay?  But here, you don't have -- you don't have that 
negative implication at all, do you? 

1  Erika, of Brown v. General Services Administration, 
2  cases like that, and Sheehan.  And what the Court said 
3  was, where a statute provides for liability against the 
4  United States, but in certain situations, you don't look 
5
6  those kinds of limitations. 
7
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but that's -- that's 
8  because the negative implication of that statute is --
9  affirms that there is no liability of the United States. 
10
11 
12
13  think we need to have that negative implication to that 
14  full extent in order to invoke the specific versus the 
general canon, because the question at the end of the 
15
16  day is what did Congress intend?  And where Congress 
17  enacts a specific remedial scheme that sets out the 
18  extent to which liability will be imposed under, in this 
19  case, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it stands to reason 
that Congress would have expected courts to look to the 
20
21  remedial scheme that it established to determine to 
22  metes and bounds of liability, not to some other general 
23  default provision. 
24
25

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, I guess -- I don't

Would you be making the same argument? 
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  If -- if the statute were 

1  sense, the specific remedial scheme that's in the 
2  statute should control over some other general scheme 
3  that Congress might well not have had in mind at all 
4  when it set forward the terms under which claims can be 
5
6
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  How specific does the other 
7  statute have to be?  Suppose there were another statute 
8  that just said any party can bring suits to enforce any 
9  rights against any persons under this statute. 
10
11
12  that general? 
13
14  statute says.  It just says any party can bring suit to 
15
16  lot of hoopla and a lot of detail about a remedial 
17  scheme.  Would you still say that -- this controls over 
18  the Tucker Act? 
19
20
21  determination on the scope of liability for claims under 
22  that statute.  It would have given thought to that 
23  issue, and it would have set forth in a very general 
24  provision the metes and bounds of the liability.  And

 Now, in Your Honor's hypothetical, if you 

But on the question of whether you'd look to 

1  anyone to look to the Tucker Act, because Congress gave 
2  no indication that it was thinking about the Tucker Act. 
3
4  had a statute that spoke in those kinds of general 
terms, of course, we'd have I think a very good argument 
5
6  that there would have been no contemplation of a waiver 
7  of sovereign immunity.  So we would strongly resist the 
8  notion that the United States might fall within the 
9  compass of that general provision.

21  whether -- whether the Tucker Act eliminates for all 
22  other statutes the presumption against liability on the 
23  part of the United States? 
24
25

that general provision as opposed to the Tucker Act, I 
think you would look to that general provision, because 
Congress in the context of enacting that statute told 
everybody:  We're defining the extent to which liability 
can be asserted in court by reference to this general 
provision; this is where you ought to look, not 
somewhere else. 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  It does.  I think it does. 
And I think that's quite a breathtaking proposition, and 

 Now, one other --

way around, right?  The Tucker Act discusses 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, it would be hard to 

1  not one that Congress would have intended by virtue of 
2  the Tucker Act --
3
4  really the specific governing the general, but the other 
5
6  specifically the liability and the sovereign immunity of 
7  the United States, and if the statute just generally 
8  doesn't address it, then the Tucker Act is the specific 
9  one and the other statute is the general one.

square that understanding with the way -- with the 
series of this Court's cases that apply the specific 
versus general canon, because I think the same argument 
could have been made in Brown v. General Services 
Administration, in Erika, in Hinck, that if you thought 
that the subject --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You'd win under this 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  I'm sorry? 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You win under this

address the liability of the United States.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: 

Well, that's the question 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

In which case you would 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  It -- well, you can look at 

1  So the Tucker Act is the one that's specific, and it 
2  applies instead of the general language in the -- in 
3  FCRA. 
4
5  it that way, Mr. Chief Justice, but I guess my only 
6  response --

8  lose, not win. 
9

13  construe the Tucker Act. 
14
15  construing the Tucker Act's waiver of sovereign immunity 
16  only to apply to a certain limited subset of acts of 
17  Congress.  And if you construed it in a sufficiently 
18  limited way, I suppose we could live with that result. 
19
 But I think the better way to approach the 
20  question is to look at the particular remedial scheme 
21  that Congress enacted in the scope of the statute 
22  itself.  And for purposes of questions of sovereign 
23  immunity, you'd look to that particular remedial scheme 
24  and ask the age-old question, countenanced by this

Tucker Act?  I mean, every -- every basis for suit 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  There -- well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So what --
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  -- not claims in contract, 

1  Court's decisions, of whether there is an unequivocal --
2  unequivocal expression of an intent to waive sovereign 
3  immunity in the scope of that statute itself.

6  against the Government, every claim that the Government 
7  owes you money rests upon some statutory text, doesn't 
8  it? 
9
10

12  for example.  Obviously, if there is an expressed 
13  contract with the United States, I don't know that that 
14  comes under a statute, necessarily, but --

19  under the Constitution, but the Tucker Act can be used.

comes under a statute, you would look to the other 
statute to see whether there is sovereign immunity under 
that statute; and, if there is under that statute, then 
the Tucker Act does not overcome it. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  If that statute -- at least

14  compensation to prisoners of war.  This was the statute 
that was at issue in Bell v. The United States.  I think 
15
16  it's cited in footnote 42 of the Court's opinion in 
17  Bowen v. Massachusetts. 
 But that statute specifically set forth that

provider have the burdens of accomplishing Y, unless 
there is an express waiver of sovereign immunity, the 
Tucker Act doesn't come into play. 

1  and jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims.  And 
2  the reason is that that statute has the two predicate 
3  conditions that we think have to be met in order to even 
4  raise the question whether the Tucker Act steps in.

6  statute is written to impose obligations only on the

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Right. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- unless there is an

2  given our case law -- but you're saying they can't sue 
3  the Government under the Tucker Act --
4

6  express waiver. 
7
8  would look to the question of whether there’s been a 
9  sufficiently expressed waiver in the terms of the 
10
11 
12
13  no remedial provision at all; it just lists a set of 
14  legal obligations, but it’s a generally applicable 
statute, it doesn't concern only the United States? 
15
16  Would your argument still apply that the Tucker Act has 
17  no force? 
18
19  it's easier where you have a remedial scheme, obviously, 
20
21  substantive obligation is a generally applicable one and 
22  doesn't run against the United States alone, you'd 
23  still, I think, want to --
24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So then your argument really 

isn't about another statute having a remedial scheme. 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Yes, it would.  I think 

but I think it's also the case that where the

a remedial scheme, we don't look to the Tucker Act; we 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  That's true.  I mean, but I 
guess -- you don't have to reach the question of whether 
the Tucker Act applies or the statute doesn't have its 
own remedial scheme, obviously, in this case, because 
FCRA does have its own remedial scheme.  Our argument 
would still apply. 

1  In the briefs, you present it as another statute has a 
2  remedial scheme, of course you should look to that more 
3  particular remedial scheme.  But you would take the 
4  argument and say, even if the other statute doesn't have 
5
6  just think of the Tucker Act as having a limitation that 
7  is not in the Tucker Act's test -- text in order to make 
8  the Tucker Act consistent with everything we thought we

11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  the Tucker Act in one particular way to a subsets of 
18  acts of Congress, I guess one point I'd make is that the 
19  money mandating test that this Court has always applied 
where the Tucker Act does apply already presupposes that 
20
21  it doesn't apply to just any act of Congress, because 
22  the act of Congress has to be a money-mandating one. 
23
24  Give me the last sentence again. 
25

 And on the question of whether we're reading 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Say it again.  I lost it. 

MR. SRINIVASAN:  The last sentence, the last

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But is this a 

money-mandated statute? 

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  I -- if you didn't 

We don't get to that question, 

1  thought at least -- maybe I should try to rephrase it, 
2  but the last thought is that this Court's jurisprudence 
3  already presupposes that the Tucker Act doesn't apply to 
4  every act of Congress because the Court's jurisprudence 
requires that the act of Congress be money-mandated. 
5
6
 So we’re already in a zone in which the 
7  Tucker Act's reference to acts of Congress doesn't 
8  literally extend to every conceivable act of Congress. 
9  It only extends to certain acts of Congress.  And I --
10

25

Justice Kennedy, because you only get to the 
money-mandating question if there is not a remedial 
scheme in the text of the statute itself and the 
substantive obligation runs against the United States, 
and the United States alone, which this one doesn't

States, and the United States alone, and where there’s 
no remedial scheme embedded within the statute itself. 
And then you ask the question whether is that kind of 
substantive obligation that runs against the United 
States, is that one that's naturally conceived as a 
money-mandating. 

1  and, precisely because the statute is generally 
2  applicable, I think we would say that under this statute 
3  it's not money-mandating, because it's not 
4  money-mandating in that it doesn't contemplate payment 
by the United States with relevant specificity because 
5
6  the substantive obligation is generally applicable. 
7
 You only get to that question in a context 
8  like White Mountain Apache Tribe or Mitchell II, where 
9  the substantive obligation runs against the United 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 And on that, I think you would look at a 
17  couple of considerations consistent with this Court's 
18  decisions.  One is, is the obligation one that 
19  necessarily deals with compensation?  So, for example, 
the statute I was referring to earlier that has to do 
20
21  with compensation for -- for imprisoned prisoners of 
22  war, that one naturally has to do with compensation, so 
23  it might be money-mandating.

trust cases that arise under the Indian Tucker Act, the

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- the statute awards

12  money-mandating; the question is who’s it mandating.

16  It expressly awards --
17
18  money-mandating test, Justice Sotomayor, is whether it 
19  contemplates the payment of damages by the

22  there’s a predicate condition that hasn't been 
23  satisfied.

hard to ask the question whether the statute is

2  precisely for the reason that Your Honor says, where the

what I would like you to elaborate, because this sounds 
rather like a tort suit, not sort of.  That's why I am 
14 
asking. 
15
16
17  Honor posed a very difficult question.  I would submit 
18  that if the statute says that you may not do A, B, and 
19  C, that you could then sue in the Court of Claims. 
20
21 
22
23  traditionally, you could think of that as a tort, I 
24  believe that's this Court's jurisprudence.

6  this case is within one of the first class of cases 
7  specified in the Tucker Act of claims based upon a law 
8  of Congress." 
9
10
11  statute doesn't say tort claims, it says claims sounding 
12  in tort, which means cases that aren't torts, but are 
13  like torts.  And it seems to me the case you -- you --
14  you have here is like tort, an invasion of privacy or 
15
16
 MR. JACOBS:  Your Honor, I believe, again, 
17  that this Court has not interpreted the cases that way. 
18  There is a debate as to whether a breach of fiduciary 
19  duty is a tort or something else, and yet this Court in 
White Mountain and other cases has -- has not found that 
20
21  to be a bar. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, your friend 
22
23  says that that's a fiduciary -- that's a trust breach,

7  Congress ever honed in on the issue whether the United 
8  States, given the multitude of financial transactions in 
9  which it engages, ever thought that sovereign immunity 
would be waived?  I mean, if you're right about this, 
10
11 
the consequences are enormous for the Federal fisc.  And 
12 
we -- the -- the statute developed in a peculiar way. 
13
 First, there was the definition of person 
14  when there was no civil liability, and then some years 
15
16  number and the expiration date.  In all of it, is there 
17  any hint that Congress envisioned a waiver of sovereign 
18  immunity in the Fair Credit Reporting Act? 
19
20
21  explicit reference in the Congressional Record to 
22  whether this was going to impact the Government or not. 
23  However, what they talked about was the almost epidemic 
24  proportion of identity theft going on, and in response

 Knowing that the Government is one of the 

sense.  It doesn't make any difference where the 

immense liability, but they are not willing to subject 
the Federal Government to immense liability.  That's 
what the doctrine of sovereign immunity is all about, 
isn't it?

3  to wonder why they would want to exclude the Government

 Now, under your world, the next time

2  it until this time. 
 So I will give you an -- Congress decides to 
3
4  pass a statute, and the statute has a cause of action in 
5
6  say that the Government retains sovereign immunity?  And 
7  everybody says, no, the rules are that if we say nothing 
8  at all, the Government does retain sovereign immunity. 
9
10
11  up, you would say, oh, we have to say that the 
12  Government waives -- retains its sovereign immunity, 
13  because if we don't say that, somebody's going to bring 
14  an action under the Tucker Act.

 MR. JACOBS:  With respect, Justice Kagan, I 
22
23  don't think that's true at all.  They went out of their 
24  way to define person to include the Government.  And 
25

have been written under the old rules and the new ones 
to come, we have completely flipped the presumption. 
Now, Congress is going to have to say when it wants to 
retain sovereign immunity, and if it doesn't -- if it 
doesn't, the Tucker Act applies, and you get to be in 
court. 

that's significant in this respect, Your Honor.  We cite

The question is what standard are we going 
to hold you to.  Are we going to say, all you need to 
show is that it's fairly arguable, or are we going to 
say, no, unless there's an express statement that the 
Government has waived its sovereign immunity, the 
Government retains it? 

1  the Moore case, Moore v. The Department of Agriculture, 
2  an almost identically worded statute, where it said, a 
3  Government --
4
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I don't think that quite 
answers the question.  That's a -- that's a question 
5
6  about what FCRA means and whether under any standard, 
7  whether the fairly arguable standard or the express 
8  standard, you should win.  And that's a different 
9  question.

13 
14

16
17  presumption from now on. 
 MR. JACOBS:  I don't believe so, Your Honor. 
18
19  I think they went out of their way to say this applies. 
It's not some general statute that says if a credit card 
20
21  is printed improperly. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When the definition of 
22
23  persons was put into the statute, there was no civil 
24  liability; isn't that right?  So they didn't -- they 
could not have been thinking about civil liability.

 And as to that, you're asking us to flip the

 MR. JACOBS:  Well, when they amended FCRA in 

 Now, in the appendix to the Government's 

any other provision of this section notwithstanding, 

And proof of that is found, I think, in two 

1
2  1996 to add the -- to change the word from credit 
3  reporting agency to person, I would submit that had to 
4  be a conscious step. 
5
6  subsequent amendments.  One, the next year, 
7  1681(b)(b)(4), saying, but this does not apply to the 
8  Government if there is a national security issue.  And 
9  then the Government pointed to 1681(u)(i), that talked 
about if the FBI improperly disclosed information, what 
10
11 
liability it would have. 
12
13  brief, it stops there.  But in the Government's petition 
14  for cert at page 78a, it also has 1681(u)(l) which says 
15
16  people are limited to this remedy against the 
17  Government.  Why would Congress say that if there were 
18  not other liability for Congress -- for the 
19  United States? 
20
21 
22 
23 
24
25

So, I believe the -- Congress was about as 
clear as it could be that it knew this applied to the 
United States, and when it wanted to carve something 
out, it did so, twice. 

 Now --

a similarly, almost identical statute, the Equal Credit 
25

United States, the FBI.  1681(u) is explicitly passed 
with regard to the FBI getting information and 
improperly disclosing it. 

 MR. JACOBS:  I believe, Your Honor, that --

 The Truth in Lending Act, the equal 

different parts of it.  And the Equal Credit Opportunity 

any person -- it doesn't have an exception for the 
United States, unlike the Truth in Lending Act which had 
a specific provision exempting the United States. 
 This is identical except for one word 

1  Opportunity Act. 
2
3  opportunity -- the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and FCRA 
4  were all part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 
5
6  Act had the same, almost the same definition with one 
7  word different of importance. 
8
9  there is no exception in here, once it says that, for 
10
11 
12 
13
14  different.  This says any, the most emphatic word it 
could use.  The other two statutes say, a Government or 
15
16  Government entity.  This statute says, any Government or 
17  Government entity. 
18
19  that interpretation that is throughout our judicial 
20
21  throughout the United States now, the -- the United 
22  States no longer even attempts to argue that ECOA does 
23  not provide for waiver of sovereign immunity.

about that, I guess we could write a very narrow opinion 

 And the United States makes no response to

 And, indeed, the -- the cases where the 

 MR. JACOBS:  Well, I'm hoping we won't make 

much new law, Your Honor --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes. 
 MR. JACOBS:  -- because I believe this is

12  escape, to get around a limitation in the substantive 
13  act, where they're trying to avoid a statute of 
14  limitations, avoid the requirement to file a -- a claim, 
as in Elkhorn Mining, as -- to get around -- get away 
15
16  from a court as in Hinck, where it says the tax court 
17  will have jurisdiction of this.  And then they are 
18  trying to get around --
19
20

 That's not going on here.  We're -- the 

Plaintiff in this case is not trying to evade any 

 The -- the reason that this statute was

1  that if any Government violates the statute, it has this 
2  liability.  I do not know how you could have a clearer 
3  money-mandating statute. 
4
 And, Justice Scalia, you asked, well, would 
we just win under the -- under the statute?  My answer 
5
6  to that would be unequivocally yes, we should.  It's an 
7  unequivocal waiver. 
 And that's the irony here.  I think you have 
8
9  a -- a more unequivocal waiver in this statute than you 
do almost any other where the Court has found that yeah, 
10
11 
that's a fair inference of a money-mandating situation. 
12
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I mean, the -- a lot 
13  of these provisions are technical, like the one I think 
14  is fairly technical, the one you are talking about, the 
Government -- it provides for treble damages -- treble 
15
16  damages, does it? 
17
18
19  damages, a fairly lengthy statute of limitations

 At the same time, there are differences 

between the relief scheme in this statute and the normal 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  My -- my impression was 
1
2  there are several differences.  And normally, these 
3  things you, at least arguably, are not appropriate 
4  against the Government, because the Government when it 
knows the law will follow it, we hope.  And, therefore, 
5
6  you don't need brow-beating mechanisms to make sure they 
7  follow it once it's clarified.  So, therefore, it -- I 
8  mean, I can imagine arguments. 
9
10
11  one you have in the Court of Claims.  And they're 
12  arguing that that means that they didn't want this 
13  Tucker Act and these other things to apply. 
14
15
16
17  Your Honor, but, with respect, I see nothing about 
18  saying, this is what you must do, and if you don't do, 
19  this is what you have to pay -- I see nothing unusual 
about saying that can be in the Court of Claims; that 
20
21  that's a Tucker Act claim.  That doesn't seem -- that's 
22  not some reticulated statute unlike the Civil Service 
23  Review Act or something like that, where you have to do 
24  all these steps, have this hearing first, have that

14  I mean, Justice Breyer's point.  It does seem a little 
ad hoc.  In other words, they don't fit quite together, 
15
16  and your answer is:  Well, we'll just take whatever, you 
17  know, whatever we have to, to make it fit.  It would go 
18  under the least imposing on the Government.

20
21  provisions in FCRA to get it to fit under the Tucker 
22  Act. 
23
24  understand your question correctly, I -- I don't believe

 It suggests that Congress did not expect the 
Tucker Act to apply if you've got to change the remedial

 This Court has consistently said, as Your 
1
2  Honor said, that the Tucker Act only provides an outer 
3  limit for filing, but we'll use the shorter time period. 
4  In Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto, the Court said:  No, no, no, 
you've got -- because Monsanto didn't want there to be a 
5
6  Tucker Act claim.  It wanted to be able to argue:  We 
7  have no relief available to us for having to disclose 
8  the components of our insecticides.  And they wanted to 
9  argue:  There is no relief available to us.

20
21  the Restatement of Torts as to whether a trade secret --
22  a listed trade secret under the Restatement of Torts, 
23  and then went ahead and said:  No.  You've got a Tucker 
24  Act claim here. 
25

you've got a Tucker Act claim.  You do have relief 
available to you.  And the Court said:  Yeah, you didn't 
file a claim.  There is a procedure where you could file 
a -- a claim saying:  This is a trade secret, and the --
you then would have arbitration.  And the Court said: 
You haven't done that; go ahead and do that and then 
let's see what happens.  But you've got a Tucker Act 
claim. 

 And incidentally, in that regard, in 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  So is -- are you 

49
 

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. JACOBS:  Absolutely. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  So what you want us to say 

1  also saying, FCRA, the underlying statute, clearly 
2  waives sovereign immunity, so we don't have to worry 
3  about whether the standard is a weak standard or a tough 
4  standard, doesn't matter.  We win anyway. 
5
6
7  is, okay.  We will apply the tough standard.  There's 
8  still -- there's still -- sovereign immunity is waived 
9  in FCRA.  And since sovereign immunity is clearly waived 
there, then you can bring this under the Tucker Act, and 
10
11 
the only differences are the remedial schemes are 
12 
slightly different, but that doesn't matter.

22  with the Government's basic proposition which is where 
23  you have a remedy you have to pursue that remedy.  And I 
24  think that, at bottom, that's their argument. 
25

MR. JACOBS:  I'm telling Your Honor that we 
win under such a test.  We don't believe such a test is 
called for, but if -- if such a test were used, we still 
win because you do have such a clear waiver. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  One of the purposes of 

the Tucker Act was to provide a remedy, where none 

 Am I correctly stating what you are now 

What's wrong with that scheme?  Instead of

 MR. JACOBS:  Your Honor, I would submit that 

role the Tucker Act should play one that should be given 

court, for years now, has said, "If you meet these 
requirements, you may sue under the Tucker Act." 

1  permitting two remedies with potentially conflicting 
2  commands, whether it's on the amount of damages or the 
3  nature of the recovery or the statute of limitations, 
4  why isn't their vision of what the Tucker Act -- the 
5
6  voice?  One that should be followed? 
7
8  that would be a substantial change in this Court's 
9  jurisprudence.  Congress passed the Tucker Act, and this 
10
11 
12
13  concede that you have a cause of action under FCRA at 
14  all. 
15
16
17  the opposite.  And so what I find peculiar is that there 
18  should be two causes of action for the same thing.  You 
19  can proceed either under FCRA or under the Tucker Act or 
20
21  me, one or the other, and it would normally be the 
22  specific governing the general. 
23
24  do we need the Tucker Act?

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. JACOBS:  Your Honor, I cannot name you a 

case off the top of my head.  As I said, I believe the 

1  made available by Congress, could we proceed only under 
2  FCRA?  Yes, we could, but the Tucker Act is available, 
3  the statute 1295 says what it says, and we have appealed 
4  to the Court of Appeals.  But there is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have any other case 
5
6  where -- where you -- somebody's been allowed to proceed 
7  under the Tucker Act where there is clear ability to 
8  proceed under some other statute? 
9
10
11  Privacy Act allows you to do either.  The -- all --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The FSLA as well.

to say, as Your Honor said earlier.  But the cases 
where a Tucker Act remedy has been denied, as I've said, 
are where a person was trying to evade a limitation of 
the substantive act.  That's not this case.  This case 
is four-square within the court's jurisprudence.  The 
Government argues now for a new -- and it's not clear to 
me exactly what test, but it's a limiting one.  It 
would -- it would cut back the Tucker Act. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Mr. Jacobs, you are 
trying to evade a certain kind of limitation.  The

MR. JACOBS:  No, Your Honor.  We believe, 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But then you wouldn't need 

going under the Tucker Act and going under the statute 
is the difference between, you know, what -- what 
standard is a court going to hold you to, to decide 
whether there has been a waiver of sovereign immunity. 
 MR. JACOBS:  The standard, I would submit, 
Your Honor, is that the Tucker Act is always available 

1  limitation that you are trying to evade is the rule that 
2  waivers of sovereign immunity have to be express.  And 
3  that's the rule you are trying to evade by going under 
4  the Tucker Act. 
5
6  and we've maintained throughout, that we do have an 
7  express waiver, 1681(a) --
8
9  to go under the Tucker Act.  The difference between

13

15
16  unless a -- the substantive statute provides a 
17  limitation on that ability; either saying it shall be --
18  shall be litigated in the Tax Court, it can only be 
19  litigated if it is preceded by a claim, an

21  if there's something that says it has to be in another 
22  forum, then you would be evading it.  But otherwise, the 
23  Tucker Act remedy is available and it's appropriate and 
24  it's precisely, I would submit, that what do you do --

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Or you don't proceed at

 MR. SRINIVASAN:  Well, FLSA is a bit 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And what about -- what is 

1  there, or you don't --
2
3  all, yeah. 
4
5
6
7  complicated, for the reasons I was adverting to earlier. 
8  It's -- this Court has never confronted the question of 
9  how exactly you go forward under the FLSA.  And I think, 
because of the ambiguity in the courts to which the FLSA 
10
11 
refers, for the reasons I was discussing with Justice 
Sotomayor earlier, I think you could see that statute as 
12 
13 
incorporating the Tucker Act itself, but that would be 
something that Congress did. 
14 
15
16 
17
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  (u)(i).  I think there's 
18  several answers to (u)(i).  First of all, I'm not sure 
19  which way that cuts because the fact -- it may be 
20
21  way that cuts because, on one hand, the fact that 
22  Congress specifically provided for the United States to 
23  be liable in certain situations I think cuts in favor of 
24  our understanding, not against it. 
25

(u)(l), it may be (u)(i), but (u) -- I'm not sure which 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about (u)(l), that 

your friend raised? 

But there's a more fundamental point about 

55
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Now, I have two points that I'd like to make 

notwithstanding any other provision would have referred 

1  the argument that my friend makes on the other side, 
2  which is that that statute was enacted, I think, before 
3  the civil remedies provisions were expanded to encompass 
4  all persons.  So it's hard to conclude that that 
5
6  to something that came along later. 
7
8  in rebuttal, one of which, there's been some questions 
9  today about which is the specific statute and which is 
10
11
 Now, one, I think, clear indication that the 
12  specific statute for present purposes should be FCRA is 
13  to look at what the Plaintiffs allege. 
14
15
16  Plaintiffs seek the FCRA advantage of statutory damages 
17  of at least $100.  And so they're grounding their claim 
18  in the FCRA cause of action.  And I think, therefore, 
19  you should look at FCRA to determine whether the 
20
21
 And you don't have a situation in which you 
22  can mix and match under both; you should look to FCRA to 
23  determine whether there's been a clear and express 
24  waiver of sovereign immunity. 
25

 The Plaintiffs are bringing a FCRA claim, 

and there's no mistake about that, because the 

The other point I would like to discuss is 

56

the general statute. 

Government is liable. 

Official 

though there's a cause of action already in the statute, 

 The Tucker Act doesn't apply to torts.  This 

1  something that -- references something Justice Breyer 
2  was adverting to earlier, which is even if there was 
3  some universe in which you could contemplate a 
4  hybridization where you apply the Tucker Act, even 
5
6  you wouldn't do so in the context of this case because 
7  there are clear indications that Congress wouldn't have 
8  contemplated a resort to the Tucker Act. 
9
claim is a tort claim.  We know this because the Court 
10
11  in Safeco a few terms ago -- this is at 551 U.S. 69 --
12  specifically referred to the Restatement of Torts as a 
13  means of -- interpreting the term willfulness, which is 
14  the linchpin for the claim here.
