CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 00-1531, Verizon Maryland v. the Public


Service Commission of Maryland and United States v. Public


Service Commission of Maryland.


Mr. Evans.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. EVANS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


Unlike Mr. Smith, Verizon takes the position


that these contracts are, in fact, pervasive and Federal,


and I'd like to tell you why.  The statute, by its terms,


requires us to enter into these relationships whether we


want to or not.  It dictates the subject matter of the


negotiations, it provides that the agreement has to be


approved by the State commission but under Federal


standards spelled out in the statute.  Once approved,


moreover, these agreements are binding not as a matter of


State law but as a matter of Federal law, which is


provided for in 252(a)(1) of the statute.


QUESTION:  252(a)(1)?


MR. EVANS:  (a)(1), and finally, and in some


ways most tellingly, every provision of an approved

agreement is like a tariff made available automatically to


every other carrier that wishes to adopt them, and the


Court upheld that in the Iowa utilities case even though


it was challenged, but the function of not only the


agreement's terms but every interpretation of an


agreement's terms has Federal reverberations.  These are


not cases that -- with which the Federal Government has


washed its hands.


QUESTION:  Well, what about Justice Stevens'


example in the previous case, do you pay on Tuesday or do


you pay on Thursday?


MR. EVANS:  Mr. Chief Justice, I think that is a


hard question in terms of the way it was put, and I think


the answer, to be consistent, is yes it belongs in Federal


court, and the reason I say that is because just like a


Federal tariff, where there's a question about the payment


date, it belongs in Federal court.  That -- the Court has


held that in many cases involving Federal tariffs, one of


which we've -- two of which we've dealt with in the brief,


one of which is Thurston Motor Lines, which is in 460 U.S.


QUESTION:  How many of these agreements,


negotiated or otherwise, are there Nation-wide?


MR. EVANS:  They're -- they're


QUESTION:  Do you have any idea?  I mean, give


me --

 MR. EVANS:  -- limited to --


QUESTION:  -- a magnitude.


MR. EVANS:  I'm sorry.  They're limited to the


boundaries of the State in most instances, although the


negotiations in one State have reverberations for the same


two parties in other States, as, for example, with


Verizon.


QUESTION:  I'm just wondering how many pure


contract cases are being dumped into Federal courts by


your --


MR. EVANS:  Oh, I see.


QUESTION:  100,000?


MR. EVANS:  I think the -- I don't have a


number, Justice Scalia.  I can say that I don't think once


the big issues are resolved there's going to be many of


them, and the big issues tend to be like the issue in this


case, where the very contract says, on the point in


dispute, that the parties agree that reciprocal


compensation will be paid only to the extent required by


the statute, naming a specific section of the statute.


QUESTION:  Yes, but you say every time there's


any dispute on this contract, even as to what date payment


should be made, you run into Federal court.


MR. EVANS:  Well, I mean, yes, but as a


practical matter the issues will not be brought to Federal

court unless there's a lot of money involved and the


issues are very important for a variety of reasons.  It's


not a cost-free proposition to go to Federal court.


QUESTION:  I thought a tariff -- I mean, you're


talking about a State railroad tariff?


MR. EVANS:  No, not a --


QUESTION:  No, of course a Federal railroad


tariff is a Federal question.  Nobody doubts that.  What


they're saying is, here, the structure of this statute is


to have State commissions run these agreements, period. 


Now, of course, they have to be sure that the State


commission satisfies certain Federal standards, which


might have been minimal but have turned out not to be so


minimal.


MR. EVANS:  Well --


QUESTION:  But -- so I don't see how in answer


to Justice Stevens -- and I think it does create a


problem.  I don't see how you can put all the -- every


detail of this State contract in a Federal court, calling


it a Federal question, and once that's so, there does


become an issue as to whether Congress bifurcated this and


said, as is true of all other State agencies, you have a


Federal question, you can go into Federal court.  Or said,


throw them all in the State.


MR. EVANS:  Well --

 QUESTION:  What's your response?


MR. EVANS:  Well, two things, Justice Breyer. 


First, the -- if you look back at this Court's Federal


tariff cases you find that the reason these cases wound up


in Federal court, even though lower courts in the cases


have almost routinely said this looks to us like a run-


of-the-mill state contract issue, is because the tariff


itself derives its authority and depends entirely upon the


Federal statute.  That's what makes them Federal statutes,


because of the Federal Government's interest in the whole


process.


QUESTION:  What's your answer to the Jackson


Transit case, then?


MR. EVANS:  Jackson Transit actually was a case


involving a contract under the Urban Mass Transit Act in


which the Court's analysis proceeded as follows.  First,


it said these are inherently, pervasively Federal


contracts -- e agree with that -- and but for a contrary


indication in the text of the statute or the legislative


history we would view those as Federal issues that belong


in Federal court, but the Court went on to look first at


the text where they found the issue not conclusive, and


then to the legislative history where it found that


Congress made a specific determination that it did not


want these cases in Federal court.  There is no such

analogy in the case here, and in fact, if anything, the


suggestion is to the contrary, because when Congress did


address the question of jurisdiction, albeit it perhaps in


narrower terms than we would have liked.  It made clear


that the -- that there's jurisdiction in the Federal


courts and that, moreover, State courts are foreclosed


from involvement.


It's odd to imagine why an issue like the one in


this case which could just as well have come up at the


approval stage, but didn't until the interpretation stage,


in part because the Internet exploded in the interim.  In


one case it goes to Federal court, in the other case it


goes to State court.  It just doesn't -- it doesn't make


sense that Congress would have envisioned that outcome.


There has been discussion about whether


252(e)(6) in some way restricts the provisions of --


excuse me, the availability of jurisdiction under section


1331, and we think the answer to that is quite clear not


only from the general presumption against that kind of


restriction that the Court has articulated from time to


time, but also because in this statute Congress actually


enacted a specific rule of construction in section 601(c)


of the act which is actually not in the joint appendix and


not codified.  It appears as a -- in the note to 47 U.S.C.


152, and what it said there was that nothing in the act

should be construed to modify, impair, or supersede


Federal law unless expressly so provided.


So Congress spoke to what inferences could be


drawn from a limitation of jurisdiction in 252(e)(6) and,


moreover, there -- the Court has -- I mean, the Congress


has shown repeatedly, both in this statute and in other


statutes, that when it wishes to preclude review in one


court system or another it spells that out specifically,


as it does in 252(e)(4) here with respects to States, as


it's done in a variety of statutes that we and the


Government have cited in our briefs with respect to the


other -- with respect to the medicare act.


And finally, let me just say a word about the


impracticality of the bifurcation that I think Mr. Smith


is striving for here.  It would mean a bizarre separation


where a case could come up with an interpretation not only


of -- not only of the issues we think are binding as a


matter of Federal law, but also State law issues that the


State put in as part of its review, and from Mr. Smith's


point of view, if it's interpretive, it all goes right to


State court.


In our view, at least all of the Federal issues


come to Federal court, and probably the State issues can


come along under supplementary jurisdiction, although


there may be a -- may not be possible to name the State in

that context.


QUESTION:  You say they're going there under


1331?


MR. EVANS:  Yes, and this Court once before had


before it a bifurcation scheme that had been proposed,


actually decided by the Seventh Circuit, as it was in this


case, and that's the Bank One case in 516 U.S., and the


Court said, this is just too unwieldy and inefficient a


system for us to impute the Congress, even if the language


were clear, and here the language by no means even


supports the outcome.


Unless there are further questions, Your


Honor --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Evans.


Ms. McDowell.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL


ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER UNITED STATES


MS. McDOWELL:  Initially, I'd like to note that


although this -- in this case the Court granted certiorari


only on the question of jurisdiction under section 1331,


if the Court determines that there is a standing problem


in the Mathias case, all of the other questions on which


the Court granted cert in that case are also presented


here, and section 1331 gives the district courts


jurisdiction over claims at least that a State commission

has acted contrary to controlling Federal law in


construing or enforcing an interconnection agreement. 


Such claims arise under the laws of the United States


within the meaning of section 1331.


QUESTION:  Excuse me, how does a State


commission act contrary to Federal law in construing an


agreement that clearly says X, which is contrary to


Federal law, but I mean, the State commission is just


saying what is the truth.  How is that acting contrary to


Federal law?


MS. McDOWELL:  For example, let's say that the


FCC had issued a different order with respect to Internet


calls than it actually did.  What if the FCC had said that


no agreement under section 252 can be construed as


providing reciprocal compensation for Internet service


provider --


QUESTION:  They wouldn't say that.  What do you


mean, can be construed?  Can be enforced, which provides,


I mean, that's fine.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, it -- the commission


conceivably could have said if the contract is silent on


the specific subject --


QUESTION:  Oh -- yes.


MS. McDOWELL:  -- or whatever.


In any event, one can envision circumstances in

which --


QUESTION:  Okay, but you -- but sure, I mean, if


you posit that the Federal regulation says no contract


shall be construed this way, no matter what it says, no


matter how clearly it says that, then I agree with you,


the commission would be violating Federal law, but let's


assume a more normal FCC regulation which just says that


this particular disposition is unlawful, even if you do


agree with it, okay, and all that happens is that the


State commission says, yes, they're -- that's what they


agreed to, okay.  Now, how does that violate State law?


MS. McDOWELL:  It may not.  It may be --


QUESTION:  Federal law, excuse me.


MS. McDOWELL:  It may be the rare case in which


a State commission decision interpreting a negotiated


agreement will -- can be alleged to violate Federal law. 


I think the questions are more likely to come up with


respect to interpretation of terms of an arbitrated


agreement where the State commission was --


QUESTION:  What is the actual question before


the commission?  Is it, what did these parties mean by


their agreement, and nothing more than that, or is it


something with more legal overtones to it?


MS. McDOWELL:  This has been sort of a moving


target, because the FCC's orders have been subject to

review and have been vacated, so -- but the claim was that


under the commission's initial order with respect to


Internet calls


QUESTION:  No, I meant the rules of the State


commission, not the FCC.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, the State commission, after


looking at the FCC's orders and the statute, decided that


there was -- the FCC had said it was permissible to adopt


either rule, to read these agreements either as providing


reciprocal compensation for these calls or not, and gave


some factors that State commissions might look to in


construing agreements, and that is what it did.


QUESTION:  For instance, if you go to a State


court, I'm A, I'm suing B because we have a contract, the


final decision of the State court isn't just necessarily


the parties agree to this.  They have to go further and


say, well, is this -- is there any State law prohibition


against this kind of an agreement, and what are the


results in this particular case, does A owe B money.  Does


the commission, State commission have that broad an area


to deal with the contracts under this statute?


MS. McDOWELL:  Yes, and certainly it's subject


to the standards of 252(d) with respect to assuring that


the public interest, convenience, and necessity is served,


and it needs to look at the polices as articulated in the

Telecommunications Act and by the FCC in its regulations


and orders, so it's a broader mandate than just looking at


the parties' intent, yes.


Whether this will always present an issue of


Federal law is, of course, not clear, but where there is a


claim that what the State commission has done is contrary


to the 1996 act, to the FCC's orders under the act, or to


some other provision of Federal, constitutional, or


statutory law --


QUESTION:  Ms. McDowell, would you clarify what


you define as the Federal question in this case?  There


were a lot of arguments that were made by Verizon like,


this is a Federal tariff, in effect, like the State


commissioner simply is saying that it is for this purpose


a Federal agency.


In your brief, the only thing that I recall --


maybe I got this altogether wrong -- was, you said the


Federal question is an FCC order which would be


controlling, and that FCC order, it turns out, has been


vacated by the D.C. Circuit, so I'm really left at sea


about what is the Federal question.


MS. McDOWELL:  Verizon's complaint, and that's


in the court of appeals joint appendix, was really quite


bare bones.  It alluded to the FCC order that's since been


vacated, as you mentioned, and to other principles of

Federal law, and it just simply alleged that the Maryland


commission's decision was inconsistent with Federal law,


also with the language of the agreement, and is arbitrary


and capricious, so it was a very general claim.


The district court construed Verizon's claim as


being that the Public Service Commission's order is in


direct conflict with a declaratory ruling of the FCC, and


that's on pages 1 to 2 of the court of appeals joint


appendix.  I think the principal --


QUESTION:  That ruling has been vacated.


MS. McDOWELL:  That's true.  There's now a new


ruling, and that's being litigated in the D.C. Circuit.


I think as currently articulated Verizon


contends that among other things the Maryland commission's


order is contrary to section 252(a)(1) of the act, which


requires these agreements to be binding, and the


allegation is that the commission has violated that


commission by writing additional terms into a party's


agreement.  Whether that is a viable claim or not need not


be decided at this point.  It's at least a sufficiently


nonfrivolous claim to state a Federal claim.


QUESTION:  Can I get a clear restatement, if you


like, of just what you think -- I mean, on the overall


question I now see three possible ways you could go.  Way


number 1 is just what we heard.  These contracts are

creatures of the Federal law, so much so that everything


about them is Federal, they all go into Federal court. 


The opposite view, no, everything about them goes into


State court, with one exception.  The exception is


approval or rejection, which is a narrow proceeding that


happens once.  That puts 98 percent of the cases in State


court for everything.


Choice 3, the compromise, which is some form of


which I think you're advocating.  That would have to be,


the Federal questions come into Federal court under either


252 or 1331.  I don't know if it makes any difference, but


they're in Federal court, the Federal questions, and where


they're all mixed up with State interpretation you have


three choices.  Each Federal judge is on his own.  1) It's


their supplementary jurisdiction, 2) they have some form


of abstention, to wait, 3) they do something else.  I


don't know what it is, all right.  But in other words,


let's call that a hybrid approach.


I want to know which of those three positions


the Government takes, and I think it's the last one, and I


want to know precisely how all this works out.


MS. McDOWELL:  I wish I could tell you precisely


how it would work out in every case.  When the --

MS. McDOWELL:  Yes.  When there is a claim that


a State commission order is contrary to controlling


Federal law, that claim should come into Federal court. 


If the only claim is a violation of State law, it should


go into State court.  If there are both kinds of claims,


they can perhaps be brought in Federal court under


supplemental jurisdiction, but then there's a question of


the State officials' sovereign immunity, assuming that


they're a party and they haven't waived sovereign


immunity, because the State law claims can't be


adjudicated under -- according to Pennhurst in Federal


court.


So the optimal solution in many of these cases


may be to bifurcate, or may be to bring the case in State


court, and the State courts, of course, are competent to


hear these cases as well, but we don't think that Congress


intended to preclude the opportunity of parties to go to


Federal court on these claims when they have a Federal


claim under --


QUESTION:  Let's put the question the other way. 


Why would Congress have wanted to provide for a bifurcated


scheme, which we know is going to lead to all kinds of


pleadings chicanery in order to get it into one court or


another court, and we're going to have endless disputes

about the pleadings.  Why would Congress have wanted that


kind of a system?


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, it is the system that we


have generally, Your Honor.  Parties do have the option of


taking their claims to State court or to Federal court,


and Congress may have been --


QUESTION:  But I think you're -- aren't you


positing a system in which there -- I was going to say,


aren't you positing a system in which, as a system, we


assume there is going to be some kind of a system of


utility regulation, and there isn't going to be a system. 


Some utility regulation through contract interpretation is


going to be done in State courts, some of it's going to he


done in Federal courts, parties in essentially the same


situation are going to be making inconsistent choices, and


you're not going to have a resulting coherent system.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, we already know, of course,


under section 252(e)(4) of the act that a number of these


cases are going to be in Federal court, and what seems


particularly irrational is that if there was exclusive


Federal court jurisdiction over some category of cases and


exclusive State court jurisdiction over the same sorts of


issues when they arise in an interpretation context as


opposed to an approval context, so that seems clearly what


Congress could not have meant.

 QUESTION:  May I ask -- oh, excuse me.  May I


ask just sort of a broader question?  My recollection is


that all the cases we're familiar with so far run around


as one issue about local calls to the Internet and so


forth.  I have the -- a feeling that there must be a


pattern.  All these agreements have a great deal of


similarity, same kind of issue, same kind of litigants on 


both sides.  I wonder if there really is a mountain of


litigation out there, or if they only have -- a very few


test cases may resolve most of these issues.  What's your


view on that?


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, I think this particular


issue involves large amounts of money --


QUESTION:  Right.


MS. McDOWELL:  -- tens if not hundreds of


millions of dollars, and that's why it's being litigated.


QUESTION:  But are there similar issues bouncing


around in State and Federal courts, or is this sort of the


only thing they're fighting about?


MS. McDOWELL:  I wouldn't say it's the only


thing they've been fighting about, and I'm not familiar


with all the cases that may have been brought, but


certainly these are the leading categories of cases at the


interpretation stage.  Certainly at the initial approval


stage there are a number of cases that have made their way

to Federal court on a variety of issues which principally


concern whether the State commission has --


QUESTION:  At the approval stage, there's no


doubt about where those go.


MS. McDOWELL:  Right.  It also should be noted


that most of these interconnection agreements build in


some form of alternative dispute resolution process that


there is some negotiation between the parties.  Sometimes


there is formal arbitration to resolve these disputes, so


it's not necessarily clear that they will all proceed


through this particular process.


QUESTION:  Do you know -- do you have any sense


of this in the hybrid -- in the hybrid system that we're


describing as concerning Justice Souter, that I agree with


you is supposed to be the norm in respect to State


agencies after the Chicago case.  Now, one of the concerns


in Chicago, and you may have come across this in your


reading, or just experience, would be there would be,


then, a lot of cases, because it covers every State


agency, where people would run into Federal court on a


Federal question related to a basically State matter, and


they'd bring in and get review through the supplementary


jurisdiction of all kinds of State issues.


Has that happened?  I mean, is this the norm? 


Do you have any sense of what actually happens in, let's

say, the 40 million State proceedings that go on every


week?


MS. McDOWELL:  I don't think there are nearly


that many State proceedings.  In some of these cases


involving reciprocal compensation for Internet calls, yes,


parties have asserted, as they have here, State law claims


as well as Federal law claims, and some Federal courts, at


least where there's been no objection raised by the State


commission, relating to sovereign immunity, have exercised


supplemental jurisdiction over these claims.


QUESTION:  Ms. McDowell, regarding your earlier


answer to Justice Souter as to why Congress would have


wanted such a crazy, hybrid system, I mean, this piece of


legislation was an extraordinary intrusion of the Federal


Government into local utility regulation, wasn't it?  I


mean, this is an area that has traditionally been


regulated by the States.  The Government has regulated


interstate communications, but here they are getting into


local communication regulation.


MS. McDOWELL:  But this isn't their --


QUESTION:  And was there not a feeling in


Congress that we should take as little as possible away


from the States, if they want to continue their


traditional regulation, and if it ended up in a hodge


podge system, maybe many in Congress said, so be it.  Is

that not a sufficient explanation?


MS. McDOWELL:  That might indeed be a sufficient


explanation.  I would preface this by saying that although


local competition surely has traditionally been regulated


by the States, this act dealt with something a little


different, encouraging competition between local carriers,


which was quite new at the time this 1996 act was adopted.


QUESTION:  Well, it may be a new Federal policy,


but to regulate concededly local telecommunications was a


major step for the Federal Government, and maybe they


didn't want to get into the business of doing that, which


is why they leave it optional to the States whether they


want to implement it or not.  The Federal Government


didn't want to take on these things, neither at the FCC


level nor, as far as we know, at the Federal district


court level.


MS. McDOWELL:  Well, it certainly is clear from


the act that Congress hoped that State commissions would


want to regulate these agreements to bring their expertise


with local conditions and with local telecommunications to


bear, although Congress, of course, also gave States the


option of allowing the FCC to do that.


QUESTION:  Let me ask the question Justice


Scalia doesn't want to ask, and that is, do you have any


legislative history that indicates that they really did

intend the hodge podge?


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  I mean, if they intended a hodge


podge, I will say God bless the hodge podge, but I


don't -- I haven't heard anyone getting into the


legislative background to indicate that they didn't.  Do


you have anything?


MS. McDOWELL:  Not really, no.  The only


arguable legislative history that seems relevant is that


the State utility commissioners through their


organizations came to Congress and said, we've started to


do this, we would like to have a role in this, and


Congress apparently heard them in enacting --


QUESTION:  What about the provision of the


statute itself, that says if the States want to do it,


they can do it?  On the other hand, if they don't do it,


the Federal Government -- isn't that -- don't you start


off with a hodge podge?  It's going to be State regulation


some places, Federal regulation other places?


MS. McDOWELL:  Yes, and that all argues all the


more for Federal court review under 1331 to assure some


uniformity in the application of the Federal standards in


the act.


If I could reserve --


QUESTION:  If there's FTC participation, the

State doesn't participate and there's an agreement, does


that subsequently raise some issues of State law


interpretation, of interpretation that can go into State


court?


MS. McDOWELL:  I believe that if the FCC


resolves these issues it may turn to State law.  It hasn't


had the opportunity to issue a decision on this yet, but


those decisions would be reviewable only in the courts of


appeals under the Hobbs act, whether they involve State


law or Federal law issues.


QUESTION:  On the Eleventh Amendment point, if


we find that there's a waiver under 252, rather than Ex


parte Young as a theory, would that simplify the question


of determination of State law issues?


MS. McDOWELL:  It might or might not.  One would


think the extent of the waiver would be governed by


section 252(e)(6), which refers to review to ascertain


whether the agreement or statement complies with sections


251 and 252.  That might be too narrow to encompass State


law as well.


If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

 QUESTION:  Oh, Mr. Evans I thought was the

Ms. Miller.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN S. MILLER


ON BEHALF OF THE STATE RESPONDENT


MS. MILLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


I'd like to start out with giving you a little


factual background of what the commission considered and


what Verizon appealed.  Essentially, the FCC issued an


order saying that ISP calls to ISP's were largely


interstate.  That order also said, for those companies


that had already approved agreements, the State commission


was to look at contract principles to see if the parties


should be bound by their previous agreements, and whether


their previous agreements should be interpreted to include


calls to ISP's being local.  That's what the Maryland


commission did in this instance.


Verizon appealed to Federal district court


raising two issues. 

The first issue was that, under


Maryland contract law, the commission had misinterpreted


the contract.  That's the first issue that they raised. 


That was clear from their motion for summary judgment,


which is part of the record of the case, but I don't


believe it's included in any appendix to the case.

 The second issue they raised is, after the


commission had interpreted the contract principles, the


commission determined that the FCC order required them to


develop an intercarrier compensation mechanism until such


time as the FCC had developed its own compensation


mechanism.


Now, what Verizon said was that the commission


was wrong, that the FCC didn't require that, that they


made it discretionary for the commission, and those were


the only two issued raised by Verizon in this case.


QUESTION:  Excuse me, Verizon was objecting to a


misinterpretation of Maryland contract law, but up here


they're saying that this contract isn't governed by


Maryland contract law, but rather by Federal contract law.


MS. MILLER:  Their --


QUESTION:  Is that a change of position?


MS. MILLER:  Their claim -- what they argued on


their motion for summary judgment was that Maryland


contract law became Federal common law, and that thus it


was --


QUESTION:  Maryland contract law became Federal


common law, I see.


MS. MILLER:  That was their argument.


QUESTION:  So that we have a Federal contract


law that consists of Federal adoption of the common law of

each of the 50 States that --


MS. MILLER:  Whatever their contract law is.


QUESTION:  I understand it, I guess.


(Laughter.)


MS. MILLER:  So those were the two issues that


were raised by Verizon.


QUESTION:  I just want to be sure I understand


the thrust of your point.  That's entirely consistent with


the argument we heard this morning, though, is it not,


because they're basically saying it's all a matter of


Federal law.


MS. MILLER:  I just want to make clear that what


they were raising was a contract issue.  They're claiming


that all contract issues are also Federal law now.


QUESTION:  Right.


MS. MILLER:  I just wanted to make sure the


Court was clear that what -- the sole thing they were


raising was a contract issue.


QUESTION:  But they made the same argument at


the district court level, if I understand you correctly.


MS. MILLER:  That --


QUESTION:  Yes --


MS. MILLER:  It had become Federal common law,


that's correct.


QUESTION:  And the Federal law is borrowed law

so far as it involves the interpretation of a contract.


MS. MILLER:  That's correct.


Now, the Fourth Circuit dismissed the 1331 claim


on the basis of three alternative grounds.  The first


ground was that in relying on Jackson Transit they found


that Verizon's claim did not meet the arising under


standard contained in 1331.  According to the Fourth


Circuit, the fact that interconnection agreements are


creations of Federal law did not in and of itself raise a


substantial Federal question.


The Fourth Circuit also relied on Shoshone


Mining, which said that Federal question jurisdiction


isn't established where local rules or customs would


govern the result, which is what we have here, of course. 


Maryland contract law is what governed the result here,


that under -- specifically under 252 the negotiating


parties had absolutely no obligation to include anything


from 251 and 252 in their contract.  For that reason,


negotiated contracts are kind of taken away from those


aspects of the Telecommunications Act.


QUESTION:  Would you think the -- would you


assert that the result would be different and you would


take a different position if this were not a voluntarily


negotiated contract?


MS. MILLER:  We still believe it wouldn't come

you.


QUESTION:  It would be a harder question for


MS. MILLER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MS. MILLER:  The petitioners really haven't


distinguished Jackson Transits.  Both cases involve the


precise question of whether an action for breach of


contract arises under Federal law merely because the


contract required -- merely because Congress required the


contract to be formed, or required that the contract --


QUESTION:  Mr. Evans offered one distinction,


that there was substantial legislative history there


saying that Congress wanted these actions to be brought in


State court.


MS. MILLER:  I disagree with that reading of


Jackson Transit  They noted one sentence that they said


led them to believe that Congress wouldn't have wanted


these.  There are also several other circuit court cases,


however, that have interpreted Jackson Transit to say that


where State law governs the decision before the Court,


then there is no Federal question jurisdiction regardless


of whether the contract terms were required to be


incorporated or not.

 QUESTION:  I saw two Federal questions, and


either way it seems Federal.  His first point, as Justice


Stevens said, was there's some words in this contract. 


This contract is a creature of Federal law.  The


interpretation of every one of those words is a Federal


question, whatever source of law that you might come --


turn to to figure out what Federal law is, whether it's


Maryland, or whether it's Alaska, or whether it's some


totally different place.


Argument 2, that the Federal Communications


Commission in a series of decisions, whatever may be true


of other words in the contract, has said that these words


in the contract, A, B, C, D, mean, and then he gets the


result he wants, all right, so he's looking both to the


F -- which obviously the FCC does have the power to do


that, doesn't it?


I mean, it could say as a matter of FCC rule any


contract that has words A, B, and C, must be interpreted


to mean thus and so under this statute.


MS. MILLER:  I believe it --


QUESTION:  Okay.  Now, it seemed to me they're


making some combination of those two arguments.  Is that


right?


QUESTION:  Excuse me, it can say that before the


fact or after the fact?  Do you think the FCC has the

power to say that after a contract has already been


voluntarily negotiated?


MS. MILLER:  Well --


QUESTION:  And the FCC can say, as a matter of


Federal law, what the parties agreed to voluntarily is


this, even though it plainly is not that?


MS. MILLER:  I think --


QUESTION:  Can the FCC do that?


MS. MILLER:  I don't believe they can, and I


think that was what was the problem with --


QUESTION:  If I got us into this, I'd modify the


question.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  It's simply a matter of, wouldn't


that state a Federal question?  I don't know what the


answer is, but somebody who says just what I said has


raised a Federal question, haven't they, just as somebody


who says this contract is a creature of Federal law, the


word interpretation is Federal, has raised a Federal


question, and you would reply, you're wrong about what the


answer to the question is, but that's different from


saying you haven't raised a Federal question.


MS. MILLER:  I think under Jackson Transit what


they've said is that you haven't raised a Federal


question.  That's what Jackson Transit said.  If you take

a contract, and your only basis of the contract was that


it was required by Federal law, then that doesn't even


raise a Federal question.


QUESTION:  They're not saying it was required by


Federal law.  They're saying that the words of the


contract, what they mean is Federal law.


MS. MILLER:  That would be a closer question as


to whether that actually raises a substantial Federal


question regarding whether -- because it would obviously


limit a State commission's interpretation.  The State


commission could not interpret the word in a different


way.


The second basis for the Fourth Circuit's


dismissal of the 1331 claim was essentially based on this


Court's Merrell Dow decision.  In Merrell Dow, the court


found that where a Federal statute includes a limited


grant of jurisdiction, that any other broader grant of


jurisdiction would flout the intent of Congress.  Based on


that, the Fourth Circuit found that 252(e)(6) was a


limited grant of jurisdiction and that therefore it should


not allow suit to be brought under 1331.


The respon -- the petitioners have argued that


the rule is otherwise that essentially the courts have


this broad grant authority unless there is some


limitation, but all the cases cited by the respondents

involve Federal agencies, and there's a distinction here,


because what the Federal agencies were arguing was


essentially that there was absolutely no review of what


was at issue, that you couldn't bring it under 1331, there


was no other statute, essentially it was a discretionary


act of the agency, and you couldn't bring it, and in that


sense the Court --


QUESTION:  Oh, now --


QUESTION:  Your position is that there's no


jurisdiction under 252, and there's also no jurisdiction


under 1331.  Is that right?


MS. MILLER:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  And is it because 252 by implication


prohibits 1331 jurisdiction, or just that 1331 isn't broad


enough to cover this?


MS. MILLER:  It's that 252 represents a limited


grant of jurisdiction on behalf of Congress, and that


Congress only intended such a limited grant of


jurisdiction, and that therefore to use a broader grant of


jurisdiction such as 1331 would defy congressional intent.


QUESTION:  In other words, Congress intended


Federal jurisdiction over review of approval agreements,


but didn't intend Federal jurisdiction over anything else?


MS. MILLER:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  What do you say to the provision that

your brother quoted to the effect that there will be no


modification of Federal statutory law unless it's express


modification, which would preserve the full extent of


1331, I suppose?


MS. MILLER:  It -- but it also preserves the --


how 1331 has been analyzed in the past, and how 1331 has


been analyzed under Merrell Dow is that you look at the


statute, and if the statute has a limited grant of


authority, then that's congressional intent that that be


the only authority, so 601 didn't change the analysis, it


just says you use the same analysis, and in this case the


analysis is, under Merrell Dow, there is a jurisdictional


statute in the statute at issue, so no other statutes --


so 1331, which is a broader grant of jurisdiction, should


not be used.


QUESTION:  What about section 251 of the


Telecommunications Act, which does seem to have a lot of


standards for these agreements.  Wouldn't that make it a


Federal question?


MS. MILLER:  Well, but they're -- for negotiated


agreements they're not required to incorporate anything


involving 251 and 252, so they've made the choice to not


include those Federal standards by negotiating an


agreement rather than having it arbitrated, so in that


sense, no, it would not raise a Federal question.

 QUESTION:  We're told that the agreements that


are negotiated are not very far distant from what the


standards are under the -- of the statute.  The thing is


so set up that the parties will come down to pretty much


what's in the statute.  Is that not so?


MS. MILLER:  I don't know that it's so in any --


in every instance.  In this instance, for a matter of


fact, the initial contract at issue with MFS and Telenet,


Verizon actually agreed to a reciprocal compensation rate


that was higher than the commission's arbitrated rate. 


Now, for what reason, I don't know.  Presumably they


traded something else for that.


So it's not necessarily so that whatever's in


the statute the parties agree to, and if the parties agree


to that, then they've chosen to agree to that rather than


go to the State commission and say, Federal law requires


this, we don't want to agree to it, but we recognize that


you have the authority to order us to do it.


QUESTION:  So you say that what has been created


is this weird system in which challenges to the


interpretation or validity of negotiated agreements can't


go to Federal court, but if it's a challenge to an


arbitrated agreement, it does go to Federal court?


MS. MILLER:  Well, we think it would not end up


in Federal court for other reasons, but we -- but --

 QUESTION:  What are the other reasons, because


it makes some difference to me whether there's going to be


this strange line between negotiated and --


MS. MILLER:  Well, if you're talking about 13 --


going into Federal court under 1331 --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MS. MILLER:  -- our argument would be the


private right of action argument, that 1331, you have to


look at the four court factors and things like that, and


that therefore those wouldn't end up under 1331 either,


and also the same argument --


QUESTION:  But then you're blending together two


things --


QUESTION:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- that I think this Court's


decisions keep separate.  One is 1331, general Federal


question jurisdiction.


QUESTION:  Right.


QUESTION:  That you have to have first, and then


do you have, would you survive a 12(b)(6) motion, do you


have a claim for relief, and you treated that in your


brief, and now again, as though they're the same question,


and they're not.


MS. MILLER:  I don't believe, in answer to


Justice Scalia's question, I was treating them the same.

He asked me what other issues would we raise to say that


this arbitration case shouldn't be in this Court, and that


was one of the issues we raised.


I believe that there are cases that essentially


say that a cause of action is a matter, a matter of


subject matter jurisdiction.  There are several circuit


courts that have interpreted this Court's Merrell Dow case


in that manner, but I don't think it's necessary for the


Court to even reach this, because I think the cases can be


upheld based on the Fourth Circuit analysis, and any one


of the three alternatives raised.


QUESTION:  I thought we wrestled with that issue


in Steel Co.,


MS. MILLER:  And --


QUESTION:  You're not going to drag us back into


that again, are you?


MS. MILLER:  Do you want to know what the Fourth


Circuit -- how the Fourth Circuit distinguished your Steel


Co. case?


QUESTION:  Yes.  I defended in Steel Co., so I'd


like to know that.


(Laughter.)


MS. MILLER:  What the Fourth Circuit claimed you


were doing in Steel Co. is that you were distinguishing


between Article III subject matter jurisdiction, which had

to be decided before you reached the merits, and statutory


subject matter jurisdiction, which you didn't have to


decide before you reached the merits under that


hypothetical jurisdiction issue.  That's how the Fourth


Circuit has interpreted Steel Co.


So in this instance I believe the petitioners


are wrong in their analysis that you have 1331


jurisdiction unless Congress specifically precludes 1331


jurisdiction.  The only cases that has occurred has been


with regard to Federal agencies, as I mentioned earlier,


and that was because to find that 1331 wasn't broad enough


to encompass a Federal agency would mean that there would


be absolutely no review, so I think that there is a


distinction that is important between the two cases.


The final reason the Fourth Circuit found that


the 1331 claim should be dismissed was the Rooker-Feldman


doctrine.  Under that doctrine, it involves essentially a


statutory interpretation element and a federalism element. 


The statutory interpretation element is that 1257 grants


original jurisdiction to this Court and this Court alone


over State -- I'm sorry.  1257 alone grants this Court


appellate review of State court decisions, and that the


Federal district courts only have review over original


actions, original civil actions, and that by implication,


therefore, Federal district courts have no review over

State court actions.


QUESTION:  Well, how does that fit in with City


of Chicago, where a Federal district court did sit on


those supplemental jurisdiction claims as a reviewer of a


State administrative agency?


MS. MILLER:  I think that's distinguishable


because in the case you referred to the district court


already had jurisdiction over Federal claims that were


totally separate and apart from the on-record


administrative review.  Essentially, the Federal claims


could have been brought without actually reviewing the


record and the order in the case.  It was because the


Federal district court already had that jurisdiction over


those claims that this Court found it could exercise its


supplemental jurisdiction and also hear those claims that


involved the on-the-record State court -- actually, I


think it was actually a local administrative agency in


that case, but the on-the-record review.


So I think this is different in that Verizon


raises no claims that are separate and apart from the on-


the-record review and decisions of the Maryland Public


Service Commission, so in this instance the Federal


district court will be acting as an appellate court,


particularly since I believe virtually every Federal


district court that has considered the issue has said in

telecommunications cases it's not a de novo review, it is


an on-the-record review, so in this instance they will be


performing an appellate action rather than an original


civil action.


QUESTION:  Could you -- in your opinion, if


there is -- suppose it isn't a communications case, it's


common, isn't it, if, say the California State Coastal


Authority, a State agency, orders someone to do thus-and-


so, they could say in Federal court, that order violates a


Federal statute, all right.


Now, in your case, if there were plaintiff just


like this one, and he went into a Federal court and said,


your State court order violates a Federal statute -- so in


other words, suppose it were much more clear, are you


saying there, there's no jurisdiction?


MS. MILLER:  There, there would be Federal


jurisdiction if the basis of that claim didn't require the


appellate -- the Federal district court, excuse me, to


actually -- to review the determinations of the Maryland


Public Service Commission to reach the conclusion that


their order violated a Federal law, essentially --


QUESTION:  Well, there may often be, with the


California State Coastal Commission somebody says, this is


a taking of my property, or something simpler.  Now, it


could be that you have to look at the underlying State

order in order to deal with the Federal question.


MS. MILLER:  To a certain extent you would be


looking at the Federal -- the State order, but you would


not be overturning the State order on the basis that the


State commission found.  You would be saying, yes, you


found this, but the problem is, what you found now


implicates this, so --


QUESTION:  Well, but what if the Federal


objection was raised at the administrative level, so that


the administrator, the administrative body had said, no


Federal problem.  In that case, I take it, your answer


would be no, they can't go into Federal court.


MS. MILLER:  That would be correct.  They would


have to go through the State court proceedings in that,


and have it resolved in that manner.


QUESTION:  May I ask you a procedural question? 


I hate to do this, but it seemed to be in the case.  Your


client's the commission.


MS. MILLER:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  Now, it's my understanding that the


commission first raised an Eleventh Amendment problem.


MS. MILLER:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  And then it was dismissed from the


case.


MS. MILLER:  We were not dismissed from the case

The whole case was dismissed.


QUESTION:  The whole case -- how did the 1331


come up, then?


MS. MILLER:  Well --


QUESTION:  It decided as to your client, you're


out of it because of Eleventh Amendment.  As to the rest


of them they were out of it because of 1331, or --


MS. MILLER:  No, Your Honor.  At the Federal


district court level, essentially the court decided that


we had Eleventh Amendment immunity and that we were


indispensable parties and, as such, the entire case had to


be dismissed.


The Federal district court also addressed the


1331 issue and found that it would not imply a private


right of action, and that the -- and that his Eleventh


Amendment analysis probably would pertain to the 1331


claim as well.


That's all I have, unless there are any other


questions.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Miller.


Mr. Evans, you have 1 minute remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 00-1531


MR. EVANS:  I would just like to read two


provisions, very short provisions from the contract that's


43 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

being interpreted here.  The first says, reciprocal


compensation is as described in the act.  The second says,


as described in the act means, as described in or required


by the act, meaning the '96 telecom act, and as from time


to time interpreted in the duly authorized rules and


regulations of the FCC or the State commission.


Now, if you look at the decision of the agency


here, the State agency here, it is full of a discussion of


what it means, what reciprocal compensation is required


under the act.  That was the basis for the interpretation.


The effect of the interpretation was to say,


even though the act doesn't require it, you have to


provide it, because your agreement says you're going to


provide it, and we -- this statement says just the


opposite.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Evans. 


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:51 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
