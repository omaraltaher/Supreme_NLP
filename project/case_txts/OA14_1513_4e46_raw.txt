Mr.  Wall. 

 

            

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  JEFFREY  B.  WALL 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WALL:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  Federal  Circuit  has  developed  such  a  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

a  rigid  test  for  enhanced  damages  in  patent  infringement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  that  a  large  number  of  the  worst  infringers,  even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bad­faith  copiers,  are  not  ­­ are  immunized  from  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enhancement. 

            

The  Federal  Circuit  has  done  that  by  moving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away  from  historical  practice  in  two  key  ways. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First,  it's  made  the  test  all  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recklessness  rather  than  also  intent. 

 

 

 

 

            

Second,  it  judges  recklessness  based  on 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  defenses  developed  in  litigation  rather  than  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts  at  the  time  of  the  infringement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  net  result,  now  that  this  Court  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Octane  and  Highmark  set  aside  a  similarly  artificial

test  for  fees  is  a  one­of­its­kind,  good  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

patent­damages­only  framework  that  does  not  track  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enhancement  statute's  text,  history,  or  purposes. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  was  not  always  this  way.  For  nearly  150 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years,  district  courts  conducted  a  totality  inquiry 

   

 

 

 

 

subject  to  deferential  review.  And  as  part  of  that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  said  the  nature  of  the  infringement  has  to  be  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  negligent  if  it's  going  to  be  an  aggravating  factor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  counsels  in  favor  of  an  enhancement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  is  that  ­­ is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  you're  advocating,  to  return  to  that,  just  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  discretion,  for  the  district  court  and  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it? 

            

MR.  WALL:  In  a  word,  yes.  We  do  think  that 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  are  principles  to  guide  district  courts' 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion,  because  historically,  district  courts  said 

 

 

 

 

 

certain  things.  But  the  one  agreed­upon  principle  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  we  all  agree  on,  or  at  least  Petitioners  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PTO  do,  is  the  court  said  in  the  totality,  if  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patentee  wants  to  point  to  the  nature  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement  and  say  that  pulls  you  out  of  the  mine  run 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  cases  and  that  warrants  an  enhancement,  it  had  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  than  negligent.  Had  to  be  intentional  or  reckless 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement,  but  based  on  the  facts  at  the  time.

It  was  a  traditional,  willfulness  inquiry. 

   

 

 

 

It  was  not  the  willfulness  inquiry  that  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  conducts,  which  looks  at  after­the­fact  defenses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  not  what  were  the  facts  facing  the  infringer  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  of  its  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  You  ­­ you  referred  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

nature  of  the  infringement.  Is  that  the  only  thing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  involved  here?  Are  any  of  the  Petitioners  asking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  enhanced  damages  based  on  litigation  misconduct,  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example? 

            

MR.  WALL:  Well,  I  think  there  was  some 

   

  

 

 

 

 

litigation  misconduct  here,  and  we  cited  in  the  district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court's  opinion  that  Zimmer  did  conceal  some  things  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  run  up  to  trial.  So  I  think  there  ­­ there  were 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  other  factors.  But  I  think  the  major  one  here,  for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instance,  in  Stryker,  was  the  nature  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement;  that  they  hired  an  independent  contractor, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  handed  the  contractor  a  patented  product;  they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

said,  essentially,  Make  one  of  these  for  us. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  We  have  to  decide  whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

enhanced  damages  can  be  awarded  solely  based  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  misconduct.  That  would  seem  to  be  a  separate 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

question.  Or  you  said  that  the  main  thing  involved  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  nature  of  the  infringement.  So  what  is  the  issue

before  us? 

 

            

MR.  WALL:  Yeah.  I  ­­ I  don't  want  to  say 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  you  have  to.  And  I  want  to  be  careful  about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  misconduct,  because  in  a  number  of  the  older 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  it  was  something  like  concealment,  which  was  post 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement  but  prelitigation,  so  it  was  a  broader 

   

 

 

 

 

 

category  of  misconduct. 

 

 

            

But  no.  I  think  the  only  reason  that  we  and 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  PTO  have  pointed  to  the  compensation  cases  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misconduct  cases  is  just  to  show  that  for  150  years  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  totality  inquiry,  and  district  courts  were  looking 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  a  lot  of  different  things. 

   

 

 

 

            

These  cases  are  primarily  about  the  nature 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  infringement.  Most  cases  will  be  like  that.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  if  the  Court  wanted  to  provide  guidance  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Circuit  about  how  to  run  the  statute,  it  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  go  back  to  doing  a  totality  inquiry,  and  here's  some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  principles  that  historically  guided  your  exercise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  discretion.  But  I  don't  think  you  have  to  do  that, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Alito. 

 

            

MR.  WALL:  I  think  you  could  ­­

the  infringement  so  determinative  under  your  view?

Yes,  they  copied  it,  but  perhaps  they  had  a, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  good­faith  belief  that  this  wasn't  patented. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  the  fact  that  they  copied  it  doesn't  seem  to  me  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

automatically  make  it  something  which  is  suitable  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sanctions. 

            

MR.  WALL:  So  the  products  here  were  marked. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  they  were  marked  as  patented.  But  I  take  your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  I  think  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Or  they  could  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

had,  you  know,  a  good­faith  belief  that  the  patent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  valid. 

 

            

MR.  WALL:  Sure.  And  that's  exactly 

  

  

 

 

 

historically  how  cases  played  out,  and  it's  how  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  play  out  once  this  Court  takes  care  of  Seagate, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  both  parties  come  in  at  the  enhancement  stage; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most  of  the  evidence  has  come  in  on  infringement  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability  or  damages. 

 

 

            

And  the  patentee  will  say,  you  copied  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patented  product  and  haven't  shown  any  evidence  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  a  reasonable  belief  in  invalidity. 

   

 

 

 

            

And  the  defendant,  if  the  patentee  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carried  its  burden,  will  say,  no.  I  did  some 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation.  I  thought  I  wasn't  infringing.  Or  I 

    

   

  

 

 

thought  it  was  invalid. 

 

 

 

            

And  a  district  court  will  make  a  judgment

call  faced  with  those  competing  narratives  about  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  right  answer  is  based  on  the  facts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Our  point  is  that  that  judgment  call  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  courts  were  making  for  a  very  long  time  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  been  stripped  from  them  because  it  no  longer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matters.  Even  if  you  acted  intentionally  at  the  time, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  Zimmer  did,  what  the  Federal  Circuit  says  is,  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  hire  good  lawyers  and  come  up  with  defenses  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation,  you'll  be  off  the  hook. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  as  Justice  Breyer  pointed  out  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Octane  litigation  ­­ and  I  now  know  it's  true  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preparing  for  this  case,  you  can  ­­ a  patent  lawyer  can 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

virtually  always  come  up  with  some  nonfrivolous  defense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  litigation.  And  that's  why,  in  effect,  what  you  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  almost  a  per  se  bar. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  That  may  be.  But  this  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

my  question  on  this. 

 

 

 

            

The  statute  doesn't  say  anything.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

statute  just  says:  In  either  event,  the  Court  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

increase  the  damages  up  to  three  times  the  amount  found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  assessed. 

 

              

I  don't  get  too  much  guidance  from  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Let  me  assume  against  you,  assume  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you,  that  the  history  does  not  favor  you.  The  history 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

insists  upon  willful.

Let  me  assume  with  you  that  there  isn't  good

indeed,  some  preliminary  in  tests.  If,  for  example,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patentee  has  a  flaw  in  his  patent  ­­ not  enough  to  kill 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  but  enough  to  make  it  pretty  uncertain,  a  weak 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent.  There  are  all  kinds  of  things  wrong  with  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

No  willfulness  damages,  irrespective,  almost,  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

state  of  mind  of  the  infringer. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  what  could  be  said  for  that?  You've  read 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their  excellent  briefs  on  both  sides,  and  you  know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perfectly  well  what  can  be  said  for  that.  And  if  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

summarize  it  ­­ and  that's  what  I  want  your  answer  to. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Today's  patent  world  is  not  a  steam­engine  world.  We 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

have  decided  to  patent  tens  of  thousands  of  software 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

products  and  similar  things  where  hardly  anyone  knows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  the  patent's  really  about.  A  company  that's  a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

start­up,  a  small  company,  once  it  gets  a  letter,  cannot 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

afford  to  pay  10,000  to  $100,000  for  a  letter  from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Counsel,  and  may  be  willing  to  run  its  chances. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You  start  saying,  little  company,  you  must 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pay  10,000  to  $100,000  to  get  a  letter,  lest  you  get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

willful  damages  against  you  should  your  bet  be  wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  have  one  more  path  leading  us  to  national

All  right.  If  I  have,  I  would  like  your

MR.  WALL:  I  think  you  have  stated  the  best 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible  version  of  Respondents'  argument,  and  I'm  happy

It's  a  high  bar  to  carry,  and  I  don't  think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

patentees  are  often  going  to  be  able  to  do  it.  And  what

briefs  that  say  that's  the  truth.  And  indeed,  thousands 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  thousands  and  thousands  of  small  businessmen  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  break  into  businesses  that  they  just  can't  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without  software.  And  when  you  have  tens  or  hundreds  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thousands  of  patents  on  software  by  other  companies, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  means  we  can't  break  in. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WALL:  Justice  Breyer,  the  sky  didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

fall  for  a  century  and  a  half,  and  it's  not  going  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fall  if  you  reverse  the  Federal  Circuit's  framework, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  as  it  didn't  fall  after  Octane  and  Highmark  in  the

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  hasn't  fallen.  Go  look 

  

  

 

 

 

 

at  the  market  shares  of  the  different  companies  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seriously  involved  in  software. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WALL:  Justice  Breyer,  showing  intent  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

recklessness  based  on  the  facts  at  the  time  is  not  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  easy.  The  intent  box  is  copying  patented 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

products.  And  I  don't  think  we  have  a  lot  of  dispute, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  where  people  are  copying  patented  products  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absence  of  a  reasonable  belief  in  invalidity,  it  doesn't

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Okay.  Then  are  you 

  

  

 

 

 

MR.  WALL:  ­­ carraigeware. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  ­­ with  this?  You've  just 

  

  

 

 

 

 

            

satisfied  ­­

 

            

            

used  a  word  that  might  help:  "reasonable  belief."  We 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

say  that  where  a  company  is  small,  where  it  is  small  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wants  to  run  the  risk,  follow  the  Fed  Circuit  rule,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order  to  show  willfulness  ­­ because  it's  reasonable  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  order  to  show  willfulness,  you  have  to  show  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringer  not  only  didn't  know  it  was  faulty,  but  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  big  company  that  was  pretty  used  to  getting  these 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyers'  opinions,  and  also  pretty  used  to  asking  their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own  experts  whether  it  really  was  a  good  patent  or  not. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  they  didn't  do  it  here.  What  about  something  like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that? 

            

MR.  WALL:  Justice  Breyer,  we  tried  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

opening  brief  to  embrace  the  full  totality  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances,  including  the  strength  of  the  patent,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  notice,  what's  commercially  reasonable  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

industry. 

            

The  one  point  I  just  want  to  make,  because  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  very  important,  is  to  get  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recklessness  box  at  common  law,  and  traditionally,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  to  show  an  objectively  high  risk.  So  as  a  patentee, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've  got  to  show  to  the  judge,  not  just  that

infringement  occurred,  but  that  a  reasonable  person 

   

 

 

 

 

looking  at  it  would  have  said  there  is  a  very  high  risk 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  what  I  am  doing  is  unlawful  because  it  trenches  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone  else's  valid  patent. 

 

 

 

            

That's  a  pretty  high  bar.  You're  not  going 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to  be  able  to  satisfy  that.  You  shouldn't  be  able  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfy  that  in  a  lot  of  cases. 

   

 

 

 

 

              

 

I  think  the  strength  of  the  PTO's  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

is  when  you  can  show  that,  the  district  court  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able  to  make  a  judgment  call  about  enhancement.  And  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  it  can't  shows  you  that  you've  really  skewed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  incentives.  Because  on  the  other  side  of  the  parade 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  horribles  you're  worried  about  are  the  people  who  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringe,  knowing  that  they  can  discount  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probability  that  they'll  be  found  to  have  infringed  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  with  virtually  no  back­end  penalty,  even  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  a  very  bad  infringer,  as  Zimmer  was  here. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Tell  me  how  you 

  

 

 

 

 

articulate  this.  And  I  ask  because  the  SG  is  talking 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  describing  it  as  egregious  conduct. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You're  saying  something  about  willfulness 

 

 

 

 

and  recklessness.  And  I  don't  know  if  this  is  all  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  of  semantics,  but  I  think  the  SG  is  right.  Even 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  give  discretion  to  the  district  courts  to  make  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  of  when  to  enhance  penalties,  we  have  to  give

them  some  guidance. 

 

 

            

            

MR.  WALL:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  It  can't  be  that  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

can  give  enhanced  penalties  on  whim. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WALL:  That's  right. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right?  So  if  it's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

not  whim,  what  is  it?  How  do  we  articulate  a  test  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protects  what  Justice  Breyer  is  concerned  about,  which  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  is  a  legitimate  concern,  but  doesn't  entrench  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  that  just  favors  you? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WALL:  No.  No,  I  ­­

   

  

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  And  by  that,  I  mean,  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

know  ­­

 

            

MR.  WALL:  Right. 

  

 

            

No,  I  think  there's  a  little  bit  of  daylight 

   

   

 

 

 

 

between  us  and  the  government,  in  the  sense  that  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  statute  was  invoked  for  various  purposes  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  just  to  punish  infringement.  But  to  the  extent  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  invoke  the  statute  to  punish  infringement,  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  is  no  daylight  between  our  position  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's.

lion's  share  of  cases,  what  the  parties  are  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debating  is  the  nature  of  the  infringement.  That  needs 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  intentional  or  reckless  based  on  the  facts  as  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  known  to  the  infringer.  And  as  part  of  whether  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringer  ­­

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No,  but  that  ­­ that  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  WALL:  ­­ is  acting  ­­

tests  understands  life  a  little  ­­ is  more  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WALL:  Sure. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  ­­ complex  than  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

Okay?  Because  you  can  often  use  the  conduct  of  someone, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  the  time,  to  reflect  what  they  thought.  And  so  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  seeing  that  someone  is  withholding  information, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  might  be  able  to  infer  that  there  wasn't  good  faith 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  beginning. 

 

 

            

MR.  WALL:  Sure. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  So  your  articulation 

  

 

 

 

doesn't  really  give  life  to  the  complexity  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry. 

            

MR.  WALL:  So  ­­ and  to  add,  then,  a  little 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

more,  I  think  what  you  ought  to  be  taking  into  account 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  for  instance,  the  strength  of  the  notice.  Some  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  letters  are  just  form  letters.  They  really  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  more  than  a  license.

Corporation  factors  that  the  district  court  here  did  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Stryker  case. 

 

 

            

MR.  WALL:  I  think  that's  right.  I  think 

    

    

 

 

 

some  of  them  will  matter  more  than  others.  But  some

don't  want  to  adopt  that  test.  How  do  I  articulate  this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  a  more  generalized  way? 

   

 

 

            

MR.  WALL:  I  think  what  you  would  say  is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  in  judging  whether  a  reasonable  person  would  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought  that  there  was  a  really  high  risk,  you've  got  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  account  of  both  the  strength  of  the  notice,  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  notice  were  they  on  of  the  patent,  and  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  been  commercially  reasonable  in  the  industry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  it  exists.  And  I  think  that  ­­ those  factors  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  limitations  are  going  to  take  account  of  the  vast

Court  to  a  case  like  Consolidated  Rubber  and  Judge 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Learned  Hand's  opinion.  He  said,  look,  you  know,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent  was  open  to  doubt  for  a  period  of  time,  and  so  no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enhancement.  But  at  some  point  here,  the  facts  changed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  infringer  knew  about  them.  It  reasonably  should 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  known  the  patent  was  valid.  We  start  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enhancement  running,  and  then  we  get  some  misconduct  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  back  end  like  we  had  in  this  case.  And  so  he  says, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm  rolling  it  all  in.  This  was  more  than  negligent, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  here's  the  enhancement  I'm  going  to  give. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  this  ­­ you  see,  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  the  case  where  at  the  time  when  the  ­­ the  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  enhanced  damages  is  decided,  the  judge  can  see  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  defense  was  able  to  ­­ with  the  help  of  good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyers,  was  able  to  put  on  an  objectively  reasonable, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

although  unsuccessful,  defense.  How  are  you  going  to  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able  to  show  that  the  infringer  did  not  have  that  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information  at  the  time  of  the  conduct  in  question? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WALL:  Well,  I  think  in  the  typical  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  intent  cases  are  ­­ are  fairly  easy  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  generally  copying.  I  think  in  the  typical 

    

 

 

 

 

 

recklessness  case,  the  infringer  will  come  in  and  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here's  the  fulsome  claim  letter  I  sent  you.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

actually  got  a  claim  chart.  It  maps  on  the  infringement 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  patent.  I  reached  out  to  you.  You  never

And  I  think  at  that  point,  then,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  has  got  to  say,  okay,  I  did  something,  but  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  in  talking  to  a  lawyer.  I  talked  to  my  engineers. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  looked  at  the  ­­ the  specifications  in  the  patent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You're  ­­ you're  limited  to  devices  with  four  wheels, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  have  three.  I  think  there  are  lots  of  things  that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  commercially  reasonable  depending  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances,  and  I  honestly  do  think  if  you  ­­ if  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go  back  and  look  through  the  cases  historically,  that's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  good  judges  and  courts  were  doing  for  a  long  time 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  the  Federal  Circuit  essentially  stripped 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion  from  them,  and  having  taken  the  bar  too  low 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Underwater  Devices  overcompensated  in  Seagate.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  bar  ought  to  be  high.  We  just  don't  think  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ought  to  be  arbitrarily  high  as  it  is  now.

all  the  parties  to  this  case  that  mere  negligence  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough  to  trigger  enhanced  damages.  But  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Circuit  is  wrong  to  categorically  bar  such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages  whenever  an  infringer  presents  an  objectively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  defense  at  trial.  That  role  creates  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

arbitrary  loophole  that  allows  some  of  the  most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

egregious  infringers  to  escape  enhanced  damages. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  The  enhanced  damages  that 

  

 

 

 

 

we're  discussing  really  is  almost  entirely  punitive  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  octane  standard  for  attorneys'  fees  remains  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect.  In  other  words,  an  octane  standard  is  ­­ gives 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  judge  much  more  latitude  to  impose  ­­ to  award 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorneys'  fees  when  there's  been  unnecessary 

 

 

 

 

 

resistance.  So  all  we're  talking  about  is  punitive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages. 

            

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  ­­ I  ­­

    

   

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  you  ­­ and  you  want  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  basically  dismantle  the  willfulness  structure  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  of  appeals  has  established;  is  that  correct? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  No.  I  think  that's  not 

    

  

 

 

 

correct.  I  think  the  Federal  Circuit,  in  our  view,  took 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  law  in  a  good  direction  or  a  better  direction  when 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  reversed  its  Underwater  Devices  standard  which  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  was  akin  to  negligence,  and  it  tried  to  tighten  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  versus  ­­ about  willfulness  up  to  make  it  harder  to

get  enhanced  damages. 

 

 

            

We  think  that  was  a  step  in  the  right 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

direction,  but  we  think  that  they  made  two  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistakes  when  they  did  that.  The  first  one  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  that  they  said  that  in  a  case  where  you  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subjective  intent,  that,  in  and  of  itself,  is  not  enough 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  establish  a  case  for  enhanced  damages.  Essentially 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  you  have  to  prove  recklessness  under  an  objective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  in  each  and  every  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  don't  think  that's  consistent  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history  of  the  statute,  with  the  purpose  of  the  statute, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  the  way  punitive  damages  have  ­­ have  always  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered,  with  the  way  willfulness  has  always  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreted.  So  we  think  that's  wrong. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The  second  mistake  we  think  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  Circuit  made  is  with  respect  to  how  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recklessness  inquiry  is  supposed  to  happen.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

recklessness,  everyone  agrees,  is  an  objective  inquiry. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  in  every  other  area  of  law  where  courts  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conducting  an  objective  inquiry,  what  you  ­­ what  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposed  to  do  is  you're  supposed  to  take  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

man,  and  you  put  him  in  the  ­­ the  actual  person  who  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accused  of  wrongdoing,  in  his  shoes.  And  you  take  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  actual  person  knew,  and  you  figure  out  whether  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  man  in  that  person's  shoes  would  have  thought

that  there  was  a  very  high  risk  that  the  conduct  at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  was  unlawful. 

 

 

            

And  what  the  Federal  Circuit  does  is  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  What  they  are  essentially  doing  is  taking  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  man  and  giving  him  the  benefit  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

omniscience,  giving  him  the  benefit  of  hindsight  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  what  facts  do  we  know  at  the  time  of  trial?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now  that  we  know  these  facts  at  the  time  of  trial, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  we  retroactively  sort  of  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  didn't  think  they  were 

    

 

 

 

 

doing  that.  I  thought  what  they  were  doing  was  saying, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  are  not  going  to  allow  punitive  damages  in  a  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  patent  is  so  weak.  And  so  we're  really  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  at  state  of  mind. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  reason  that  we're  doing  that  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  I  said  previously.  And  the  reason  that  we're  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

leaving  it  up  to  475  trial  judges  is  because  those  475 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial  judges  don't  see  patent  cases  very  much.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  they  have  a  pretty  good  idea  of  how  employment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law,  tort  law,  and  all  kinds  of  other  law  works,  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  have  that,  a  good  idea  in  respect  to  patent  law. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  we,  the  Federal  Circuit,  do.  That's  why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  are  created.  And  we  are  afraid  that  if  we  do  not  use 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  objective  standard,  what  we  will  see  is  a  major 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  discouraging  invention  because  of  fear  that  if  we

can't  afford  $100,000  for  an  opinion. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  I've  just  repeated  the  same  argument. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  we  did  create  the  government,  that  expert  court  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  such  determinations  in  the  face  of  language  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  to  allow  it,  and  so  what  is  wrong  with  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing  what  they  were  paid  to  do? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  think  there  are  ­­ there 

    

 

 

 

 

 

are  a  couple  things  that  are  wrong  with  ­­ with  that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  I  think  the  first  thing  that  they're  paid  to  do 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  to  look  to  the  text  and  history  of  the  statute.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  text  is  ­­ as  you  said,  doesn't  provide  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categorical  ­­ is  silent.  It  doesn't  provide  the  kind 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  categorical  bar  that  the  Federal  Circuit  is  asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for. 

            

And  the  history  of  the  statute  affirmatively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undermines  that  categorical  bar  because  the  history 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  clear  that  subjective  bad  intent,  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanton  and  malicious  pirate  that  this  Court  talked  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Seymour  case,  that  is  a  sufficient  basis  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enhance  damages. 

 

            

With  respect  to  the  recklessness  standard, 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  ­­ that  recklessness  is  objective,  we  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agree  with  that.  But  there's  no  reason  to  conduct  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objective  analysis  in  a  different  way  in  this  context

we  share,  which  is  that  we  think  it's  important  in  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  a  patent  is  of  questionable  validity.  We  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's  important  to  encourage  people  in  certain  cases  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  the  patent  or  to  make  sure  that  innovation  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  being  stifled.  And  we  think  that  the  ordinary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  test  for  recklessness  in  our  test  accommodates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  concern  because  it  would  treat  a  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

good­faith  belief  that  a  patent  is  invalid  or  that

MR.  MARTINEZ:  I  think  there's  some  minor 

    

 

 

 

 

differences.  Let  me  explain  how  we  see  our  standard  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe  what  the  differences  are. 

 

 

 

 

            

We  think  our  standard  covers  three  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

buckets  of  cases.  The  first  bucket  ­­ and  this  is  borne 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  by  the  history  ­­ the  first  bucket  are  cases  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  there's  intentional  conduct  or  bad­faith  conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  a  subjective  standard,  a  subjective  analysis. 

   

   

 

 

That's  bucket  number  one.  But  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Just  a  ­­ for  one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

just  brief  moment.  By  "intentional,"  you  mean 

  

 

 

 

 

 

intentional  infringement,  not  intentional  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  No.  Intentional  conduct  by  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

person  who  believes  that  he  is  infringing  a  valid 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Okay. 

  

 

 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  In  other  words,  if  you  have  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good­faith  belief  that  the  patent  is  not  valid  and  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

belief's  reasonable,  we  don't  think  you're  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intentional  infringer. 

 

            

The  ­­ the  second  bucket  covers  recklessness

cases.  And  we  all  agree  that  recklessness  is  judged  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  objective  standard.  Where  we  disagree  with  the  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side  is  we  think  it's  judged  based  on  the  facts  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  that  are  known  to  the  actual  infringer  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  time  of  infringement. 

 

 

 

            

And  then  the  third  bucket  that  we  think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ would  qualify  for  enhanced  damages  are  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving  other  types  of  egregious  misconduct  not  having 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  with  the  infringement  itself.  For  example,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  corporate  espionage,  if  one  of  the  parties 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

destroyed  evidence. 

 

              

I  think  the  difference  between  us  and 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  is  very  minor.  I  think  they  would  also  allow 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enhanced  damages  for  certain  purely  compensatory 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes,  even  when  a  case  did  not  fall  into  the  other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three  buckets. 

 

            

We  ­­ we  can  have  a  ­­ a  interesting 

   

   

 

 

 

 

historical  discussion  about  whether  or  not  that  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  for  damages  is  warranted  or  not.  I  don't  think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  needs  to  resolve  that  in  this  case,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  not  presented.  But  we  do  think  our  test  is  limited 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  those  three  buckets:  Essentially,  intentional 

  

 

 

 

 

conduct,  reckless  conduct,  and  other  types  of  egregious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation  misconduct.

MR.  MARTINEZ:  There's  a  sort  of  semantic 

   

  

 

 

 

element  to  this  case.  I  think  if  you  wanted  to  use 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ those  three  buckets  to  encompass  willfulness,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  we  wouldn't  stand  in  the  way  of  that.  I  think  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  that  we  see  with  what  the  Respondents  are  trying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  is  that  they're  looking  to  the  history,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pre­1952  cases,  and  they're  taking  the  word  "willful" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  of  that.  They're  plucking  that  word  out,  and  then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  defining  it  in  a  way  that's  at  odds  with  the  way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  which  willfulness  or  the  way  in  which  the  standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  applied  before  1952. 

 

 

 

            

We  think  if  ­­ if  history  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justification  for  imposing  a  willfulness  requirement  in 

   

 

 

 

 

the  first  place,  history  has  to  provide  the  guide  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting  what  willfulness  means  or  what  the  standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is.

of  the  Respondents'  position  is  that  they  agree  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  statute  is  ­­ Section  284  is  trying  to  get  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

culpable  infringers.  It's  ­­ the  touchstone  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

culpability. 

            

And  they  agree  that  recklessness  is  culpable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough  to  get  you  into  enhanced  damages  world.  And  yet, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everyone  agrees,  everyone  in  the  civil  law  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal  law,  intentional  misconduct  has  always  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered  worse  than  reckless  conduct.  And  yet,  their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  would  allow  a  class  of  intentional  infringers  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially  get  out  of  jail  free  based  on  their  ability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  hire  a  lawyer  and  come  up  with  a  ­­ a  post  hoc

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why  isn't  that  post  hoc

scours  the  world,  and  they  find  the  library  in  Germany

arguably  anticipated  the  invention  at  issue.  So  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  new  fact.  It  wasn't  in  anyone's  head.  No  one  was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aware  of  it  at  the  time  the  infringement  occurred. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  maybe  that  law  firm  then  puts  together  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  but  wrong  theory  under  which  the  patent  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalid  in  light  of  that  prior  art.  We  think  that's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  in  which  the  ­­ the  conduct  was  culpable  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  of  ­­ of  infringement,  and  we  think  that's  a  case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  warrant  enhanced  damages. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Justice  Kagan,  did 

  

 

 

 

 

you  have  a  question? 

   

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Can  I  ask:  If  you  were 

   

  

  

 

 

 

doing  this  just  on  policy  ­­ very  odd,  but  you  know,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  text  that  everybody's  off  of  at  this  point. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  ­­ and  maybe  some  viewed  that  what  happened  in  1952, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  some  of  the  reasons  that  Justice  Breyer  gave,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps  not  the  most  relevant  thing.  If  you  were  doing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  just  on  policy,  would  you  come  up  with  this  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test? 

            

MR.  MARTINEZ:  Yes.  We  would,  and  the  PTO 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

would.  We  think  that  the  ­­ the  policy  concern  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  had  in  mind  of  ensuring  deterrents  and

that  have  been  raised  by  Justice  Breyer  and  others.

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  CARTER  G.  PHILLIPS 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  may  it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Before  I  get  into  the  substance  of  my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

argument,  one  point  that  seems  to  me  to  cry  out,  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least  in  response  to  the  characterizations  by  my  ­­ from

as  copying  the  invention  in  this  case,  what  ­­ what  the

years  of  that  initial  copying.

this  involves  purely  copying,  beginning  from  the  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outset  of  the  process. 

 

 

 

            

That's  not  to  say  that  there  couldn't  be  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  somewhere  along  the  line  that  they  ­­ that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  ­­ there  might  have  been  an  argument  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

willfulness.  But  this  is  not  a  classic  copying  case.  I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  in  a  lot  of  ways  this  case  comes  down  to  sort  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trolls  versus  pirates  in  terms  of  how  you  want  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analyze  it.  And  our  view  is  ­­ and  ­­ and  I  thought  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example  that  the  Solicitor  General's  office  just  offered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  tells  you  everything  you  should  know  about  this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

His  ­­ his  criticism  is  that  a  good  lawyer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  hired  and  goes  off  and  searches  in  the  German 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

libraries  and  finds  some  basis  upon  which  to  challenge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legitimately  the  validity  of  that  patent. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  it  had  turned  out  that  in  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

German  sources  they  had,  in  fact,  demonstrated  that  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent  was  invalid,  the  position  of  the  world  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  great,  because  this  patent  should  be  declared 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invalid  and  the  monopoly  that  attaches  to  it  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

declared  null  and  void  and  unenforceable. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  fact  that  they  found  it  and  it  turns  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  to  get  you  over  the  hump  shouldn't  be,  by  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stretch  of  the  imagination,  lead  to  a  ­­ to  a  standard

And  Justice  Breyer,  I  mean,  that  goes  to  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

core  point  that  you  were  making.  We're  not  talking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  a  situation  here  where  it's  obvious  when  something 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  infringed.  There  are  thousands  of  patents,  hundreds 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  thousands  of  patents.  There  are  lots  of  entities 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creating  new  products  every  day,  new  services,  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  go  beyond  the  products  and  the  patent  law,

JUSTICE  BREYER:  My  empirical  information  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

I  mean  my  empirical  information  ­­ ha,  ha,  ha,  laughs

The  ­­ the  ­­ I  have  ­­ I  have  assumed,  and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  there  stuff  that  I  could  look  at  to  back  this  up  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  in  a  world  of  patent  and  copyright  protection,  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  unfortunate  that  Congress  hasn't  passed  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

special  regime  for  those  kinds  of  patents,  but  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't. 

            

In  that  such  ­­ in  that  a  world  like  that, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  seeing  more  and  more  companies  that  have  more  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more,  and  continuously  more  patents.  And  if  all  that

happens  is  you  send  a  letter  to  somebody  who  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that's  trying  to  break  into  the  industry,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  don't  have  enough  money  to  hire  many  lawyers,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

becomes  a  serious  barrier,  and  that  the  government's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

rule  in  your  view,  and  the  opponent's  rule  in  your  view, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  raise  those  barriers  to  entry. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  that's  a  very  elementary  kind  of 

   

 

 

 

 

assumption.  And  I  do  admit  it's  supported  by  the  briefs 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  your  side. 

 

 

            

And  is  there  anything  you  would  refer  me  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  suggest  that  maybe  I  have  a  point,  and  your 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs  have  a  point? 

   

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Well,  the  ­­ the  briefs  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  thought  were  particularly  effective,  Justice  Breyer, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  the  amicus  brief  of  public  knowledge  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Of  course.  I've  looked 

  

  

 

 

 

through  them,  and  I  understand  they're  effective.  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

just  feel  a  little  bit  more  comfortable  when  I  can  read 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  that  isn't  participating  in  the  litigation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it,  too,  bears  out  this  view. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Well,  Professor  Lumley  has 

  

 

 

 

 

written  on  the  subject  repeatedly,  and  he  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Lumley  has  also  said  quite 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  lot  that  he's  worried  about  lawyers  coming  in  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inventing  various  things  that  make  the  patent  look  weak

on  this. 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right.  But  ­­

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  He  is  not  totally  with  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  PHILLIPS:  But  there  are  ­­ but  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  two  separate  issues  here.  Let's  ­­ so,  and  I'll 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  those  in  turn. 

 

 

 

            

 

 

The  first  one  is,  is  there  empirical 

 

 

 

 

evidence  that  there  is  a  significant  amount  of  activity 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

out  there  in  which  patents  are  asserted  in  ­­ in  more  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less  specific  ways.  You'll  recall  the  example  given 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  ­­ by  my  friend  was  you  receive  a  letter  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identifies  the  precise  claims,  identifies  exactly  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  infringe  it,  and  it's  ignored.  Well,  I  can  assure 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you,  that  is  not  the  standard  letter,  and  that's  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind  of  letters  that  are  involved  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  letter  we  got  said,  we  have  patents, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  you  like  to  ­­ would  you  like  to  pay  a  royalty  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  patents.  It  didn't  identify  the  claims.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  tell  us  anything  about  them.  We  handed  them  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  engineer.  The  engineer  looked  at  them  and  said,  "It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looks  the  same  as  the  product  we're  already  producing." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Put  it  aside.  We  went  forward  with  it,  and  we  find  out

compromising  this  in  this  way?  To  say  to  the  circuit, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  see  your  point.  Okay?  And  by  and  large,  we  accept 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  but  there  can  be  very  big  companies  that  make  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

habit  of  getting  those  letters  and  giving  the  things  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engineers,  as  we  saw  right  now  in  this  case.  And  where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  like  that  goes  on  normally,  then  a  refusal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

deliberately  to  do  it  for  fear  it  comes  back  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong  answer.  Or  you  do  do  it  and  you  get  the  wrong 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer  and  you  go  ahead  anyway. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That  may  be  worth  willful  damages  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though,  in  fact,  there  was  a  slight  flaw  with  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent. 

            

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Justice  Breyer  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  about  that?  Giving 

  

  

 

 

 

them  some  leeway  around  the  edges? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Justice  Breyer,  I  understand 

   

  

 

 

the  desire  to  always  be  in  a  position  where  you  can  sort 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  catch  that  one  party  that's  out  there,  and  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  real  issue  there  is  twofold.  One  is,  is  it  worth

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  your  other  point.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

were  just  about  to  make  a  second  point.  Do  ­­ do  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remember?  See,  for  one  thing  it's  easy  ­­ it  was  a  good 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  too.

protecting  innovation. 

 

            

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  there's  not  a  whole 

   

  

 

 

 

lot  of  worry  about  protecting  the  patent  owner.  I  can't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forget  that  historically  enhanced  damages  were 

 

 

 

 

 

automatic,  and  they  were  automatic  because  of  a  policy 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  that  owning  a  patent  entitled  you  to  not  have

people  infringe  willfully  or  not  willfully.  And  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

accept  that  at  some  point  there  was  a  different  judgment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  that  ­­ that  good­faith  infringers  should  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treated  differently  than  other  infringers,  willful 

 

 

 

 

 

infringers. 

            

But  I  don't  know  that  that  swung  things  so 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

far  the  other  way  that  it  can  only  be  that,  if  you  come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  with  something,  any  defense  whatsoever  in  the

go? 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Well,  let  ­­ let  me  at  least 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct  one  portion  of  the  statement  because  you  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ enough  to  put  forward  that  it's  not  frivolous. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ I  don't  think  that's  the  appropriate  standard. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Objective  reasonableness  is  the  requirement 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Federal  Circuit  has  looked  at,  and  I  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  more  than  simply  the  ability  to  satisfy  Rule  11. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  there  has  to  be  a  substantial  defense.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial  defenses  were  put  forward  in  both  of  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  Indeed  these  were,  in  both  instances,  close 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  So  I  would  hope  that  that's  where  the  Court 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  ­­ would  focus  its  attention. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  the  different 

  

 

 

 

court  called  it  differently  in  the  second  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right.  But  again,  I  think 

   

  

  

 

 

it's  important  to  look  at  the  ­­ the  way  the  court  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeals  analyzed  it.  And  the  reality  is  I  think  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  ­­ and  it's  the  reason  why  you  have  to  have  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experienced,  an  expert  court  of  appeals  looking  at  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issues  on  an  objective  ­­ on  the  ­­ on  the  basis  of  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objective  analysis  because  they  are  the  ones  who  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seen  these  kinds  of  claim­construction  issues,  have  seen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  kinds  of  infringement  issues.  They're  in  the  best 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position  to  be  able  to  say,  this  is  objectively

reasonable  and,  therefore,  not  something  on  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enhanced  damages  should  be  added. 

 

 

 

 

            

What  I  think  it's  important  to  put  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

context,  because  you're  going  through  the  history  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this,  is  to  ­­ is,  again,  to  look  at  the  difference 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  Section  284  as  it  evolved  and  the  ­­ and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning  of  Section  285. 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  this  Court  last  term  said 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  285  has  now  ­­ has  now  ­­ it's  not  essential  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effective.  It  has  completely  made  the  enhanced  damages 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

purely  punitive  because  every  other  piece  of  conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes  into  the  portion  that  talks  about  whether  you  get

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  you  are  ­­

dealing  with  statutory  language.  And  I'm  not  sure  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  quoted  yet.  It  says,  "The  Court  may  increase  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages  up  to  three  times  the  amount  found  or  assessed." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Period. 

            

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  And  yet  the  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit  standard,  you've  got  ­­ you  know,  you've  got

heightened  burdens  of  proof,  particularly  articulated. 

 

 

 

 

 

I  mean,  the  way  we  ­­ the  ­­ courts  have  been  used  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealing  with  discretionary  standards  for  a  long  time. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

And  the  way  it  works  is,  historically,  you  know,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise  of  discretion  in  a  lot  of  cases  that,  you  know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wears  a  channel  which  kind  of  confines  the  exercise  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion.  And  I  think  the  other  side's  argument  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

based  on  that  history. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right.  And  ­­

  

  

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Over  time,  this  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what  discretion  has  ­­ has  given  us  in  this  area,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore,  you  get  beyond  that,  it's  an  abuse.  But  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

erect  this  fairly  elaborate  standard  on  the  basis  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  language  I  think  is  surprising. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  I  ­­ I  ­­ I  understand  that, 

    

   

   

 

 

and  that's  why  I  think  you  have  to  take  it  one  step  at  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time. 

            

First  of  all,  you  ­­ you  quoted  one  portion 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  language  of  ­­ of  284.  The  portion  that  I  focus 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  particularly  is  the  ­­ you  begin  with  damages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adequate  to  compensate  for  the  infringement.  So  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

284  is  now  ­­ and,  you  know,  since  1952,  has  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focused  exclusively  on  the  infringement.  It's  not  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  kind  of  ancillary  conduct.  It's  only  enhanced 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages  for  the  infringement  because  those  are  the

only  ­­ you  know,  that  ­­ those  damages  are  one  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same. 

            

Then  you  get  to  the  point  where  Seagate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  if  we  don't  have  a  strong  enough  standard  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recklessness  and  willfulness  and  an  objective  standard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  can  be  examined  by  us  independently,  the  downside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risks  and  the  harm  to  the  economy  is  ­­ is  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial.  There  have  been  ­­ there  are  huge  numbers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  these  letters  being  sent,  litigation.  It  skews  every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspect  of  it. 

 

 

            

And  then  Congress  comes  back  in  the  America 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Invents  Act,  and  through  the  process  leading  up  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

America  Invents  Act,  Seagate  comes  into  being,  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  ­­ and  the  Federal  Circuit  takes  a  very  hard 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at  it. 

 

 

            

Congress  looks  at  that  and  says,  we're  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  change  Section  284  because,  in  light  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Seagate,  that  willfulness  standard,  which  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard  the  Court  was  very  explicit  about,  that  helped 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solve  the  problem  that  all  of  us  had  been  concerned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about. 

            

The  Congress  didn't  just  leave  it  at  ­­ at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  you  have  to  infer  this  from  silence  or  inaction  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress.  Congress  passed  the  Section  298.  And  in 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Section  298  it  talks  about  opinions  of  counsel  and  what

role  they  play  in  the  willfulness  determination. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  seems  to  me,  in  order  to  give  Section  298 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  significant  meaning,  you  have  to  have  concluded, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then,  that  284  necessarily  incorporates  a  standard  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

willfulness  even  though,  obviously,  it's  not  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language,  but  that's  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  I  don't  know  how  far 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that  gets  you,  Mr.  Phillips,  because  Mr.  Martinez  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

told  us  that  he'd  be  happy  to  call  willfulness  his  test. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  willfulness  has  meant  different  things 

 

 

 

 

 

to  different  people  here. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  there's  nothing  that 

  

 

 

 

 

Congress  did  that  suggests  that,  when  it  used  that  word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"willfulness,"  it  really  meant  the  Seagate  test. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Well,  the  only  test  in  front 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  it  at  the  point  ­­ at  that  point  in  time  was  Seagate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  Seagate  was  the  definition  of  what  284  was  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  what  the  standard  of  willfulness  was  about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  think  what's  equally  important, 

   

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan,  is  ­­ I'll  ­­ I'll  concede  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

willfulness  can  have  a  lot  of  different  meanings,  but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  meaning  that  the  Seagate  court  adopted  was  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  the  meaning  this  Court  adopted  in  Safeco.  And  it's

But  ­­ and  this  is  why  it's  not  such  a  big 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jump,  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  because  what  ­­ what  Seagate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  is  what's  ­­ what's  the  best  source  for  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  up  with  a  sensible  way  of  applying  willfulness? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  ­­ and  they  looked  at  Safeco,  and  they  said,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  the  ­­ the  best  way  to  do  it  is  with  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recklessness  standard.  That's  an  objective 

  

 

 

 

determination.  And  the  fact  that  there  may  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

subjective,  bad  ­­ bad  intent  is  off  the  table.  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  footnote  20  of  the  Safeco  opinion,  and  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Can  we  ­­ can  we  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  ­­ that's  the  best  way  to

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Can  we  at  least  peel  off

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Well,  the  ­­ the  clear  and

particularly  relevant  to  the  ­­ how  this  case  got 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided.  Because  at  the  end  of  the  day,  it's  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it  was  clear  and  convincing.  At  the  end  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day,  it  was  because  there  was  objectively  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defenses  that  were  put  forward  in  both  of  these  cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  a  proper  case,  obviously  you  ­­ you'd 

   

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  fight  that  fight.  The  only  thing  I  can  say  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well,  that's  not  the  only  thing.  There's  two  things  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  say  in  defense  of  clear  and  convincing.  First,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  in  existence  in  1985.  Congress  passed  The  America 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Invents  Act,  didn't  modify  it,  and  so  may  have,  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense,  either  acquiesced  or  ratified  it  under  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances. 

            

And  second,  we're  talking  about  punitive 

 

 

 

 

 

damages.  And  therefore,  under  normal  circumstances, 

  

 

 

 

 

it's  certainly  not  a  matter  of  indifference  when  you're

talking  about  allowing  a  plaintiff  to  go  forward  and  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  just  skew  completely  the  entire  litigation  process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  consequence  of  having  access  to  treble  damages.  In 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  context,  some  heightened  standard  might  make  sense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  this  context,  it's  hard  for  me  to  get  excited  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  one  way  or  the  other,  because  these  are  not  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factual  questions.  If  you  were  in  a  subjective  intent 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

standard,  that  would  be  a  different  issue. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

In  the  context  of  objective  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  But  you  can't  have  abuse 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of  discretion. 

 

            

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  I'm  sorry?

de  novo  review  in  the  Federal  Circuit  rather  than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testing  the  district  court's  determination  for  abuse  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion. 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Yes,  Justice  Ginsburg.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

think  it  is  critical  ­­ there  are  two  elements  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  are  absolutely  critical.  And  I  suppose,  in  some 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

ways,  it  goes  to  the  question  you  asked, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Sotomayor.  What  are  you  ­­ what  are  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolute  critical  elements  that  you  need  to  take  out  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Seagate  to  apply  in  these  cases?  And  candidly,  both

One,  you  need  to  have  an  objective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assessment  of  whether  or  not  there  is  a  reasonably 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

objective  set  of  circumstances  that  allow  the  defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  say  this  ­­ either  these  patents  are  invalid,  or  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  not  infringe  those  patents. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  two,  you  have  to  have  that  reviewed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nondeferentially  by  the  Federal  Circuit  in  order  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ensure  that  the  500  or  400  ­­ I  forget  how  many  district 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  judges  there  are  ­­ do  not  sort  of  go  off  on  a

the  objective  and  expert  body  that  the  Federal  Circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  The  recklessness  decision 

  

 

 

 

here  seems  different  from  those  that  generally  come  up. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  maybe  you  can  provide  an  example  where  this  occurs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outside  of  this  context. 

 

 

 

            

Usually,  to  determine  whether  someone  was 

 

 

 

 

 

reckless,  you  have  to  assess  the  ­­ the  nature  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

risk,  the  severity  of  the  risk.  And  in  the  typical  tort 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  the  severity  of  the  risk  may  seem  greater  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  of  trial  than  it  did  at  the  time  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tortfeasor's  action,  because  someone  has  been  harmed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  in  this  situation,  the  ­­ the  degree  of  the  risk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  smaller  at  the  time  of  the  determination  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enhanced  damages  than  it  may  have  been  at  the  time  of  ­­

of  the  infringement.  And  I  can't  think  of  another  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  it's  a  legal  risk.  And  the  first  determination

recklessness  determination  has  those  characteristics? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Well,  I  think  ­­ I  think  the 

   

   

  

 

 

 

copyright  would  probably  be  the  other  one  that  sort  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attends  to  it  in  the  same  way,  because  it's  essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  kind  of  an  inquiry.  I  mean,  part  of  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem  is  it's  the  nature  of  the  continuing  tort 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action,  and  it's  also  the  fact  that  the  infringement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  is  ­­ is  a  matter  of  strict  liability. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  ­­ but,  you  know,  there  are  a  thousand  obviously 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  ways  of  ­­ different  situations  that  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arise. 

            

But,  you  know,  if  you're  in  a  situation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

where  you've  ­­ you've  come  out  with  a  product,  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  a  perfectly  good  product.  You  may  or  may  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  looking  at  patents.  You  didn't  see  anything 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  creates  a  problem  for  it.  You  ­­ you  put  the  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  put  it  in  the  market.  Two,  three  years  later 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody  sends  you  a  letter.  And  then  ­­ and  the  letter 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  very  specific.  Maybe  ­­ and  then  ­­ so  you  say,

JUSTICE  BREYER:  How  does  it  work  in  tort 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Well,  in  tort  law  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I  mean,  you  can  imagine 

    

 

 

 

 

situations  where  when  the  actor  takes  a  risk,  it  looks 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tremendously  great.  But  by  the  time  trial  is  over,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  pretty  small.  It  happened,  but,  you  know,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eggshell  skull.  He  thought  almost  certainly  he  had  one. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  he  did,  but  the  chances  of  his  having  one  were  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

million  to  one  against  it.  Punitives,  how  does  the

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Well,  you  take  ­­ I  mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

obviously,  you  take  the  ­­ the  plaintiff  as  you  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yeah.  But  it  turns  out  as 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  found  it,  it  wasn't  very  bad.  And  what  you  thought 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  were  going  to  find,  then,  was  just  terrible.  This

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right,  but  I  ­­ my  guess  is

MR.  PHILLIPS:  There  are  not,  because  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  There  are  not. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  PHILLIPS:  ­­ normally  act  reasonably 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  then  we  would  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ an  analogy  on  your  side,  because  the  other  way,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  an  analogy  on  the  other  side. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Well,  let  my  friend  on  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  side  come  forward  with  tort  cases  in  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eggshell  plaintiff  gets  punitive  damages  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  overreacted. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  there  any  way  to  allow 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  consideration  for  a  subjective  intent  to  infringe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in  an  egregious  case,  as  an  additional  element  for  ­­ as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  additional  way  to  define  willfulness  without

MR.  PHILLIPS:  I  ­­ I  think  if  you  ­­ if  you 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  in  a  situation  where  you're  past  recklessness,  that

that's  where  the  discretion  lies  in  this  report. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No.  But  take  a  case 

   

  

  

 

 

where  ­­ take  a  case  where  there's  somebody  who

Mr.  Jones  ­­

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Copy  a  product  or  copy  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

patent? 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  A  patented  product. 

    

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Okay. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  All  right?  So  same  thing, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

let's  call  it. 

 

 

            

Mr.  Jones  sells  a  product  that  involves  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

patent,  and  it's  selling  very  well.  And  Mr.  Smith  comes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

along  and  says  I  want  to  copy  that  patent  and  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

product  and  sell  the  same  thing  so  that  I  can  reap  those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profits  too,  and  ­­ and  does  that.

his  lawyer  can  come  along  at  the  end  and  raise  some  kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  doubt  about  the  patent's  validity,  the  fact  that  ­­ I

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Well,  one  of  them. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  The  fact  that  he  went  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  I  am  going  to  copy  this  patent  so  that  I  can  reap 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  benefits  of  some  other  person's  work,  that  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make  a  difference.  And  that's,  I  think,  the  question 

   

   

  

 

 

 

that  Justice  Kennedy  was  asking.  It  seems  to  stick  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  craw  a  bit. 

   

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right.  Well,  one  answer  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy  is  there  is  a  role  for  that  kind  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subjective  bad  faith,  but  it's  only  after  you  make  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

determination  that  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Right.  But  that's  not 

  

  

 

 

 

enough.  Because,  you  know,  if  I'm  Mr.  Jones  and  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  is  it  worth  my  while  to  go  copy  this  patent,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think,  you  know  what?  A  lot  of  patents  are  not  valid. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll  take  this  risk.  I  will  ­­ I  will  make  a  lot  of 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

money  selling  this  patented  product,  and  if  somebody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

calls  me  on  it,  I'll  go  hire  myself  a  lawyer,  and  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer  will  come  up  with  some  kind  of  argument  about  why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  patent  is  not  valid  after  all.

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  That  seems  like  it's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

bad  ­­ that  seems  like  a  bad  incentive. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right.  Justice  Kagan,  the  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

two  basic  points  I  would  make  to  that.  First  of  all, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ I  don't  remember  if  it's  Mr.  Jones  or  Mr.  Smith, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  the  bad  actor,  we'll  call  it  ­­ the  bad  actor  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  circumstance  obviously  has  to  pay  the  full 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

compensation  for  the  infringement,  which  is  in  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instances,  tens  of  millions  of  dollars,  will  almost 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly  be  subject  to  attorneys'  fees  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  285.  So  it's  not  as  though  you're  getting  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pass  under  that  ­­ in  that  situation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  I  understand  the  desire  to  ­­ to  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

enhanced  damages  against  that  particular  bad  actor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  why  I  say  in  a  lot  of  ways,  this  case  comes  down 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  what  do  you  worry  about  more,  pirates  or  trolls?  My 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assessment  of  this,  and  I  think  it's  borne  out  by  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  the  Federal  Circuit  has  looked  at  this  problem,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  are  not  that  ­­ there  are  not  very  many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pirates  out  there.  And  if  you  keep  a  rule  that  is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

designed  simply  to  get  the  one  in  a  million  pirates  ­­ I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  call  them  unicorns  ­­ but  one  in  a  million 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pirates,  you'd  end  up  with  a  rule  that  will  allow  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trolls  to  go  after  every  legitimate  producer  of  products

you'd  have  to  pay  to  get  at  the  ­­ at  the  really  bad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actor. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  See,  the  question  ­­ I  know 

   

  

 

 

 

 

this  is  not  exactly  a  question  that  we've  seen  in  your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs,  but  we  see  countering  in  your  brief,  is  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  company.  And  the  company  made,  I  think,  cotton 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

goods.  And  an  individual  thought  that  he  could  make  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lot  of  money  by  taking  those  cotton  goods  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

machinery  that  they  were  used  and  selling  it  all  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States.  And  so  he  did  it.  I  think  it  was 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alexander  Hamilton. 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  not  sure.  And  as  a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

result,  New  England  grew  rich. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  supposed  he'd  gotten  a  letter  one  day 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  said,  we  have  a  patent.  We  have  a  patent.  And  it 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  cost  him  $10  million  to  look  into  it,  and  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  have  all  the  money  so  he  thought  he'd  run  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chances.  Suddenly  I'm  not  so  sure  which  way  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equities  would  work  out.  That's  your  point.  Both  of 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  have  a  point. 

   

 

            

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  that's  why  I'm  looking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for  is  there  some  way  we  can  get  the  real  worst  ones

and  yet,  where  he's  really  worried  about  the  real  worst 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ones? 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  And  I  think  the  answer,  at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  end  of  the  day,  is  Congress  made  the  choice,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  They  just  used  the  word 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"willful."  I'm  not  ­­

  

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  No,  no.  But  it  did  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

against  the  backdrop  of  the  ­­ of  the  Seagate  standard. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because  Seagate  clearly  made  a  judgment  that  as  between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  raft  of  claims  by  nonpracticing  entities  arising  out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  a  raft  of  letters  and  everything  that  goes  with  that, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  that  and  the  risk  of  a  true  pirate  out  there, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  ­­ that  it  thought  the  better  answer

think  ­­ and  a  lot  of  the  arguments  we've  heard  today 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  the  sort  of  arguments  that  can  be  made  to  the

or,  you  know,  trolls,  and  it  is  a  serious  one  or  it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less  serious  one.  And  you  have  these  standards  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply,  and  ­­ and  the  district  court  will  exercise  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion. 

            

And  if  it's  out  of  the  channel  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discretion,  then  the  Court  can  review  it  on  that  basis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  PHILLIPS:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

the  problem  with  that  is  ­­ is  that  it  ­­ unless  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  up  with  ­­ I  mean,  I  ­­ you  know,  recklessness  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  ­­ or  egregiousness  ­­ I  don't  know  what 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

"egregiousness"  means,  and  I  don't  know  how  you  ­­ how 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  evaluate  that  on  review. 

 

 

 

 

              

I  do  know  what  it  means  to  ­­ to  take  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objectively  reasonable  position.  More  than  simply 

  

 

 

 

 

something  that's  beyond  frivolous,  it  is  a  substantial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  either  the  patent  doesn't  extend  to  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  particular  product  or  the  patent  itself  is  invalid. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  circumstances  where  ­­ where  that  is  true,  my  hope 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  that  the  Court,  recognizing  the  extraordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

importance  of  limiting  patents  and  the  monopolies  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flow  from  there,  would  drive  the  legal  decision  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context  ­­ of  the  legal  standard  in  this  context  exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  ­­ where  the  Court  adopted  it  in  Seagate. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's  the  court  that  has  the  experience  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expertise,  and  I  would  hope  under  these  circumstances,

in  this  very  unusual  situation,  because  patent  law  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  context  I  do  think  is  very  different  than  almost 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  other  tort  context,  I  would  hope  in  the  one  ­­ in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ in  the  decidedly  one­sided  approach  that  284  is, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  it  only  gives  to  the  plaintiffs  the  ability  to  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  they  can  do  and  what  they  want,  that  the  Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  adopt  the  kind  of  rigorous  objective  standard  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

allows  both  for  the  ­­ both  for  the  determination  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ that  the  patent  is  invalid  or  doesn't  infringe, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  that's  examined  on  an  objective  basis. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions,  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honors,  I  urge  the  Court  to  affirm. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,

Mr.  Wall,  you  have  four  minutes  remaining. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

          

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  JEFFREY  B.  WALL 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WALL:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  I  have  two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

fairly  simple  points. 

 

 

            

The  first  is,  as  we  and  the  PTO  and  many  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondents'  amici  recognize,  the  system  as  it  currently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stands  is  out  of  balance.  And  we  have  tried,  and  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe  we  have  succeeded,  in  crafting  an  approach  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balances  the  Court's  concerns  with  the  need  to  respect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  rights  of  patentees,  including  small  companies  like

And  we've  done  it  in  a  couple  of  different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Reasonable,  good­faith  efforts  to  ­­ to 

 

 

 

 

 

Halo. 

            

ways. 

            

challenge  patents  are  not  going  to  result  in  enhanced 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages.  And  intent  and  recklessness  are  not  going  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  and  should  not  be  easy  to  show. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  the  Federal  Circuit  hasn't  adopted  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary  approach  based  on  its  expertise.  It  thought  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  to  in  light  of  this  Court's  decision  in  Safeco, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  it  has  misread.  Safeco  says  if  you  adopt  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  view  of  the  law  at  the  time,  you're  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acting  willfully.  It  doesn't  say  if  you  subjectively 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  correctly  believe  that  you  are  violating  the  law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  are  held  not  to  be  willful  because  you  have  hired  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good  lawyer  and  come  up  with  a  defense  later. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that  approach  is  what  has  skewed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentives  in  the  patent  system  and  taken  us  out  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

balance. 

            

Our  approach  incentivizes  good,  commercially 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  behavior  under  the  full  set  of  circumstances 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  discretion  of  the  district  court.  Their  approach 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  incentivizing  good  litigation. 

 

 

 

            

And  the  second  point  I  just  want  to  make 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

quickly  is  we  do  have  the  evidentiary  burden  and

standard  of  review  in  this  case.  I  think  it's  clear 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  ­­ there  isn't  any  basis  for  the  clear  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convincing  standard.  On  the  standard  of  review,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Highmark  resolves  and  I  think  Pierce  v.  Underwood 

   

 

 

 

 

 

resolves  it. 

 

            

These  are  determinations  bound  up  with  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facts,  and  just  as  the  Court  said  in  Pierce,  whether  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigating  position  is  substantially  justified  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mixed  question  of  fact  and  law.  So  too  the  questions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  These  should  be  reviewed  for  abuse  of  discretion, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it's  very  important  for  the  Court  to  say  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Halo  should  go  back  to  the  district  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  be  analyzed  under  the  right  standard  so  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidentiary  burden  matters. 

 

 

            

In  Stryker  the  district  court  actually  got 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  discretionary  way,  did  it,  and  on  appeal,  Zimmer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  challenged  that  as  an  abuse  of  discretion.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  argued  about  the  objective  prong. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When  this  Court  takes  that  out  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis,  as  it  should,  there's  no  basis  to  disturb  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district  court's  discretionary  ruling.  As  the  Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

knows  from  looking  at  it,  it's  a  thorough  and  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion.  So  ­­

  

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  One  point  Mr.  Phillips 

  

 

 

 

 

brought  up  that  you  didn't  address  in  your  initial

argument,  maybe  you  could  say  a  word  about  it,  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  298  of  the  American  ­­ America  Invents  Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

Under  your  ­­ under  your  reading,  could 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  of  the  failure  to  obtain  or  introduce  advice  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  be  used  to  prove  that  the  defendant  infringed  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bad  faith? 

 

            

MR.  WALL:  No.  The  patentee  cannot  put  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

at  issue  affirmatively.  All  298  does  is  it  dealt  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  ­­ that  very  narrow  problem.  And  when  the  patentee 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes  in  and  wants  to  show  intent  or  recklessness,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  point  to  your  copying  of  the  patent.  It  can  point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  fact  that  it  gave  you  really  extensive,  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detailed  notice.  It  tried  to  license  with  you.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  do  anything.  It  cannot  put  at  issue  whether  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talked  to  counsel. 

 

 

            

            

Now,  the  defendant  maybe  ­­

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  How  do  you  get  to  that  point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  language  of  298? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  WALL:  Because  298  just  says  when  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

proving  of  willfulness,  whether  it's  a  factor  as  it  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  our  approach,  whether  it's  the  end­all,  be­all  as  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  in  their  approach,  whenever  the  patentee  is  trying  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove  that  up,  you  can't  affirmatively  put  that  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue. 

            

And  as  Pulse  candidly,  and  I  think  honestly,

concedes  in  its  brief,  you  can  read  298  to  have  effect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  either  side's  view  of  the  ­­ how  you  ought  to  treat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  enhancement  statute.  So  I  don't  think  298  cuts 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

either  way. 

 

            

And  I  would  just  stress  for  the  Court  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  at  the  time  looked  at  putting  "willfully"  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute,  and  it  looked  at  putting  something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

virtually  identical  to  Seagate  in  the  statute.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't  do  either  one,  so  I  don't  think  it  can  be  taken 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  ratified  the  Federal  Circuit's  current  approach. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

The  case  is  submitted.
