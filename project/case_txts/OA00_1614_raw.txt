CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 00-1614, the National Railroad Passenger


Corporation v. Abner Morgan.


Mr. Englert. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. ENGLERT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


25 years ago in United Air Lines v. Evans, this


Court observed that an employer was entitled to treat a


past act as lawful after respondent failed to file a


timely charge of discrimination.  In the Court's words --


and I quote -- a discriminatory act, which has not made


the basis for a timely charge, is the legal equivalent of


a discriminatory act which occurred before the statute was


passed.  The Court further referred to the alleged


discriminatory act outside the limitations period as


merely an unfortunate event in history which has no


present legal consequences. 


In the present case, Abner Morgan challenges as


discriminatory various acts that he did not make the basis


for an EEOC charge within 300 days.  Our contention is


that Amtrak was entitled to treat those past acts as

lawful after the passage of 300 days.  Those acts are


merely unfortunate events in history with no present legal


consequences. 


The Ninth Circuit saw things quite differently. 


According to the Ninth Circuit, all plaintiffs, completely


without regard to their own diligence, may base suit on


events they didn't make the basis of a timely charge, as


long as those events are sufficiently related to later


events that can also be characterized as discrimination.


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Englert, there are, I


assume even in your view, a few exceptions to this rule. 


When is it that you would look back?


MR. ENGLERT:  For certain diligent plaintiffs --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MR. ENGLERT:  -- who bring suit within 300 days


after their cause of action first accrues, we would look


back.  That obviously isn't this case. 


QUESTION:  And there's no other circumstance,


you think, where you would end up looking back beyond --


where the -- the full thrust of -- of what was going on


didn't become evident until the statute had passed as some


early -- on some earlier events? 


MR. ENGLERT:  We would allow plaintiffs, in


exactly the situation you described, Justice O'Connor, to


look back, the situation in which it was not fully evident

until within the 300-day period what was going on.  That


is the exception we're willing to concede.


QUESTION:  I don't understand how's that's an


exception.  I thought we were talking about the period


before the 300 days.  Is there any instance in which you


would allow a person to get recovery for something that


happened to him prior to 300 days before he filed?


MR. ENGLERT:  Yes, Justice Breyer.  If the --


QUESTION:  What is that? 


MR. ENGLERT:  -- if the events outside the 300-


day window were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to


rise to the level of being actionable, then we would


concede that the cause of action doesn't accrue until


they've become sufficiently severe or pervasive.


QUESTION:  What about the circumstance where


they're very much related to what did occur within the 300


days, but the person isn't certain?  I mean, later on the


judge says, yes, it was independently actionable, but I


could understand how a person at the time might think it


wasn't.  What about that one?


MR. ENGLERT:  Well, there may be close cases,


Justice Breyer, and --


QUESTION:  No, no.  But I want to know.  This --


that is the case.  A judge would say a reasonable person


would not have realized, though he would have been wrong,

that those outside-the-period events rose to the level of

case.


MR. ENGLERT:  We -- we would give away that


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MR. ENGLERT:  If a reasonable person would not


have known --


QUESTION:  Fine. 


QUESTION:  Would not have known his injury.  So


-- so you're saying the test under the act is not injury,


but knowledge of injury. 


MR. ENGLERT:  Well, Justice Scalia, that gets


into the debate, of course, this Court has had --


QUESTION:  I know it does.  You're -- you're


giving it away.  You're saying that under the act,


knowledge of injury is --


MR. ENGLERT:  No.  I -- I'm not trying to give


that away.  I'm trying not to take a position on that.  I


understood Justice Breyer's question to pertain to the


situation in which the judge says a reasonable person


would not have known, not this particular plaintiff


wouldn't have known, but a reasonable person would not


have known. 


QUESTION:  Oh, in practice, that's always an

exception to the knowledge of injury rule.  With due


diligence, he didn't know.  I mean, but -- but that --


you're willing to accept that. 


MR. ENGLERT:  That's why I'm not trying to give


away anything on injury versus injury discovery.


QUESTION:  With due diligence -- with due


diligence -- the person had due diligence but didn't know. 


So, it's a -- it's a knowledge -- it's a knowledge of


injury test. 


QUESTION:  Not a subjective knowledge of injury


but knowledge of injury that -- that would have occurred


to a reasonable person.


MR. ENGLERT:  Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice, and --


QUESTION:  All right.  If you're willing to give


that one away, what about a person who, though he might


have understood -- a reasonable person might have


understood that this would have been actionable, he's in


the middle of negotiations with his company there --


there, and it would have been foolish to go to the EEOC.


MR. ENGLERT:  That plaintiff loses.


QUESTION:  I mean, because after all, we're


trying to settle this thing right within the company.


MR. ENGLERT:  That plaintiff loses, Justice


Breyer.  That's quite clear.


QUESTION:  He loses.

 MR. ENGLERT:  That's quite clear under cases


like Robinson Meyers.


QUESTION:  And -- and why should he lose where


the other one doesn't? 


MR. ENGLERT:  Because this Court has said so. 


Cases like Robinson Meyers and Johnson v. --


QUESTION:  Are you talking about EEOC cases?


MR. ENGLERT:  Those -- those are title VII cases


in which -- Robinson Meyers was a case in which the


plaintiff exhausted union grievances and then filed the


EEOC charge, and the Court said, no, you should have filed


your EEOC charge within the statutory period. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Englert, I'm not aware that there


is a case -- perhaps I'm wrong about this -- quite like


this where there are a succession of similar acts, a


number of disciplines, a number of refusal to give


training opportunities, and the employee goes to the EEO


-- the in-house person, tries to settle it, tries not to


make a Federal case out of it.  And -- but the rule that


you would have us adopt would say if you're in doubt, sue


instead of saying, if you're in doubt -- each one of these


discrete instances that he was trying to work out, we


would have to have -- your rule would mean that this


person has to file 10 charges with the EEOC instead of


one.

 MR. ENGLERT:  Well, it's not when in doubt, sue,


Justice Ginsburg.  It is when in doubt, go to the EEOC,


and it's an important distinction because the purpose of


filing with the EEOC is to start a conciliatory process.


QUESTION:  But he's always -- he also has the


in-house.  He's got a conciliatory process going without


involving the Federal Government.  He's just dealing with


his employer.  His employer has an EEO counselor.  That he


did.  He didn't come to a Federal agency.  So, let's take


it that we're talking about the EEOC and not suing in


court. 


The EEOC -- one of its objections is you would


be breeding tremendous fragmentation here because on every


incident in a pattern, he'd have to file another EEOC


charge.  That much you are saying.


MR. ENGLERT:  That much I am saying, and that is


very consistent with the purposes of the title VII charge-


filing requirement, which is to cause plaintiffs to go


promptly to the EEOC, as this Court itself has said in a


number of its cases, and to get that process started


quickly. 


Now, there -- there could be rare cases, Justice


Ginsburg, in which equitable tolling would apply on the


facts that you've suggested.  This isn't one of them, and


I don't think there are many such cases.  But if one is in

the middle of some kind of negotiation and is being misled


into thinking that it's all going to work out and


therefore don't got to the EEOC, that person might have an


equitable tolling argument, although as this Court has


said, the virtue of equitable tolling is that it is so


rarely invoked --


QUESTION:  Well, I guess any statute of


limitations of any sort means you -- you have to sue 10


times instead of one time, doesn't it?


MR. ENGLERT:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  I mean, it's the nature of a statute


of limitations that when you're hurt, you have to sue. 


You can't wait till you're hurt the 10th time and then


say, well, you know, let's put it in one big package. 


I'll wait 10 years until I'm hurt -- hurt more often.


MR. ENGLERT:  Yes, Justice Scalia, and --


QUESTION:  Mr. Englert, I don't think that this


is in any case.  I think you have recognized that in the


so-called hostile atmosphere case, the first epithet, even


the second, it's -- it's uncertain when how much is enough


and when it's insufficient.  So, I think you recognize


that at least in that category of case, there would have


to be a succession of similar incidents.


MR. ENGLERT:  Yes.  That's part of the


definition of the very violation of title VII in hostile

environment cases. 


QUESTION:  In other words, you're -- you're


saying that there is no pervasive hostility, no pervasive


hostile environment until the acts are repeated, or is it


there is a pervasive hostile environment, but it's just


not discovered until the acts are repeated?  Which --


which of the two is it? 


MR. ENGLERT:  The case I'm willing to concede,


looking back beyond 300 days, is the case in which there


is no hostile environment until within the 300-day period. 


The fact that the hostile environment isn't discovered I


have not conceded.  That -- that case I have not conceded.


QUESTION:  Wait.  Now, you say there is no


hostile -- what are you conceding?  That that -- that that


evidence can be brought in, or that you can get damages


for those events? 


MR. ENGLERT:  I'm conceding that you can get


back pay or damages for those events as the Seventh


Circuit said in Galloway and as the First Circuit said in


Sabree. 


QUESTION:  Well, why if -- if you assert that


there hasn't been any offense when those events occurred? 


You say there's not yet a hostile environment.  Why should


you be able to get any damages for a period during which


there as not a hostile environment?

 MR. ENGLERT:  Well, the hypothetical example,


Justice Scalia, that I think makes the point is suppose


there is an epithet at the office Christmas party one


year.  Then there's an epithet at the office Christmas


party the next year.  Then there's an epithet at the


office Christmas party the third year, and the person has


to seek psychological counseling after each of those. 


It's not going to rise to the level, in all likelihood, of


a hostile environment after one epithet, but with


repetition, it can rise to the level of a hostile


environment. 


QUESTION:  Well, sure, but it doesn't make the


first one a hostile environment. 


MR. ENGLERT:  No, but the statute of


limitations, under standard accrual principles, didn't


begin to run until it became a hostile environment, and


we're suggesting --


QUESTION:  But if that's the case, you don't


have to concede anything because the hostile environment


doesn't occur, as you're analyzing it, until -- within the


300-day period. 


I thought what you meant was that you would


concede the -- the case -- you would concede the


application of continuing violation when the hostile


environment was not apparent enough to bring a lawsuit

until you get within the 300-day period -- yes, the -- the


limitation period. 


MR. ENGLERT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Okay.  But you're saying that -- I --


I thought, in answer to Justice Scalia, you were saying


there is no hostile environment prior to the third


incident, which is within the period.


MR. ENGLERT:  No, I --


QUESTION:  Maybe that isn't what you meant.


MR. ENGLERT:  I think --


QUESTION:  That's how I understood him.


MR. ENGLERT:  Justice Souter -- and I don't know


that I want to spend much more of my argument on


concessions, but --


(Laughter.) 


MR. ENGLERT:  -- I think the -- the point is


that the entire series of actions that constitute the


hostile environment are all part of the hostile


environment, but it may not --


QUESTION:  Okay.  Then the hostile environment


goes back beyond the 300-day period.  You're saying a


hostile environment began with the first epithet, but you


didn't have a -- a sufficiently obvious indication of it


until you got to epithet three. 


MR. ENGLERT:  In 20/20 hindsight, this is how

hostile environment cases work.  An epithet that was not a


hostile environment on day 1 may actually become part of a


hostile environment on day 300.


QUESTION:  Good.  Then change your answer to my


earlier question because I asked you whether there was a


hostile environment at the first incident -- incident, and


you said no, it -- there was not yet until the last


incident.  You're talking about a different situation


where there's been a hostile environment all along, but it


doesn't become apparent until the third incident, but


there really was one the first time the epithet was used. 


That's a different situation, and we got to know which one


of the two you -- you want us to allow. 


QUESTION:  And that was my -- and that was my


question.  And I want to know which one you think this


case is, and I also want to know can there be both kinds


of cases and we have to see which applies -- which


description applies in each instance. 


MR. ENGLERT:  Okay.  In -- in this case, Mr.


Morgan was complaining to members of Congress starting in


1991.  There is absolutely no doubt that he thought that


he was being discriminated against from long before the


statute of limitations ran. 


QUESTION:  Is this a hostile environment claim,


do you think?

 MR. ENGLERT:  Not primarily, but there is a


hostile environment claim in this case as the Ninth


Circuit saw it. 


QUESTION:  It is in the case.  Is it a pattern


and practice case? 


MR. ENGLERT:  No, Your Honor.  Pattern or


practice is a term in section 707 of the act, which


applies exclusively to governmental actions, and the Court


has used that phrase in certain class actions as well --


in private class actions, but this is not a class action


either. 


QUESTION:  But it could be a hostile environment


claim included here.


MR. ENGLERT:  The Ninth Circuit believed there


was, yes. 


But in any event, Mr. Morgan was -- was well


aware long before he filed his EEOC charge that he had a


-- a claim of discrimination.  I --


QUESTION:  May I ask you about a hypothetical


that's perhaps a little simpler to discuss?  Supposing the


company had a policy that was unwritten or secret or


something like that, we will not allow any woman into a


certain job category, no woman, no black into a certain


job category.  It's -- it's found out 3 years after the


policy was formally described and so forth.  And then a

person who repeatedly tried to get into that job category


over the entire 3-year period but was refused each time


because of the existence of a continuing policy, does that


person have any right to recover for anything happening


prior to the 300 days? 


MR. ENGLERT:  I think not, Justice Stevens, but


that raises two issues that are not in this case.  One is


fraudulent concealment, and the second is the issue of


injury versus injury discovery for statutes of


limitation --


QUESTION:  I'm assuming there's no discovery,


but I'm assuming --


MR. ENGLERT:  No. 


QUESTION:  -- if you can ever describe anything


as a continuing violation, I have described a continuing


discriminatory policy.  And if it's clear as a bell that


it's all one policy and it had a several -- manifested


itself in several different incidents, is it -- may a


plaintiff recover for something that happened prior to the


300-day filing?  That's my -- sort of the basic question


in this case it seems to me. 


MR. ENGLERT:  My short answer is no.


QUESTION:  Okay. 


MR. ENGLERT:  My longer answer is no unless this


Court resolves an issue that is not presented by this case

which is injury versus injury discovery in favor of an


injury discovery rule. 


QUESTION:  You're saying injury would not be


enough.


MR. ENGLERT:  That issue is not in this case,


but that is my -- I'm saying injury would be enough.


QUESTION:  Well, arguably it would be in this


case to the extent the hostile environment claim is a


continuing violation.  I don't know whether it is, but


arguably that's -- the hostile environment claim


conceivably could be a continuing policy also. 


MR. ENGLERT:  It could be, but the reason I'm


making a concession with regard to hostile environment


claims is not injury versus injury discovery.  The reason


I'm making a concession is because under standard


principles of accrual, the plaintiff may not sue until he


or she actually has a cause of action.  And because a


hostile environment claim can only develop over time, it


may be that not until the third, fourth, fifth epithet,


incident is -- is there anything for the plaintiff to sue


on.


QUESTION:  Well, my assumption is a case --


there was a violation all along, but the -- the charge was


not filed within 300 days of the commencement of a


continuing violation.  The question I have in the back of

my mind is, could there be recovery for the portion of the


continuing violation that was more than 300 days old?


MR. ENGLERT:  There -- no.  There can always be


recovery for the portion of the continuing violation


within the 300 days. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Englert, you have been deflected


from what I think is the strongest point on the other side


that said, that's all well and good, but Congress


understood you could go back way beyond the 300 days


because they put a 2-year cap on back pay.


MR. ENGLERT:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  So, that shows how, whatever you


might say, just looking at the words of the statute,


Congress understood that you have to shorten the period


and the period they picked was 2 years, much longer than


180 days or 300.


MR. ENGLERT:  And let me try very quickly to say


why that argument is not a good argument.  Congress did


worry that there was no time limit on title VII actions


and it put the 2 years in there.  But that's because of


the continuing effects doctrine, which this Court


repudiated in 1977, and that's because this Court hadn't


clearly said the title VII statute of limitations is


section 706(e) until 1982 in Zipes.  Many of the lower


courts were actually borrowing State statutes of

limitations on the theory that title VII had no statute of


limitations of its own.  This Court laid that to rest in


Zipes, and now all of the Federal courts of appeals,


including the Ninth Circuit, agree that 706(e) is a


statute of limitations.


If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my


time. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Englert. 


Mr. Schlick, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. SCHLICK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This Court's decision in Zipes established and


the Court reaffirmed in Lorance that section 706(e)


operates as a statute of limitations.  The limitations


period begins to run with the occurrence of the alleged


unlawful employment practice. 


In this case, respondent could sue on alleged


violations that occurred not more than 300 days before he


filed his charge with EEOC, but he could not sue on


alleged violations that occurred earlier and outside the


limitations period. 


Our construction of section 706(e) gives effect

to the balance underlying that provision.  On the one


hand, it ensures that plaintiffs are able to sue and


recover for ongoing violations.  At the same time, it


ensures that employers will not be liable for violations


that -- that occurred long ago.


QUESTION:  When you say ongoing violations and


taking my hypothetical, could they recover for damages


prior to the 300 days? 


MR. SCHLICK:  In your hypothetical, Justice


Stevens, recovery would only be available if equitable


tolling came into play.  As -- absent equitable tolling


based on -- based on the conceal -- equitable estoppel


based on the concealment that you mentioned in your


hypothetical, recovery would be limited to 300 days. 


QUESTION:  In my hypothetical it would be


limited to 300 days. 


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes, Justice Stevens.  The fact


that it was continuing would not -- would not affect the


application of a 300-day period. 


QUESTION:  In a nutshell, where do you think the


Ninth Circuit went wrong, which I take it you believe is


the case here?


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes, Justice O'Connor.  There were


two categories of claims at issue in this case.  The first


is what Ninth Circuit referred to as serial violations,

that is, independently actionable alleged violations of


title VII.  And as to -- as to those claims, the Ninth


Circuit went wrong in holding that violations that


occurred -- that accrued more than 300 days before the --


the charge was filed were actionable. 


The second claim was a hostile work environment


claim.  Now, the allegation of the complaint and the


claims at trial were that the hostile work environment


became actionable right from the outset of Mr. Morgan's


employment with -- with Amtrak.  It was actionable


throughout the period.  Mr. Morgan, however, didn't bring


a charge on that -- on that claim until years later. 


Accordingly, he could only recover for 300 days of the


alleged maintenance of the hostile work environment. 


Now, our construction --


QUESTION:  On your theory then, the -- the only


thing that the continuing violation concept gives, in


effect, is a right to use evidence of something that


happened prior to the period.  It does not, in effect,


give any right to damages for the -- whatever the damage


is for the hostility prior to the 300-day period.  So, you


turned it into an evidentiary rule, it seems to me. 


MR. SCHLICK:  No.  Although evidence says that


events outside the limitations period are admissible as


background evidence, our view of the continuing violation

doctrine is that it allows a plaintiff to sue


notwithstanding that there may have been notice of -- of


similar violations outside the limitations period.  And


that's the application of the continuing violation


doctrine --


QUESTION:  Oh.  So, you're saying if there has


been no -- let's -- let's assume a case in which there is


no independent notice of the hostile environment within


the 300-day period.  They would still be able to sue on a


continuing violation theory.  Whereas, if it were a purely


evidentiary rule, they would not be able to sue within


that period. 


MR. SCHLICK:  Suit -- suit could be brought


within 300 days for the entirety provided that it accrued


within the 300 days.  And the -- the relevance of the


continuing violation rule is that notice outside the


limitations period -- in this case going back to the


serial claims, in this case notice of related violations


outside the limitations period do not prevent Mr. Morgan


for suing on violations that occurred within the


limitations period. 


QUESTION:  Let's -- let's assume you have a


hostile work environment that goes on for 900 days.  He


doesn't bring an action until the last 300 days or until


day 601.  What -- what you're saying, I believe -- and

correct me if I'm wrong -- is that the mere fact that the 


hostile work environment really commenced 600 days ago


does -- or 900 days ago does not bar you from getting


damages for the last 300 days. 


MR. SCHLICK:  That's right, Justice Scalia. 


When you say commenced, I understand you to mean accrued. 


It became actionable. 


QUESTION:  It became -- it became a hostile work


environment --


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- 900 days ago. 


MR. SCHLICK:  That's correct, Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  But it continued to be a -- a hostile


work for all 900 days.  You can sue for the last 300


days --


MR. SCHLICK:  That's correct, Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  -- even though it's --


QUESTION:  And you also think he can -- don't


you think he can get damages for the whole 900 days if a


reasonable person wouldn't have realized that those first


600 days were actionable?


MR. SCHLICK:  That, Justice Breyer, is the


question of accrual under Harris.  The -- the standard for


the claim in that case would be whether the work


environment -- the -- was severe and pervasive both

objectively and subjectively. 


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, if you -- if you --


what about just modifying it a little to try to give


meaning to the 2 years of back pay that you could get and


all the other things and realities of the work place, and


say, as long as it was reasonable for him not to go to the


EEOC, he can recover for the whole 900 days? 


And there are a lot of reasons it's reasonable


not to go to the EEOC.  Maybe because you didn't quite


understand what was going on.  Maybe you thought it would


cure itself.  Maybe you thought those were just comments


that some guy made.  He should be better educated.  Maybe


you thought the employer will work it out.  Maybe you


thought your supervisor wasn't the rat he turned out to


be.  All right, or whatever.  You see what I'm saying?  As


long as a judge would say it was reasonable, what about


that? 


MR. SCHLICK:  The -- the reasonableness that


would allow -- that would extend the limitations period is


-- is reasonableness that would qualify under the


equitable tolling or equitable estoppel doctrines.  And


indeed, the limitations period is sometimes extended even


beyond 2 years, thereby giving effect to the 2-year


restriction on back pay under the equitable tolling


doctrine.

 QUESTION:  Well, there -- there are a lot of


reasons for not going to court too, but we've never said


those toll the statute of limitations.


MR. SCHLICK:  That's correct, and if it's a


reason which does not --


QUESTION:  Do you think the Seventh Circuit has


adopted the right test in that regard?


MR. SCHLICK:  The result of the Seventh


Circuit's test is generally consistent with our rule, but


the -- the Seventh Circuit's test is in our view less


definite than our own.  They seem to ask whether the


plaintiff sued at an appropriate time.  Our question is,


did the plaintiff bring suit within -- or file a charge,


rather, within 300 days or 180 days, if applicable, of the


accrual of the violation, of the occurrence of the alleged


unlawful employment practice.  And that is the rule


established in the NLRA, which is the model for title VII.


QUESTION:  But the agency here -- I mean, that's


-- the position that you are taking, on behalf of the


United States, differs from the EEOC's position which, I


understand it, is the position that the Ninth Circuit


followed. 


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  The


respondent and amici rely on regulations issued by the


EEOC under section 717 of the act, which is the Federal

employer provision.  Those regulations are by their terms


inapplicable to claims under 706, and indeed, Congress


left it to the EEOC to establish a -- a framework for --


for filing charges that the EEOC requires consultation


within 45 days with the agency's EEO office.  So, it's a


different structure, and in that context --


QUESTION:  Well, what is the EEOC's position on


-- on this case? 


MR. SCHLICK:  In section 706 cases, respondent


correctly points out that the EEOC has filed briefs and


taken a position which is consistent with the Ninth


Circuit's test.  Our view is that while that would be


evaluated under Skidmore, it is not persuasive for the


views that we've given in our brief. 


QUESTION:  And your answer to the question about


the 2 years is that there are cases.  There wouldn't be


very many, though, that would fit where would be a 2-year


-- possibility of a 2-year back pay. 


MR. SCHLICK:  I can give you two cases from the


Southern District of New York last year, Sye v. The


Rockefeller University, 137 F.Supp.2d 276; Bardniak v.


Cushman and Wakefield, 2001 WL 1505501, both last year. 


In both of those cases, the charge was filed 3 years after


the last occurrence that's alleged and applying equitable


tolling principles, the courts indicated that the -- that

the complaint could go forward because of the equitable


tolling. 


QUESTION:  And you agree with those equitable --


whatever those equitable tolling reasons were?  You think


those courts handled the case correctly?


MR. SCHLICK:  Yes.  I think so.  In both cases,


misinformation was provided by the agency, either the


State agency or the EEOC itself.  In one case there was a


question of mental -- mental incapacity of the plaintiff,


and tolling was additionally extended on that basis.


QUESTION:  I'm not sure I understand why hostile


environment cases are unique.  Why is that the only kind


of continuing violation?  I mean, if I'm not giving --


given a promotion that I was entitled to because of my


race, I continue not to have that promotion month after


month after month.  Why isn't that as much of a continuing


violation as is a hostile work environment? 


MR. SCHLICK:  In our view hostile environment


cases are not unique and are not properly exceptions in


which -- in which a continuing violation doctrine apply. 


Rather it's a question of accrual, and hostile environment


cases are distinguishable in that they may take a long


time to accrue.  But that simply means that when they do


accrue, the charge should be brought within 300 days.  The


example of -- of a discharge would be --

 QUESTION:  But I thought you said the opposite. 


If -- if it accrues now, I can still sue 900 -- 900 days


later for the hostile work environment of the last 300


days.  I thought that's what you said. 


MR. SCHLICK:  If I may answer, Mr. Chief


Justice.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. SCHLICK:  In that case there is an


occurrence within the 300 days and it's that occurrence


that is the basis for the charge and the complaint within


the 300 days. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Schlick.


Ms. Price, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA Y. PRICE


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MS. PRICE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


Ongoing violations of the law must be treated


differently from discrete acts.  A continuing unlawful


practice which involves a present violation of the act


means that the claim is not stale.  Limiting liability to


180 days solely would essentially nullify section 706(g). 


It would allow the defendant in this case Amtrak -- would


essentially negate the language of title VII which speaks


in terms of practices.  It speaks specifically to an

unlawful employment practice. 


QUESTION:  Well, I mean, the claim is not stale,


of course, as to the continuing acts.  The question is can


you go back for the acts as -- as to which the statute


arguably has run.


MS. PRICE:  This is true. 


QUESTION:  And -- and so the -- the question is


not whether or not you can sue continuing acts.  If it's


indeed a continuing act, you can sue for the acts that are


within the -- the period.  The question is can you go


back.


MS. PRICE:  Yes, Your Honor.  And it is true


that we believe that you can go back.  With respect to


back pay, Congress has specifically provided under 706(g)


that you can go back 2 years for back pay liability. 


With -- and there is a difference between a


liability for damages and liability for essentially


liability's sake.  Under the statute, under title VII,


Congress did not put a limit in as to how far you could go


back.  It said you must file the charge within 300 days


for purposes of initiating the conciliatory involvement of


the EEOC.  But filing the charge while, you said in Zipes,


it's like a statute of limitations, it does not dictate


how far you go back in terms of establishing the


employer's liability.

 You said in Havens that where you have a


continuing practice of discrimination, that it is


appropriate to allow the plaintiff to recover for the


entire practice and --


QUESTION:  But Havens was a different statute,


was it not? 


MS. PRICE:  It is a -- it is -- yes, sir.  It


was a different statute but it has the same language and


it has the same purpose.  It was a statute intended to


outlaw discrimination, and it is supposed to be


interpreted with the same understanding, one, that it's a


statute that's going to be utilized by lay persons, and


two, that it has a broad remedial intent.


QUESTION:  Well, have we ever set aside this


type of statute and said we give all possible breaks to


plaintiffs on it?  I don't believe we have.


MS. PRICE:  No.  I don't believe you have.  And


I think what you said in Zipes, Mr. Chief Justice, was


that it was necessary to strike a balance to allow for the


prompt filing for -- to give notice to allow the EEOC to


give notice to the employer and to be sure to effectuate


the remedial intent of the statute.  So, there was a


balance struck. 


If you date the trigger period for the statute


of limitations from the date that the person either knew

or reasonably should have known, you disrupt that balance


because then you're moving the trigger from the last


occurrence of the practice to an uncertain time when the


plaintiff either reasonably should have known or


unreasonably should have known. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Price, the Ninth Circuit, whose


judgment we're reviewing here, as nearly as I can tell


seems to take a different view of what can be included for


damages as actionable than that taken by other circuits


that have looked at the same statute and the same problem.


MS. PRICE:  It is -- yes, ma'am. 


QUESTION:  Would you agree with that? 


MS. PRICE:  Yes, ma'am.  I would agree that it


has taken a -- that there is a split in the circuits.  I


believe --


QUESTION:  Yes, a very lopsided split really.


MS. PRICE:  Well, I think the Ninth Circuit's


position is actually in the majority view. 


QUESTION:  It's a big circuit.  Right? 


MS. PRICE:  Yes. 


(Laughter.) 


MS. PRICE:  Yes, but none of the circuits


disagree about what constitutes a continuing violation. 


Where the disagreement is is in -- similar in this case. 


There's a disagreement between us and Amtrak as to when

the trigger for the practice -- for the charge-filing


requirement occurs.  There's a disagreement as -- with --


between us and the Government as to what is covered in


that 300-day period. 


QUESTION:  Well, if there are separate events


that have occurred and if each one standing alone would be


actionable and if no charge is filed or suit brought until


after the time limit established for some of the


violations, what do we do? 


MS. PRICE:  Well, you look, as the circuits have


uniformly looked, as to whether or not it is a practice or


a continuing violation.  You -- it's -- you -- if you look


at the case as a series of discrete acts, then yes, we


lose.  But it's not a case where there's a series of


discrete acts, and in fact, the majority of the issues


that Mr. Morgan was addressing were not actionable in and


of themselves.  The initiation of disciplinary action --


QUESTION:  Do you think the acts that occurred


before the applicable statutory period had expired were


actionable?


MS. PRICE:  I -- no, I don't.  I think that


there were some that, if they had occurred in isolation,


could have been actionable.  When we presented the case,


we did not pursue this case as one for a violation, for


example, of the -- his termination and then ultimate

suspension in 1991.  We did --


QUESTION:  But if you -- if you say that an


event, if it occurred in isolation, would be actionable,


you are saying then that it was actionable by itself


without combining it with anything else. 


MS. PRICE:  Yes, sir, I am saying that.  It is


true that if that is -- the difference between a discrete


act and a continuing practice of discrimination.


QUESTION:  Well, what do you mean by a


continuing -- let -- let's -- let's take the failure to


give a person a promotion because of her sex or his race


or whatever.  Let's assume that that occurs and then --


and then the claim is made 2 years later.  During that


whole 2 years, the person hasn't gotten the promotion. 


And is it your position that -- that when it is finally


filed 2 years later, you can get back pay or damages for


the whole 2 years, even though, you know, you had the


claim 2 years ago. 


MS. PRICE:  Well, a promotion, as I understand


the law, is a distinct area, and there are some


circumstances where the courts have held that a promotion


would result in extending the time for one to recover


damages.  There are other situations where we want to


distinguish between a promotion that simply involves the


continuing effects.

 We're not talking about, as -- as the Court is


well aware, a promotion in this case or a situation where


it's simply Mr. Morgan is suffering the continuing effects


of a prior decision.  We're talking about a continuing


series of acts that continued up until the charge-filing


period that were motivated by retaliation and


discrimination.  We're talking about a hostile environment


claim, and the Court should be clear there was a question


as to whether or not this case involved a hostile


environment.  We brought that to the trial court's


attention, and on October 22nd, 1998, she issued a


specific order ruling --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I don't -- I'm not sure


what your answer is to my hypothetical, and -- and I asked


the hypothetical because frankly I don't see how a hostile


environment claim is any different from a failure to


promote claim.  That failure to promote continues.  The --


the loss of salary continues right over the 2 years, just


as a hostile environment claim continues over 2 years.


MS. PRICE:  This Court has defined a hostile


environment as the -- the actionable part of it is the


environment itself.  It's not the discrete acts.  In the


Justice's hypothetical, I believe that you're focusing on


the discrete act of a failure to promote that individual,


which is -- has a definite beginning, end.  It's right

there.  It happens. 


In a hostile environment, it's not so simple. 


Hostile environment -- you can have an act that might not


be actionable, but when you -- when you look at it over a


period of time, a series of acts, that it's cumulative and


the harm is indivisible.  In a promotion case, the harm is


related solely to the failure to promote.  In a hostile


environment case, you can't separate the harm that's


caused on day 899 from the harm that's caused on day 200.


QUESTION:  What you're saying, if I understand


it correct, is the promotion is a discrete violation with


continuing effects, whereas a hostile environment is a


continuing violation.


MS. PRICE:  Yes.  Yes, Justice Stevens.


QUESTION:  Which is two quite different things. 


MS. PRICE:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  Suppose you have a continuing --


QUESTION:  Is this case --


QUESTION:  Suppose you have a continuing


violation, a hostile environment, made up of many minor


acts. 


MS. PRICE:  Yes, sir. 


QUESTION:  And it goes on for many, many years. 


And the -- the injured individual finally goes to the


EEOC after a very long time.  In your opinion, can he

recover damages then back for the entire 10 years or 15


years, or is there some cutoff point behind which you


won't get the damages? 


MS. PRICE:  The ability to recover damages in


that circumstances depends on a number of factors.  First


would be the plaintiff's ability to establish that it is


in fact a continuing violation that --


QUESTION:  Well, he does.  Let's assume he does.


MS. PRICE:  Then his ability would be affected


by this Court's decisions in both Faragher and Burlington


Industries where this Court said that if there's no


tangible employment action and the employer can show that


it has taken appropriate steps to prevent or remedy


discrimination, and the plaintiff --


QUESTION:  No, they didn't. 


MS. PRICE:  Okay. 


(Laughter.) 


MS. PRICE:  Well, if they can't show that the


victim unreasonably failed to take advantage of whatever


remedies or opportunities were -- were not available or


should have been available, then yes, the plaintiff


would --


QUESTION:  I just wonder.  You see, if at some


point we might say, well, he should have gone to the EEOC. 


It was unreasonable of him not to.  I wouldn't say he had

to do it immediately, but after many years?  And -- and do


we want to give him damages all the way back? 


MS. PRICE:  The damages question again is a


separate question from liability.  The damages are going


to be limited by 706(g) which provides a 2-year cap on


back pay and by the caps that Congress has enacted for


compensatory damages.  For instance, if -- if his employer


was, you know, within that $50,000 range, he's only going


to get $50,000.


QUESTION:  But would you --


QUESTION:  Why is it that if there's a


continuing violation, say, for 900 days and you file on


the 900th day, that you can go back for the first 600


days?  Why? 


MS. PRICE:  Because the statute must have the


ability to reach practices.  Where you have a longstanding


pattern or practice of retaliation or discrimination, this


statute in particular is designed to get at that.


QUESTION:  It does reach it.  The only question


is, you know, how many damages you get, whether you -- you


have to be prompt and bring your action soon enough to put


an end to it.  I mean, it's not a question of whether you


can reach the pattern or practice.  You certainly can.


MS. PRICE:  Well, but if you limit the period


for which you can reach it to only 300 days, you're

essentially immunizing the employer who has engaged in a


longstanding --


QUESTION:  No, you're not.  You're -- you're


telling the person who's been harmed, you know, if you're


harmed, take action right away --


MS. PRICE:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- which is the whole purpose of


statutes of limitations. 


MS. PRICE:  You're telling the person not simply


to take action, Justice Scalia, but to take action that it


may in fact result in greater retaliation or a loss of


employment.  You're not telling them simply to go to the


employer --


QUESTION:  Well, but that's -- but that's always


true. 


QUESTION:  Retaliation is a separate claim.


QUESTION:  I -- I thought your answer might be


that it's difficult to know that there's a pervasive


environment until you look at a whole context of acts. 


I'm not sure that would be a conclusive -- but at least


that's a reason.  But when you say, well, it's necessary


in order to enforce the act, that -- that just begs the


question. 


MS. PRICE:  Well, I think that there are cases


where it's difficult to know.  There are also cases where

people --


QUESTION:  All right.  That's one reason.


Suppose -- suppose that we play with the


hypothetical and we establish that it wasn't difficult to


know.  Is there any other reason for allowing us -- for


requiring the courts to go back? 


MS. PRICE:  It's not that -- well, it's because


it's fundamentally a continuing violation of the statute,


and the statute itself allows for you to deal with


practices. 


Number two, you have the 706(g) statute which


allows the court to -- or allows a -- entitles a victim of


discrimination to recover damages for a 2-year period, for


back pay. 


QUESTION:  And you say that for compensatory


damages you rely on the lid in dollar amount.


MS. PRICE:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  For back pay time.  But I take it


your argument would be no different if there were no


ceiling on the amount you could get for compensatory or


punitive damages.


MS. PRICE:  That is correct, and the reason why


is because Congress looked at this problem.  They looked


at this problem in 1972.  They looked at the problem again


in 1991.  Congress did not set an anterior limit on

liability under title VII, and where Congress has not


acted to do that, it is not appropriate for the Court to


set that limit. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Price, I don't understand the


rationale for treating continuing violations differently


in so far as how far you can go back to get damages.  I


can understand why you should treat them differently for


purposes of determining whether you can bring suit at all. 


That is, if it's a continuing violation, the mere fact


that you didn't bring suit within 300 days after the


violation started doesn't matter.  You can -- you can


bring suit at any point during the continuing violation. 


But it's a separate question whether, once you do bring


suit, you can get damages all the way back to the


beginning of it or rather damages just back 300 days.  I


see no -- no reason conceptually why you should have --


you should be able to go all the way back. 


Take a failure to promote, which we discussed


before, which you say is a one-shot violation, not a


continuing violation.  Okay? 


MS. PRICE:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  You -- you can't bring suit for that


if you don't sue within 300 days.


Suppose it's not a failure to promote.  It is


simply a failure to pay the salary that this person in --

in the job the person has is entitled to, and that's a


continuing violation. 


MS. PRICE:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  It continues on and on.  And you're


saying that even though that's been continuing on and on


for 2 years and the -- the employee doesn't take any


action, he can go all the way back for the whole 2 years


instead of just back for the last 30 days -- last 300


days.  I -- I don't see conceptually why that ought to be


the case. 


MS. PRICE:  706(g) determines how far one can go


for back damages.  If the concern is one with respect to


liability, the difference -- conceptually there may not be


a difference.  But in fact in the -- in Bazemore, this


Court addressed that particular scenario, and in that


particular scenario, the Court said every time the person


receives a -- a check that's less, then that constitutes a


violation.  I mean, it's conceivable under your -- under


the Court's hypothetical that the employee could file a


charge for each one of those paychecks, and I think that


that sort of turns Congress' --


QUESTION:  You're saying it's not a continuing


violation.


MS. PRICE:  Right.  I mean, and that -- that


upsets I believe what Congress really intended to do.

That would essentially eliminate the caps entirely.


And we have that potential problem in this case. 


If you look at this case as a series of discrete acts, you


require Mr. Morgan to file a charge every time he's


charged with a rule L violation or every time they


threaten to charge him or every time they suggest that he


shouldn't have been -- that he was 2 minutes late for


work.  Those kinds of things in and of themselves should


not become the basis for title VII charges. 


You have to allow for the circumstance where the


employee is in fact being subjected to a -- a persistent


and a continuing pattern of discrimination that becomes


actionable within the 300-day or the 180-day charge-filing


period. 


QUESTION:  Well, should we look to what a


reasonable person should be expected to recognize as a


cause of action?


MS. PRICE:  No.  I think no, Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION:  There shouldn't be any objective test


element in it? 


MS. PRICE:  I think that it's appropriate to


look at this continuing violation circumstance in the same


way in which the Court has looked at the hostile


environment claim.  And in the hostile environment claim,


the Court has imposed both an objective test and a

subjective test to determine whether or not there is a


hostile environment.  That's in the definition of the


cause of action. 


In this case, the definition of the cause of


action is already found within title VII.  Title VII


defines what practices violate the act. 


With respect to the timing, title VII doesn't


say -- there's nowhere in title VII where it says that you


-- the charge-filing is triggered where the person knows


or should have known.  There is no notice requirement in


title VII.  Title VII ties the requirement that you file a


charge from the last date -- the last occurrence of the


unlawful practice.  That's what the statute says, and I


think that's what the Court has to impose on employers. 


That is the certainty that employers are entitled to. 


It's in the language. 


QUESTION:  But it's not certain because if it is


a truly continuing violation -- every promotion, every --


every training I ask for is going to be denied -- it will


never end.  It's going on.  At some point there's going to


be a suit.  So, the last act is just the last act that


happens before the employee decided to bring the suit. 


The very nature of the continuing thing, it's going to go


on.  Hopefully the -- the charge will stop it.  But it's


-- the last act is the one that the complainant would

pick.  Right? 


MS. PRICE:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  I think your basic position is these


filing periods are like a statute of limitations in some


respects but not in other respects.


MS. PRICE:  This is true, and I believe that's


why there is that language in Zipes.  It is true that


there have been times when it's been referred to as -- as


a statute of limitations, but in Zipes where the Court


looked at it and when you look at the actual purpose of it


in Occidental Life Insurance Company v. EEOC, again the


Court looked at the purpose of the charge-filing


requirement is not to determine liability.  It's to start


the administrative process.  That's really all it does.


There's other statutes of limitations or things


that are like a statute of limitations.  You have the 90-


day period in which one has to bring a lawsuit after you


receive the right to sue.  That again is another


limitations period.


QUESTION:  Or the 45 days that you have if


you're a Government employee to start consulting in your


own house. 


MS. PRICE:  Exactly.  This is not your


traditional statute of limitations that defines the period


of time for which liability may be imposed.

 QUESTION:  One of -- one of the peculiarities is


the difference between 180-day and 300 which makes very


good sense as far as administrative exhaustion is


concerned. 


MS. PRICE:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  But as -- why should the person who's


in a deferral state get 300 days while the person who's


not get only 180 days if we're talking about a statute of


limitations as measuring the ripeness or staleness of a


claim? 


MS. PRICE:  Yes, that is true.  Congress


understood that this statute could be utilized with change


depending on where one lived, depending on what sector of


the employment arena one is found in.  So, it's not


appropriate to rely upon this particular statute as


determining the period of liability.  You must look to


706(g) and you must look to the caps where Congress


specifically tried to address the concerns of employers.


Viewing this case solely as a -- as a series of


discrete acts ignores the fundamental problem that Mr.


Morgan faced at Amtrak.  Mr. Morgan thought that the --


the practices the he was being subjected to were only


being perpetuated by a few managers.  What he discovered,


when he complained -- and you must acknowledge that he did


complain.  This is not a situation where the person sat on

his rights, as Amtrak would portray him.  Mr. Morgan did


complain, and then he discovered that Amtrak absolutely


refused to address those practices that were going on in


the Oakland yard. 


QUESTION:  But if -- he complained in October


1991 to the EEOC, didn't he?  And if he discovered then


what was going on, shouldn't the statute at least have


started running then? 


MS. PRICE:  Well, there's no indication that he


discovered -- he knew that there were racist practices


going on at the yard.  He complained to Congresswoman


Barbara Boxer and he complained to the EEOC with the


anticipation that there would be some action taken.  In


fact, in 1992 Inspector Wiederholt did come out at the


insistence of Congresswoman Boxer and looked at that


situation.  But that was a process that took over 10


months. 


Subsequently when he did complain again in 1993,


Amtrak took 9 months to investigate.  To require him to --


to go to EEOC within a 6-month or a 10-month window


essentially negates his ability --


QUESTION:  But he did go to EEOC.


MS. PRICE:  He went to EEOC, yes, when they


indicated that they intended to fire him, and that would


result in the absolute termination of his relationship

with Amtrak. 


QUESTION:  There's some confusion in the -- you


are referring not to the EEOC charge that didn't come to


till the end of the line, but the EEO charges that he


filed in-house. 


MS. PRICE:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And that's what you're saying he did


earlier. 


MS. PRICE:  Yes.  Yes, throughout that process. 


Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, he went to Amtrak's EEO.  He filed


eight separate charges with them, and they only


responded --


QUESTION:  When -- when was the first time he


filed a complaint with the EEOC?


MS. PRICE:  It was in February of 1995.


QUESTION:  You know, 300 days is -- it's almost


a year.  The same thing happens in -- in statutes of -- of


limitations, some of which are 2 years, some of which are


as short as 1 year.  The -- the person who's thinking of


bringing a lawsuit is put to the choice of either


negotiating with the person and trying to work it out, but


at some point, if he knows there's a 1-year statute of


limitations, he's just going to have to say, I'm sorry,


I'm going to go ahead. 


And I don't know how this 300-day period is any

different from that.  It's fine to say you should be able


to, you know, waltz around and talk to the employer and


talk to, you know, Barbara Boxer or whatever else, but at


some point the -- the curtain comes down and you know


that's 300 days.  That's the standard operation of a


statute of limitations. 


MS. PRICE:  In this case, Mr. -- Justice Scalia,


the -- as I pointed out, the -- the statute of limitations


operates somewhat differently.  It's like a statute of


limitations. 


More to the point, however, in this case, as in


the cases that are addressed by title VII, you're talking


about an employment relationship, an ongoing relationship


where the evidence that is -- we've presented in our


amicus briefs is that the person wants to maintain their


employment, and there is a very real fear that if you go


outside the scope of your employment to an outside agency,


that's going to tear apart the employment relationship. 


That -- that is essentially crossing the river, and you


can't go back from that.  And so, it's very important to


allow people an opportunity, and that's the -- the focus


of the statute was to allow the EEOC not to come in and


file a lawsuit, but to come in and conciliate, to try to


resolve the problem without the necessity of a lawsuit.


So, you don't want to adopt a strict

interpretation or a hard and fast rule that says you've


got to file a lawsuit or you've got to start this process


within 10 months.  That is not -- that doesn't give the


employer nor the employee an opportunity to try to resolve


matters internally. 


QUESTION:  For some it's 300 days, for some it's


180.  How many States are so-called deferral States where


people would get the benefit of the 300 days rather than


the 180? 


MS. PRICE:  I regret, Justice Ginsburg, I'm not


-- I don't know how many.


QUESTION:  Because that would be a very odd


statute of limitations to say, depending on your -- the


State that you're in, you get 180 days or 300 days.


MS. PRICE:  This is true.  And again, it's


interpreted.  It has to be interpreted because it applies


in other areas of the law, and it does define -- it really


defines the point at which you have to try to get an


outside agency to come in.  It doesn't define the point at


which you have to sue, and it doesn't define the point


that limits your damages.  That is what is critical. 


Congress has defined the -- the point of damages. 


Congress has not defined the point of liability. 


QUESTION:  But Mr. Englert said that the


limitation, the 2-year limitation -- that's because

Congress was reacting to a time when there was no


limitation and there were fears that you'd have to go all


the way back to 1965.  So, they set 2 years.  If they had


understood properly what was going to be the effect of 180


days, which wasn't determined till much later, then they


would have realized that there was -- they fixed something


that -- where there was nothing broken. 


MS. PRICE:  Congress had an opportunity.  The


problem with Mr. Englert's view of it is that Congress had


another opportunity after this Court's decision in Zipes


in 1991, and Congress did not change either 706(g) and it


didn't change 706(e). 


It did address the very concern that employers


were raising, that we're going to be subjected to


unlimited damages where you -- if you allow compensatory


damages, and Congress put in the caps.  Congress addressed


this problem in a different way by putting in temporal --


excuse me -- nontemporal limits, by putting in a monetary


limit.  Congress could have put in a temporal limit, and


it did not. 


It could have taken out 706(g), and it did not. 


So, to suggest that that section is -- is a superfluous


section that only addresses some long past effect of title


VII or a doctrine that is no longer a part of title VII is


inaccurate.

 QUESTION:  Well, 706(g) would still apply to a


continuing violation, wouldn't it?  I mean, if there's a


continuing violation, you think it wouldn't apply to that


at all.  Maybe not.  You don't think 706(g) has any


application under -- under the petitioner's theory. 


MS. PRICE:  Not under the petitioner's theory,


no.  I think that they're reading 706(g) out of the


statute, which this Court should not do.  Ultimately in


hostile environment cases, the sexual harassment victim --


if you impose this requirement, the sexual harassment


victim, in particular, runs the risk of being -- of filing


either too early or filing too late. 


Again, in Love v. Pullman, this Court recognized


that this process is one that is initiated and utilized by


lay persons unassisted by trained lawyers.  You should not


impose a requirement upon a lay person to determine, oh,


now -- when this continuing violation doctrine is going to


start and when my damages are going to start accruing. 


And therefore, now I must file with the EEOC.  They are --


the last act which is what Congress contemplated is what


has to be the trigger for the statute.


QUESTION:  But you recognize that you can't turn


every discrete act into a continuing violation.  I mean,


it must be used.  You have conceded that the one-time


thing -- you're not getting this promotion, you're

discharged.


How does one tell -- and here -- here there were


several similar acts -- whether it's a discrete violation


on the one hand or whether it's a continuing violation?


MS. PRICE:  I think that the courts have not --


have been able to determine where there's a discrete act,


and there's nothing happens.  And this is really where


this Court has set the outer limit.  The -- it requires a


present violation.  It is sometimes difficult to determine


what's a discrete act and what is a part of a pattern.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Price. 


Mr. Englert, you have 3 minutes remaining. 


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. ENGLERT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


Justice O'Connor, in one of her questions for


Ms. Price, referred to the very lopsided split in the


circuits, and I agree that there's a very lopsided split


contrary to the Ninth Circuit's view.  Only one of those


many circuit cases that I'm aware of -- at least the


recent circuit cases -- actually discusses the 706(g)


issue that's taken up much of the argument time today, and


that is the First Circuit's opinion in Sabree, which


actually comes out squarely where we come out in this


case, that in general damages are cut off at 300 days.

There is an exception, the details of which it's probably


better not to spend any more time on.  But we agree with


the Sabree result. 


Under no circumstances does our view render


section 706(g) superfluous.  I do think it's something of


an anachronism enacted to deal with problems that went


away, but under no circumstances is it superfluous.  In


cases of equitable tolling, in government suits against


municipalities under section 707 where there is no statute


of limitations, in the kinds of hostile environment cases


we were discussing earlier, the 2-year back pay cap can


have effect. 


Let me mention very briefly, although not much


time was spent on it earlier, the Havens case was decided


under a different statute.  In the Lorance case, the


Solicitor General urged the Court to follow Havens.  The


Court said no.  The Court didn't address Havens in its


opinion.  It said -- but it said -- did say in its opinion


the more relevant precedents are the NLRA precedents,


which squarely support the position we're taking here


today.


Because --


QUESTION:  What's the difference between your


position and the Government's? 


MR. ENGLERT:  Very little, if any, Your Honor.

I think they might concede less than I was conceding


earlier, but other than that, I think there's very little


difference. 


And the Government, quite importantly, in its


brief says what the continuing violation doctrine is, and


what the continuing violation doctrine is in all other


areas of law besides title VII is essentially what some of


Justice Scalia's questions were suggesting, which is


you're not out of court entirely just because you didn't


bring suit within 300 days of the first incident or 4


years in the case of the Clayton Act.  You do get to bring


suit, but you only get damages reaching back to the


limitations period.


Let me mention very quickly.  Amtrak did win


this case at trial.  So, I don't want the Court to have


the impression that it's conceded that there was racial


discrimination going on, but I'll leave it at that.


And finally, just a detail.  43 States and the


District of Columbia more or less are deferral States. 


That's the figure the Government has given me, and I'm --


I'm certain it's more than 40 States are deferral States.


QUESTION:  Could you explain the logic in


statute of limitations terms between giving some people


300 and others 180? 


MR. ENGLERT:  The only logic is that that's what


54 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Congress said.  If it's a single incident case and you


file on the 181st day, you're out of court if you're not


in a deferral State. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Englert. 


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 12:14 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
