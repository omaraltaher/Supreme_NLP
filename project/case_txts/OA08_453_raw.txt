Association.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Under the OCC regulation at issue here, 

State antidiscrimination and consumer protection laws 
can be enforced against national banks by the Federal 
OCC and by private parties, but not by State attorneys 
general.  This unusual enforcement pre-emption, which 
detaches the State's power to make laws from its power 
to enforce them, was not written into the National Bank 
Act by Congress in 1864, and it's implausible that 
Congress implicitly delegated to OCC the power to read 
it in now.

 We know the NBA did not in 1864 enact 

enforcement pre-emption against the States for three 
reasons:  First, the words of the statute; second, a 
long line of cases from this Court, especially St. 
Louis, upholding the power of the State to enforce laws

against a national bank or rejecting it on the ground 
that the law was substantively pre-empted, but not 
questioning the power of the State to enforce a valid 
law; and, finally, the wholly anomalous character, 
foreign really to our structure of government, of 
separating the power to make law from the power to 
enforce it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But to some extent, would 

you concede that interpretation; that is, not only the 
attorney general under New York's law, but the 
superintendent of banks as well, has authority over 
mortgage lending?  Would -- would you agree that the 
part about the bank superintendent's enforcement could 
not be enforced against national banks?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, first of all, the bank 

superintendent in New York doesn't have authority over 
national banks.  It has authority only over State banks, 
as we pointed out in our reply brief.  So we don't 
assert that authority.

 I would say that the -- and the injunction 

doesn't run -- that's at issue in this case, doesn't run 
against the superintendent.  It runs against the 
attorney general.  But I would say --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there is -- the

the authority of the bank superintendent as well as the 
authority of the attorney general; isn't that so?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  I believe that the banking 

superintendent does not assert authority to enforce in a 
regulatory fashion against national banks.  If they did, 
if -- if -- if the bank superintendent asserted a 
chartering or licensing supervisory regime, that would 
be a different issue from the question --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Just with respect to the 
same issue on mortgage lending where there's a concern 
about racial discrimination?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, the -- the bank -- the 

banking superintendent of New York does not enforce 
against national banks.

to that?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Yes, that is right.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even if the New York 

MS. UNDERWOOD:  Read differently or 

interpreted or applied differently.

 What's at issue here is a distinction 

between a supervisory regime -- "visitation" is a regime 
characterized by routine examinations, no cause needed, 
by a chartering or a licensing authority for the purpose

of enforcing limitations on --

JUSTICE BREYER:  How is it supposed to work? 
This is what is bothering me at the heart of this case. 
I imagine that banks, particularly right in these last 
few months, are in situations where there are three 
categories of -- of borrowers.  One might be a category 
of people whom you are reasonably confident in, and the 
second is a category of people who are borderline or 
less so, and there are also minorities.

 Now, where you make the decision as a bank 
to deny them the loan, it sometimes is difficult to say 
whether that decision was made for a discriminatory 
reason, namely race, or for a legitimate reason, namely 
because this was a person unlikely to pay the money 
back.

 Now, how is a bank to function if 50 

different attorneys general plus the Federal agencies 
all look at the books of the bank to look at the 
individual loan and to make that kind of determination 
about which quite honestly reasonable people will often 
differ?

 And how -- how is that really a problem, or 
am I just creating that?  And if it's really a problem, 
how in your opinion does the Federal law deal with that 
problem, if not in the way that your opponent suggests?

MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, an -- there is a 

single standard of discrimination.  It is the case that 
the -- that the Federal standards applied by the OCC and 
the State law all look to Title VII law about a prima 
facie case being --

JUSTICE BREYER:  If I may say so, that 
response overlooks the question.  I don't doubt the 
single standard.  What I do doubt is in the -- in the 
category of uncertain cases, that 51 different 
individuals, 50 State attorneys general plus one Federal 
individual, will reach the same result.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  These are hard and, 

therefore, they will reach a lot of different results 
under the same standard.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  There has been no such 

multiplicity of -- of enforcement.  In fact, there is so 
much antidiscrimination work to go around that having 
multiple enforcers is a device for --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So you deny the 

hypothetical.  You are saying that my analysis of the 
problem is wrong; there simply is no such problem, and 
since there is no such problem, it doesn't matter if 
everyone enforces it.

under the Fair Housing Act, HUD is required to refer --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is your answer yes or no to 

what I just said, that you deny that the statement of 
the problem is realistic and therefore there is no 
problem in your view about having 51 different people 
enforce the same standard.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  There is no record of any 

such problem.  And should such a -- yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And should such a problem 

arise, what?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Should such a problem arise, 

that would be an occasion for considering a kind of 
burden pre-emption that would be similar -- on evidence 
of such a problem, that might be a basis for OCC to make 
a record and enact a regulation to deal with that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if OCC thought there 
might be such a problem, couldn't it act in advance to 
avoid the risk that Justice Breyer's question explains?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, its regulation doesn't 

say that.  The injunction that was issued in this case 
doesn't say that.  What the regulation, the rulemaking, 
and the injunction all rest on is a legal analysis, not 
an empirical one.

New York is not asserting authority over bank lending in 
Hawaii.  So for each institution, I assume it's going to 
be two sovereigns, the OCC and the State attorney 
general, not 50 descending on the single -- single bank 
with respect to particular loans?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  That's correct.  And the 

OCC --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's correct 

with respect to a particular loan.  It's not respect --
with respect to Federal policy about national banks 
around the country.  It's conceivable and I suppose 
likely that the Federal regulator would want the same 
rule to apply to banks in Michigan as to banks in 
Hawaii.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  It is.  But if the question 
was would the -- would the actual act of responding to a 
complaint or to discovery burden particular people 
because there would be 50 people asking for the same 
information, that's not the case, because the loans made 
in New York would be analyzed by a New York enforcer.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I want to --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  The same rule 

would not apply in Michigan and Hawaii, anyway, even 
under the Federal Government.  The Federal Government 
acknowledges that Michigan can have its own law --

MS. UNDERWOOD:  The Federal Government --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- and Hawaii can have a 
different law.  All the Federal Government is arguing 
is:  We want to be the ones to enforce the separate 
Michigan law and the separate Hawaii law, right?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  That appears to be the case. 

In fact, they have acknowledged that the State law 
actually applies.  It's undisputed.  OCC said so in its 
complaint.  Congress has several times said so, which is 
presumably why the OCC says so -- said so in the Fair 
Housing Act savings clause, in the -- in the Equal 
Credit Opportunity Act savings clause, and in 
Riegle-Neal, which specifically applies only to national 
bank branches, but expressly preserves the application 
of State fair lending and consumer protection laws.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You are just at the point 
of getting to what I -- the blank in my mind.  And the 
blank in my mind is when you said, but if there were 
such a problem, as I had described, but if there were, 
then they could -- and now that's the blank.  Then they 
could what?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, there are many things 

that they might do.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  For example, just give me 

two, a couple.

MS. UNDERWOOD:  For example, make some 
provision for -- in fact, I believe there are some 
regulations that call for conferencing and collaboration 
and consultation among the State enforcers and between 
the State and Federal regulators to avoid duplicative 
regulation.  There is already the potential with respect 
to State banks that are supervised both by State 
regulators and by the FDIC.  There are alternate audits 
in alternate years.  I mean, there -- there is plenty of 
precedent in bank regulation for mechanisms for 
consultation and collaboration so that people don't step 
on each other's toes.

 And in Federal criminal enforcement, for 

example, there are -- there are many -- many occasions 
where there is both Federal and State authority to 
enforce.  And the result of that tends to be to get more 
extensive, fuller enforcement.  People don't tend to 
both bring the same case.  If somebody is enforcing 
something, somebody -- a different enforcer will attack 
a different problem.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But the -- in the -- in the 

general -- in the field of criminal enforcement 
generally there isn't any provision comparable to what 
is now 36(f)(1)(B), at least to my knowledge, and it's 
set out on pages 46 and 47, the text is in the

government's brief:  "The provisions of any State law to 
which a branch of a national bank is subject under this 
paragraph shall be enforced with respect to such branch 
by the OCC."

 And that mandate, it "shall be enforced with 

respect to such branch" sounds pretty exclusive to me.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  You can't tell for sure. 

But why would -- why would Congress, number one, if 
it -- if Congress simply assumed that there would be 
a -- a dual system of enforcement, that OCC could --
could say to the bank, you follow State law, and if you 
don't, we are going to go after you administratively, 
and leaving it to the State to go after, in any other 
fashion, what State law provided.  If that was 
Congress's assumption, why would it have -- have passed 
this seeming mandate, "shall be enforced with respect to 
such branch" by the -- by the OCC?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  There are two reasons for 
that provision.  The purpose of that provision was to 
confirm that OCC didn't lose its pre-existing 
enforcement power when Riegle-Neal stated -- that's (1) 
(B) -- in (1)(A) that national branches would be treated 
more or less like State branches for purposes of 
consumer protection and fair lending.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But that -- that's, in 

effect, saving clause kind of function could have been 
performed simply by a statute that says OCC may.  And 
this says it shall be enforced by OCC.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  There is another reason in 
the legislative history, which makes it clear that it 
was a directive to OCC to mount an enforcement program 
which Congress thought it had not been doing.  We know 
that because in the conference report and other 
legislative history Congress says it's trying to expand, 
not contract, the enforcement of fair lending and 
consumer protection laws, and that the law isn't taking 
any authority away from the States and that they are 
distressed at the inadequate failure of OCC to exercise 
its enforcement authority.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't deny, do you, 

that the Federal Government can, if it wishes, enforce 
the State laws?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Absolutely.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So this provision isn't 
really contrary to what you are saying.  You are just 
saying the State can do it as well?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  That's correct.  It isn't 

talking -- it doesn't say anything about exclusive 
authority, and it isn't talking about judicial

enforcement, which OCC doesn't do.  It is talking about 
it's -- it has a savings clause kind of function and 
it -- it's hortatory, it's directing OCC to exercise the 
authority that it has.

 It seems to be common ground that it didn't 
give OCC any new power, because it would be odd to give 
OCC different power over the branches -- this only 
applies to the branches -- different power to the 
branches than over the branches than over the banks, 
different, more extensive power over consumer protection 
and fair lending than other kinds of bank enforcement. 
This was a provision dealing with branches and consumer 
protection and fair lending that said to OCC:  You still 
have that authority and you should exercise it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we come to the New 

York Attorney General.  I see your argument that there's 
a certain incongruity between saying private attorneys 
general okay, but no public attorney general.  But on 
the other hand, the attorney general starts out by 
asking for bank books and records.  And high on the list 
of visitorial powers is the authority to demand the 
bank's books and records.

 So why isn't that -- his preliminary 

investigation at least, why doesn't that fit within the 
visitorial power bundle?

MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, because you can look 
at books and records under various authorities.  Books 
and -- you can look at books and records under your 
visitorial authority, if you are the supervisor and have 
the relationship to the bank that a licensing or 
chartering authority has and you are looking at them for 
no particular cause.  Or you can look at books and 
records if you have a civil suit against the bank and 
you are engaging in discovery that is -- or for that 
matter a criminal prosecution against the bank, and 
ancillary to that discovery is required; or in Guthrie, 
the inquiry -- the looking at books and records was 
pursuant to a statutory authority for shareholders to 
look at books and records.

 So the simple fact of a physical act of 

looking -- or a legal act of looking at books and 
records doesn't tell you whether visitorial authority is 
being exercised.  Visitorial authority has long been 
understood as a whole regime of oversight.  Watters 
involved a visitorial regime that was ancillary to 
licensing.  The earlier visitorial regimes that were 
referenced in the old treatise tended to involve 
visitorial regimes that were established ancillary to 
chartering, back when corporate charters had limited 
purposes, the way banks do still, but most corporate

charters, most corporate certificates of incorporation 
don't anymore.

 So the fact that books and records are being 

examined is neither here nor there on the question 
whether the visitorial power that is referenced in 484 
is -- is being exercised.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  There is an historic 

reason for thinking that Congress would be more 
concerned about States exercising visitorial powers than 
they would be about private attorneys general or private 
lawyers.  This goes back to McCulloch v. Maryland. 
National banks were always targeted by the States.  They 
weren't typically targeted by private attorneys.  So 
that incongruity doesn't strike me as terribly 
significant.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, the suggestion is made 
that 484, and there is some historical basis for it, was 
-- was meant to protect national banks against --
against, hostile States, which I guess is what you are 
suggesting, rather than hostile private people.  But 
actually what it was meant to do was assign 
responsibility for the supervision of these new 
entities -- there hadn't been banks like this, private 
banks which were nevertheless federally chartered. 
Before that there was the National Bank that was at

issue in McCulloch v Maryland, and to exclude the States 
from asserting the authority to do audits, to do regular 
banking examinations, which actually one senator had 
proposed the States be permitted to do and that was 
rejected.

 I would say the concern about State 

hostility was apparently much reduced by 1869, not much 
after this statute was passed, when this Court in 
National Bank v. Kentucky upheld the power of the States 
not just to tax shareholders on their shares, but to 
require the national banks to help, to require the 
national banks to pay the tax that was due from those 
shareholders in order to assist in collection.  And the 
Court -- McCulloch was cited to the Court and the Court 
said it saw no possibility here, unlike in McCulloch, 
that the State would somehow use its authority in this 
way to incapacitate the banks or impair them by 
eliciting their help to collect a valid tax.

 There actually had been some thought when 
the national banks were first created that they would, 
in the marketplace, drive State banks out of existence, 
but they didn't.  And the story has been one 
legislatively of maintaining competitive equality 
between them, not of hostility.  So --

a little bit about Chevron?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Whatever the 

arguments may be on the merits, it's not clear to me 
that visitorial powers has an unambiguous meaning that 
would pre-empt the authority of the OCC to explain it to 
us.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, I'd say two thing 

about that.  484 may have some ambiguity about it.  I 
think it is not ambiguous as to the matters covered by 
this regulation.  Visitorials have -- visitorial powers 
have never been understood to include discrete acts of 
law enforcement by a jurisdiction that neither has nor 
asserts supervisory relationship, the kind of 
supervisory relationship that the chartering or 
licensing sovereign has.  So I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  What do you say about the 

quotations in the -- the brief that Mr. Waxman filed, as 
I recall; it may have been the government's brief --

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- which -- which do have 

references to visitorial powers as including general 
conformance to the law.  Those are not universal 
provisions, but they -- they were certainly understood 
in some cases.

MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, the strongest 

quotations that his brief mentioned several times come 
from Blackstone.  He talks about inquiring into all 
misbehaviors of the supervised visited corporation. 
Those comments are made in a time and place when there 
was only one sovereign, not the distinctive federalism 
we have today, and so there was no need to distinguish 
between the visitorial, the distinctly visitorial powers 
of the sovereign, and the coexisting police powers of 
another sovereign.  There was no --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but there was -- there 

was a point in -- in distinguishing the visitorial 
powers that Blackstone, in the cases Blackstone was 
referring to, and those for example that would apply 
solely to -- to religious or originally religious 
foundations like Oxford and Cambridge colleges and so 
on.  So there -- there seems to have been a reason to 
understand the distinction.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, I think that the point 

about Blackstone's comment to distinguish -- the point 
about the distinction between the charitable 
corporations and the public non-charitable corporations 
is that it may well be that the sovereign was enforcing 
not just the charter, but the laws of the sovereign with 
respect to that State.  It simply --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But he didn't need 

visitorial powers to do that.  I mean, the sovereign had 
that by virtue of the general law.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Yes, but the sovereign might 

do it in many different -- a supervisor might do it in 
many different ways, just as OCC here claims to enforce 
law not by going into court --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought that was your 
position, that the -- that the visitation authority 
includes the power to enforce general laws.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  The general laws of the 

visitor, of the sovereign.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of the sovereign.  But that 

a separate action to enforce the laws of the sovereign 
does not necessarily mean that visitorial powers are 
being exercised.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  That is correct.  That is 

correct.  That is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So there would be no 

inconsistency, if you believe that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  One thing --
MS. UNDERWOOD:  That's --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  One thing puzzled me about 

this.  They are not pre-empting any New York laws; is 
that correct?

MS. UNDERWOOD:  They're pre-empting --

that's correct.  They are preempting our ability to 
enforce any laws.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Did we ever -- do we have 

any precedents dealing with the question whether 
preemption of the right to enforce a valid law is 
appropriate?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, this Court in, for 
example, St. Louis said that when the Federal and the 
State prohibition were the same, that is, a bank 
couldn't branch at that time or couldn't interstate 
branch, the -- and the -- and State tried to enforce 
both provisions -- they were the same, but the State 
tried to enforce both the Federal charter limitation and 
the State law, this Court said the State could not 
enforce the Federal charter, because that was the 
prerogative of the chartering visitor, but that it could 
enforce the State prohibition.  And it said that 
separating -- if the law is valid and can be validly 
applied, then it's virtually unthinkable to separate the 
authority to enforce it from the application of the law.
 This Court said that in -- in St. Louis; it 
-- actually it said it in -- in Easton, which went the 
other way.  That is to say, Easton was a criminal 
prosecution of a bank officer for taking deposits

knowing the bank was insolvent.  Prosecution under State 
law.  And this Court said that the law itself had to be 
preempted.  Wasn't clear exactly what Federal law on the 
subject was.  The Court said there must be some Federal 
law in this area, but we can't afford to have 
conflicting laws, so it's substantively pre-empted.  But 
the Court also said, if it were valid, it would be 
unthinkable to bar the State from enforcing it.  And 
that is the correct way, we think, to approach this 
problem.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it -- could they --

could the Federal authorities pre-empt the State law, in 
your opinion?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, no, because Congress 

has said to the contrary.  Congress has said, that's why 
they didn't -- presumably why they didn't do it that 
way.  Congress has said State law shall apply.  So I 
think this is an area where Congress clearly had in mind 
that there would be, not broad pre-emption of this kind, 
but the laws would apply.  But that it --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but -- I'm 
sorry, but it certainly is pre-empted with respect to 
visitorial powers.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Yes.  That is correct.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 FOR THE RESPONDENT OFFICE OF
 THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY
 MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 To explain the threat that the OCC believes 

the State's enforcement regime poses to the national 
banking system and OCC's administration of that system, 
I would like to begin by going back to a colloquy 
between Ms. Underwood and Justice Breyer near the 
beginning of the argument.

 And Justice Breyer raised the possibility 
that a myriad of State attorneys general would file --
would pursue similar antidiscrimination claims, and Ms. 
Underwood's response was there really would be no 
problem because they are all applying the same 
substantive standard.  And I think at a very high level 
of generality that is so; that is, the Federal statute

and the State statute both say no discrimination on the 
basis of race in extensions of credit.  But I think when 
you get to the way in which the statutes are 
administered, there is at least the potential for 
significant differences, because --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, wait a minute.  I --
this is state law.  And if the State supreme court has 
said that the statute means a certain thing and that 
certain thing is a little bit different from what the 
Federal antidiscrimination law is, I assume that the 
Federal Government in applying State law has to -- has 
to take that difference into account, doesn't it?

 MR. STEWART:  We would --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The Federal Government 
doesn't -- doesn't have the right to alter State law.

 MR. STEWART:  The Federal Government 

wouldn't have the right to alter State law.  The Federal 
Government would have the authority to make its own 
assessment of whether the State law was pre-empted based 
upon those distinctions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I thought it is a 

given in this case -- and tell me if I am wrong on this 
-- that the State substantive law is not pre-empted. 
You refer, I think, to enforcement pre-emption; that is, 
the State law is governing law.  But the only enforcer

is Federal authority; and if that's so, is there any 
other -- in all of Federal-State relations, any other 
law where the State as sovereign can prescribe but 
cannot enforce?

 MR. STEWART:  I give two examples from the 

national banking system, itself.  The first is the 
Riegle-Neal amendments, which Justice Souter was 
alluding to.  And the amendments don't simply say that 
OCC shall enforce non-pre-empted State laws.  It says 
that those laws shall be enforced by the Comptroller of 
the Currency.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But do you -- do you agree 
that -- that it is possible to read the "shall" both as 
-- as an unequivocal grant of power to OCC, but not 
necessarily as an exclusive ground?

 MR. STEWART:  I don't think so with the 

"shall" in combination with the passive voice.  That is, 
if you had a statute that said a certain category of 
suits shall be adjudicated by the Court of Federal 
Claims, I think that would mean not simply that the 
Court of Federal Claims would be required to adjudicate 
them if a case was brought before it, but I think that 
would unmistakably identify the Court of Federal Claims 
as the exclusive tribunal --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but if you have a

situation in which the OCC, say, has very limited 
personnel -- they only have ten people in their 
enforcement division, for example -- and Congress 
thought they have to get more, wouldn't it be 
appropriate in that background to say, you shall start 
enforcing?  And that wouldn't necessarily mean you are 
excluding States from also enforcing.

 MR. STEWART:  I agree that if the statute 

simply -- if the statute used the active voice and said 
the OCC shall enforce these laws, there would be a 
better argument that the OCC's authority was not 
exclusive.  But when the statute said -- says these laws 
shall be enforced by the Comptroller of the Currency, I 
think the clear implication is this is the exclusive 
mechanism by which the laws --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't see any difference 

whatever in that regard between using the active and 
passive.

 MR. STEWART:  Well, let me give you another 
example from the national banking system, and that is 12 
U.S.C. 85.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I want you to come back.  I 

-- I won't stop -- I don't want to stop you from doing 
that, but I want to come back to this.  Do you -- do you 
want to go on to your second example, or do you want to

--

MR. STEWART:  Let me just give you a second 
example very quickly.  12 U.S.C. section 85, which was 
an issue in Smiley, deals with the maximum rate of 
interest that national banks may charge, and it says 
that they may charge as much as the law of the State in 
which they are located allows and no more.  And that is 
a similar system in that to determine the maximum rate 
of interest that the bank may charge, you look to State 
law.  You defer to the choice of the State legislature, 
but the enforcement regime with respect to 
administrative enforcement is exclusively Federal.  It's 
only the Federal authorities that can go after --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's because --

because it's picking a rate.  It's not saying there is 
the Federal law and it has this rate, and the State law 
that has that rate.  Here, the Equal Credit Opportunity 
Act, a Federal Act, undoubtedly applies.  And that is 
proper Federal -- Federal law enforced by the Federal 
authorities.

 The State law, as this picture is drawn for 
us, is applicable.  It's substantive law applicable to 
these banks, but only the Federal authority can enforce 
it.  That seems passing strange.  And do you have an 
example outside the -- the two you gave us in the

National Bank Act where the State prescribes but the 
Federal authorities enforce?

 MR. STEWART:  Well, another example would be 

the Similar Crimes Act, which provides for the 
incorporation of State law with respect to --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's not State law 
applying of its own force, just as your second example 
was not State law applying of its own force.  It was 
State law that had been converted into Federal law by 
the Federal Government's adoption of it.

 MR. STEWART:  Those provisions --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a different 

situation.

 MR. STEWART:  Those provisions do accomplish 

incorporation of State law as Federal law.  But this 
Court has repeatedly said, most recently in Watters, 
that State law applies to national banks only insofar as 
Congress shall see fit to permit it.  So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is your concern that 
-- not with the substantive State law, but that leaving 
enforcement to the States would cause particular 
problems?  I mean there may be a State law provision 
that says you shall do this, and the way the attorney 
general elects to enforce it is by shutting the bank 
down, jailing the bank officers, doing all sorts of

things that -- that the -- the Federal Government may 
not consider appropriate.

 MR. STEWART:  That is certainly true, that 
the -- the State's exercise of remedial discretion may 
be different from the Federal Government's.  But even 
before that stage, if you look at the letters in the 
Joint Appendix that the New York Attorney General's 
Office sent to the national banks in question, basically 
the thrust of the letters was:  We have identified what 
we believe to be troubling statistical disparities in 
terms of the terms on which the credit was offered to 
applicants of different races.  If those disparities are 
not satisfactorily explained, that it -- you may be in 
violation of State fair lending laws.  Therefore, give 
us a wide variety of information that would allow us to 
determine whether you have a satisfactory explanation.

 And I think it's clear that had this process 

been allowed to run its course, what the New York 
Attorney General's Office was going to do was assess the 
bank's own criteria for making lending decisions to 
decide whether those criteria were suitable and decide, 
therefore, whether they provided a satisfactory 
explanation for the statistical disparities that had 
been observed.

 And once the New York A.G. is in the

business of passing upon the adequacy of the bank's 
lending criteria, he is right on the -- the OCC's --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You are arguing for 

conflict pre-emption.  I mean that's a -- that's a 
different issue than, say, that the -- the State law 
shouldn't apply.  But don't tell me the State law 
applies, but only the Federal Government is -- what 
incentive does the Federal Government have to enforce 
State law?

 MR. STEWART:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It -- it has so much spare 
time after enforcing Federal law that it's -- it's going 
to be worrying about State law?

 MR. STEWART:  Well, the point that has been 
made at various times in the argument that the State law 
basically tracks Federal law, I think, is an answer to 
that question; that is, whatever incentive the Federal 
Government might have to enforce idiosyncratic features 
of State law that didn't have a Federal analogue.  Here 
the State law in question prohibits discriminatory 
practices that are already prohibited by Federal law. 
So whether OCC and HUD set out to enforce State law, if 
they are vigorously enforcing Federal law, they will in 
the course of doing that vindicate the State's 
prerogatives.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is there any -- is there 
any legislative history whatever to the effect that at 
the time 36(f)(1)(B) was adopted -- to the effect that 
its effect was to pre-empt State enforcement for --

MR. STEWART:  They -- they don't say it in 

-- with quite that degree of clarity, but there is a 
colloquy quoted in the -- the brief for the Clearing 
House between -- I believe it's Senator D'Amato and --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Senator D'Amato and --
MR. STEWART:  And it is -- it is to the 

effect that Senator D'Amato expresses the concern that 
this may subject the -- the national banks in their 
branch activities to State supervision.  And the 
response is that's not the case.  That will happen with 
branches of State banks, but with respect to branches of 
national banks the supervision will be by the OCC.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but the -- the problem 

I have with that is, as a -- as a kind of clear 
statement of -- of something which is -- is -- would be 
extraordinary -- is that it talks in terms of 
supervision.  It doesn't use the -- my recollection is 
it doesn't use the magic word "enforcement."

 And I would have thought that if in the 

course of that colloquy the -- the statement had been 
made:  The States will not have the authority to enforce

this, that there would have been rather a dust-up.  And 
there wasn't.  It's kind of a "dog that didn't bark" 
argument.  And, therefore, if -- if there is uncertainty 
as to how to construe 36(f)(1)(B), I'm not sure that I 
-- I don't think the legislative history supports your 
exclusivity view.

 MR. STEWART:  Well, section 36(f)(1)(A) 
refers to a very limited category of State laws that 
include State fair lending laws and said these laws will 
not be pre-empted unless they would be pre-empted with 
respect to national banks generally.  And then 
36(f)(1)(B) says the laws in that preceding paragraph 
shall be enforced by the comptroller of the Currency. 
And so even if the colloquy used the term "supervision," 
the focus of the statutory language was -- was on a 
pretty narrow category of laws.

 I would like also to refer the Court to 12 

U.S.C. 484(b), which I think is relevant here, and it is 
on page 1a of the appendix to the government's brief. 
And it is an express exception to the general rule 
against the exercise of visitorial powers.

 And it says, "Notwithstanding subsection (a) 
of this section, lawfully authorized State auditors and 
examiners may at reasonable times and upon reasonable 
notice to a bank review its records solely to ensure

compliance with applicable State unclaimed property or 
escheat laws."

 Now, the basic thrust of --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Does that mean -- when they 

say "review records," does that mean that the State 
auditors in effect can walk into the bank, as 
distinguished from what we have here, in which the bank 
is being requested to produce excerpts from records?
 MR. STEWART:  I think that would be the 

implication of the provision, but the significant point 
for our purposes is that it refers solely to ensure 
compliance with applicable State unclaimed property 
ordinances and laws.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you this 

question?  Naturally, if it's State laws, clearly they 
can look at, but what if New York was trying to enforce 
its discrimination laws in an employment context or in 
context where they said you are charging minority 
depositors -- giving them lower rates of interest than 
you give Caucasian depositors?  Would they have -- would 
the discrimination and the rates of interests paid on 
deposits -- assume that was the question.  Would you 
make the same argument, if that was what New York had 
alleged?

 MR. STEWART:  Yes, we would because that

would be going to the banks' federally authorized 
banking --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  All you would have to just 

look at the records.  You can tell from the records 
whether people of different classes are paying different 
-- are getting different rates on their deposits.

 MR. STEWART:  I mean, it might be that in 
that instance the discrimination would be unlikely to 
persist, but the basic --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  It would be unlikely to 
persist.  Maybe it's an unlikely example.  But you are 
suggesting that that would also interfere with the 
Comptroller's ability to regulate the banks?

 MR. STEWART:  Yes, the way the regulation is 
written, it speaks to State efforts to enforce laws that 
are directed at the bank's federally authorized banking 
activities.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So do you think the same 
answer whether -- Justice Stevens mentioned employment 
discrimination.  The State has reason to believe the 
bank is discriminating in its employment policies, and 
it wants to examine certain employment records in that 
connection.  Would you say also that, although New York 
can prescribe its antidiscrimination in employment law, 
it can't enforce it?

MR. STEWART:  No, the regulation does sweep 

more categorically with respect to inspection of bank 
records.  New York would not be forbidden to file 
lawsuits to enforce its employment discrimination laws.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Does any of this bring us 
back to the colloquy you began -- began with -- between 
Justice Breyer and Ms. Underwood with reference to many 
States?

 MR. STEWART:  Yes, a certain --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You -- you began on that, 

and I never did hear --

MR. STEWART:  The part of the point I was 

trying to make was, even if the substantive State law on 
its face is not pre-empted because it is identical to 
the Federal law, once we get to the enforcement stage 
where the relevant enforcement agency is saying your 
statistical disparity constitutes a violation because it 
is not justified by sound banking practices, inevitably 
that judgment is going to put the State regulator in the 
business of doing what OCC does.  And if 50 different 
State attorneys general have slightly different ideas of 
what constitutes an adequate banking justification for 
lending criteria that produces statistical disparity, 
then the problem is multiplied.  Then --

pre-emption, and that goes to the -- to the law.  You 
shouldn't have a separate State law that -- that 
provides a separate standard that conflicts with the 
Federal standard.  So you pre-empt the law.  You don't 
say the law is in effect, but the State can't enforce 
it.  That's a weird way to solve that problem.

 MR. STEWART:  Well, the other point I would 
make about this is that it is accurate to say that under 
the Federal regime the State is entirely disabled from 
enforcing its own fair lending law.  As Ms. Underwood 
alluded to in the opening part of the argument and as 
the Petitioner's reply brief explains at pages 25 and 
26, the Fair Housing Act does contain a mechanism by 
which a State agency -- in the case of New York, it's 
the Division of Human Resources --- can be certified by 
HUD to enforce the State fair lending laws.

 But that certification entails two different 
steps:  First, HUD has to determine that the substantive 
State law is -- I believe it's substantially equivalent 
to the comparable Federal law.  And, second, HUD 
monitors the performance of the enforcing agency, the 
particular agency under State law that carries out that 
responsibility, and HUD can thereby make sure that 
enforcement as well as the substance of the law are 
consistent with Federal law.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Mr. Waxman.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 THE CLEARING HOUSE ASSOCIATION, L.L.C.

 MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Section 484 plainly has pre-emptive effect, 
and what it pre-empts, quoting this Court's decision in 
Watters, is, quote, "the State's investigative and 
enforcement machinery," close quote.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Waxman, your mention 

of Watters, which has been mentioned in the briefs, I 
think is an inaccurate description of what that opinion 
held.  Watters dealt with a regime that was indisputably 
visitorial.  It was a registration regime, where annual 
fees were paid, annual reports were filed with the State 
financial agency, and the State monitor could go into a 
lending organization any time for any reason without any 
suspicion of wrongdoing.  The only -- so everyone agreed 
that was a visitorial regime.

 The sole question was whether the banks --

the national bank's operating subsidiary was to be 
equated with a division of the national bank.  That was 
the only question provided the Court.

MR. WAXMAN:  Oh, I -- I quite agree, and I 
did not mean to suggest that this Court's decision in 
Watters, you know, the holding in Watters concludes the 
outcome of this case.  But this Court, in section II A 
of Watters -- and we did have a State statutory regime 
that dealt, yes, with licensure but also with 
examination, supervision, and enforcement, including 
judicial enforcement -- this Court repeatedly described 
that what was pre-empted is -- and this goes to, I 
think, a point that Justice Scalia was making -- was not 
substantive pre-emption.  There are substantive 
pre-emption provisions that are addressed in other 
sections of the Act, including the one that was at issue 
in Smiley.  What is exempted, this Court said again and 
again, is the State's enforcement and investment and --
investigative and enforcement machinery, or its 
examination and enforcement authority, and that those --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that was in the 
context of a State law that says, mortgage lending 
institution, you may not lend unless you register and do 
all the rest.  That was the context of Watters.  And I 
do not think that excerpts from that opinion should be 
taken out of that context, which was:  You can't be in 
this business unless you register with us.

 MR. WAXMAN:  The question in the case is

whether or not what the Attorney General here sought to 
do is the exercise of a visitorial power.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Can I -- can I take what 

Justice Ginsburg just said, and give you a thought that 
I am interested in your response to?

 I haven't seen the letter from the Attorney 

General.  Is the whole thing in the record?

 MR. WAXMAN:  There -- the letters are in the 

record in the Joint Appendix.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now, reading Judge 

Parker's description of it, it seemed to me that what he 
had said was that there are statistical disparities 
between interest rates and race.  Well, as long as, most 
unfortunately, income is correlated with race, with 
minorities being towards the bottom, of course such 
statistical disparities will exist, some legitimate, 
some not.  So if the only basis for getting this 
information is that allegation, it's hard to see how 
this differs from the case that Justice Ginsburg put.

 MR. WAXMAN:  Yes, that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But it might be quite a 
different case, if they had gone into court and found 
individuals who were really getting different interest 
rates and who really seemed very, very similar, but for 
race.  But at that point, they'd have to go get this

same information, because that's where they would find 
whether that prima facie case was right or wrong.

 MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you see what I'm doing?
 MR. WAXMAN:  Right.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm dividing the matter 

vertically, instead of, say, horizontally --

MR. WAXMAN:  I'd like to --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and I want to know if 

that's possible.

 MR. WAXMAN:  I'd like to address both the 
vertical and horizontal axes of what I perceive to be 
your question.  One is the distinction that this Court 
drew in Guthrie, where it said there is a -- there's a 
huge distinction in determining what's a visitorial 
power between a private individual seeking to vindicate 
a deprivation of his or her traditional property right, 
which is what was at issue there, and what the Court --
what this Court said was the public right of visitation, 
which it also explained was the State's, quote, 
"enforcing observance of its laws and regulations." 
There is a public and private distinction, and 
visitation deals with the former.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sure, there is.
 MR. WAXMAN:  It deals with the sovereign.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would -- would you 

acknowledge, counsel, that there is a difference between 
enforcing State laws through visitation and enforcing 
State laws apart from visitation?  And what Waters 
involved was enforcing State laws through visitation. 
Of course, you can do that through -- through visitation 
powers, but you can also do apart from that by bringing 
a lawsuit or whatever.

 MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Breyer, I'll get to the 

horizontal axis in a moment.  I'm afraid I'm going to 
forget --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm sorry, did I skip over 

an axis here.

 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I didn't mean to.
 MR. WAXMAN:  Let me go -- let me go to your 

axis first, which is to say that anything that is a 
visitorial power can also be interpreted as a police or 
enforcement power, and what Congress had in mind -- this 
is legislation that was born in the crucible of the 
Civil War, and what Congress sought to pre-empt was 
State executive action, State examination and 
enforcement action with respect to these newly created, 
very important Federal instrumentalities.  That was 
historically done, this Court explained in Guthrie, and

Chancellor Kent and Blackstone and many other 
authorities agree was historically done through access 
to the courts; and in fact what Dean Pound in his 
oft-cited article about visitorial powers said, was --
he said, and this is discussed at pages 16 through 18 of 
the amicus brief of the Financial Services Roundtable --
what he called, quote, "the leading case for visitorial 
powers in equity" was a case called the Attorney General 
v Chicago and Northwest Railroad decided in 1874, in 
which the Attorney General of Wisconsin was seeking to 
require this railroad to comply with the State's 
mandated rate schedule.  That was a visitorial power, 
even though you could also call it a law enforcement 
power.

 Now, Justice Breyer, on the horizontality of 
your question:  This is not a suit in which the New York 
Attorney General is trying to enforce its employment 
discrimination laws or its health laws or its zoning 
laws.  The attorney general wants the loan records of 
national banks, and he wants them so that he can 
evaluate for himself whether the banks are making proper 
judgments about how to market and how to price their 
loans.

letter, the Attorney General of New York said, "We have 
conducted 500 interviews with people who have borrowed 
money from you, and on the basis of all these interviews 
we have drawn these tentative conclusions that there is 
discrimination.  We would like to give you an 
opportunity to explain all of this by showing us your 
records."  And they say no, we won't do it.  Would they 
then be pre-empted from bringing their lawsuit?

 MR. WAXMAN:  Yes, they would.  And in fact 

--

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Even though they didn't 

have to look at any bank record to make their prima 
facie case?

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well, their -- the OCC in the 

preamble to its regulations does draw a distinction 
between State enforcement actions and a pure State 
declaratory judgment, quote, "as to the meaning of the 
applicable law."  This is a case that -- in which --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I am asking about a 

hypothetical.  I understand your argument here.  But I 
just don't understand how your argument would apply to 
my hypothetical.  But I think the regulation would apply 
to the hypothetical.

certainly in the core, but a -- a State authority,

whether it's the State banking commission or the State 
human rights commission or the State attorney general, 
or for that matter another Federal Government authority, 
that seeks to call a national bank to account for the 
manner in which it is conducting an expressly 
designated, allocated banking power is an exercise of 
visitorial power.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it isn't -- it isn't 

if --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  He doesn't even want to 

look at your books; he just wants to prove it by people 
who have been borrowing money and compare them with --
among them they can orally.

 MR. WAXMAN:  I don't --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  I don't understand why 

that would be visitorial power.

 MR. WAXMAN:  The -- the State's enforcement 

of any law that is directed at a national bank's 
authorized banking powers is a visitorial power.  And 
the fact that it may also be characterized as a police 
power or a lawsuit is -- is interesting, but not what's 
at stake.

 What Congress aimed at -- Congress in 1864 
knew -- the Supreme Court said, Blackstone and Kent had 
said -- that visitorial powers on civil corporations are

exercised A, by the sovereign, not by a private 
individual, and B, are almost always exercised through 
access to the courts.  Whether they are invoking the 
courts' authority to seek records or not, that was the 
historical core of what visitorial powers --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So one could say, yes, 

the Federal authorities have visitorial powers, and they 
can go to court.  But we have here that the State can 
prescribe, not a supervisory regime, but -- fair 
lending.  And the State wants to go into court and say 
the bank is violating the State substantive law, which 
is applicable.

 MR. WAXMAN:  That's correct.  And a 

sovereign taking a national bank into court with respect 
to not any old general law, but with respect to the 
conduct of its specifically authorized national banking 
powers, is the exercise of visitorial powers.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, is it --
MR. WAXMAN:  That was the reason for the 

courts of justice exception.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Is it the exercise of 

visitorial powers, or is it an action which covers the 
same subject that an exercise of visitorial powers would 
do?  Let me -- let me propose a distinction, and I don't 
know whether this is sound.  You know -- I mean, you

tell me.

 I would suppose that if someone with 

visitorial powers dealing with discrimination in lending 
brought an action against the bank or tried to enforce 
it against the bank and couldn't do so in any other way 
then by going to court, it would go to court, and it 
would say court, tell this institution that I have some 
responsibility for, to obey the law.

 But I also assume that if the Attorney 

General of New York, which is not a visitor, enforces 
the law, it would go into court and say tell them to 
obey the law and to pay damages or recompense of some 
sort to these people whom they have wronged.

 The subject matter of each suit is the same, 
but the relief that is being requested and the judicial 
power that is being exercised is different in these two 
cases.  Is that a fair distinction?

 MR. WAXMAN:  I don't think -- I think that 
if I understood your question, and I may not have -- if 
a suit by a private individual or a group of private 
individuals seeking to indicate the deprivation of a 
private traditional right is not visitorial; but if the 
State, either directly in the enforcement of its general 
laws or seeking to protect the people of its State, goes 
into court or asks for records or anything else, it is

exercising a traditional visitorial power.

 May -- while I have your attention, may I 

also go back to your question about 36(f) and 
Riegle-Neal, because there is yet -- there are other 
additional indicators that when the Congress said in 
36(f) that these State laws shall be enforced by the 
OCC, it was mandatory and exclusive.

 First of all, the colloquy that was 

discussed and is reported in our brief, I think at page 
26, does use the word "enforce" as well as "supervise," 
but more to the point --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  That is the one with 

Senator D'Amato?

 MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.  Riegle-Neal -- here's the 

most important point.  That provision that we've been 
were looking at had a cognate, had an analogue that was 
also enforced.  Riegle-Neal basically said out-of-state 
banks can now branch bank.  When they do so, they are 
subject to these four categories of State laws.  The 
provision we have been looking, which was section 102, 
said with respect to enforcement of those laws, the OCC 
shall enforce it.  But section 105 said where the 
out-of-state bank is a State-chartered bank -- and this 
is reported, I think it's at section 1820(h) of title 
12, when it's a State-chartered bank, the State

authorities of the host State shall enforce the laws.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Uh-huh.
 MR. WAXMAN:  So it enacted a dual regime 
that demonstrates exactly what Congress had in mind, 
which is that there would be one regulator making the 
kind of judgments about, okay, there is a disparity, but 
let's look at credit history, let's look at the loan to 
equity value, let's look at income versus debt incurred, 
and all these factors that the OCC and the Fed have 
explained have to go into making a judgment about 
whether or not a particular condition of a particular 
loan violates Federal law, whether it the Fair Housing 
Act or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Fed's 
regulation B.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Waxman, you are 

talking about lending.  And like depositing, those are 
core banking activities, but today national banks have a 
lot of incidental -- they have authority to do things 
incidental to banking.  Does your restriction of State 
enforcement extend to those matters incidental to 
banking?

 MR. WAXMAN:  May I answer?  I believe that 

it would if those incidental authorities are in fact 
authorized, approved and regulated by the OCC, but this 
case doesn't require you to address it, because this is

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

Five minutes, Ms. Underwood.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  A couple of -- four points 
or so.  To the extent the subpoena is perceived -- or 
this discovery request -- it didn't even proceed to this 
subpoena stage -- is perceived to be burdensome, State 
laws allows a motion to quash a subpoena for inadequate 
basis or for harassment.  So there is control in the 
State courts over anything that is perceived to be 
excessive.

 Two, States have been enforcing consumer 

protection and fair lending laws since the mid '70s when 
they were enacted.  The Center for Responsive Lending 
amicus brief has a discussion of that history of 
enforcement.  The Conway affidavit at the Joint Appendix 
at 152 has a description of New York's enforcement 
activities between 1975 and 2004.  And the Lawyers' 
Committee for Civil Rights also goes over that history.

 And they have been enforcing other laws 

against national banks for even longer, antitrust laws, 
branching laws, idiosyncratic laws of various sorts with 
no evidence that this has impaired the functions of the

banks.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Underwood, I -- I 

forgot the response you made in your brief.  I know you 
did make some response to subsection (b) of section 484. 
How do you -- how do you explain that?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  In the exceptions?
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  Why -- why do they 

list those exceptions, unless one would think that 
everything is covered?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Virtually every exception 

was enacted to resolve a controversy over whether 
something was visitorial or not.  In fact, just as in 
Guthrie, where this Court said the shareholders' suit 
for bank records was not visitorial, or alternatively, 
if it is, it is covered by the courts of justice 
exception.  So too, each of those exceptions involved a 
situation where there was a claim, an incorrect claim, 
but a claim that the action would be banned as 
visitorial, so Congress --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, why isn't 

it a complete answer to what I agree is a somewhat 
unusual situation of pre-empting enforcement but not the 
substance of law that its enforcement that raises the 
concerns?  That the Federal Government thinks the State 
law is fine, but when you get attorneys general

enforcing it in a particular way, that's what causes the 
problem.  And I mean, the problem arises in a lot of 
areas.  Even within the Federal Government, the FBI and 
DEA have different ways of enforcing that might conflict 
with each other.  Why doesn't that make perfect sense?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well, even without 

enforcement of State law, OCC would not have exclusive 
control of enforcement of discrimination laws against 
national banks.  So the idea that State enforcement 
poses some special problem to interfere with that 
exclusive control is just a mistake.  That's not the way 
Congress set it up.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, why -- why is it 

a mistake?  Why can't Congress or the OCC think that 
that's where the difficulties are going to arise?  In 
other words, it's kind of a less intrusive approach, and 
saying, well, you can have your State law but we are 
concerned about enforcement, so we are going to be the 
ones that enforce it.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  I didn't mean it's a mistake 
of policy.  I meant it's a mistake in description of the 
regime Congress created.

 HUD has administrative enforcement.  DOJ has 
litigation enforcement.  This is a Federal law.  Private 
parties can enforce Federal fair housing law.  States

can probably enforce Federal fair housing laws, too, as 
-- patriotic for the victim.  The Second Circuit set 
aside that part of the injunction, the part that barred 
New York from enforcing Federal law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So your answer is 
because they have different entities that can enforce 
it, they are sort of in for a penny, in for a pound?  If 
you let anybody else enforce it, you have got to let 
everybody else enforce it?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  No, I don't say that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Including the 

entities that have historically have targeted national 
banks?

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  I don't make that argument. 

What I say is that is strong evidence that Congress 
didn't intend to give OCC exclusive control here.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suppose if -- if 

enforcement pre-emption is the lesser step, we probably 
ought to revise our jurisprudence so as not to tread any 
more heavily than we have to upon the States so that 
where there is conflict pre-emption, all we should say 
is the State law is not invalidated, it is simply not 
enforceable?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I suppose the 
question would not be what we think is a good idea but 
what Congress has done.  And here the OCC has 
interpreted what Congress has done is to make exclusive 
the OCC regulation only with respect to enforcement.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would suppose you 
would thank them for that rather than criticize them for 
it.

 MS. UNDERWOOD:  I think that in many ways 

leaving the law intact and denying the States the 
ability to enforce it is more intrusive then simply 
finding pre-emption.  In any event, Congress made it 
quite clear that it didn't want pre-emption.

 I think my time is up.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Ms. Underwood.  The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:18 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
