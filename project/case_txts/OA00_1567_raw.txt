CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 00-1567, Cornelius P. Young v. the United


States. 


Mr. Clark. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GRENVILLE CLARK, III


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. CLARK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


This is a case about discharging taxes in a


bankruptcy proceeding. 


The Bankruptcy Code provides that income taxes


that are more than 3 years old are discharged in a


bankruptcy proceeding.  In the petitioner's case, the


Youngs filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding in March of


1997, some 3 years, 5 months after they had filed their


1992 income tax return in October of 1993.  The Bankruptcy


Code provides, on this simple set of facts, that the


Youngs' 1992 income tax obligation is discharged.  The


operative code sections are 727, 523, and 507, which I set


out at pages 10 and 11 of my brief. 


QUESTION:  Well, they also filed an earlier


bankruptcy petition, didn't they? 


MR. CLARK:  They did indeed, Your Honor.  That

was filed in May of 1996.  It was a Chapter 13 proceeding. 


It lasted just short of 6 months, and the -- the argument


that the IRS has tendered in this case and below is that


you subtract out the 6 months they are in the prior


proceeding from the calculation of the 3 years, 5 months,


and when you do that, you come out with the Youngs ending


up with being only 2 years 11 months away from the 3-year


mark --


QUESTION:  Well, why was the first Chapter 13


petition dismissed? 


MR. CLARK:  It was dismissed at the behest of


the Youngs for a variety of reasons that did not appear in


the record.  During the Chapter 13 proceeding, they had


succeeded in selling their house and paying off mortgages


on the house that had -- they had placed on there.  Later


on in the proceeding, they had gone through the trouble of


engaging special counsel, an attorney Noreen Farr, to do


something which does not appear in the record.  But they


finally decided that they would dismiss the case rather


than go forward with it.  The reasons that they did not --


do not appear in the record. 


They dismissed the case about 3 weeks before


they would have gotten to confirmation of their plan,


which they had submitted earlier in the case. 


QUESTION:  But there was also the fact that they

-- in addition to dismissing the Chapter 13, the day


before that order was entered granting the dismissal at


their request, they started a new bankruptcy proceeding. 


They started a Chapter 7 proceeding, and that way they


were able to stretch out the stay of any effort the


Government might have made to collect the tax.


MR. CLARK:  The -- the bankruptcy -- the Chapter


13 bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed.  The final closing


order in the case was entered in March of 1997.  The


motion that -- or the request, I think, that the Youngs


had filed was in October of 1996, October 23, 1996.  It is


our position that the automatic stay expired as soon as


the case was dismissed and not later when the case was


closed a number of months later.  And I think that is


significant because in our view the IRS was entitled to


restart their enforced collection efforts against the


Youngs --


QUESTION:  Do you have authority for that, for


saying that -- that it's not the date that the bankruptcy


was closed, but some -- the earlier date when they -- when


they made that motion? 


MR. CLARK:  Yes.  It's in the Bankruptcy Code


itself, section 320 -- yes -- I'll have to get the --


QUESTION:  Is the filing of the notice of


dismissal, which was October 23?

 MR. CLARK:  Yes.  It's the filing of the notice


of dismissal, and that we contend is the dismissal. 


What happened subsequent to the -- the filing of


that notice is the Chapter 13 trustee held some funds that


had been paid in.  He sought to apply for an


administrative expense, and that was put on for a hearing


and eventually it was granted.  And then thereafter the


clerk's office closed the case in March of 1997. 


QUESTION:  Did anyone object to the notice of


dismissal? 


MR. CLARK:  Not in a -- not in a Chapter 13


where the debtor seeks dismissal.  The debtor has the


absolute right to seek dismissal of his Chapter 13 case


because it's a voluntary proceeding. 


QUESTION:  You used the term seek dismissal,


move to dismiss in October, and then the proceeding was


actually dismissed in March.  Are you saying that your


simple motion to dismiss is the same thing as having it


dismissed? 


MR. CLARK:  Yes, I am in this situation, Mr.


Chief Justice, because of -- the bankruptcy rules are a


little -- were a little vague at that point in time. 


Whether you seek a dismissal by simply filing a, quote,


request or moving for a dismissal, the rule says that upon


a request for dismissal, the judge shall dismiss it.  In

this particular case, the judge did not actually enter an


order of dismissal.  It simply accepted the dismissal as


entered or requested in October of 1996. 


QUESTION:  Well, this whole sequence of events


seems a bit gimmicky.


MR. CLARK:  Well, if -- if there are gimmicks,


if somebody is trying to manipulate the system, to game


the system, certainly the Government -- any party in


interest who was affected by the gaming, the manipulation


-- can object, can take -- can move to dismiss -- to


convert the case, for example, which --


QUESTION:  I thought there was a finding of good


faith here, wasn't there? 


MR. CLARK:  Yes, there was, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Was it a finding of good faith or --


or a finding that he was making no finding of bad faith?


MR. CLARK:  No.  The -- the judge below, Judge


Vaughn in the Bankruptcy Court, found in favor of the


Government, suggesting that there was a potential, in


similar cases such as this, for abuse or manipulation by


debtors in general.  But in this case, Judge Vaughn had


found that he attributes no bad faith to the Youngs in


this particular situation, and I think that's an important


fact. 


The Government, when it objected to --

 QUESTION:  Is it bad faith to look for a tax


loophole?  I think thought that's what all the tax


attorneys always did. 


MR. CLARK:  It's certainly not in our view bad


faith to look for a tax -- for a way to get a grant of a


discharge of an obligation that you formerly owed.


QUESTION:  Do you think that that's what the


judge meant -- meant by not attributing bad faith?  He


didn't even think that your client was legitimately trying


to take advantage of a tax loophole?  That -- that's what


I took it to mean. 


MR. CLARK:  The case -- Justice Scalia, the case


came before the court, before the Bankruptcy Court, on a


motion for summary judgment by the motion -- by the


Government.  The -- there was no findings of fact as such


other than those that were on summary judgment.  The --


what the -- I see Judge Vaughn has -- as finding is that


he sees no evidence before the court from which he would


infer any manipulative or abusive scheme.


QUESTION:  Well, would it be manipulative or


abusive just to take advantage of the provision of the


statute? 


MR. CLARK:  No, Your Honor, it would not be.


QUESTION:  So, the finding doesn't make any


difference one way or the other, does it?

 MR. CLARK:  When bankruptcy -- bankruptcy


debtors take advantage --


QUESTION:  You're just saying you have a


statutory right to do what you did. 


MR. CLARK:  That's exactly right, Justice --


QUESTION:  Why should we read the statute


regardless, when it's good faith or bad faith, as allowing


the following?  We look back 3 years to see how much money


a bankrupt filer owes the Government.  He's going to have


to pay it.  Let's say it's $100,000.  He dismisses that


after a number of years, the first bankruptcy, then brings


the second bankruptcy proceeding and says, well, if we


look back 3 years from the second one, this $100,000 I


owned -- I owed falls outside that period.  It's simply a


windfall to him because he brought two bankruptcy


proceedings rather than one, and it's a loss to the


Government for no reason other than his having brought two


bankruptcy proceedings rather than one.  It serves no


purpose whatsoever that I can fathom in the bankruptcy


statute, and what purpose is there in reading the statute


to permit such a result? 


MR. CLARK:  Justice Breyer, you would have to


look at what happened in the prior bankruptcy I think to


see why the debtor was able to stay in bankruptcy for the


length of time that the debtor did and thereby supposedly

prevent the Government from collecting taxes from the


debtor. 


A chapter -- usually the prior bankruptcy is a


reorganization bankruptcy, a Chapter 13, possibly a


Chapter 11.  During the Chapter 13 proceeding, that had --


had a long life, the debtor had to propose a plan that had


to pay the taxes that the debtor owed in full over the


life of a plan, whether that be 3 years, 4 years, 5 years,


whatever it was.  The plan has to go to confirmation.  If


the plan is confirmed, all the plan payments that have


accumulated to that point are now paid out to the


Government and to other creditors in accordance with the


plan.  Plan payments that follow on still go to the


Government and to other creditors as designated in the


plan.  The Government is getting money here during the --


during the prior bankruptcy proceeding. 


Yes, a person can file for bankruptcy, submit a


plan.  It might be a 5-year plan.  They get the plan


confirmed.  They make payments for 3 years and then they


elect to dismiss.  That is their right to -- to dismiss.


QUESTION:  Do they get the payments back if


they --


MR. CLARK:  No.  No, Your Honor, they do not. 


The -- the plan payments have been paid to the Government


all throughout the 3-year period.  They have a confirmed

plan.  Once you have confirmation, the confirmation order


releases the money to the -- the payees, the creditors,


including the Government. 


QUESTION:  How much of the -- how much of the


tax liability did the Government receive during the course


of the first bankruptcy?


MR. CLARK:  In the Youngs' case, the Government


did not receive any payments whatsoever.  The Youngs'


Chapter 13 lasted about -- just short of 6 months.  They


had not filed that tax case, that Chapter 13 until 2 and a


half years after they had filed their tax return.  They --


but they did not receive any payment because we did not


get to confirmation in the Youngs' case.


QUESTION:  Did you -- did you seek confirmation?


MR. CLARK:  The confirmation hearing had been


set by the court at the outset of the case, and it was


scheduled for November 15 of --


QUESTION:  But it was -- it was the debtors'


voluntary action that stopped the Government from getting


any payments under that plan. 


MR. CLARK:  It was -- in this particular case,


yes, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  Could the judge --


MR. CLARK:  -- for the -- because they had not


gotten to confirmation.

 QUESTION:  When the debtor asked to have the


Chapter 13 dismissed, could the judge have said, I will


enter the dismissal order, the closure order, but only on


condition that you do not attempt to assert a time bar,


should you -- as everybody knew was -- that was going to


happen, go into a successive bankruptcy proceeding?  Did


-- would the judge have any authority to do that?


MR. CLARK:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  Under, I


think it's section 349 of the Bankruptcy Code which


governs dismissals, the judge certainly has the authority


to put conditions upon the issuance of the dismissal.


QUESTION:  Well, then why is the dismissal


automatic, which is what we talked about at the very


first?


MR. CLARK:  Well, because the debtor -- I think


the procedural problem here is because the request -- the


rules, at least at the point of this request for dismissal


was -- was made, were a little vague as to how you request


or move for a dismissal.


QUESTION:  All right. 


MR. CLARK:  But the debtor has the absolute


right to request the dismissal. 


The effect of the dismissal the judge can impose


a condition on to say, well, yes, we're going to dismiss


the case, but we're going to enter an order that says you

cannot count the 6 months that the Youngs were in


bankruptcy.


QUESTION:  Well, the debtor -- the debtor has a


right to reject that condition and say, if that's the


condition, I don't want to dismiss, I assume.  And if


that's so, then the dismissal is not automatic.  I mean,


you can't have it both ways. 


MR. CLARK:  I don't -- I think the --


QUESTION:  If he has a right to reject that


condition, then once you say the judge may impose a


condition, you have to say that -- that dismissal does not


occur automatically once you request it.


MR. CLARK:  I think in that --


QUESTION:  You can't have it both ways. 


MR. CLARK:  I -- I'm not saying it's -- I think


what I'm saying is that the court has the ability to put a


condition on it.  If the judge -- if the debtor doesn't


wish to accept it, it's going to have to withdraw the


motion to dismiss. 


QUESTION:  Right, and we don't know, until the


judge enters an order of dismissal, whether he's going to


put a condition on it.  So, how can you say the dismissal


is automatic as soon as you request it?


MR. CLARK:  I'm saying it's -- Justice Scalia,


I'm saying it's automatic in the sense that the -- the

debtor has an absolute right, quote/unquote -- and that's


not an absolutely absolute, but the debtor has a right


under Chapter 13 to have his case dismissed.


QUESTION:  No, but -- no, but you say he doesn't


because the judge can say, I'll let you dismiss it if. 


Whereupon, the debtor can say no -- no deal.  So, it's not


an absolute right. 


MR. CLARK:  Well, it's -- I think it is an


absolute right or nearly so.  I don't think that putting a


condition on it makes it less of -- of an absolute right


to dismiss. 


QUESTION:  But it doesn't mean that you can't


equate the date that you file the motion to dismiss with


the termination of the Chapter 13.  It can't be.  If the


judge could put a condition on it, then the -- the 13


proceeding doesn't terminate until the closure order is


entered.


MR. CLARK:  I think the -- well, I don't know


that the judge could withhold or -- or delay the entry of


a dismissal order.  It could put a condition on it that


the time in Chapter 13 won't count against the --


QUESTION:  Let's say we disagree with you and we


find --


QUESTION:  Have you cited any cases in which


this kind of condition was imposed?

 MR. CLARK:  I do not know of any cases where, in


a Chapter 13, a condition has been imposed. 


QUESTION:  So, this is totally speculative,


really, I think.  I would assume if the -- if this problem


has occurred as many times as the Government says it has,


and if the solution that you suggest is available, I would


have thought some judge would have thought of it. 


MR. CLARK:  Well, I think no -- no judge is


going to impose the condition I think under section 349


unless the IRS comes in and makes a motion or brings it to


the attention of the court that --


QUESTION:  But then the lawyers have never had


enough sense to do this, as I understand it. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. CLARK:  Well, they've gone a -- the


Government I think has gone on a different track on -- on


this issue. 


QUESTION:  The answer is no.


MR. CLARK:  The answer is no, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  In -- in all events, let's assume


that we think that the dismissal occurs in -- it would be


March 13.  Does the difference between October and March


make a difference in this case?


MR. CLARK:  No, it does not, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  All right.  So, it doesn't make any

difference. 


MR. CLARK:  This -- we got into this in the


court of appeals a little bit, but it really makes no


difference whatsoever in the computation. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Clark, can I get your


understanding of what you think would be manipulation? 


Because it may have something to do with my view of -- of


this case.  You don't assert that -- that somebody can go


into a Chapter 13 proceeding with the -- with the avowed


intent of not carrying it through to completion and of


dismissing it in order to get the benefit of -- of the --


the shorter lookback. 


Suppose -- suppose I open a 13 proceeding and I


have no intention -- I propose a plan.  I have no


intention of completing that plan.  I ask the court to


approve it.  From the beginning, I have no intention of --


of going through to the end of it.  Isn't that a fraud on


the court? 


MR. CLARK:  I would -- I would never -- I would


-- I agree with you, Judge Scalia.  It would be a -- an


abuse of the bankruptcy process. 


QUESTION:  And if that were shown, I suppose


there's no doubt that the -- that the Bankruptcy Court in


the later proceeding could disallow the -- the shortening


of the lookback period because of that fraud.

 MR. CLARK:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  So, we're talking here only


about cases in which someone in good faith, at least as


far as the IRS can approve, commences a 13 proceeding, and


then for -- for some -- some plausible, good reason,


before it is concluded, dismisses.  Is that how you --


MR. CLARK:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- understand the situation?


MR. CLARK:  Yes, it is. 


QUESTION:  Whose burden is it to show that there


was some reason other than just getting advantage of the


automatic stay?  Do you have to put in any evidence to


show that?  I mean, you're suggesting -- I guess Justice


Scalia's question -- that there should be a fact question


in every case as just what was the motivation of the


petitioner who file the Chapter 13 proceeding. 


MR. CLARK:  I think there has to be -- if -- if


somebody is charging that there is an abuse, there has to


be some factual determination that there's an abuse.  The


-- under section 105, even the bankruptcy judge himself,


sua sponte, can look at this and enter orders if he


detects abuse.  And bankruptcy judges happen to be rather


good at this.  They -- they see cases that emit an odor,


if you will, and they are not reluctant to get involved in


that.

 QUESTION:  So, suppose the bankruptcy proceeding


is commenced with the intent ultimately of getting the


discharge, but there's also the intent to do it in two


steps.  You say, I'm going to -- I want -- I want to get


Chapter 13 or Chapter 13 -- 11, but I'm just going to do


it in two steps.  Is -- is that -- that abuse of process?


MR. CLARK:  No, I don't believe so, Justice


Kennedy.  Here's what happened --


QUESTION:  I don't understand the question. 


QUESTION:  The hypothetical is I -- the bankrupt


intends to get a bankruptcy discharge, but he also intends


to do it in two steps.  He intends to have a Chapter 13,


wait for 3 years, and then after a very short interval,


refile under 7.  And then hypo two is under 13.


I take it you can do it under 13?  Couldn't you


have two successive 13?


MR. CLARK:  You could have -- you could have --


QUESTION:  And your argument would be the same.


MR. CLARK:  Yes, Your Honor, it would --


QUESTION:  In either of those cases, would that


-- would that be abuse of process in your view?


MR. CLARK:  Not in my view, Justice Kennedy, and


here -- here is why.  If you're going to go -- if you're


going to go into Chapter 13 and stay there for 3 years,


you're going to get a plan confirmed during the course of

those 3 years.  You better, sure as heck, get a plan


confirmed during those 3 years.  And you will be -- once


the plan is confirmed, payments are going to be made to


the IRS for those 3 years.  It may or may not pay off the


debt to the IRS in full during the 3 years, but it is the


debtor's best effort, according to the Chapter 13, to be


paying those dollars.  So, it's not as though the IRS is


getting nothing in this -- in that hypothetical situation.


QUESTION:  But if -- if taxes had been paid


during the Chapter 13 proceeding, wouldn't they have to


have been returned on the dismissal of that proceeding? 


MR. CLARK:  If there -- Justice O'Connor, if


there were no confirmation order entered prior to the


dismissal --


QUESTION:  Right, as was the case here.


MR. CLARK:  -- which was the Youngs' case.  Yes.


QUESTION:  As was the case here.  So, presumably


even if something had been paid in for the taxes, they


would have been given back on the dismissal.


MR. CLARK:  Yes.  The magic moment in Chapter 13


is the entry of the confirmation order, and once the


confirmation order is entered, whatever plan payments the


trustee has already accumulated, because the --


QUESTION:  Well, why -- why do you think it's


improper to equitably toll that lookback period for this

situation? 


MR. CLARK:  I -- I do not think it is proper at


all to -- I -- there are several reasons why I think it's


improper. 


First of all, the language of the statute itself


is very plain and straightforward and has no provision for


equitable tolling or any tolling. 


QUESTION:  We have held that equitable tolling


applies in similar statutes which have no provision for


equitable tolling. 


MR. CLARK:  Yes, I'm -- I -- I know that the --


I know that you have, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I thought your point is --


one of your points was that statutes of limitations are


different from this, that this is not a statute of


limitations. 


MR. CLARK:  It's -- my point is that it is --


this is a part of the definition of which taxes can be


discharged in bankruptcy.  There are several time elements


to defining which taxes can be discharged in bankruptcy. 


There is this 3-year lookback period.  There is a 2-year


period where a taxpayer has filed a return late and then


we go to a 2-year lookback.  And then there's a third 240-


day period that the taxpayer/debtor must satisfy and that


is 240 days from the date of assessment.  Now, the debtor

must meet all three of these to be able to discharge the


taxes. 


In the Youngs' case, the taxes were assessed


promptly, about 2 and a half months after they filed their


tax return.  They clearly met that one.  The -- they did


not file a late return because they got extensions to file


their return in October of 1993.  So, they -- that one


doesn't apply.  And the only one in question in this


particular case then is the 3-year, and how do you measure


3 years and do you toll the 3 years for the period of the


prior Chapter 13.


QUESTION:  Mr. Clark, is the Government correct


in -- in pointing out that the debtor here could, instead


of seeking dismissal of the 13 and starting a 7, simply


have moved to convert the 13 into a 7?  Is that correct?


MR. CLARK:  That is correct, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  If -- if the debtor had done that,


the 3-year period would continue to have been calculated


as it originally was under the Chapter 13 proceeding. 


MR. CLARK:  Yes, Justice Souter, that is


correct.


QUESTION:  Would -- would it have been error if


-- if the judge or any judge in a case like this, when --


when confronted with a motion or a request to dismiss,


simply questioned the debtor whether it was the debtor's

intent to start a Chapter 7 proceeding, and if the answer


was yes, for the judge simply to say, well, I will treat


your motion as a motion for a conversion and we'll grant


that?  Would that have been error on the judge's part?


MR. CLARK:  I think it would be error for a


judge to take a motion to dismiss a Chapter 13 and make it


a chapter -- and say, we are going to make it instead a


Chapter 7 case. 


QUESTION:  Even when the debtor says, yes, my


plan, my intent is to -- is to initiate Chapter 7


proceedings. 


MR. CLARK:  Yes.  Justice Souter --


QUESTION:  The -- I take it the only harm to the


debtor in that case would simply be the -- the argument


about the 3-year lookback because the debtor would be


getting exactly otherwise exactly what the debtor wanted,


i.e., a Chapter 7 filing.


MR. CLARK:  Yes, Justice Souter.  But keep in


mind in the -- in the case of either dismissal or


conversion, in the example in the Government's brief, the


-- it does not do any good to seek conversion -- I'm sorry


-- to dismiss and then refile unless you're toward the end


of the 3-year period in any event.  So that when the case


is dismissed, now the 3-year period has expired, and now


you go the next day and you file your Chapter 7, saying,

well, I've been -- it's been now more than 3 years since


the filing of the return.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. CLARK:  But in the meantime, of course, the


plan payments are being made, hopefully, to the Government


and to other creditors for the 2 years and however many


months. 


QUESTION:  Well, that -- that's so.  But, I


mean, even in the case in which there has been a


confirmation under -- under the Chapter 13 and plan


payments have been made, it may very well be that the


amount of tax liability that has actually been paid could


be minuscule, so that it would be very much in the


debtor's interest to -- to start a new Chapter 7 and save


whatever the balance due is on the taxes. 


MR. CLARK:  Well, except that, Justice Souter,


the problem is that the tax payments are not going to be


minuscule during the Chapter 13.


QUESTION:  Well, whether they're minuscule or


not, if they're not 100 percent, the debtor still gains


something by going -- so far as the Federal taxes are


concerned, by dismissing and starting a Chapter 7 because


whatever the balance due is, in -- on the facts of a case


like this, the -- the debtor is going to -- going to


obtain.

 MR. CLARK:  That is correct, Justice Souter. 


But again, I would point to the fact that the Government


is getting something.  It may not get the whole amount. 


And in tax collection in general, apart from bankruptcy,


even when bankruptcy is not in the picture at all, the way


the Government is trying to collect taxes is through


installment payments as the Youngs --


QUESTION:  Well, that's right.  But I think the


Government's answer to that is unless we, in fact, make a


compromise agreement, we're entitled to 100 cents on the


dollar.  And the -- the fact that -- that the Government


may get 50 cents on the dollar before you go from 13 to 7


I -- I don't think really disparages the Government's


argument any. 


QUESTION:  Or it can be, as it was here, the


Government got nothing. 


QUESTION:  The Government got nothing.


MR. CLARK:  The Government did get nothing in


this situation, Justice Ginsburg, for the 6 months.


QUESTION:  And would there -- in -- in this very


case where the Chapter 7 was started the day before the


Chapter 13 was closed, was there any advantage, other than


wiping out the lookback period, to instituting two


proceedings rather than having the 13 converted to a 7?


MR. CLARK:  Well, the reason the Chapter 7 was

filed was because I think other creditors were descending


upon the Youngs.  They had dismissed their Chapter 13 back


in October, and that, of course, put everybody back into


the status quo ante, except with respect to the sale of


their house, of course.  But the creditors now were free,


once the case has been dismissed, to come forward again.


QUESTION:  Well, we're getting into filing


versus dismissal.


MR. CLARK:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  But if -- if we take the order of the


court as what counts, there wouldn't have been any period


in which other creditors could have jumped in because the


Chapter 13 hadn't yet been closed. 


So, from the point of view of the debtors here,


was there any advantage that they gained other than wiping


out the lookback period? 


MR. CLARK:  With -- with the filing of the


Chapter 13, they obviously gained the advantage also of


eliminating their other debts.


QUESTION:  I mean, when they got to the point of


saying we're not going to make it under this plan, so


we're going to have to quit the 13, at that point they


could have done -- either asked for conversion to 7 or


started a new proceeding.  Is there any difference from


their viewpoint other than they'd get the benefit under a

reading of the statute of putting the Government out of


the picture because the 3-year lookback has run?


MR. CLARK:  I'm not quite sure I understand the


question, that they -- Justice Ginsburg.  I think they --


they get the -- when they -- when they dismiss and then


refile, they obviously get the benefit of discharging


their other taxes in -- their other debts, non-tax debts.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Clark. 


Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES


MS. MILLETT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


I would like to address first the -- there's


been some discussion about protections that maybe or maybe


could not occur in a Chapter 13 proceeding to prevent the


-- the Government from losing its claim.  And in fact,


that rarely, if ever, is capable of happening because we


don't know -- debtors don't telegraph to us at the time


they're in Chapter 13 or dismissing their Chapter 13 --


that they plan to file a second bankruptcy.  And if you


don't know that's going to happen, you can't prove bad


faith.  You can't ask for conditions, or it would be


virtually impossible to do that.


QUESTION:  Well, sure you can.  You can ask the

bankruptcy judge to inquire and -- and say if -- if that


is the plan, Your Honor, we -- we request that it not be


dismissed but rather converted. 


MS. MILLETT:  I think --


QUESTION:  Or that that be a condition of -- of


the dismissal that you not -- that you not refile.


MS. MILLETT:  I think there's two difficulties


with that approach, and the first that it would be an


enormous burden in every Chapter 13 case that is filed and


then sought to be dismissed -- and an awful lot -- the


vast majority are -- to have that inquiry undertaken. 


And secondly, there is -- there is no authority


under the code that we're aware of that allows a court to


condition -- a voluntary dismissal, which they have as of


right, on willingness to forego a discharge in a future


bankruptcy proceeding. 


QUESTION:  But, I mean, let's assume someone has


in all good faith commenced a Chapter 13 and has in all


good faith dismissed it because, part the way through it,


said, you know, I think I can make it on my own now, and


-- and then, you know, sometime after that, decides, no, I


can't make it and -- and files another bankruptcy


proceeding under 7.  No bad faith.  You would still want


to alter the 3-year lookback in the statute to make it --


to make it what?  5 years or whatever.

 MS. MILLETT:  We would -- we would want the


3-year lookback period to tolled during the time the


automatic stay prevented us --


QUESTION:  That's not what the statute says. 


There's no fraud here.  There's -- there's nothing going


on.  You're just saying here's a loophole in the tax law


or the bankruptcy law, that aspect of the bankruptcy law


dealing with taxes.  I'll call it a tax loophole.  And


you're saying, you know, courts, repair this loophole. 


That's not what courts normally do. 


MS. MILLETT:  Well, as the Chief --


QUESTION:  I mean, that's the fun of practicing


tax law. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Bankruptcy law. 


QUESTION:  You take all the joy out of it. 


(Laughter.) 


MS. MILLETT:  That's what we do. 


As the Chief -- as the Chief Justice pointed


out, in fact, equitable tolling -- in virtually every case


that I'm aware of, equitable tolling is applied when the


statute is silent, and in fact when it may provide


specifically for tolling in other circumstances, as


occurred in Bowen v. City of New York and American


Pipefitters v. Utah.  And equitable tolling has not --

never been held to turn upon the existence of bad faith.


QUESTION:  This is not equitable tolling in --


in the statute of limitations sense.  What is involved


here is not the termination period for bringing a cause of


action, but rather the quite different question of when


taxes will be discharged and when they don't.  Congress


provided for, you know, a 3-year lookback.  In some


circumstances, they get the benefit of -- of less than


that if -- if they brought the two -- but at least, where


there's been no fraud, at least where you haven't been


able to show that -- that they were gaming the system


intentionally, I don't see why equity should -- should


come -- there is legislation pending to close this gap,


isn't there? 


MS. MILLETT:  There is and there has been for a


number of --


QUESTION:  Well, I don't know why we don't leave


it to Congress. 


MS. MILLETT:  Well, Your Honor, there's --


there's a number of responses to that.  And the first is


we would respectfully disagree that this is not


sufficiently analogous or akin to a statute of limitations


that the First Circuit described in this case to merit


equitable tolling.  A time period does not have to be a


statute of limitations to be tolled.  In Zipes v. TWA, in

Honda v. Clark, this Court has applied equitable tolling


to other types of time limitations, and within the


bankruptcy context, which is a specialized context, this


lookback period has the same operation and effect as a


traditional statute of limitations.  It prevents the


assertion of stale claims, stale claims defined as ones


that the Government has allowed to linger.  It -- it


extinguishes a claim if the period does lapse as


effectively as a bar on the time limitations. 


QUESTION:  It doesn't extinguish it.  The -- the


Government is just thrown in with the other -- with the


other creditors, isn't it?  I mean --


MS. MILLETT:  Well, this --


QUESTION:  -- they may come out without any


money, but it's just -- the -- the question is whether the


Government is going to have the preferred position of not


having its debt discharged.  It will be thrown in with the


other general creditors. 


MS. MILLETT:  That's not entirely correct,


Justice Scalia, for -- for -- in two ways.  First of all,


there are two -- there are two aspects to the priority. 


There's a priority as against other creditors, but what is


at issue here, and again what is at issue in virtually all


of these Chapter 7 cases, or these no -- no-asset Chapter


7 cases, is the discharge.  That's what's at issue here,

and the discharge is -- does extinguish a claim as much as


a bar on -- on filing. 


QUESTION:  Well, I know, but it -- but it


discharges the Government's claim just the way it


discharges the general creditors' claims.  The Government


is thrown into that pot instead of having the preferred


position that you can pay off everybody else 3 cents on


the dollar, but not the Government.  All that happens is


the Government goes in with the other creditors.  Isn't


that --


MS. MILLETT:  Taxes have always been different. 


And the -- the treatment of this is simply a 3-year --


3-year period that -- that the debtor has to run out, and


it doesn't afford the Government any capacity to enforce


the claim would be, I think, an extraordinary assumption


on the part of Congress. 


QUESTION:  Well, what is your -- what is your


main argument?  Is it to ask us to apply the principle of


equitable tolling to this section 105 lookback provision?


MS. MILLETT:  Section 507.


QUESTION:  Yes. 


MS. MILLETT:  Yes, that is -- that is our --


that is our submission.  The Congress --


QUESTION:  And what's your best case for that?

cases, but the most analogous one I think is Honda v.


Clark -- Clark and Burnett v. New York Central Railroad,


both of which are cited in our brief.  Honda v. Clark


involved not a traditional statute of limitations, but the


time for filing proofs of claim under the Trading with the


Enemy Act, which was specifically modeled on the


Bankruptcy Act.  And there -- there the Court held that it


would be equitably -- equitably -- the time period would


be equitably tolled --


QUESTION:  Why isn't that a traditional statute


of limitations? 


MS. MILLETT:  I'm sorry? 


QUESTION:  Why isn't that a traditional statute


of limitations?  Your claim is invalid unless you file it


within a certain period.


MS. MILLETT:  Well, within the bankruptcy


context, in fact a claim can still be paid as long as it's


on the schedules.  The filing of a proof of claim does


not --


QUESTION:  No, I'm not talking about this case. 


I'm talking about the case you're citing us as -- as being


analogous to this one.  You said it didn't involve a


traditional statute of limitations.  Why did that not


involve a traditional --

in Honda v. Clark was -- was that Congress modeled -- the


proof of claim there may have been closer to an actual


statute of limitations, but the rationale the Court


applied was looking to the treatment of proofs of claim in


the Bankruptcy Code, and that was the analogy that


Congress was drawing at the time it enacted the Trading


with the Enemy statute, and that those proofs of claim --


it was in the bankruptcy context --


QUESTION:  Maybe, but Trading with the Enemy


statute itself contained what was a statute of


limitations, and in the case at hand, we were equitably


tolling what was effectively a statute of limitations.


What's your other best case? 


MS. MILLETT:  And Nassau Smelting v. Refining


Works, which is discussed in Honda v. Clark, was a


bankruptcy case where the proof of claim was not filed


until a year after the deadline and the Court allowed


participation nonetheless.  And again, it's the nature of


the proof of claim that's --


QUESTION:  Those are also -- the difficult issue


I think in this case is exactly what Justice Scalia has


been saying, that this isn't a traditional statute of


limitations.  You have to do one of two things.  You


either have to say the word 3 years shall be read 3 years


plus days tolled.  That's one thing you could do.  Or the

second thing you could do is you could look to 105(a) and


you could say that the order that can be issued is an


order pay money -- this is in the section 7 -- pay money


as if this were the section 13 that hadn't been dismissed.


Now, both of those, the question would be, does


-- does the judge have the authority to do that?  And


looking simply to statute of limitations provisions


doesn't answer that question.  It -- it provokes the


question.  It proves you might be right, but -- but the


worrying thing is whether you can just stick those words


in, either plus days tolled, or read 105(a) in so broad a


manner. 


So, those are the -- I'd like to know what


should we do and what's the authority for that. 


MS. MILLETT:  To take the first -- the first --


first scenario first, the proposition for reading the


3-year lookback period as 3 years plus --


QUESTION:  Plus days tolled. 


MS. MILLETT:  3 years plus.  In deciding what


the character of the lookback period is, whether it's akin


to the statute of --


QUESTION:  Could you speak up a little bit, Ms.


Millett? 


MS. MILLETT:  In deciding what the -- the


character of the lookback period is, equitable tolling

does apply in Zipes in filing a proof of -- filing of a


claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 


There the Court described it as similar to a statute of


limitations, but it was not a statute of limitations.  So,


equitable tolling does not require --


QUESTION:  Which case was that? 


MS. MILLETT:  Zipes v. TW -- Trans World


Airlines.


That does not require the presence in the actual


statute of limitations.  It has to be a time limit.  If


the question is whether Congress would have intended that


type of time limit to be subject to tolling principles. 


And the -- we can either assume the lookback period would


have for many of the policy reasons that have been


discussed -- the -- the conclusion that results if we


decide that it is not something that Congress would have


intended to be subject to equitable tolling is that the


3-year lookback period is an empty gesture as far as


protecting the Government.  The Congress --


QUESTION:  You have no problem convincing me


about what I'd call the equitable merits of your side. 


The problem you have, as far as I'm concerned, is how to


work, which route do we take and what's the authority for


doing it, just what I asked in the first place. 


MS. MILLETT:  And that is I think -- and it's

both prongs of your -- of your question.  It is -- we


think that the nature of the time limitation is


sufficiently similar within the bankruptcy context.  This


is how you enforce claims within the bankruptcy context. 


QUESTION:  Well, I don't think it is similar.  I


-- I -- I mean, the only thing -- the only respect in


which it's similar is that it involves time, but all of


the other cases that -- that you refer us to, the statute


of limitations proper, Zipes, they're all cases in which


action by the party seeking to enforce something is


limited by a period of time.  He has to do it within a


certain time or else it's no good.  Now, whether you call


it proof of claim or anything else, that's -- that's the


scenario. 


In this case, it's -- it's not a matter of


whether the Government has filed in time at all.  This


lookback is quite a -- quite a different animal.  It's how


far back you -- you can go in -- in deciding which claims


cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. 


Now, it involves time.  I guess, if you think


that's enough of a commonality, then -- then I'd agree,


but gee, I -- I don't think that's enough to -- to make me


think that we have the -- the authority by long tradition


to rewrite a statute so that where it says 3 months, it's


going to be 3 months -- 3 years, it's going to be on our

authority 3 years plus some other period of time.


MS. MILLETT:  I think this is exactly the


situation that you described.  It's like a typical statute


of limitations, and that is unless the Government takes


action within 3 years to enforce its claim, unless it acts


within those 3 years, it will, for all intents and


purposes and all practical purposes, within the unique


context of bankruptcy proceedings, have no claim left.  It


will be discharged.  There's nothing --


QUESTION:  But it's not a limitation on the


Government's action within 3 -- it doesn't say the


Government has to act within 3 years.  It says when you


have a bankruptcy proceeding, you look back only 3 years. 


It has nothing to do with how soon the Government has to


come forward.  The Government has absolutely no control


over that lookback.


QUESTION:  If the Government comes forward after


3 years, it loses. 


MS. MILLETT:  That's right.  It eliminates --


and the legislative history describes this quite -- from


Congress' vantage point that this was an enforcement


period, a collection time, and that -- that if the -- it


would eliminate stale claims, which this Court said in


Zipes is one of the purposes of a statute of limitations. 


It would -- it would extinguish liability if the

Government doesn't act within the particular period of


time, which again is akin to a traditional statute of


limitations.  The --


QUESTION:  I have one -- one technical question. 


I should know the answer.  Suppose before the Chapter 13


proceeding is commenced, the Government says, oh, we've


got a lot of taxes here and this debtor may file Chapter


13.  Can you file a lien against his property which


somehow protects you? 


MS. MILLETT:  If we -- if we have assessed the


taxes, which in itself requires a 90-day period as a


matter of law, but if we have assessed the taxes, which we


had here, we can go file a notice of federal tax lien


which would protect us. 


What happened in this case --


QUESTION:  And that would protect you.


MS. MILLETT:  That would protect us, but it's


important to keep in mind how tax collection works.  The


IRS, as a matter of policy and as a matter of some


statutory provisions, tends not to descend immediately


upon taxpayers the second there's a liability. 


In this case, we had been working with the


Youngs, and they had been making some payments.  And it's


routine for us to try voluntary compliance.  It's good


policy and that's what we do, and it wasn't -- we tried

to --


QUESTION:  If you -- if you imposed a lien,


could you still work with the taxpayer?  The lien doesn't


prohibit you from trying to work it out, does it?


MS. MILLETT:  We -- we could have, but it


certainly has some consequences for -- for the taxpayer. 


And -- and again we -- we try -- we try to work these


things out without going to that sort of adversarial level


of proceedings.  And there had been payments being made


here.


But if I could get back to Justice Breyer's --


QUESTION:  And just -- just so I get the


technical --


MS. MILLETT:  Sure. 


QUESTION:  But once the Chapter 13 proceeding


commences, you --


MS. MILLETT:  We cannot impose --


QUESTION:  -- cannot impose a lien.


MS. MILLETT:  Absolutely not.  That's part of


the automatic stay. 


If I could get back to Justice Breyer's


question.  What we think is important here is -- is the --


the combination of the two factors that you discussed is


that this is sufficiently like a statute of limitations,


and Congress intended it to operate like a statute of

limitations, and it does operate like a statute of


limitations within the bankruptcy context.  And we've


combined that with the unique equitable powers the


bankruptcy courts have and the unique operation of


equitable principles within the bankruptcy context.  So,


it's not an either/or.  I think the combination of those


is a sufficient reason as to why tolling of this lookback


period would be appropriate. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Millett, Mr. Clark said in his


brief that, well, if you're going to do this for taxes,


the same logic would apply to wage claims that have a


priority.  What else did he say?  Employee benefit claims. 


Is that -- is that so?


MS. MILLETT:  Those are the only two nontax


provisions that have these type of --


QUESTION:  So, could you --


MS. MILLETT:  -- lookback periods.  And I -- I'm


assuming that it would, in fact, apply.  I -- I haven't


analyzed -- the same analysis would apply and assuming


that the same congressional purpose would be shown and the


consistency of congressional purpose to apply equitable


tolling -- it would apply there. 


It doesn't actually happen to be a problem in


that area because those -- for two reasons.  Those types


of -- those two claims involve very, very short time

limits, 90 and 180 days, not 3 years.  And so, in order to


avail themselves of this procedural roundabout, they would


have to file two bankruptcy proceedings very closely on


top of each other, and that just doesn't happen. 


QUESTION:  Well, as they did here. 


MS. MILLETT:  No.  I mean, they would have to


file their first one, and then within 3 months to get out


of the 90 days, you'd have to file another one.  This --


the first one lasted I guess approximately 6 months. 


QUESTION:  Ms. Millett, there is legislation


pending to do what?  How is it drafted?


MS. MILLETT:  It -- it is drafted to provide for


tolling of the lookback period during the pendency of --


during the time an automatic stay in a prior bankruptcy


case.

QUESTION:  As an amendment to section 105 or


MS. MILLETT:  I think it's to section 507, which


is -- 507(a)(8), which is what provides the lookback


period itself.  But that legislation --


QUESTION:  Is it part of the overall Bankruptcy


Code revision?


MS. MILLETT:  It is.  It has not been --

 QUESTION:  Which may or may not go anywhere.


MS. MILLETT:  Which may or may not go.  There


are -- there is -- there are, you know, different bills


before Congress.  They've both been passed.  Conferees


have been appointed.  They aren't fighting over this


provision, but there are lots of other provisions that


they are in disagreement over. 


I also think it's important to keep in mind what


-- what we would have to assume Congress intended were we


to read the lookback period as something not subject to


tolling.  Now, there have been some suggestions that


people like to avail themselves of tax loopholes.  That's


usually done to decide how much taxes you owe. 


What we're talking about here is an admitted


acknowledged tax liability that they want to get out of


paying and that -- that we want to hold that -- that


debtor --


QUESTION:  Well, if you were the lawyer for the


Government faced with a taxpayer that had a big tax


liability and it looked like bankruptcy might be looming,


what would you advise the Government to do?


MS. MILLETT:  Depending on this Court's holding,


there -- I have to say in all candor the volume -- the


sheer volume of cases that the IRS handles in bankruptcy


makes much -- and it's handled often at the initial

stages, as it was here, not by lawyers, but by special


agents in the bankruptcy proceeding.  I think we would


have to go to a system where we would go to the tax liens


immediately, but that's not what --


QUESTION:  No doubt, but absence that, what is


the best way for the Government to protect itself, do you


think? 


MS. MILLETT:  To immediately as soon -- as soon


as they assess, immediately file a tax lien.  And -- and


that's -- normally we go -- there are administrative --


other administrative means of collection.  We try to work


things out.  We have offers in compromise, and there's no


reason that Congress would have intended our tax system to


go that way and to be driven by these bankruptcy


procedures. 


Again, to get back, we're talking about whether


the lookback period --


QUESTION:  Well, that's how they wrote it.  I --


I mean, you say -- Congress often does not enact perfect


statutes.  It -- it leaves some holes that it should have


thought about and -- and we don't normally think it's our


job to patch it up.  I -- I agree with you.  I -- I find


it unlikely that Congress intended this to work this way,


but it is just one of the eventualities that they didn't


have in mind, and that's why we have things called

statutory amendments.  We -- we don't run to the courts


and ask the courts to fix them. 


And -- and I'm just very leery of extending our


-- our powers, the equitable powers that we've used in the


past, for extending statute of limitations, tolling


statute of limitations to this quite different situation


of a lookback.  I -- and there are other lookbacks in the


Internal Revenue Code and there are other time provisions,


and I -- I'm not willing to say whenever there's a time


provision, it's an invitation to us, if -- if Congress


hasn't foreseen every problem, to adjust it.


MS. MILLETT:  I think -- I think that given the


equitable powers of bankruptcy courts, most of those --


many of those time limits are in fact considered to be


subject to equitable tolling that are in the Bankruptcy


Code, although I don't know that this Court, other than


the proof of claim context, has ruled on the question. 


But in deciding -- Congress legislated against


backdrop principles of equitable tolling.  In deciding


whether this is the type of thing that should be subjected


to equitable tolling, this Court made clear in American


Pipe & Construction v. Utah that it's a question of -- of


congressional intent, not whether you think the provision


is substantive or procedural. 


And we think congressional intent drawn from the

structure of the statute, the network of tolling


provisions, limitations on filings, conversion rules, to


think that all of those were put in by Congress not to


protect the Government's enforcement period but simply to


channel debtors into one particular procedural route for


not paying taxes is a highly unlikely assumption. 


And to think that Congress would -- to read the


lookback period as intentionally empowering debtors not to


fight about how much taxes they owe, but to take an


admitted tax liability and say that because of what we do


in bankruptcy, not because of anything the Government did


in becoming a creditor or in enforcing its claim, we get


to decide that you will not have prioritized status.  You


will have, in some cases, not a minute of enforcement


activity, and we don't have to pay our taxes.  That makes


the Government not like other creditors at all, not at the


same level, but in the -- the States and Federal


Governments will be in the worst position of anyone in


bankruptcy.  We don't get to choose our debtors.  We don't


get to seek the security in advance, and we will have no


capacity to enforce, other than at the mercy of the debtor


who initiates these proceedings. 


And I think -- I understand this isn't a perfect


fit with the statute of limitations, but I think taking


those considerations and the -- the consequences of

accepting the alternative view of the lookback period, the


implausible assumptions that would assume Congress made


and the implausibility of this operation of the statute as


a whole combined with the traditional equitable powers of


Bankruptcy Court and the role of equity in these


proceedings, all of that packaged together is sufficient


to allow this Court to toll a lookback period and


effectuate Congress' intent, which -- which is --


QUESTION:  May I ask you a question about your


view of the automatic tolling statute?  As I understand


this case, the notice of dismissal of the Chapter 13


proceeding was filed in October, and the actual dismissal


was not until March 13 of the following year.  And it was


the day before that that they filed the Chapter 7 so there


--

MS. MILLETT:  That's right. 


QUESTION:  -- was the base of their changing


their mind or something like that. 


Is it your view that the automatic stay was in


effect between October and March?


MS. MILLETT:  Absolutely, and --


QUESTION:  Because I think your opponent seemed


to suggest maybe that wasn't so. 


MS. MILLETT:  Right.  In 1307(b), which is the


provision that allows automatic -- it's 11 U.S.C. -- that

allows voluntary dismissal by the debtor, provides that


the -- that the debtor may -- may ask the court, but that


the court shall dismiss the case.  And so, until a case


has been dismissed or closed, neither of which would have


happened under this provision until March, or a discharge


has been granted, which obviously did not happen in this


case, the automatic stay remains in effect.  And we were


unable to do any -- take any steps to enforce our claim.


QUESTION:  And is it true that in this case


there was some kind of report filed on February 2?  So,


there was activity in the case. 


MS. MILLETT:  There was.  A trustee had filed a


report, and there had been -- the court set time when it


got the -- the notice, it set the time for the hearing on


this or time for action on this.  So, it was in fact --


and again, if -- if we're going to suppose that courts can


impose conditions on these dismissals, that would again


require -- assume that the case is alive and is still


before the court. 


But I think the statute is quite clear that it


-- that the debtor doese not dismiss the case; the court


does.  And that didn't happen until March. 


And again --


QUESTION:  Are you aware of any cases of this


kind in which the court has imposed a condition relating

to this problem? 


MS. MILLETT:  No, and again because I think the


statute doesn't --


QUESTION:  Doesn't authorize.


MS. MILLETT:  I don't want to say it doesn't in


case we get to some situation where we might want to try,


but it doesn't seem to -- clearly to allow that and I


think it would be extraordinary reading of the Bankruptcy


Code to think that a court can impose, as a condition on a


voluntary dismissal that's entirely within the discretion


of the debtor to seek.


QUESTION:  Well, that --


MS. MILLETT: We do not accept --


QUESTION:  That -- that brings me to this


question.  Suppose I thought that section 105(a) was the


best basis for an authority for a tolling rule under the


abuse of process.  Would it follow that the tolling rule


has to be on a case-by-case basis to determine if they're


good faith, or can I say because of abuse of process,


we're going to have a general tolling rule? 


MS. MILLETT:  The Court has the authority to


impose uniform rules of equitable tolling.  It did that in


the Burnett v. New York transportation case.  That was a


Federal employer liability action --


QUESTION:  But is that consistent with my

assumed approach of just hinging the rule on the abuse of

QUESTION:  Yes. 


MS. MILLETT:  -- here the -- the debtor. 


Equitable tolling turns upon the legal disabilities


imposed on the person who wants to enforce their claim. 


And that isn't going to change from case to case, as in


Bowen v. City of New York where this Court again applied a


class-wide rule of tolling because the Government's


actions with the Social Security plaintiffs in that case


had been the same.


QUESTION:  Your argument doesn't hinge on bad


faith, anyway, as I understand it. 


MS. MILLETT:  No.  No, it doesn't. 


QUESTION:  You -- you assert that -- that


without the tolling, we would frustrate Congress' intent


even where there has been no bad faith, that Congress


would not have intended where there's good faith to give


the person an added -- an added couple of years of -- of


no taxes.


MS. MILLETT:  Of no taxes or to get out of


paying their taxes or to relegate the Government to this

lowest subsidiary position within the bankruptcy process.


But uniform rules have been applied by this


Court when that circumstance doesn't change, and in this


case for purposes of equitable tolling, what's not going


to change is that the Government hasn't had the time


Congress gave it in the statute.  That's going to be the


same. 


Beyond that, amount of tax liability shouldn't


matter.  That's a judgment for -- for Congress and the


Government to take.  It's not -- it shouldn't -- equitable


tolling shouldn't turn upon that, and the bad faith or


good faith of the taxpayer wouldn't be determinative. 


And in that regard, I think it's important to


keep in mind that if we had a test where we had to show


bad faith in every one of these cases, again we're talking


about an enormous volume of bankruptcy cases.  And -- and


showing -- in those -- in those circuits where they have


applied this sort of case-by-case equitable tolling, the


Government has had to be very selective in which cases it


decides to make that showing, giving a lot of people a


pass on taxes.  And those proceedings can take 9 to 12


months.  You have to have discovery and full-blown


hearings on people's faith and intentions and that really


is not what the purpose of the Bankruptcy Code is for.


QUESTION:  Ms. Millett, would you remind me?  I

think that Congress wanted the Government to have 3 years,


and that was a cutting back on what the Government had


before.  Right? 


MS. MILLETT:  Absolutely.


QUESTION:  They said, we gave you too much. 


We're now giving you 3 years. 


MS. MILLETT:  Absolutely, and that's why I think


it -- it's extraordinary to think that Congress --


Congress went to the steps that you would have to decide,


if you decide this is not a collection period and akin to


a statute of limitations, because prior to 1966, these tax


claims, regardless of age, were all entitled to priority


and were all nondischargeable.  And what Congress did in


1966 was decide it was going to balance competing


interests within the bankruptcy process and condition the


Government's entitlement to that special status on its


diligent enforcement of those tax claims.  And that is why


it's like a statute of limitations. 


But to hold otherwise is to say that what


Congress went to in 1966 was a situation where everything


was protected to where nothing is protected except at the


sole discretion and choice of the debtor proceeding in


bankruptcy.  The Government will be left with no capacity. 


We can't choose our -- we can't choose our debtors, and we


will -- and they have the entire authority to prevent any

enforcement.  And we're not just talking about enforcement


of claims that arose before they filed bankruptcy.  If you


have bankruptcy proceedings that go on for more than 3


years, as many do, this -- this rule would apply to tax


claims that arose while the case was in bankruptcy and the


3 years ran. 


And that in fact is what has happened in a case


we have pending in the Fifth Circuit.  If they can


discharge not just the things that you may have had a few


months before -- or a year before the bankruptcy was


filed, tax claims that we have never had a millisecond


outside the freedom of the automatic stay to enforce will


be extinguished, not because of anything the Government


did or did not do, but solely because of the procedural


steps taken by the debtor in Bankruptcy Court. 


And we think it's extraordinary to think that


that's what Congress did and intended to do in 1966.  The


-- it went for that transformation.  And statutes aren't


to be construed to assume that Congress would imperil


State or Federal revenues. 


QUESTION:  Of course, I don't think anybody


suggests that Congress intended the result.  The question


really is whether -- assume we know exactly what Congress


intended.  Do we have the authority to fill a gap in the


statute anyway without, you know, the express text?

 MS. MILLETT:  And I think equitable tolling,


particularly in the context of traditional equity courts


like bankruptcy and traditional equity proceedings, is


appropriate.  Again, in American Pipe, this -- thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms.


Millett.


The case is submitted.
