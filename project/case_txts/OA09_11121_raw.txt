 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next in Case 09-11121, J.D.B. v. North 

Carolina.

 Ms. Blackman.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA S. BLACKMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 J.D.B. was only 13 years old when he was 

taken out of his middle school classroom and escorted to 

a closed door interrogation conducted by outside law 

enforcement regarding a matter that did not take place 

on school property.  He was isolated from his family who 

had already demonstrated an interest in this 

investigation and sought to shield him from the police. 

He was not advised that he was free to leave or free not 

to answer questions until he had already incriminated 

himself.

 The restrictions on J.D.B.'s freedom of 

movement which existed because of his youth were 

heightened by the manner in which this officer chose to 

conduct this interrogation and the expected deference to 

authority figures categorically characteristic of

children were taken advantage of by the manner in which 

this officer chose to conduct the interrogation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Blackman, I'm -- I'm --

I'm not clear on what you are proposing.  Is there to be 

one different Miranda requirement rule for all minors, 

or is there to be one for, what, 20-year-olds, 

19-year-olds, 18-year-olds, 17, 16?  This one is 13, do 

we calibrate it that finely -­

MS. BLACKMAN:  Justice -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- or do we just say, you 

know, what would a minor -- I don't know, a general 

minor regard as restrictions upon his departure?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Justice Scalia, what we are 

proposing is that the test be a court may consider age 

in determining whether a reasonable person in the 

juvenile -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand that.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  So we are not -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you mean 15, 14, 13, 

13 1/2?  Right?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  We did not suggest that it be 

calibrated by age, although in State court jurisdictions 

many of them are and are not finding that a difficult 

test to perform.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not -- if not

calibrated by age, how is it to be calibrated?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  It is to be the exercise of 

reasonable judgment by the judge taking into account 

common sense -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Common sense?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  -- community experience is 

one.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and -- and how -­

how is the law enforcement officer going into the 

confrontation going to know whether a judge is going to 

be applying a 15-year-old rule, a 13-year-old rule, or 

whatever?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Clearly in the jurisdiction 

in which he practices he should be aware of the fact 

that a court utilizes that type of -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think that's clear?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  But we're not suggesting that 

that be done.  What a court is examining is -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why isn't this all 

subsumed under the voluntariness rule?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  As this Court has frequently 

recognized, the voluntariness inquiry is more difficult 

for courts to perform than the Miranda custody one.  And 

you have also recognized that the court -­

court performing it, not the interrogating officer, as 

Justice Scalia's questions point out.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  The police officer plays a 

role in the voluntariness, also.  And the police officer 

must be assessing whether the circumstances may be 

giving rise to an involuntary confession.  Age -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about mental 

deficiency, if -- if age should be one of the factors, 

deciding whether the individual regarded himself as in 

custody or not, why shouldn't mental deficiency be so as 

well?  Is there any -- any basis in principle for not --

I mean, once you do this, don't you, in effect, say that 

it is a subjective inquiry whether the particular 

individual regarded him or herself as being in custody; 

isn't that the -- the basis of what you're arguing?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No?  Why is age different 

from mental deficiency, for example?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Age is different because, 

number one, it involves restrictions on freedom of 

movement, so the circumstances of the interrogation are 

going to be understood and interpreted differently by a 

child than it would be by an adult.

 Secondly, we're talking about cognitive 

differences which exist between children and adults

which affects their perception and understanding.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You could say both of those 

things about the mentally deficient.  They may regard 

themselves as -- as unfree to leave, and they have 

cognitive deficiencies.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  As far as I know, there 

hasn't been the recognition in the law that there is, as 

to children, that proves such as the mentally 

handicapped are unable to -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what about this test 

which comes from three cases, the first being Berkemer, 

the second Stansbury, and the third I'll tell you in a 

second?  It is that those -- what are -- in considering 

a reasonable person for this purpose and avoiding 

subjective states of mind, you would look at objective 

circumstances, known to both the officer and the suspect 

that are likely relevant to the way a person would 

understand his situation.  All right?

 So both would be both mental illness and age 

and -- I don't know, whether you speak English, and a 

lot of other things would be relevant, provided they are 

things that are relevant to how a person would 

understand his situation and are known to both the 

officer and the individual.

 The third case, of course, is my dissent in

Alvarez.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But nothing in the majority 

conflicts with that, that I can see, except the holding. 

I thought I lost the case, but apparently it's up again, 

so I don't see why that isn't a perfectly good test. 

But if you're not going to support it, then I've got no 

support.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Well, we're simply making the 

point that there's not necessarily going to be a 

floodgate opening.  And we haven't seen that -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, but I mean what 

Justice Scalia was really asking is, do you favor 

something like this test that I read, which is open as 

to circumstance?  Anything could fit in that blank, as 

long as both policemen and the -- and the individual 

know it and it is relevant as to how he understands the 

circumstance, whether he's likely free to go or not.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Conceptually absolutely.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Thank you.  Yes, that's 

right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even -- even if you said 

no, you're pushing us there, because there's no basis 

for treating a childhood any differently from these 

other factors.  So basically you're saying Justice

Breyer would call it objective circumstances.  You know, 

whether you're mentally deficient, I would call that the 

subjective condition of the -- of the person being held 

in custody.  And I think, I don't think that's what we 

meant by the phrase "objective circumstances."

 But you want objective circumstances to 

include the character of the person being held in 

custody, whether he's mentally deficient, whether he's 

schizophrenic, known to the police, you know, whatever 

factors, right?  Those are all objective circumstances?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Your Honor, what we are 

talking about are a complex of characteristics which are 

unique to children, and that's what we are examining in 

this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Blackman, what is 

complex about a juvenile investigator?  That's what this 

police officer was.  So he's investigating a juvenile 

for juvenile justice purposes, and I think there's 

hardly anything more objective than that.  This case has 

child written all over it.  It's investigator who deals 

with children.  The first proceedings is going to be a 

juvenile proceeding.

 How can you not take that into account, 

whatever -- whatever these other factors may involve? 

But here it seems to me so rampant because this police

officer dealt only with juveniles, and he investigated 

juveniles.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  I agree completely.  This 

officer was assigned the case because it had already 

been determined that a juvenile was involved.  This is 

the population that he deals with on a daily basis.  He 

certainly has a basis on which to assess how J.D.B.'s 

youth was factoring into this interrogation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And then is it your point 

that he has to do something more than the read the 

standard Miranda warning?  Suppose he read the standard 

Miranda warning?  End of case as far as you're 

concerned?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Obviously his age would 

factor into whether there was a valid waiver.  But, yes, 

he has got to Mirandize or otherwise J.D.B. -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but doesn't it 

follow from there that we have to have a -- we have to 

change the warning?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Not necessarily.  I mean, 

some children will not understand Miranda warnings, just 

as some adults don't understand Miranda warnings.  But 

children are nonetheless -- have to be given the 

opportunity to be told of their rights, so that they can 

at least have the opportunity to make an informed

decision.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you asking trial judges 

to make -- to do something that is realistic?  Do you 

think -- let's take a hypothetical trial judge who, 

let's say, is 60 years old and has an IQ of -- that's at 

least an average IQ.  And now you're asking this trial 

judge to decide whether under particular circumstances, 

let's say, a 14-year-old with an IQ of 85 would 

appreciate under particular circumstances that he or she 

was free to leave?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Your Honor -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  You think a trial judge can 

really do that?

so.  And to the extent that your -­

13, I would not understand that I could go.  However, if 

I were 15, I would understand I could go.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Your Honor -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Can you slice it like that?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  What we are talking about 

here is relative youngness and relative oldness.  I

older a child is to an adult, the more adult-like they 

are.  The younger, the farther away they are from that

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do we need either 

imaginative powers or empirical data to know that when a 

13-year-old is brought into a room in his school, taken 

out of class, four people are there, two are police 

officers, one is assistant principal, threatened with 

custody, that that person is not going to feel free to 

take off and leave?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  We do not.  I'm simply 

pointing out that there is a basis of knowledge from 

which courts as well as police officers can make the 

required assessment.  It is so clear in this case, 

however -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, sympathetic cases can 

make bad law.  So take the same set of facts and let's 

hypothesize that this is a 15-year-old.  Would the 

15-year-old appreciate that he could go?  Or make him 

16.  Or make him a street-wise 17-year-old.

case, it is unlikely that a -­

him, he's dressed in baggy jeans, you know, down around

MS. BLACKMAN:  I'm not sure I understood the 

question.

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The whole point -­

MS. BLACKMAN:  Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The whole point of 

the Miranda rule, I thought, was to provide clear, 

objective guidelines about what the police are supposed 

to do.  And it seems to me that one of the difficulties 

with your rule, however clear it may seem in this case, 

but it does have to apply more broadly, is that that's 

off the table, and now they're not only going to have to 

know, does this person understand it, but they're going 

to have to know, it's not every one of these situations 

that's going to be in school.  They're going to have to 

guess how old the person is.

 And there are differences.  Some 

15-year-olds know a lot more than some 17-year-olds, and 

so on.  And -- and the facts that you're concerned about 

all go into the voluntariness inquiry, which is still 

pertinent after Miranda.  Why don't we just put those 

facts into that inquiry and say, look, we've got one 

strict rule; everybody knows it, you hear it on TV all 

the time, people are given Miranda warnings; that part 

of it is done?

MS. BLACKMAN:  It doesn't change the rule 

itself.  I mean, the rule itself remains:  All objective 

circumstances relevant to the custody determination must 

be considered.

 What it's doing is taking this out of the 

reasonable adult standard, which by default is the only 

one, then, that can be used, and so it's not going to be 

muddying the waters in the sense that it is something 

needed in order to promote accurate fact-finding.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would it be -- is it 

enough if the officers in this situation said, look, 

you're free to leave, you know, whenever you want, 

but -- and then goes on -- or do they have to think -­

now, maybe -- maybe a 13-year-old really doesn't think 

that's true, or maybe a 13-year-old really doesn't feel 

that he can leave if he's got the vice principal there 

and they want to talk.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  I mean, that is an objective 

circumstance that occurs in the course of an 

interrogation which is very weighty in determining if 

custody occurs.  Here -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm thinking it 

would not even be enough if they told the 13-year-old, 

look, you can leave, but I want to ask you some 

questions.  And the principal is there, and he thinks,

well, you know -- maybe the 13-year-old is thinking, 

maybe I'm going to get in trouble if I leave.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  It involves all of the 

circumstances which are arising during the course of 

these interrogations, but certainly advising someone 

that they are free to leave and advising them that they 

are free not to answer questions is almost half of the 

Miranda warning, and it is giving the child -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if the parent tells 

them not to leave?  What if the parent says, you go and 

talk to this police officer?  If you did something 

wrong, I want them to know about it; talk to the 

officer.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Whether that would factor in 

depends, I think, upon whether they're acting as an 

agent of the police, because what we're looking at is -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, no.  They're not an 

agent; they're acting as a parent.

specific factors that occur in the course of any 

interrogation will be considered, but our focus here is 

upon what the police officer must do.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would be one relevant 

factor that would be considered was that nobody called 

the parents?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  It is relevant in this 

situation, because -- by North Carolina law.  Because a 

custodial interrogation was occurring, there was a 

requirement that a parent or guardian be present.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How is that relevant 

to the Miranda inquiry?  It might be relevant to the 

voluntariness inquiry, but I don't see whether you call 

the parents or not.  Part of his Miranda -- your Miranda 

right is not to have your parents called.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  What I understood the 

question was:  Was it relevant that a parent was not 

contacted?  In this particular situation, yes, because 

that was going to create an independent basis on which 

the statement wasn't going to be admitted, and is than 

additional reason why -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Independent of what?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Independent of Miranda.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, right.  That's 

my whole point.

MS. BLACKMAN:  But that is an additional 

reason why police officers need to be aware of what the 

age is of a child that they are interrogating because of 

independent obligations arising out of State statutes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So is your answer to 

Justice Ginsburg that, no, the fact that a parent was 

not notified is not relevant to the Miranda question?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  No, I believe it remains 

relevant to the Miranda question, because -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The question really is if 

he is in custody.  And maybe there's something different 

about being in the room with a juvenile police 

investigator and the assistant principal and being in 

that same room with your parents there.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  That is correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, so it's not just 

that they have to call the parent; they have to wait for 

the parent to show up?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Because of State statutory 

requirements, here they were.  Obviously, not every 

State has that kind of requirement.  In this particular 

situation, there was a requirement of parental presence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's not -- that's 

not pertinent to the Federal law question on the Miranda

warnings.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  I understand that, but I'm 

just explaining that independent bases may arise for 

which an officer has to be aware of the age.  And given 

that, we're not imposing additional burdens.  These are 

things that police officers have to be considering.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the age of the 

person being questioned is unclear?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  If the interrogation is 

occurring under circumstances where the officer should 

have known, then I think the burden remains with the 

officer to consider this, and that could arise from -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose -- suppose the 

person shows an ID and it shows the person is 19 years 

old, and the officer looks at him and says, he looks 

like a pretty young 19-year-old?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  If there is no way to verify 

the information that the child is giving, then the 

officer accepts the ID as being the age of the person he 

is interrogating.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What if -- I mean, under my 

example, what if the child -- what if the person looks 

like a minor but has an adult ID?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  I think that if -­

obligation to look behind that?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Um -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Or the other way around? 

The person says, I'm 15, and the officer sees that this 

person has a pretty heavy beard and -­

MS. BLACKMAN:  The officer has to proceed on 

the basis of his observations.  I mean, objective 

circumstances are things that are readily apparent. 

There can be circumstances which tell the officer that, 

in fact, he is dealing with a child, either the setting, 

the appearance, the contact of parents, and so on.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there a good faith -­

MS. BLACKMAN:  But if there -- if there is 

no reasonable basis upon which the officer could discern 

that this is a child, if he has no reason to know, then 

the rule that we are asking to be put into effect would 

not apply.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does a good faith mistake 

make it okay?  If, you know, the officer, in good faith, 

believes that it's not a minor and -- and proceeds 

accordingly?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Yes.  I mean, what we would 

be assessing is:  Are the circumstances clear such that 

the officer should have known?  And if they simply could 

not ascertain it, then the rule that we're asking for

would not apply.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The way you phrase the 

question, you say, may the trial -- whether trial courts 

may consider the juvenile's age in Miranda to make the 

in-custody Miranda determination.

 Did you really mean "may," so it's 

discretionary with each judge, whether a juvenile's age 

is relevant to the in-custody analysis?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  No, it is must.  As with any 

objective circumstance, the court has to take it into 

account, and we can't be relegating some to a 

discretionary review and others to mandatory review. 

So, yes, if a child is involved in the case, then a 

court must take that into account -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So -­

MS. BLACKMAN:  -- in determining if there's 

custody.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- are you saying, going 

back to the hypotheticals that some of my colleagues 

posed, police officer comes across an individual, looks 

older or looks younger, doesn't know, and just engages 

that person and says come over here and let's talk for a 

second.  Is the officer required to ask the age?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  It's a simple enough matter, 

but no.  But I think if the person -­

Miranda is not coming into play at all -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Perhaps not, but it's -­

if it's outside a school, school corner.  No reasonable 

suspicion, just says come over here, kid.  Is he 

supposed to ask the age to see if he's 19 or 18 or 17?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  We're not in a custodial 

interrogation setting, I think in your question, and so 

Miranda is not coming into play at all, but I mean, this 

is a matter -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It is, because it's a 

stop with no reasonable suspicion.  And the kid comes 

over, and the officer stands him there and continues to 

talk to him for half an hour.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  If there is a custodial -- if 

we have restraint on freedom of movement which is rising 

to the degree of a formal arrest, it's a simple enough 

matter to ask.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why don't we go back 

to the test that Justice Breyer suggested, which would 

answer many of the hypotheticals here, that the 

objective fact is what is known to both?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  What is known to both.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That way you don't get 

into what the 13-year-old is thinking inside himself or 

not, because that then becomes subjective; you don't go 

back to what others might think are special 

characteristics or subjective characteristics.  You go 

to what's known, what's an objective factor known to 

both.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Yes.  But I think that we 

can't be encouraging willful blindness, either; and so, 

you know, if an officer encounters someone at a facility 

where only children would be, for example, like an 

elementary school or a juvenile detention facility -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think that's clear, 

but that's different.  I mean, you can tell the 

difference between a 9-year-old, I think, and an adult 

generally.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Indeed.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And I'm hard pressed to 

think that anyone would believe that if you took a 

9-year-old out of his classroom and the assistant 

principal walked him into a room and said these guys 

want to talk to you, that that 9-year-old would think 

he's free to leave.

that's a fact known to everyone, that it's a 9-year-old.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Correct.  Correct.  I did -­

there have been a lot of questions that sort of 

presupposed that we are doing a subjective inquiry, and 

I think nothing could be farther from the case.  What we 

are not doing -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I guess part of my problem 

is it's just in some respects hard to put the Miranda in 

the context of a -- let's say a 13-year-old alone.  It 

may be that Miranda warnings, "You have a right to 

remain silent, anything you say can be used against you" 

-- might terrify the kid just to hear about it.  I'm 

just wondering how the Miranda warning works here 

anyway.  The school is in loco parentis, it has certain 

-- it has obligations and privileges with respect to the 

student.

 MS. BLACKMAN:  Well, Miranda is the only 

procedure to date that anyone uses, and constitutionally 

they are --

everyone is entitled to some advisement so 

that they can make an informed choice.  I mean, whether 

there should be a more simplified or different Miranda 

warning for children is an issue for another day, but we 

can't simply say we're not going to do anything.  We are 

not going to tell these children that they don't have to 

cooperate with the State in building a case against

themselves.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I go back to an 

earlier question?  Is it your argument that age is the 

only objective individual characteristic of the person 

being questioned that must be taken into account, or are 

there other objective characteristics of people being 

questioned who -- that fall into the same category?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  I think that one's status as 

an inmate, for example, can be characterized as 

objective, and certainly that has been taken into 

account because inmates share that same baseline 

restriction on freedom of movement that children do, and 

so this court in -- Shafter -- for example, 

characterized it as what would the reasonable person in 

the inmate's position have understood as to his freedom 

of movement.  So, yes, I mean, there can be other 

objective circumstances individual to the person, but 

we're still not answering a subjective -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  But what are they?  I don't 

want to use up your rebuttal time, but what -- what are 

they in addition to age?  For people who are not 

institutionalized or in school or in an environment like 

that?  What falls into the same category as age?

 MS. BLACKMAN:  I think that's for other 

litigants to press upon this Court upon proper records

with input from experts as to whether it relates to the 

special susceptibilities of children, how cognitively 

different they are which is affecting their perception

are questions for another day.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ROY COOPER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. COOPER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In determining custody for Miranda purposes, 

this Court has considered only the external surrounding 

circumstances of the question and not the attributes 

that affect the mental processes of the person being 

questioned.  Age fundamentally changes the reasonable 

person test, makes it complex, makes it more illogical, 

with no logical stopping point for adding other 

characteristics, as Justice Breyer -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  You would add none?  No 

others?  No other characteristics?

 MR. COOPER:  This Court has not said -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I mean here.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  There's a big sign jail 

cell, the door is unlocked.  When you want to leave, 

leave.  Is he in custody?

 MR. COOPER:  Well, Your Honor, I think you 

have to look at the obvious circumstances.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is he in custody?  It's a 

jail cell, but a big sign, "Go ahead, leave, go when you 

want."  Is he free to leave?

 MR. COOPER:  I think he may be, Your Honor.

steep steps and he's in a wheelchair.  Are you willing 

to take that into account?

 MR. COOPER:  I am willing to take that into 

account.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Then why aren't you 

willing to take into account an ambiguous situation as 

was true in Alvarado, a tough situation where it's 

pretty unclear; he was brought there by his parents and 

there are all these things around that might suggest to 

a 20-year-old, yeah, you could leave, but to a 

12-year-old, "no."  If the judge can take into account 

whether he's in a wheelchair, whether he just speaks 

Ukrainian, whether in fact a thing -- you have to swim 

through a pool and he doesn't know how to swim -- I 

mean, all kinds of things like that; why can't he take 

into account in a proper situation before he thinks he's 

in custody or not, things they both know including 

whether he's 8 years old or 22?

 MR. COOPER:  Your Honor, because those are 

obvious circumstances that everyone agrees -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  And it's obvious whether 

he's 8-year-old or 2 2, too.  I'll tell you that.

 MR. COOPER:  The problem is, Your Honor, you 

have to think like an 8-year-old or think like a 

15-year-old in order to determine the situation.

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  And you have to 

think like a Ukrainian speaker or think like a -- a -- a 

-- like a person who knows he's in a wheelchair before 

you know he can't get up those steep steps.

 MR. COOPER:  I think the difference -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  What is exactly the -- the 

difference?

 MR. COOPER:  The difference is with the 

Ukrainian is that you look at whether the knowledge was 

actually acquired.  And if he speaks Ukrainian, then 

everyone knows that the -- that the knowledge was not 

acquired.  People understand that someone who has a 

seeing eye dog, if you take him out of the room, then 

you have exerted coercion over the situation.  I think 

that's different from requiring the officer to get into 

the mind of the reasonable 15-year-old or 16-year-old.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I haven't said that.  What 

the opinion said, which unfortunately may mean nothing 

unless it's promoted to the status of majority, is you 

look to those factors that are relevant to, known to 

both policeman and the suspect, and are known to be 

relevant to the likelihood that a person -- a likely 

person, not him -- that are known likely relevant to an 

ordinary person's belief -- this kind of a person -­

that he thinks he's free to go.

MR. COOPER:  Well, no, age is an objective

age in a way where you're having to figure out what a -­

an overgeneralization for compliance.  There are lots of 

groups that would be naturally more compliant.  Mentally 

challenged people, seniors in rest homes, there are all 

kinds of people who would be more compliant, but 

compliance doesn't necessarily equal coercion.

 MR. COOPER:  I am.

age in the way they want to use it in this particular 

situation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What do you mean by use 

it in this situation?  This is a middle -- middle 

school.  This is an officer who deals only with 

children.  I can't imagine any setting where age isn't 

more apparent than when dealing with an assistant 

principal, a juvenile investigator, going -- deciding -­

the juvenile investigator deciding the place where he 

wants to conduct this is in a middle school.  I mean, 

just as a matter of common sense, how can you say that 

we're going to have the same test for this 8-year-old as 

we would for the 30-year-old?

MR. COOPER:  Well, Your Honor, the officer 

may not know the age, but if he does, in this situation 

he did, and -- and if the officer is in a middle school, 

there is still a problem with having to figure out what 

his actions and how they -- what they are and how they 

affect a juvenile of a particular age.

 In the situation of the 8-year-old it may 

seem intuitively wrong, but the issue is, is you have to 

get into the mind of the 8-year-old, makes it very 

difficult as a practical matter.  The officer's going to 

have voluntariness problems.  If the officer would read 

Miranda, the officer is going to have waiver problems.

 Officers have, in those situations, 

incentive to read Miranda, to get a parent.  In -- in -­

in this type of situation the officer went there, it -­

it was a familiar location to this juvenile, it was a 

situation where he knew three of the people in the room, 

the officer asked him if he wanted to answer questions, 

and he said yes, the interview was relatively short.

 The juvenile left at the end of the 

interview, which is -- which is relevant, and I think in 

this situation if -- if you -- if you look at it 

broadly, it's very difficult for officers to tell age 

and to tell how age affects the situation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  He probably couldn't leave

the classroom, either, could he, the classroom where he 

was studying?

 MR. COOPER:  Your Honor, he probably could 

not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So the -- the additional 

coercive effect of not being able to leave probably 

didn't make a whole lot of difference.  He knew he was 

stuck where his parents had put him, in the school.  And 

if the school sent him to a classroom, he had to be in 

the classroom; and if the school sent him to a place 

where he could, if he wished, voluntarily speak to the 

police officers, he had to be there.

 MR. COOPER:  Well, I think that's right, 

Your Honor.  I think you look at the school setting and 

I think you look at -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And we look at what is 

the normal school setting just like we looked at the 

normal business settings, he's in class, all the 

children are around him.  This seventh grader was 

marched by the school security officer, taken away from 

his peers, from his class in -- put in a room with a 

closed door with the assistant principal.  That is not a 

normal part of the school day.  That's not where he is 

required to be.  This is -­

feeling free to leave somewhere is not the entire test 

for custody.  There has to be a restraint on freedom to 

the degree associated with the arrest, and I think 

that's pretty clear from the Berkemer case -­

is one of ordinary reason and intelligence who knows 

what custody looks like, essentially, and is informed by 

45 years of case law.  If you have someone who is very 

young, but if you have someone without any other kind of 

disability, the voluntariness test is there.  It -- it 

considers age significantly in determining whether a

the entire purpose of Miranda and its requirement 

because there was a belief that it wasn't -- that 

voluntariness wasn't enough -- was not good enough 

because it was such a high bar, to secure the privilege 

against self-incrimination?

 MR. COOPER:  Well, Your Honor, I agree with 

that, but the voluntariness test was complex because you 

did consider so many factors.  So the Court lifted the

objective test, a prophylactic one, clearly a different 

test -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That doesn't answer my 

question.  If we've said if you're not in custody, it's 

going to be nearly impossible for you to show that your 

statement was involuntary, are you now accepting that 

with respect to age a 9-year-old may not feel free to 

leave as opposed to a 13 or 14-year-old, that somehow we 

should instruct the courts that age really needs to be 

stepped up in the voluntariness test?

 MR. COOPER:  Well, Your Honor, in -- in 

voluntariness, you don't necessarily have to have 

custody to prove that a statement is involuntary, and of 

children who are particularly young, that will come into 

play significantly.  I think you don't have to get into 

turning Miranda upside down in order -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So are you happy with 

the rule that says, no, not in the objective Miranda 

test, but, yes, age should be elevated as a prime 

consideration in the voluntariness test?

 MR. COOPER:  Justice Sotomayor, I think it 

is already a significant factor in the voluntariness 

test, and I think particularly for young children, I 

think you're going to see that continue to occur.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  General Cooper, I'm not sure 

how I understand or that I understand how this would be 

turning Miranda upside down.  Miranda is already an 

incredibly complicated test about when those warnings 

need to be given, all right.  So there are all manner of 

circumstances which go into the determination of whether 

a person would feel free to learn -- leave, whether a 

person would feel as though he were in custody, a 

thousand things, how many people are in the room, how 

long the interrogation is, where the interrogation is, 

the particular circumstances of the interrogation.

 So, this is not a bright line test, and all 

that we would be doing here would be adding an 

additional objective factor to an already multifaceted 

inquiry.

 MR. COOPER:  Justice Kagan, admittedly 

sometimes Miranda has gray areas, because you do look at

a combination of factors, but it's informed with 45 

years of case law.  And officers now have a pretty good 

idea as to what combination of factors constitute 

custody for Miranda purposes.

 What age does is now we're going to have to 

go back in and reassess all of those combination of 

factors through the eyes of a 13, 14, 15-year-old, 

16-year-old, it's going to be case law that's going to

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  Why is that?  We've 

seen two cases that seem like blue moon, once in a blue 

moon.  Alvarado is a odd set of circumstances.  And what 

is the terrible thing, the awful thing that has to 

happen if the officer isn't sure whether this individual 

thinks he's in custody or not?  Suppose the officer just 

isn't sure.  What terrible thing happens?

 MR. COOPER:  Well, Your Honor -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  What is the answer to that 

question?

 MR. COOPER:  You over Mirandize.  You 

Mirandize when it's not necessary.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, well, you over 

Mirandize.  The terrible thing that happens is you have 

to give them a Miranda warning.

 Now -- now, that is the terrible thing.

Now -- now -- now, why is that a burden on the criminal 

justice system that sometimes in ambiguous circumstances 

or because this kid is very young, he might not 

understand it quite as well, and the officer sees that, 

the kid sees it, and so the officer has to give him a 

Miranda warning.

 MR. COOPER:  Your Honor -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, what happens to 

destroy the criminal justice system?  You can see from 

my overstatement, I tend to suspect nothing, but you 

tell me.

 MR. COOPER:  A lot.  School resource 

officers, there are thousands of them, they are -- they 

are licensed, but police officers -- uniform police 

officers who often counsel kids as well as protect the 

school.  Under the Petitioner's theory, a school 

resource officer who is going to take a juvenile into a 

room to talk about a stolen cell phone or bullying, the 

first thing that he's got to say is you have the right 

to remain silent.

 Now, that, in my opinion, disrupts the 

communication.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not the first thing, 

hey, kid, we're here talking, but you want to leave, 

just open the door and leave.  Go.  Nobody's keeping you

not.  It's just like Berkemer.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  For search purposes, is 

age consciousness required?  Remember, a part of this is

police officer is trained to deal with juveniles.  And 

he says to the boy, you can't consent to the search 

because you're a seventh-grader.  I will have to get a 

warrant.  So please stay here until I get a warrant.

 If he can't -- if he's not treated like an 

adult for purposes of the search, if you get the 

warrant, if the police need a warrant because they're

dealing with a seventh-grader, why should it be 

different for in custody for Miranda purposes?

 MR. COOPER:  Well, Your Honor, I think when 

you're dealing with voluntariness, when you're dealing 

with consent to search, when you're dealing with waiver, 

you're looking at the particular juvenile.  You're 

looking at all of the circumstances.  The courts have 

said that the Miranda test is different -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought all the police 

officer was looking at when he said "I have to get a 

warrant" is that he's dealing with a seventh-grader, not 

all the circumstances.  Very simple:  Age.

particular age of a juvenile, which makes it all the 

more difficult for the officer.

 You know, say for example that you're at a 

Terry stop and there are a number of juvenile-looking 

people there.  Let's say they're 15 to 19, but the 

officer doesn't know it.  He's at the Terry stop.  He's 

going to be faced with, potentially, Mirandizing some of 

the people there and not -- not others.  That's going to 

put law enforcement in an untenable situation and make 

it very complex for them as to when they read Miranda 

and they don't.  And I think in addition to -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know, I don't agree with 

that.  You are trying to understand this situation as 

the blind person would have seen it or as the deaf 

person would have seen it or as the 13-year-old would 

have seen it, and I don't understand why it's different.

 MR. COOPER:  Well, Your Honor, I think it's 

different because it has to do with something that is 

obvious.  It is not necessarily obvious how a 13- or 

14-year-old would view the situation.  And just in 

the -- the Alvarado opinion, the opinion says that 

sometimes the permissible objective facts and 

impermissible subjective opinions sometimes merge.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The blind person doesn't 

have a different mind.

 MR. COOPER:  That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The deaf person doesn't 

have a different mind.  He just has less data, and it's 

easy to take account of less data; easier to take 

account of less data than it is to take account of how 

different one's mind is because he's 16 instead of 13 or 

whatever.  That's the difference between the blind and 

the deaf, isn't it?

absolutely right, and yes, too, Your Honor.  I think 

it's important to know that we have already started 

going down the slippery slope in a number of states. 

There have been 11 states, contrary to Petitioner's 

brief, that are considering other characteristics in 

Miranda, such as sophistication, such as education, such 

as intelligence.  That makes it so much more difficult.

 And this Court has not hesitated -- it did 

not hesitate in Alvarado; it did not hesitate in 

Berkemer -- to correct lower courts, to say we've got to 

make sure that Miranda is complete, that Miranda stays 

clear and objective, and that we don't blur the lines.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If the law goes down that 

route, then one of the chief advantages of the Miranda 

rule, which is that it's a relatively simple objective 

test, is eliminated, and the law of Miranda begins to 

resemble the law of voluntariness.  And maybe at that 

point, there is no longer a strong argument in favor of 

Miranda, and the voluntariness test will be the sole 

test.

 MR. COOPER:  We support Miranda, Your Honor. 

We support Miranda in its current form.  We think it's 

appropriate, but I think clearly, by adding age into the 

circumstance, it makes it more complicated.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Feigin.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN,

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

 MR. FEIGIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 There are three primary reasons why age 

should not be a factor in the Miranda custody test. 

I 

think the most important one is this:  The only 

statements that are going to be suppressed under 

Petitioner's rule that wouldn't already be suppressed by 

existing doctrine are statements that, first of all, the 

prosecution has -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm sorry.  I just -- the 

only statements that could be suppressed -- I just 

didn't hear.

 MR. FEIGIN:  The only statements that are 

going to be suppressed under Petitioner's rule that 

would take age into account that aren't already going to 

be suppressed under existing constitutional doctrines 

are statements that, first of all, the prosecution has 

carried its burden to prove are voluntary under a

voluntariness test that already takes age into account, 

and second of all, are given under circumstances that 

don't otherwise meet the definition of custody; that is, 

formal arrest or its functional equivalent.

 I think that's a relatively small and not a 

particularly problematic category of statements, and I 

don't think it's worth complicating the Miranda rule in 

order to make sure that those statements are suppressed.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  Maybe you can explain 

this to me, too.

 You have a blind person there.  Everyone -­

you don't know how blind.  He's somewhat blind.  A deaf 

person.  How hard of hearing?  We're not sure.  So the 

policeman goes a little overboard.  You are free to 

leave, or shows it to him, or makes sure he gets it in. 

Okay?  Why is that so tough to do where you also have a 

12-year-old?  If he really is free to leave, just make 

clear that he knows it.

 MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think the 

critical difference between blindness, deafness, and 

other sensory disabilities and age is what Justice 

Scalia said a few minutes ago, which is, in the case of 

a blind or deaf person, you can try to figure out what 

the circumstances surrounding the interrogation that are 

observable to that person are, and then -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that's all we're doing 

with the young person.  And in fact, most of us, many of 

us, have a great deal more experience understanding the 

world through the eyes of a young person or children, 

perhaps, than understanding the eyes -- the world 

through the eyes of a severely sensory deprived person.

 We're asking the exact same thing in both 

contexts:  What is this person -- what is this -- what 

do the objective circumstances appear to a person in 

this situation?

 MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I don't think 

you're doing the same thing, and I think it's easier to 

put yourself in the mindset of a person with a sensory 

deprivation than a person of a particular age, and let 

me explain why.

 For a person with a sensory deprivation, 

like in Justice Breyer's example, the sign that someone 

can't read, I think it's very common and easy for 

officers and courts to figure out how they would react 

to the situation if the sign simply weren't there.

 With age, what you're asking perhaps a 

45-year-old officer to do, in Justice Alito's example, 

or a 60-year-old judge to do, is to put them into the 

frame of mind of a person that they haven't been for 32 

years or 45 years, and I don't think that's a very easy

inquiry to ask officers or courts to make.

 I think this is really going to complicate 

the Miranda rule by asking them, A, to do that, and, B, 

because there are going to be many cases, unlike this 

case, where it's not going to be apparent to the officer 

what age the suspect is.

 One thing that comes up fairly commonly in 

many jurisdictions is that an officer will stop someone 

on a -- do a traffic stop of someone on the road; the 

person will claim not to have their ID, and it will turn 

out the person is 14 and they will give the name and 

birth date of an older sibling.  And there is simply no 

way for an officer in those circumstances to know what 

the age of the suspect is.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Limit it to when the age 

is known.  If we limit it to, this is an officer who not 

only knows he's dealing with a seventh-grader but he 

decides the venue for the questioning is going to be a 

room in the school, that's -- it's not a mystery.  It's 

not a guess.  He knows he's dealing with a 

seventh-grader.  He sets it up.

 Are we to ignore what the investigating 

officer knows?  The investigating officer knows he's 

dealing with a child.

 MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think there

are sort of two parts to your question.  Let me deal 

first with the rule that would only apply when officers 

know the identity, know the age of the suspect.  I think 

that rule would be easier to apply than the rule the 

Petitioners are suggesting and would mitigate some of 

the damage, but first of all it doesn't solve the 

critical problem of asking officers who aren't 

themselves 13 to think like someone who is 13; and 

second of all, I think for reasons that I think were 

apparent during the argument by my friend on the other 

side, that rule might easily devolve into a "should have 

known" test, and officers simply aren't going to be able 

to deal with that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The officer doesn't have to 

think like a 13-year-old, he has to think the way a 

60-year-old judge would think a 13-year-old thought, 

right?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. FEIGIN:  That's right, Your Honor, and 

it may depend what -- which particular 60-year-old 

judge -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  But that isn't -- to me, 

anyway, that is not the question.  I don't think anybody 

is asking anybody to think like anything else.  All it 

is, when you face a younger child, and he is free to go,

and you mean he's free to go, you just sort of err a 

little bit on the safe side and make sure he understands 

it.  That's all.  Nobody has to think like anybody.  All 

they have to think is let's err somewhat on the safe 

side.  Now why is that tough?

 MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think that 

the main problem here is that it's going to create more 

confusion for officers because it's another factor they 

have to put into the test, and it's -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there any harm in

we require it all the time?  Can you tell us why it 

makes a difference?

 MR. FEIGIN:  I think it's very unrealistic 

that every time an officer opens their mouth they have 

to give Miranda warnings, and I think it would 

fundamentally change the nature of police interactions 

with the public.  The Court -- and the other reason the 

Court has never required it is that voluntary 

statements, the Court made clear in two cases last term 

again, Maryland v.  Jasper, and Berkeley v. Thompkins,

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think that a 00 a 

person with Down's syndrome, that that should be taken 

into account in this inquiry?

 MR. FEIGIN:  I'm not sure how that would be 

taken into account, Your Honor.  To the extent that 

someone with Down's syndrome thinks differently from 

someone who doesn't have Down's syndrome, I think that 

would be very relevant to the voluntariness test but 

would not be relevant to the custody test.  Because it's 

-- again it's going to be very difficult to ask an 

officer to put themselves in the mindset of someone who 

has Down's syndrome.  I think the -- the third 

problem -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how is that different 

than blindness or hearing?  A person with Down's 

syndrome, many -- some don't -- show characteristics 

that they're not capable of comprehension, or not 

capable of absorbing information.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They barely look at you, 

they barely -- you know, there are characteristics that 

show you a lack of absorption of information.

 MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, I may have 

difficulty dealing with this particular hypothetical 

because of my lack of knowledge of the particular 

symptoms of Down's syndrome; but if you're dealing with 

a suspect who simply can't absorb information about the 

world, then that's going to be a sensory deprivation 

that's going to be taken into account, because it's 

going to subtract circumstances away that that suspect 

can't perceive.  But if you're asking about the mindset 

of someone that has a particular sensory disability, 

then no, I don't think that would be taken into account 

because it's asking too much of officers to try to put 

themselves in that mindset.

 And the third problem, I think, with 

factoring age into the custody test is that -- and as I 

think Petitioners effectively conceded, it creates a 

slippery slope problem.  There really isn't a clear 

distinction between age and other things such as mental 

disorders or cultural background, that defendants also 

argue change whether they believe that they've been 

subject to a formal arrest or its functional equivalent.

warnings to be given where they are unnecessary because 

they are only necessary to prevent coercion, and where 

there's no coercion, we want confessions, don't we?  And 

the Miranda warnings deter confessions.

 MR. FEIGIN:  That's right, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't that the basic 

reason?

and -­

 MR. FEIGIN:  That's right, Your Honor, 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it's not cost-free to 

require Miranda warnings.

 MR. FEIGIN:  That's right -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a good thing to have 

the bad guys confess that they're bad guys, right?

 MR. FEIGIN:  That's right, Your Honor, 

that's what I was trying to say earlier.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Before you -- you are so 

quick to answer that's right, isn't it so that the 

manual that this very officer was given to use said 

before you question a child, give Miranda warnings?

 MR. FEIGIN:  Yes, it did, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Apparently the people who 

train these juvenile officers think it's a good thing, 

not a bad thing to give a Miranda warning.

 MR. FEIGIN:  Well, one reason they may think

it's a good thing and one reason I think the Court 

doesn't need to accept Petitioner's rule here, is that 

officers often will give Miranda warnings, for precisely 

the reasons Justice Sotomayor was suggesting earlier, 

which is that when officers do give Miranda warnings, 

it's going to be -- and those Miranda -- the Miranda 

procedures are all validly followed, there's not going 

to be a real robust voluntariness inquiry because in 

most cases where the Miranda procedures are followed, 

the statements are going to be found to be voluntary 

under the voluntariness test.

 And if I could actually add answer an answer 

to Justice Scalia's earlier question, Miranda isn't 

simply concerned with coercion.  The Court made very 

clear in Oregon v. Mathiason that Miranda isn't 

attempting capture every quote, unquote, "coercive 

environment."  What Miranda is directed at is a specific 

environment -- thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Finish your 

sentence.

 MR. FEIGIN:  Specific environment, namely 

custody, which is defined as a formal arrest or its 

functional equivalent.  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 Ms. Blackman, you have 3 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA S. BLACKMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. BLACKMAN:  I think what's very odd in 

this case is that the only party that didn't consider 

J.D.B.'s age was the courts.  I mean, it was clearly 

being taken into account by Officer DiCostanzo, and 

J.D.B. was fully aware of his own age.  And under 

Thompson v. Keohane, what a reviewing court is supposed 

to be doing is immersing itself in the actual 

circumstances of the case; and without this 

consideration of age, then the courts are examining 

hypothetical, because -- hypothetical interrogations and 

not the one that was actually occurring in the case.

 Officers have to make judgments about every 

objective circumstance that arises, and asking them to 

make objective determinations on juvenile status is no 

different and is not going to muddy the water.  I think 

as Justice Kagan pointed out, custody is a very 

difficult issue.  It's not subject to bright line rules. 

But we can't be defining it in such a way where we are 

requiring these children to be someone that they never 

could be, and that is, reasonable adults.

 If our goal here is to ensure reliability of 

factfinding, reliability of statements, if we want to 

reduce the coercion, to which our citizens are entitled,

then this rule needs to be put into play, and we ask 

that the North Carolina Supreme Court decision be 

reversed.  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:12 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
