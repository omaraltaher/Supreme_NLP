            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

next in Case 10-545, Golan v. Holder.

            Mr. Falzone.

            ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY T. FALZONE

                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

            MR. FALZONE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

            Section 514 did something unprecedented in

American copyright law.  It took millions of works out

of the public domain, where they had remained for

decades as the common property of all Americans.  That

violated the Copyright Clause and the First Amendment.

            Let me turn first to the Copyright Clause.

In Eldred, this Court held Congress gets to pick the

date on which a copyright expires, and it can extend

that date before we reach that date.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said that Congress

can set a time limit.  In this case, we're dealing with,

let's say, Aaron Copeland, who gets the benefit of

copyright, and Congress says:  No, we think Shostakovich

should be treated just like Copeland.  Yes, we took care

of our own when we weren't part of the world community,

but now we are.

            And so, all that Congress is doing is giving

Shostakovich works the same limited time as Aaron

Copeland.  And why does that violate the limited-time

prescription?

            MR. FALZONE:  The problem is Congress is now

setting a second limit long after the first one has come

and gone.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the person -- the

person we're talking about, the work we're talking

about, never got the first limit.  There was no -- there

was no time, there was no time when that work could have

been protected.  So, why isn't it consistent with the

Copyright Clause to say, you are entitled to limited

time protection?  We're not talking about a case where

you've had the protection, enjoyed it, and then it

expired, and then Congress says we'd like -- we like

your work so much we're going to give you another term.

            What's affected here are people who were

unprotected.  And Congress says we think that they

should have a limited time.

            MR. FALZONE:  So, let me just clarify one

thing.  Many of the works that were restored here did

get some time, 28 years, and were not renewed.

            But to get back to your question about the

works that got none --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They didn't get the

equivalent of what a U.S. author -- but let's take the

large category, because it's the ones that you feature.

You're talking about Shostakovich, Stravinski, and I

say, well, what's wrong with giving them the same time

that Aaron Copeland got?

            MR. FALZONE:  Congress has been setting the

limited time at zero since 1790.  In the 1790 Act,

Congress set the limit at zero for a wide array of

works, those that did not comply with formalities, those

that were written by foreign authors --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's not a limited

time.  That's saying you have no time.

            MR. FALZONE:  Well, but saying you have no

time is itself picking the limit because the language of

the Copyright Clause forces Congress to pick a limit

that constrains copyright by marking its end.  And when

-- if a limit does not mark the end once reached, then

there is no limit; there is no end.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it has to have a

beginning, too.  And that's -- for these people who were

unprotected, because we didn't recognize their

copyright, there's no beginning.

            MR. FALZONE:  No, there does not need to be

a beginning.  It is within Congress's discretion.

Remember, this is permissive.  Congress may grant

exclusive rights, but it can also say your limit is

going to be zero; we decide that you're not going to get

any exclusive rights.

            And every Congress since 1790, every time it

went to add subject matter, every time it went to extend

the duration of copyright, respected that choice to give

no time.  And, in fact, the time -- the decision to make

foreign authors ineligible is a decision that Congress

has never gone back on.  None of the exceptions the

Government points to remove anything from the public

domain that was placed there based upon a lack of

national eligibility.  Two hundred years of history is

crystal clear about --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I can understand your

argument that the public domain is untouchable.  I'm not

sure I get that from the Constitution.  That says to

secure to authors for a limited time the exclusive

right.  That -- that's talking about what you can secure

to authors.  So, I don't see why using the words of the

Constitution, to secure to authors for a limited time,

Congress can't say:  We want every author to have a

limited time.

            MR. FALZONE:  Well --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The foreign works that we

didn't give -- we're not treating them any better.  They

don't get a different startup date, but they get the

same end date as our own authors.

            MR. FALZONE:  Right.  The -- the operative

language is the limited times restriction, and the limit

it requires Congress to pick is the date at which all

protection ends for good.  And Congress has picked zero

since 1790 and respected that decision, and that is no

accident.

            Because the -- the -- if you want to know

what "limited times" means, if it means anything, it

means if -- for instance, if Congress is not required to

respect an expiration date long after it's passed or its

decision to deny a work any protection in the first

place --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We're not talking about

expiration dates.  So, I'd like you to concentrate --

            MR. FALZONE:  Sure.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's not -- that's not

-- none of these -- none of these copyrights have been

extended beyond their expiration date.  They just

weren't protected.

            MR. FALZONE:  Well, taking works that got no

protection, if Congress is not required to respect its

decision to deny a work any protection in the first

place, we can never know whether we've reached the end

or not.  And, in fact, that's the problem with the

Government's theory.  Its theory says all Congress has

to do is attach a nominal expiration date to any given

copyright.  Well, if that's true, there is -- if that's

all you need, there's nothing stopping us --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But is it -- that is --

that is not --

            MR. FALZONE:  -- from reaching back and

giving De Tocqueville a hundred years.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That is most distinctly

not before this case.  So, please let's not talk about a

copyright that has been protected, has expired, and

Congress wants to revive it.

            We are concentrating on what Congress did to

bring us into compliance with the worldwide system, and

it's saying:  We're giving a limited time to these

authors.

            MR. FALZONE:  Well --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They never had a limited

time before.

            MR. FALZONE:  Well, I -- I was talking -- De

Tocqueville never got any time, because he was a foreign

author.  Ben Johnson never got any time, but on the

Government's theory, we could give him a hundred years

            This statute did work differently.  It

certainly restored copyrights into the existing period.

That's correct.  That is an accurate description of this

statute.  But that is not a limit that's contained

anywhere in the Government's interpretation of limited

times.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did anyone in the same --

the same -- published the same year as De Tocqueville, a

U.S. author, that would have a copyright protection

today?

            MR. FALZONE:  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear you.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I gave the example of

Aaron Copeland versus Shostakovich.  Let's go back to De

Tocqueville.  Who has a copyright who published in,

what, 18 -- what was it?

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Forties.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.

            MR. FALZONE:  The answer is nobody.  But

here is the problem.  If Congress wanted to reach that

work, here's all it has to do on the Government's theory

and even under the mechanism of section 514:  All it

needs to do today is extend existing terms a hundred

years, and then reach back and restore into that

existing term.  So, on the Government's theory and even

by the mechanism on which this statute operates, the

government could reach back and protect De Tocqueville.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Under your -- under

your theory, let's say you have a copyright that expires

on October 5th, okay?  On October 4th, Congress could

extend that for 25 years.

            MR. FALZONE:  Yes.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right?  But on

October 6th, they couldn't go back and extend it 1 day.

            MR. FALZONE:  That's exactly right because

the limit the Copyright Clause requires us to pick is an

end date with permanent consequence.  End dates are

about finality.  If that end date doesn't have permanent

consequence, if it doesn't have finality, we can never

know if we've reached the end or not.  The limit the

Framers knew was the limit of the Statute of Anne.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it seems -- but it

seems to me that that was rejected in our most recent --

an earlier case on copyright.

            MR. FALZONE:  In Eldred?

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.

            MR. FALZONE:  No, no.  Eldred said Congress

can move the limit back before we reach it.  But Eldred

most certainly did not say that Congress is free to

ignore the limit once we hit it, because if you can do

that, then you never know if you've reached the limit or

not.  The limit the Framers knew was the one in the --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counselor, there was no

limit here, meaning these foreign works were never given

the opportunity to be copyrighted.  Isn't that a

substantial difference from the hypothetical that you're

trying to proffer?  You're -- the hypothetical -- and I

think that's what Justice Ginsburg was responding to --

is you had a copyright, it expired, and now Congress

wants to revive it.  Isn't that different from not

having had the opportunity at all and being given a term

to exploit your work and protect it?

            MR. FALZONE:  The answer is no, it's not

different; and Congress treated those situations exactly

the same in all 19 amendments over the span of 200

years.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The problem --

            MR. FALZONE:  It gave equal respect.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I know, but it

didn't do it when it set up the copyright system.

            MR. FALZONE:  Oh, it did.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In 1790, counsel, there

were three States that didn't give copyrights.  There

were other States, and you make a big deal in your brief

about common law protection, but common law protection,

particularly in New York, which you relied on, only

extended to unpublished works.  Once a work was

published, it was no longer protected under the common

law.  That was true of most States.  And some States

gave copyright protection to residents of their own

State but not to residents from other States.

            So, it took a whole body of public works and

gave them copyright protection the day they decided to

pass the copyright law.  So, what are you doing telling

us that there has never been a historical experience

with Congress taking public works out of the public

domain?

            MR. FALZONE:  Well, let me be clear about

what happened in 1790.  The 1790 Act did not remove

anything from the public domain.  The text is clear,

because insofar as it applied to works already printed,

it presupposes existing copyrights explicitly in the

text of the Act.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Read those words to me.

            MR. FALZONE:  So, I'm looking at section 1

of the 1790 Act, and at the beginning it talks about

"after the passing of this act, the author and authors

of any map, chart, book or books already printed within

these United States, being a citizen ... thereof, or

resident within ... or his or hers executors,

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait a minute.  Who have or

have not transferred to any other person.  So, you don't

have to have a copyright.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right?

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- well, you have to

have a --

            MR. FALZONE:  You do have to have a

copyright.  So, it says "author or authors" and "hath"

is the singular, and "have" -- "have not" is the plural

for that.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Read it again.  Who have --

            MR. FALZONE:  Sure.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- or have not transferred

to any other person.

            MR. FALZONE:  Right.  The copyright of such

map.  It presupposes the existence of a copyright.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh.  Oh, the copyright.  I

got you.

            MR. FALZONE:  Yes.  "The copyright" is the

key language.  So, the text makes it clear they

presupposed existing copyrights.

Official

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- your reading of

that passage is different than mine.  I think it's a --

it's saying if -- whether you have or you haven't.

            MR. FALZONE:  But let me speak to the point

you raised about common law protection for published

works.  You said New York provided no common law

protection for published works.  With respect, that's

not correct.  The Naxos v. Capitol Records case, highest

court of New York, says New York common law provided

protection for published works right up to the point

where the Federal Act cut it off.

            And if you look -- and if -- if the question

is whether the first Congress intended to take anything

out of the public domain in 1790, the answer is you

simply cannot reach that conclusion, because everything

contemporaneous with the first Congress, the history of

the common law in Britain, decided by Millar v. Taylor

and Donaldson v. Beckett, recognized common law rights

in published works.  The Federalist Papers spoke about

Millar, and everything contemporaneous --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If we disagree with your

proposition, does your argument fail?  If the historical

work does not point to what you claim?

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- would your argument

fail.

            MR. FALZONE:  No, not necessarily, because,

of course, that was the first Copyright Act, and

Congress established a baseline.  It had to start

somewhere.  What we see 19 --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It could have started in

the place you want Congress to have started now?

            MR. FALZONE:  Well, no, but then --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It said, moving forward,

there's a Federal copyright.  It didn't have to take

things out of the public domain.  We're arguing about

whether they did or didn't.  But assuming they did.

            MR. FALZONE:  Oh, I will assume they did.

They had to start somewhere.  They wanted uniformity.

They created a statute that provided it.

            When you look at every amendment, 19 times

in 200 years after that, Congress respected the

permanent consequence of the limits it chose, even when

those limits were a work gets no time whatsoever, based

on formality and noncompliance, based upon national

eligibility, based upon expiration of 28 years.  It was

consistent each time it added subject matter or extended

terms.

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you tell me a little

bit about the phrase and the argument about the public

domain?  Is, in your view, that just a synonym for when

the time has ended?  Or is there something more

substantive to it that -- is it your position that the

public somehow owns what's in the public domain?  I'm --

            MR. FALZONE:  Well -- so, to be precise, our

position is once Congress calls the limit, that is, once

it says this work is unprotected, whether it's the

expiration of 28 years or a decision to give it no

protection, it's creating affirmative rights in every

member of the public.  Yes, they own it.  And this Court

has recognized --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but how does the

phrase -- so, the public domain is simply a conclusion

to express that, the operation of that principle?  The

public domain doesn't have any more substantive meaning

other than to just express the conclusion that there's a

limited time?

            MR. FALZONE:  Well, it -- in this case, when

I refer to the public domain, it's the collection of

things for which Congress had said protection is done,

it's over, we've hit the limit, it's done.  So things

that went --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Once again, it's just a

conclusion for the argument.

            MR. FALZONE:  I think that's the operative

concept here.  That's right.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think you gave an

analogy to the statute of limitations, and I thought you

were quite right about that.  You can extend the statute

of limitations before it's expired, but once it's

expired, it's over.

            The problem with you using that as an

analogy is that there was a beginning.  Time ran out,

and you're trying to deal with a situation here where

you say, you know, the time was limited for the U.S.

work, but it's unlimited, that you -- you cannot treat

the foreign work -- you cannot give it a limited time,

the same limited time that you would give a U.S. work.

You're saying these people had no time, and they may

never get time.

            MR. FALZONE:  They had no time because

Congress decided that their works were going to be

ineligible, and a limit of zero is one Congress has been

setting since 1790 and respected consistently.

            If the Chief Justice gives me a limited time

for oral argument, I might say no, thanks, I have

nothing to say.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it isn't -- it isn't

quite --

            MR. FALZONE:  And we all know I can't come

back tomorrow.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- quite so because there

are these examples of the people who couldn't get

copyright because of wartime both after -- after both

World War I and World War II, and -- so, those people

were allowed to get the protection that they couldn't

get because of the war.

            MR. FALZONE:  That's correct.  That's what

those statutes did.  They were never challenged.  And

make no mistake, our position is, insofar as they

removed anything from the public domain, they are

unconstitutional.

            But even if the Court doesn't want to go

that far, I think the wartime statutes and the other

small handful of exceptions the Government points to fit

quite well into a very limited exception for eligible

authors who show nothing more than the familiar concept

of excusable neglect, which has operated -- and, again,

in very narrow situations -- to relieve people of the

consequences of deadlines.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about new

categories?  You know, architecture.  Congress decides

we're going to extend copyright protection to

architectural design, and they say:  And we're going to

go back 5 years.  So, any new architectural design

conceived or constructed, whatever, within the last 5

years gets protection, and it goes on for another 15.

            MR. FALZONE:  Right.  So -- so -- of course,

to be clear, that's not what Congress actually did when

it protected architectural works.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, I know.

            MR. FALZONE:  It looked forward.  Right.

            But that -- so, in that case, the -- the

Federal scheme, if it had not previously regulated

architectural works, it had not -- there had been no

decision as to what the limit was going to be.  And so,

you may pose a different question.

            Here, we're talking about works that were

affirmatively within the Federal scheme --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, I'm just

trying to -- I'm trying to test the limit of your public

domain --

            MR. FALZONE:  Sure.

it extend to new categories of copyrightable works?

            MR. FALZONE:  I think the answer is the

retrospective portion of that statute flunks progress of

science but -- but passes limited times.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would you -- would you

spend a little bit of time on your other argument?  I

take it to be a separate argument apart from the, you

know, time limit argument, the argument that the problem

here is that this law does not promote the progress of

science and useful arts and, therefore, does not comply

with the Copyright Clause.  Why doesn't it --

            MR. FALZONE:  That's right.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why doesn't it promote the

progress of science and the useful arts?

            MR. FALZONE:  So, the -- the progress of

science corresponds roughly to the creation and spread

of knowledge and learning.  A statute that does nothing,

like this one, does nothing but take old works out of

the public domain without any impact on prospective

incentives, cannot stimulate the creation of anything.

And as for things that already exist, it cannot

stimulate the spread of them.  All it can do is restrict

the spread of things that could once circulate freely.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You don't think that

there are some foreign authors who didn't or wouldn't

come into the U.S. market because they couldn't protect

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Foreign authors who

decided not to exploit their works here wouldn't be

induced to think about coming into this market because

now they can protect their works?

            MR. FALZONE:  Well, whether they came into

this market or not has no effect on whether they can

protect their works or not.  They were unprotected

whether they came into this market or not.  They would

be protected --

foreign authors to come here and promote their work?

in a variety of contexts.  And if I'm sitting there

writing a great novel, I will have the confidence that

my government will ensure that I get protection when it

becomes a bestseller in China.

            MR. FALZONE:  Yes.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right?  Well, that's

-- that's an incentive.

            MR. FALZONE:  Yes.  And you were assured of

that incentive in 1988, when we joined the Berne

Convention without removing anything from the public

domain, because when you sit down to write that book

today, that work will absolutely be protected in all of

the Berne and WTO countries.  So, the incentive effect

was achieved and achieved in full in 1988.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I'm talking

about -- but the same issue can come up again, you know,

whether it's in the area of formalities or whatever.

There may be another problem where there's a dispute

between other countries and our country.  And I will

know that, in the past, the United States has taken

action looking out for -- for the interests of American

authors.

            MR. FALZONE:  That's -- that's --

Now, it may be, as I think it was described in a court

of appeals decision, a "meager" incentive.  You may be

more interested in other protection.  But it's -- we

haven't really required much more than that.

            MR. FALZONE:  Perhaps.  I mean, there's

nothing in -- in the record before Congress here to

reflect the fact they made any such conclusion.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let me put it -- I think

it's the same point -- another way.  Let's assume I'm a

multibillionaire, and I receive an award as a great

patron of the arts because I have furthered the arts by

giving several million dollars to someone who has

already composed an opera or who has already written a

book.  Wouldn't -- wouldn't I be furthering, be viewed

as furthering, the arts?

            MR. FALZONE:  Potentially, but the problem

here, if I can move a little bit to the First Amendment,

is the mechanism Congress chose to use here.  They chose

to create that reward by taking away core public speech

rights from the American public and transforming them

into somebody's private property.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's what the

copyright law permits, the -- excluding things from the

public domain so long as, in the process of doing it,

you're furthering the arts.

            MR. FALZONE:  Well -- but let me focus on

the First Amendment problem.  An ordinary copyright

statute does not revoke the public's Federal right to

copy and use works in the public domain.  That is

exactly the thing Congress refused to do 19 times over

200 years.  And that's the huge departure from

traditional contours of copyright protection that

triggers First Amendment scrutiny here.  And when you go

to ask the First Amendment question, you can't ignore

the mechanism Congress chose to use here, which is to

take away public speech rights and turn them into

somebody else's private property.

            That was the explicit motivation of the

people who came before Congress and asked them to pass

this statute.  That is the justification the

Government --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But now you're saying that

there is a substantive component to this public domain

argument, that the public does own something.  And

that's different from what I thought you answered

earlier when you said it's just conclusory for a limited

time.

            MR. FALZONE:  In that case, I misspoke.  The

public -- the public domain is owned collectively by the

public.  And, in fact, decisions of this Court going

back to the 19th century refer to it as public property.

And I think that --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm curious to go back a

second.  I thought Justice Sotomayor's question was:

Imagine Smith in Germany.  He has written a book.  It's

there, already exists, but it has no copyright

protection in the United States.  So, after this, would

he be more willing to send it to the United States?  And

I take it your answer is no.  The reason is because I

can go and buy a copy and sell it in the United States

even without this law.  Is that right or wrong?

            MR. FALZONE:  I think -- I think that it

could possibly incentivize him to bring a work to the

United States, depending on how the statute worked --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, see, that's what --

-- isn't that the question?  The question is, now that

Smith has the same protection in the United States that

Germany gave him, doesn't that give him an incentive to

send his book to the U.S.?  I'm thinking about that one.

I thought:  Not much, because I can go buy it today

without this law and bring it to the United States and

sell as many as I want.  But nonetheless --

            MR. FALZONE:  I think that's right.

right?

answer as being correct if it's not.

            (Laughter.)

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Then the

answer --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It might be his

incentive to buy it or not, but the question is the

author's incentive to sell it here.  Those are two

different incentives.  Whether -- you know, he could go

anywhere and buy a cheaper book if he chose to take the

trip or get on the Internet and find it.  He could do

that now.  Copyrighted materials here go at a different

price than they do elsewhere.  That's not the issue.

The issue is the author's incentive.

            MR. FALZONE:  The -- the problem here is

these authors are long gone.  You can't incentivize

them.  These works are so old they're long gone.  You

can't incentivize anything that's -- that's happened so

long ago.  So -- and if you could --

incentivize them, they're not going to claim their

rights.

            MR. FALZONE:  I'm sorry.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They're not going to

they have to declare that they're interested in

protecting their copyright here.

            MR. FALZONE:  No.  Actually, that's

optional.  It's optional for them to file a notice of

intent to enforce.  It's optional for them to declare.

But the real problem is --

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Optional for them, but

once they do, that's when they can sue a prior user.

            MR. FALZONE:  That's right.  If -- well, it

depends who they want to sue, but yes.  That -- they

certainly have broader rights once they file the notice

of intent to enforce.  But the --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, the assumption

of this -- of this line of questioning, I suppose, is

that the mere marketing in the United States of stuff

that has already been created promotes the progress of

the useful arts.  I'm not sure it promotes the progress

of the useful arts.  It makes more money for the guy who

       ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

              ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

            I'd like to begin by picking up on a point

that my friend made in response to Justice Ginsburg

suggesting that with respect to foreign works what

Congress has done is set the copyright term at zero.  I

don't really think that's a fair description of the

situation, and it obscures what Section 514 actually

does and what Congress is all about here.

            Since 1891, Congress has concluded as a

matter of copyright law that foreign works are entitled

to the same protection as domestic works.  The problem

with respect to the authors that section 514 covers is

not that Congress set the copyright limit at zero; is

that as a matter of foreign relations, we did not have

treaties with these individual countries.  And what 514

does is remedy that problem.  What 514 says is, with

respect to a defined set of foreign authors, they get

the remainder of the copyright term that they would

otherwise have gotten, and nothing more, had they lived

in countries where we had -- with which we had copyright

relations at the time they published, or had they

complied with the formalities that we used to enforce

but no longer do to perfect and renew copyrights.

That's what it does.

            It doesn't grant anybody a perpetual term.

It does not renew a copyright term that has run its full

course and create a new one.  It rectifies that problem

which doesn't -- doesn't reflect anything about a

congressional judgment setting the copyright term at

zero for foreign works.

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Could Congress grant

copyright protection to works that had lost that

protection due to the expiration of the period that was

provided for under then -- under previous law?

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  We think that the --

there isn't an ironclad limit that can be derived from

the text of the Copyright Clause or from history that

would say that Congress is forbidden in any circumstance

from doing that.  We do think that there are significant

limits in the text of the Copyright Clause that would

restrict any ability Congress might have to do that.

But one thing I think is important here is that section

514 is not a statute in which Congress did that, and

we'd respectfully suggest that any assessment by this

Court of whether Congress had that power should await a

concrete context in which Congress exercises it, if it

ever does.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What is it that you're

-- that you're referring to?

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  Excuse me, Justice

Sotomayor.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You said there are

limits.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What --

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, one limit I think

is a quite important one is that the Copyright Clause

says that you can only grant copyright in authors, to

authors.  And as a work gets older and older when you're

talking about Shakespeare and Ben Johnson, there really

at that point isn't an author in which you could vest

the copyright.  And creating any copyright for a

long-expired work like that would really, I think, raise

the problem that the Framers were addressing by

restricting copyright to authors, which -- which was to

avoid the creation of patronage monopolies in which

publishers who weren't the authors could claim the

exclusive rights of copyright.

            JUSTICE ALITO:  But doesn't this -- doesn't

section 514 provide copyright protection for works that

were created by people who are long since dead?

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, it does.

            JUSTICE ALITO:  So, I don't understand the

limit that you were just suggesting.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, because they --

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Do they have to be dead for

some period of time before --

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  No, but --

            JUSTICE ALITO:  -- Congress is unable to

give them back their copyright?

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  What 514 does, Justice

Alito, is provide copyright protection to works of

foreign authors whose works still have copyright

protection in their own country, whether they're dead or

alive.  So long as the work has protection in the

country, then 514 provides copyright protection.

            And the reason it does so is to ensure our

compliance with the Berne Convention.  And so, the why

here is very important and, I think, provides the answer

to Justice Scalia's question about how 514 contributes

to the progress of arts and sciences.  What 514 does --

514 is, in essence, the price of admission to the

international system.  We decided, the policymaking

branches of our government, the executive and the

Congress, decided that we needed to be -- and it was in

the national interest -- to be part of the international

copyright system and to join the Berne Convention to

accomplish that.  The reason we did so was because our

intellectual property is subject to very serious levels

of piracy in many foreign countries because of

under-enforcement.

            By joining Berne, what we did was commit

ourselves to the international standards.  And by

enacting Section 514 to implement the Uruguay Round

Agreements in 1994, what we did was say to the world

that we are going to ensure compliance in this country.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  General Verrilli, I do not

find that an appealing argument.  It seems to me

Congress either had the power to do this under the

Copyright Clause or it didn't.  I don't think that

powers that Congress does not have under the

Constitution can be acquired by simply obtaining the

agreement of the Senate, the President, and Zimbabwe.

            (Laughter.)

expand the powers of the Federal Government.  I mean,

this is either okay under the copyright clause or it

isn't.  Now --

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  We completely --

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- it would be nice to know

the reason for it, but you would still have to establish

that it's within the power of the Federal Government --

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  We completely agreement

with that, Justice Scalia.

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  There's no textual limit

in the Copyright Clause that would preclude Congress

from enacting this statute.

            The Petitioners have also raised the First

Amendment argument.  We don't think First Amendment

scrutiny applies here.  To the extent it did, the why

would matter there, and there's definitely a substantial

interest on the part of Congress in -- in ensuring

compliance with Berne and getting protection for our

works in Berne.

            Now, in Eldred, the Court did say, I think

quite clearly, that there is no requirement under the

Copyright Clause that a new financial benefit granted to

an existing -- that a new financial benefit cannot be

granted to an existing work --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but it was -- in Eldred

the main difference is that in Eldred, there was a law

that might, at least in principle, have elicited a new

book.  And in this case, by definition, there is no

benefit given to anything at all that is not already

created.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  I disagree.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  By -- how?  How does it

give any benefit to anything that isn't already created?

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  Because it creates

additional incentives for authors today and going

forward, because they know that there's a much greater

likelihood that whatever intellectual property they

create will be better protected in foreign countries as

a result of our joining the Berne Convention.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  How does this provision do

that?  I think maybe there are other provisions, but I

thought this provision is talking solely about books,

for example, that are already created.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, but --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, oh.  You say --

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- in which we get to

choose options.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well then, you know, as you

also know from the 42 briefs, that there's a lot of

argument that you could comply in other ways that are

less restrictive.  And whether that's true or not, is

that -- there what you're saying is -- if I parody it,

it's not a fair reading I'm going to give -- but what

you're saying is we are -- here have a law which says

that libraries, music lovers, book buyers will either

pay more money for things already in existence or will

simply be unable to get them if they're orphans, on the

one hand, so that other countries will impose similar

kinds of restrictions upon their music lovers, music

goers, libraries and -- so that they pay more for our

works that are already in -- that are already produced,

or simply can't use them because they can't find who

owns them.

            Now, that's in parody form, for

succinctness, what I think the argument is on the other

side --

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  Right, but --

copyright law -- with your exception of when the country

was founded -- no copyright law has served that kind of

purpose.  That's served often by tariffs --

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  But --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  -- but not by copyright

law.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  But there's another way

of looking at that, Justice Breyer, of course, which is

that the -- but for the fact that these individual

authors lived in countries that didn't have copyright

relations with the United States, they would have the

protection of our copyright law, and they would have the

term of copyright --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Not necessarily.  There are

three categories.  One is the category of the people who

you couldn't, because of the country; that's Egypt, I

think, and Russia.  The second is the category of the

people -- of sound recordings, and their third is the

category, which is not the null set, of people who did

not comply with certain registration requirements.  For

example, I believe that the widow of Samuel Brittan

failed to renew her copyright.  And there are probably

many that failed to renew the copyright after 28 years,

and the reason that they didn't is because they didn't

think there was much money in it.  And those are the

very works that the libraries want to get ahold of and

put in their databases.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  And there is no textual

limit in the Copyright Clause that says that Congress

cannot provide the same limited term to those categories

of works that it provides to other works.  There just is

no textual limit.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true but for one

text.  They say that text has to do with progress.  And

when they read it historically in light of Macaulay, in

light of the Statute of Anne, in light of going back to

Venice and the copyrights, in light of going back to

letters between Madison and Jefferson -- that term has

always meant produce at least one new thing.  And here

there is not one new thing.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  And -- yes.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, there is.  First,

with respect to section 514, it's part and parcel of

joining Berne, and Berne gives protection not only to

the previously created works but to newly created works,

and it creates additional economic incentives in

foreign -- by assuring better protection in foreign

countries for newly created works.  So, it creates many,

many more than one new work.

            And I think it's also quite reasonable,

Justice Breyer, to read the incentive structure here in

a way parallel to the way the Court did in Eldred, which

is to say that, just as in Eldred the Court assumed that

there was an implicit guarantee to an author making a

creation that that author would get the benefit not only

of the existing term of copyright but any extension, I

think here, with respect to American authors, it's an

implicit guarantee that they get the benefit not only of

the foreign protection in existence at the time but any

expansion of foreign protection through adjoining

treaties, and article 8 -- and section 514 implementing

article 18 of Berne is the price of admission to that

treaty --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  General, there is

something at least at an intuitive level appealing about

Mr. Falzone's First Amendment argument.  One day I can

perform Shostakovich; Congress does something, the next

day I can't.  Doesn't that present a serious First

Amendment problem?

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  I don't think so, Mr.

Chief Justice, and I do think -- for a host of reasons.

One is I think that it's -- it's just not so simple, and

I think the question that I think Your Honor asked my

friend was what about when Congress expands the scope of

exclusive rights for existing works?  Well, Congress has

done that many, many times, and musical composition is a

really good example of that.  In 1831, Congress created

exclusive right in the publishing and vending of musical

compositions, but not in their public performance.  So,

from 1831 on, once I bought the sheet music, the public

performance was, to borrow the Petitioners' way of

thinking, in the public domain.  You could do it any

time you wanted without having to get --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All right.  Well,

that's --

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- a license to pay any

money.  But --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's -- one answer

is that Congress has done this before.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  But then, in 1897,

Congress granted an exclusive right in the public

performance of musical compositions --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- and made it applicable

to all existing copyrights.  And so --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Well, do you

have an argument other than that they've -- they've done

this before?

it many times before, and it's a process -- I think it

reflects -- and -- and the point is that no one has

thought with respect to any of those significant

adjustments of the boundaries, that it was an occasion

for First Amendment scrutiny.  And I think that's

because of the wisdom of the Court's opinion in Eldred,

that these are --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But we have -- but

it's pertinent under the First Amendment in other areas,

right?  It's a different analysis if your claim is the

government should open up a park as a public forum, than

if it's been a public forum for 200 years and the

government decides to close it down.  Maybe they can do

it, but it's a different question.

            So, why isn't this a different question,

from whether they can extend copyright protection that's

already there?

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think -- because I

think there is -- once the Court gets into the business

of First Amendment analysis, there's no stopping point,

because all of the adjustments of the boundaries could

have the same kind of effect, I think, as the musical

composition example shows.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what about --

what about Jimi Hendrix, right?  He has a distinctive

rendition of the national anthem, and all of a --

assuming the national anthem is suddenly entitled to

copyright protection that it wasn't before, he can't do

that, right?

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  What copyright does, by

definition, is provide exclusive rights in expression;

and so, if the First Amendment is triggered whenever

copyright provides exclusive rights in expression that

it didn't used to provide, then heightened scrutiny will

apply any time Congress exercises its copyright power.

And what the Court said in Eldred --

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, he's just out of

luck?  And that's just one example of many, where you

take existing works and you have a derivative work or

something that is distinctive to you.  So, those people

are just out of luck?

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, of course, under

section 514, they're not out of luck because it has

significant protections and accommodations for

derivative works.  The question of whether there should

be heightened First Amendment scrutiny, we think, Eldred

answers, that -- that the First -- the Copyright Clause

already contains very significant accommodations of

First Amendment interests, the idea/expression

dichotomy, fair use.  And -- and that is going to

provide -- maybe -- maybe Jimi Hendrix could claim fair

use in that situation.

            And those are at the core of the traditional

contours of copyright.  So, if Congress were to try to

extinguish fair use, I'd say yes, we'd have a First

Amendment issue there.  If Congress were to try to

provide exclusive right in the ideas that are expressed,

as opposed to the expression itself, yes, we'd have a

First Amendment issue there.  If Congress were to, say,

use the copyright power to engage in viewpoint

discrimination --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it seems to me what

you're saying, and I'm glad you gave this answer because

originally I thought I was going to put in my notes the

First Amendment doesn't apply to the copyright area --

and that just can't be.

            What you're saying is, is that this law will

pass intermediate scrutiny.  It's an important

governmental interest, and it's substantially related to

that.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  We don't think it would

have any problem passing intermediate scrutiny, but we

don't think --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But can you -- can you

cite me to some -- some authority which says the First

Amendment doesn't apply to a copyright --

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  No.  We don't say it

doesn't apply, but Eldred --

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The First Amendment test

doesn't apply.  There has -- there has to be a -- a

test.  Now, maybe -- say it isn't immediate scrutiny but

something else.  But -- but certainly the First

Amendment is implicated.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.  And what Eldred

said, as I read it, Justice Kennedy, is that unless

Congress alters their traditional contours of copyright,

then rational basis scrutiny, rather than any heightened

form of First Amendment scrutiny, applies.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Even under -- even

under rational basis scrutiny, it seems to me that you

run into Justice Breyer's concern that the government

interest is vanishingly small when it comes to promoting

progress under the Copyright Clause, so that the

interest weighed on the other side of the -- the

restriction of free speech rights -- it's hard to say

that that's necessarily going to tip the balance in

every case.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think it is going to

tip the balance, Mr. Chief Justice, because the -- I --

the reason Congress enacted section 514, at the urging

of executive branch officials who were charged with

trying to ensure that we could integrate ourselves into

the international system of copyright protection, was

that if we didn't have this provision, then we were not

going to be taken seriously; our works were not going to

be protected in these foreign countries; and that it

would defeat the purpose of joining Berne in the first

place.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  It couldn't have been.

That must be somewhat overstated, mustn't it?  Because

the only concern is not about protecting new works in

the foreign countries.  The concern, as I understand it,

was that we've had things in copyright for many years,

and we want retroactive protection there.  The countries

that didn't give it, like Japan, were not kicked out of

the Berne Convention.

            Rather, we pursued them in the WTO for many

years, and I guess somebody might pursue us.  And then

you get into an argument about whether there are other

ways.  Now, is that strong enough to overcome what these

briefs are full of?

charged with looking for Jewish music in the periods

'30s, '40s, and '50s.  Other organizations might find a

treasure trove of literature that was -- that was

copyrighted in Czechoslovakia or in Warsaw, and they

want to put it on the Web, and they want people to

listen to it.  But they have no more idea of how to

track down the person on that, and they aren't protected

by any notice requirements because they aren't reliance

parties.

            We're told by Barbara Ringer, former

registrar, that there are millions of such instances

where people would like to go back and would like to put

music, literature, film, et cetera, in a form that

people can use it today, and there's no way to do it

without their becoming scofflaws or without their having

millions of dollars to hire infinite numbers of trackers

and lawyers.  Now, that's the argument that's made on

the other side, as the interest in communication that's

important.

            What do you say?

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  So, two points:  First,

with respect to the interest in what foreign countries

will do, I think it's incorrect to assume that this will

be tit-for-tat, that if we don't enforce article 18, the

only thing other countries won't do is enforce article

18 with respect to our works, as opposed to believing

that we're not an --  an effective partner and not

enforcing their copyright laws for the whole corpus of

our works.

            Second, Justice Breyer, that problem that

you identified just exists as a feature of copyright

law.  Copyright law exists for a certain time.  With

respect to those works, it's going to create that issue.

The problem here is just the result of a fortuity that

those works might have been published in a country that

at the time they were published didn't have copyright

relations with the United States.  And what section 514

does is address that fortuity by putting those authors

in the same position they would have been in had their

country had copyright relations with the United States.

And so, I don't think that's a principled objection on a

constitutional basis to section 514 --

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, here we have ASCAP.

We have ASCAP.  I agree with you that it is a general

problem.  It may be diminished in the United States, but

it still exists.  And I guess the argument here is,

well, don't make it millions of times worse.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, it doesn't make it

millions of times worse.  It applies to a small number

of -- but a significant number of countries --

have any reason to doubt the -- the aggregate number.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's presupposing that

they're all going to give notice.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, with respect to

reliance parties, that's certainly true.  They would

have to give notice.  It is the case, Justice Ginsburg,

that if you're not a reliance party, then there would be

an infringement even without notice.  So, I do think

there's something to that point.  But, again, I just

think that's a result of the fortuity of the countries

not having copyright relations with the United States.

matter of constitutional principle of the statute,

as a matter of text, I think it's clear -- there is no

unyielding requirement that you cannot restore copyright

to works in the public domain.  I think the history

really does bear that out.

            I think Justice Sotomayor had the history

exactly right, that in 1790, you had three States with

no copyright statutes.  Of the 10 States with copyright

statutes, you had 7 that did not provide copyright to

maps and charts, which the Federal statute did.  And I

think this is the key point:  Of the States that did

enact copyright statutes to -- in the 1780s, in advance

of the 1790 Federal Act, at least four, and depending on

how you counted, as many as eight provided copyright

protection only to works printed after the date of the

State statute.  They did that at the urging of the

Continental Congress in 1783.

            So, I don't think there's any doubt that

when Congress enacted the Copyright Act in 1790, it made

a conscious choice to take a different approach, to

grant copyright protection to existing works, including

many, many, many works that were freely available for

exploitation in those States --

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Doesn't that show at most

that retroactive protection can be granted when there is

an enormous interest in doing so, namely, the

establishment of a uniform copyright system at the

beginning of the country?  Because if Congress had not

done that and had said -- the alternative would be to

say things can be copyrighted going forward, then you

would have different copyright laws in all of the

States.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think -- I don't think

so, Justice Alito.  I think they could have followed the

model nationally of prospective copyright only and

extinguishing the prior copyright --

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Right.

            GENERAL VERRILLI:  -- and -- but they didn't

make that choice.  They made a different choice.  Now,

my friend suggests that the 1790 Act was just a

transition.  But, of course, the same thing is really

true in an important sense of section 514.  It's part of

a tradition -- of a transition of the United States into

the international system, which has required an

adjustment of our rules in order to bring us into

conformity with the international system.

            And beyond the example, of course, of the

1790 -- and by the way, with respect to that language in

the 1790 copyright -- who hath or hath not have

copyright -- that's just a rerun of an argument that the

Court rejected in Wheaton v. Peters.  In Wheaton, the

Court said that that language in the 1790 Act was

referring to pre-publication common law copyright, not

post-publication common law copyright.

            Beyond that, it seems to me pretty clear

that what that language was referring to -- of course,

Congress presupposed the existence of copyrights.  There

were all these State statutes that created some

copyrights.  But what Congress did was act far more

broadly.

            And -- so, I do think -- and then when one

looks at the examples of patents -- and I think the

Oliver Evans example and that case is an important

example.  Early in our history, Congress creates a new

patent term to an expired patent.  President Jefferson

signs it.  Secretary of State Madison issues it.  Chief

Justice Marshall upholds it as a circuit justice, and

the Court upholds it against a charge that it's

impermissibly burdening people who act in reliance on

the expiration of the prior patent.

            There wasn't a word in this Court's decision

in that case about any potential constitutional

infirmity with doing that.  And one would think if this

was such a significant and viable principle of

constitutional law, that someone would have brought it

up in those cases.  In fact, the striking thing about

reading the Evans decision is that the Court clearly

looks at this all as a matter of legislative policy

judgment.  It says, you know, yes, you're right, it

might have been an argument, a good argument in favor of

creating some reliance interest here, but that's a

judgment Congress should have made if anybody was going

to make it.  It didn't -- and there is no reading of the

-- there's no required reading of that statute that has

to protect the reliance party.

            So, I don't -- I just think when you look at

the patent protection, when you look at the 1790 Act,

when you consider the fact that when Congress expands

exclusive rights, as it did for example with respect to

musical compositions but did in the 1976 Act with

respect to lots of exclusive rights, it does so with

existing copyrights.

            And all of that points up the wisdom of what

this court said in Eldred, that within very wide

margins, these are matters for legislative choice.

These are policy calls that require the balancing of a

complex set of interests, the drawing of a complex set

of lines made even more complex by virtue of the fact

that we are now trying to make a transition into full

participation in an international system, which is of

vital importance to protecting one of our most valuable

economic exports, intellectual property.

            Thank you.

         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY T. FALZONE

              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

            MR. FALZONE:  Thank you.  I have -- I have

four points to make:  First one, refusing to provide any

protection for a work is setting the term at zero.  The

point of the limited times restriction is it -- excuse

me -- it forces Congress to tell us when the end has

come.  And if Congress is forever free to change its

mind, then we can never know if the end has come.

            Point number two, this statute does not and

cannot promote progress, that is, the creation and

spread of knowledge and learning.  When we joined Berne

in 1988, we got all of its prospective benefits or, as

the Government put it, secured the highest available

level of multilateral copyright protection for U.S.

artists, authors, and their creators.  This statute is

not about that.  It's simply about rewarding people who

made things long ago.  It's --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  At the time we joined

Berne, there was an appreciation that we deferred the

article 18 issue.  There wasn't any -- anyone who said

that we satisfied it.

            MR. FALZONE:  No.  There was an express

finding -- explicit finding written into the statute,

that -- and Congress found explicitly that we could

comply with all Berne obligations without removing

anything from the public domain.

            Now, third point --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, there were many

people who read article 18 in a different way, and

Congress was later persuaded that that was right.

            MR. FALZONE:  Congress never revisited that

finding.  So, no, they found what they found in 1988,

and they never revisited it.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They -- they found that

compliance with article 18 was appropriate for us to

become a full member of the international copyright

community.

            MR. FALZONE:  Congress did not make that

finding, and I don't think you can even glean that from

the testimony that was presented to Congress.  The

problem here is the -- the right to use works in the

public domain has defined the freedom of speech that the

public has known since 1790.  The 1790 Act made these

freedoms clear by placing works unambiguously and

clearly in the public domain, including all foreign

works.  So, even since before we had a First Amendment,

that has defined the freedom of speech that the public

knew.

            And that right has also made sure that the

copyright sequence provides ever-increasing protection

for public speech rights.  It gives partial protection

for some public speech interests during any initial

period of protection, but that blossoms into complete

protection for all public speech interests, once we

reach the limit Congress picks, once they place the work

in the public domain.

            The burden on speech that this statute

imposes is remarkable.  Let's start with the performance

right, which is central to my clients.  There can't be

any doubt, as I think Chief Justice Roberts got at, that

the performance has a huge amount of original expression

bound up in it.  It's the reason it's different to see

King Lear at the Royal Shakespeare Company; it's the

reason it's different when John Coltrane plays a jazz

standard.  Huge amount of expression.

            But even if you put performances aside, this

Court has recognized in case after case that there is a

critical speech interest in publishing the work of

another author, in showing a film created by another, or

for that matter, performing the work of another.  So,

the -- the burden here is it took speech rights of 250

million Americans and turned them into the private

property of foreign authors, all on the bare possibility

that might put more money in the pocket of some U.S.

authors.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  All this rides on

accepting your argument that zero is a limited time.

            MR. FALZONE:  No.  Not on the First

Amendment side.  Not at all.  No, no, no.

            No.  That is -- the First Amendment argument

is completely independent of that.  Even if you find

Congress could do this on the Copyright Clause, we still

have that First Amendment problem, and the -- there is

no way the Government can pass intermediate scrutiny

here.

            This was not required by Berne.  The

Government does not even contend Section 514 was

required by Berne, nor could it, because that would

violate Congress's explicit findings they made in 1988.

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would you say it was

would required by TRIPS?

            MR. FALZONE:  No.  Because TRIPS just

implements Berne.  So that the problem here is this

statute was not passed --

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it not so that if we

don't comply with Berne 18, then we are subject to being

sanctioned by some World Trade Organization --

            MR. FALZONE:  There was very vague testimony

about the unsupported possibility that could happen, and

that's why the Government falls back on this interest of

avoiding a dispute.

            Here is the problem:  If the government can

get around First Amendment limits by signing a treaty,

and then the flexibility to take away public speech

rights is defined by some complaint proffered by some

treaty partner, then the First Amendment is defined only

by the perceptions, the complaints, and, frankly, the
