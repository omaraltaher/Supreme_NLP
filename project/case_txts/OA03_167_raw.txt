 CHIEF JUSTICE  REHNQUIST:  We'll hear  argument

 Mr. Himmelfarb. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  Mr. Chief Justice, and  may it 

10  please the Court: 

11

 This  Court  has  consistently  held  in  both 

12  harmless error and plain error cases that an error affects 

13  substantial  rights  if  it affected  the  outcome  of the 

14  district court proceeding.  Applying that principle  to a 

15  violation of rule 11 at a guilty plea proceeding, 9 of the 

16  12  courts  of  appeals  that  hear  criminal  cases  have 

17  concluded that a rule 11  error affects substantial rights 

18  if it affected  the defendant's decision to  plead guilty, 

19  which means that the defendant would not have gone forward 

20  with  his  plea  if  the error  had  not  occurred.  That 

21  standard is correct. 

22

23

 The Ninth Circuit standard which the -­

 QUESTION:  May I  just ask  this one  question? 

24  Because  I'm  -- I'm  not  at all  sure  of the 

--  

is it 

25  perfectly clear  that the  -- in  terms -- effect of  the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

3 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  decision necessarily is equated to  the fact he would  not 

2  have otherwise have pleaded guilty? 

3

 MR.  HIMMELFARB:  In  the  context of  a guilty 

4  plea, I think it is, Justice Stevens.  That's the relevant 

5  decision.  This  Court's cases  have applied the  harmless 

6  error and plain error effect on substantial rights element 

7  in a  variety of circumstances:  at a  detention hearing, 

8  during  the  course  of  a  grand  jury  proceeding,  most 

9  frequently a  trial, of  course, and  also at  sentencing. 

10  Each of  those four  circumstances, the  Court made  clear 

11  that the  relevant question was whether the effect of that 

12  particular proceeding would have been the same -­

13

14

15  made. 

 QUESTION:  Well -­

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  -- if  the error had  not been 

16

 QUESTION:  Except that we -- I mean, the -- the 

17  meaning of that  term varies.  In -- in some contexts, we 

18  say,  well, it's -- it's enough if  -- if confidence in -­

19  in that  the  result would  have been  the  same has  been 

20  shattered.  In  -- in the case at the other extreme with a 

21  case -- we  -- I think  that is strongest  for you, we 

--

22  we've  said  in  the  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel 

23  context, yes,  you've got  to show  that he  wouldn't have 

24  pleaded guilty or he's got  to show that he wouldn't  have 

25  pleaded guilty otherwise.  And -- and it seems to  me that 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

4 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  the -- the issue here is, is this enough -- is the context 

2  here enough like the context  in ineffective assistance of 

3  counsel  to 

--  

to  put  the  heaviest  burden  on  the 

4  petitioner,  or  is  it 

--  

are  there 

--  

are  enough 

5  distinctions so that  maybe the burden shouldn't  be quite 

6  that heavy? 

7

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  We think the -- we think it's 

8  directly  analogous  to  the  ineffective  assistance  of 

9  counsel context.  In that context,  you have a  deficient 

10  performance by the  defendant's lawyer in connection  with 

11  advice about  a guilty plea.  And this Court's decision in 

12  Hill  v. Lockhart makes  clear that  the next step  of the 

13  Strickland  analysis, the  prejudice analysis,  is whether 

14  but for  that deficient  performance, the defendant  would 

15  not  have pleaded  guilty and would  have gone  forward to 

16  trial. 

17

18

19  here. 

 QUESTION:  All right.  No.  Your -- we -­

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  We think  the same rule applies 

20

 QUESTION:  Let me -- let me suggest at least  a 

21  reason why maybe it isn't.  I'd like your comment on it. 

22

 In -- in the ineffective assistance  of counsel 

23  context, one  reason for putting a  high -- you  know, the 

24  heaviest  burden on the  defendant is  that it is  so very 

25  difficult to police effective assistance  as you go along. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

5 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  The judge watching the -- the plea hearing has no  way of 

2  knowing what's  going on or has gone on between the lawyer 

3  and -- and the client. 

4

 Here, we're in  a different position.  There -­

5  there are a  couple of people in a position to -- to avoid 

6  the kind of problem that we've got here.  One obviously is 

7  the Federal judge.  If he had a checklist in front of him, 

8  something like this wouldn't have happened. 

9

 The second is  counsel for the Government.  The 

10  counsel for the Government can get  up in a case like this 

11  and  say,  Judge,  you forgot  something,  and  avoid this 

12  problem. 

13

 So  it may be that because there are easier ways 

14  to avoid this, the burden  on the defendant shouldn't have 

15  to be so heavy.  What do you say to that? 

16

 MR.  HIMMELFARB:  Well,  this Court's  decision 

17  makes clear  in Vonn that the  defendant has a  burden, of 

18  course,  rejected  the  contention in  that  case  that no 

19  matter when -- regardless of  the circumstances of when  a 

20  rule 11 error occurs,  the Government bears the burden  of 

21  showing that there  was no  effect on substantial  rights. 

22  The  holding  of Vonn  is  that  the  defendant bears  the 

23  burden. 

24

 The  only  question in  this  case is  what that 

25  standard is, and we think again it's directly analogous to 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

6 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  the ineffective assistance of counsel context. 

2

 QUESTION: 

Well,  you  don't  think  that  the 

3  standard for plain  error that  the Court  spelled out  in 

4  United States v. Olano provides the standard? 

5

 MR.  HIMMELFARB: 

Justice  O'Connor,  that's 

6  exactly  our  position. 

Our  position  is  that  a 

7  straightforward application of Olano --

8

 QUESTION:  Well, if  -- if  that's so,  Olano's 

9  fourth prong,  if  you will,  is that  the  error -- asks 

10  whether  the  error  seriously  affects  the  fairness, 

11  integrity, or  public reputation of  judicial proceedings. 

12  And I'm not sure that  I understand, under your test,  how 

13  that fourth prong would be  applied or if it's still  part 

14  of the test. 

15

 MR.  HIMMELFARB: 

It  certainly  is,  Justice 

16  O'Connor.  We  make two  alternative arguments, one  under 

17  the  third prong of  the plain  error rule, one  under the 

18  fourth.  Our  primary  submission is  that  in  order  to 

19  satisfy the third requirement of  the plain error rule 

--

20  in other  words, in order to show an effect on substantial 

21  rights -- that's right -- a defendant has to show that the 

22  error affected his decision to plead guilty. 

23

 Our alternative  argument is  that the  Court -­

24  even if  the Ninth Circuit standard  is correct so  that a 

25  defendant would not  have to show that  the error affected 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

7 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  his decision to plead guilty in order to show an effect on 

2  substantial  rights and  he  could  therefore satisfy  the 

3  third  requirement  of  the  plain  error rule,  he  can't 

4  satisfy  the  fourth  requirement  unless  he  makes  that 

5  showing.  And  we think that conclusion  follows from this 

6  Court's decisions in  Cotton and  Johnson where the  Court 

7  assumed, without deciding,  that the failure to  submit an 

8  element of the offense to the grand jury or the petit jury 

9  affected substantial  rights, but held that  the defendant 

10  could  not  satisfy the  fourth  requirement of  the plain 

11  error rule  because the error had no effect on the outcome 

12  of the  grand jury proceeding or  of the trial.  So we're 

13  making two alternative arguments here, one under the -­

14

 QUESTION:  May I ask  you a question  about the 

15  practical aspect  of it?  And  you're asking the  Court to 

16  choose -- well, the plain error  is what we're  doing and 

17  how high a  burden the defendant would have  to meet.  But 

18  this relates to a question Justice Souter asked. 

19

 I was surprised, given that  this was not a  new 

20  district judge, that she  didn't have a litany that  would 

21  cover all the rule 11 elements.  And I was also surprised 

22  that the  Assistant U.S. Attorney didn't say at the end of 

23  the colloquy, judge, you forgot  to mention that this plea 

24  can't be withdrawn. 

25

 Is there a manual that  judges follow?  Are U.S. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

8 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  -- Assistant U.S. Attorneys  instructed, when something is 

2  left out of rule 11, to remind the judge? 

3

 MR.  HIMMELFARB: 

Justice  Ginsburg, 

my 

4  understanding is that  there is a bench book  available to 

5  judges,  and  obviously there  are  a great  many district 

6  judges in  the United States district courts  and some are 

7  going to be more meticulous than others. 

8

 Assistant U.S.  Attorneys often or at  least are 

9  supposed to bring  checklists with them  to a guilty  plea 

10  proceeding  so  that  they  can  ensure  that rule  11  is 

11  strictly complied  with.  Of  course, a prosecutor  has no 

12  more interest in litigating a rule 11 error on appeal than 

13  anybody else  does.  So it's very much in the prosecutor's 

14  interest to try to ensure that there's strict compliance. 

15

 Vonn makes clear, though, that in the event that 

16  one of the  -- one of the  advisements slips -- and  there 

17  was only one here that the district judge did not give 

--

18  it's  the defendant's burden to  object and if he doesn't, 

19  he's in  a plain error posture  on appeal, not  a harmless 

20  error posture. 

21

 QUESTION:  Mr. Himmelfarb, is it  -- is it clear 

22  in this  case that  the defendant believed  that he  could 

23  withdraw his plea?  Do we know that? 

24

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  We don't.  The record is silent 

25  on that question. 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

9 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

 QUESTION:  Do you think that -- that a defendant 

2  making a  guilty plea would normally believe that he could 

3  withdraw it when  the Government has promised  him nothing 

4  except  that it  would recommend  to  the judge  a certain 

5  sentence? 

6

 MR.  HIMMELFARB: 

Well,  it  depends,  Justice 

7  Scalia.  In a case like this,  we think a defendant would 

8  not reasonably be  under that  impression because in  this 

9  case, this -- this defendant  -- respondent was repeatedly 

10  advised that  the judge was not  bound by the  guilty plea 

11  and  that  he  would  face  a  10-year  mandatory  minimum 

12  sentence if the parties' recommendation was not followed. 

13

 QUESTION: 

If  I  was  given  all  of  that 

14  information,  I 

--  

I  certainly  wouldn't  leap  to  the 

15  conclusion that,  well, if the judge doesn't  accept it, I 

16  can withdraw the guilty  plea.  I don't know why  he would 

17  naturally believe that.  I would think he  would naturally 

18  believe the opposite. 

19

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  We agree,  Justice Scalia, and 

20  that's why we think -­

21

 QUESTION:  Wasn't  -- wasn't that covered  in -­

22  in the  plea agreement  itself which  was translated  into 

23  Spanish  for him,  specifically that  he could  not -- he 

24  could not  withdraw his plea if  the judge did  not accept 

25  the plea? 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

10 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  That -- that's  exactly right, 

2  Mr. Chief Justice. 

3

 QUESTION:  Your basic point is that this part of 

4  the rule is pointless. 

5

6

7  point.

11

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  Not at all, Justice Stevens. 

 QUESTION:  Well, I guess that's Justice Scalia's 

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  No.  There may --

 (Laughter.) 

 QUESTION:  I'm sorry. 

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  My point is that in a case like 

12  this where  a defendant is advised  that the judge  is not 

13  bound  by  the  parties'  agreement,  it's  probably  not 

14  reasonable  for  that  defendant  to  assume that  he  can 

15  withdraw his plea if the judge doesn't follow the -­

16

 QUESTION:  My point is  not that it's pointless. 

17  My  point  is  that  when  it  is  omitted,  it  does  not 

18  necessarily  produce substantial injustice.  It's  a good 

19  idea to give it, of course.  But in the absence  of giving 

20  it, I  would think that normally you'd think that he would 

21  assume that anyway. 

22

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's exactly right.  That's 

23  our position, Justice Scalia. 

24

 QUESTION:  But if  that's  right and  I were  a 

25  district  judge,  I  could  probably  save  time  by  just 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

11 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  omitting this regularly then. 

2

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  No,  Justice Stevens,  I don't 

3  think  that's  likely  to  happen.  District  judges  are 

4  generally  quite conscientious  about complying  with rule 

5  11.  Prosecutors are generally  quite conscientious about 

6  making  sure  that district  judges  comply with  rule 11. 

7  Nobody has an interest in having appellate litigation over 

8  rule 11  errors.  Everyone has an interest -- everyone has 

9  an interest  in  making  sure that  rule  11  is  strictly 

10  complied  with so that  the judgment of  conviction can be 

11  entered and  people can move  on to other business.  So I 

12  don't think -­

13

 QUESTION:  Even -- even respondent doesn't argue 

14  here  that  any  omission  from  the rule  11  requirement 

15  produces  an automatic  reversal.  Does respondent  argue 

16  that? 

17

18

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  No.  My -­

 QUESTION:  So,  I mean, that's -- that's not the 

19  theory here, that if you don't -- if  you don't produce an 

20  automatic  reversal,  people  won't  give  the  rule  11 

21  requirements. 

22

 MR.  HIMMELFARB: 

That's  right. 

The  Ninth 

23  Circuit does not have a  rule of automatic reversal.  The 

24  Ninth  Circuit standard is  if the  error is not  minor or 

25  technical and the defendant wasn't  otherwise aware of the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

12 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  omitted  information, he  shows an  effect on  substantial 

2  rights. 

3

 Our position is  that knowledge  of the  omitted 

4  information is a  sufficient condition  to defeat a  claim 

5  that there was  an effect on substantial  rights, but it's 

6  not necessary. 

7

 QUESTION:  Now, is your knowledge of requirement 

8  a wholly subjective test?  We -- we want to know what this 

9  defendant  thought.  Or is  it what  a  reasonable person 

10  would have concluded based on all of the circumstances? 

11

 MR.  HIMMELFARB:  It's  a subjective  standard, 

12  Justice Kennedy.  In the context  of a guilty  plea, when 

13  the question is whether the error affected the defendant's 

14  decision to plead guilty, the relevant question is whether 

15  this particular defendant  would have  pled -- would  have 

16  gone to trial. 

17

 QUESTION:  So you put him on the stand.  You put 

18  him on the stand and -­

19

 MR.  HIMMELFARB: 

No, you  don't. 

You can't 

20  because  by definition  in the plain  error/harmless error 

21  context, you're limited to the record on appeal. 

22

 Objective considerations are  obviously relevant 

23  in  making the  subjective determination  of whether  this 

24  particular defendant would have pled guilty. 

25

 QUESTION:  Well, you're limited to the record on 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

13 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  appeal.  Could there have been a hearing in the -- in the 

2  district court on the rule 11 -­

3

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  There could, Justice  Kennedy. 

4  For  example, if the  defendant had moved  to withdraw his 

5  plea after  he pled but  before sentencing, it  might have 

6  been  within  the district  court's  discretion to  hold a 

7  hearing and  you could have  had the defendant  testify at 

8  that hearing. 

9

 QUESTION:  But  after sentence, it's  impossible 

10  for him to testify? 

11

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's right.  Under  -- under 

12  rule 11, a defendant can move to withdraw his plea for any 

13  reason before it's accepted. 

14

 QUESTION:  But he didn't do that.  This question 

15  wasn't  raised  until appeal 

--  

the appeal. 

He didn't 

16  say -­

17

 MR.  HIMMELFARB: 

That's  exactly right. 

It 

18  wasn't raised at  any point in the district court, Justice 

19  Ginsburg. 

20

 QUESTION:  But -- but my  question is in  -- in 

21  other cases  it would not  be possible  to put him  on the 

22  stand at any time after sentencing. 

23

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  No.  After sentencing, the rule 

24  makes clear  a defendant can't move to  withdraw his plea. 

25  The only way he can attack his plea is by direct appeal or 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

14 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  a collateral attack.  But before sentencing it's -­

2

 QUESTION:  On collateral attack, could  he take 

3  the stand? 

4

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  Sure.  It would be  within the 

5  discretion of the  district judge  and his willingness  to 

6  testify.

10

 QUESTION:  Under your -­

 QUESTION:  Can you -­

 QUESTION:  Excuse me. 

 QUESTION:  Can  you collaterally  attack a  plea 

11  before 0 appealed and sought to have it set aside? 

12

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  No, Mr. Chief Justice.  There's 

13  -- there's,  of  course, a  requirement  that you  file  a 

14  direct  appeal.  Otherwise  you  will  have  procedurally 

15  defaulted. 

16

 I  should  also  say  that  this Court  held  in 

17  Timmreck that  a formal violation of rule 11, which is all 

18  that we have here, is not cognizable in a 2255 proceeding. 

19

 QUESTION:  Normally -- you may know  -- I'm just 

20  drawing on  your background.  Normally when you say did it 

21  affect  somebody's substantial  rights, when  I  see those 

22  words, I  think the  judge did something  to this  person. 

23  And  when I say  did it  affect his substantial  rights, I 

24  think, well, did  it matter in terms of what  the judge or 

25  the jury did to him.  Now, is  that a correct way to think 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

15 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  about it?  Are  there other  instances where  substantial 

2  rights means something different than that? 

3

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  In the  ordinary context,  the 

4  relevant decision-maker  is,  of course,  the  judge,  and 

5  the -­

6

 QUESTION: 

No, I'm  not  talking about  -- I'm 

7  saying something happened to this human being who is there 

8  in court, and when I  say did this affect his  substantial 

9  rights,  I  usually ask  myself  did  this  error  make  a 

10  difference in terms of what happened to him.  That's how I 

11 

--  

it's  very  colloquial,  but  that's  the  question  I 

12  normally ask myself.  Now, maybe all these years I've been 

13  doing it wrong or maybe there's some circumstances where I 

14  should ask  that question.  You  know, like a  death case, 

15  which is a horrible case, sometimes there's harmless error 

16  and usually the question there  is did it matter in  terms 

17  of his being sentenced to death.  Those come up a lot. 

18

 I'm just asking you a general question.  I don't 

19  have a  point here.  I'm trying to  figure out how best to 

20  think about this. 

21

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  No.  We think your formulation 

22  is exactly the right way to think -­

23

 QUESTION: 

Fine. 

If  that  is  the  correct 

24  formulation,  can  you  think of  other  instances  in the 

25  criminal  law  where  substantial rights  meant  something 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

16 

Alderson Reporting Company

1  other than this formulation? 

2

 MR.  HIMMELFARB:  I  can.  The -- an  affect on 

3  substantial rights  means that  there's an  affect on  the 

4  outcome. 

5

 QUESTION:  That's my question.  I'm asking it to 

6  inform myself and I have  the same question for the  other 

7  side too. 

8

 MR.  HIMMELFARB:  Let -- let  me qualify that -­

9  that answer  if  I could,  Justice Breyer. 

That is  the 

10  general rule. 

There are,  of course,  certain types  of 

11  error, as  this Court has made clear, which do not require 

12  a showing of -­

13

 QUESTION:  Like  structural error.  That's one 

14  kind of exception. 

15

16

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's exactly right. 

 QUESTION:  But  I don't think we  normally speak 

17  in terms of substantial rights  in those cases.  Maybe  we 

18  do.  I don't know. 

19

 MR.  HIMMELFARB:  Well, sometimes  the question 

20  will be whether the  third requirement of the plain  error 

21  rule, which is a substantial  rights requirement, has been 

22  affected. 

23

 QUESTION:  All right.  So -- so structural error 

24  cases are an instance where my colloquial question is  not 

25  right and  nobody claims here  this is a  structural error

1  case. 

2

 MR.  HIMMELFARB:  We  certainly don't,  Justice 

3  Breyer.  I -- I don't  believe respondent does,  and the 

4  court of appeals did not take that position either. 

5

 QUESTION:  Mr. Himmelfarb,  there's -- there's 

6  another specific about  this case that might  have averted 

7  what happened.  The -- the entire plea agreement was read 

8  to the defendant  in translation  because he didn't  speak 

9  English.  And that was the day before.  If it had been the 

10  practice to give him a copy of the translation, instead of 

11  just having  him hear  it orally,  then it  would have 

--

12  might better  for him to read  and we would  have had more 

13  security that he knew. 

14

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  Justice Ginsburg, I don't know 

15  as an empirical matter which is more likely to ensure that 

16  a  defendant is  aware of  what's in  the plea  agreement, 

17  sitting down  with a lawyer  and a Spanish  interpreter as 

18  happened  here and having  the three  of them go  over the 

19  plea agreement,  having the Spanish  interpreter translate 

20  it for  the defendant in the  presence of counsel  so that 

21  the defendant can  ask any questions  of counsel that  are 

22  necessary and counsel can answer them, on the one hand, or 

23  the suggestion which you just made. 

24

 QUESTION:  But I meant both, that is, that there 

25  would be the written -- written-out plea agreement, which 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

18 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  if he could read English, he could have read, and then the 

2  lawyer and the  translator go  over that written  document 

3  with him, that that I  think would be more effective  than 

4  just hearing it orally. 

5

 MR.  HIMMELFARB:  Again,  I'm not  sure whether 

6  that's true  as an empirical matter.  As a  legal matter, 

7  the  question here  is when  a defendant  has forfeited  a 

8  claim of error and he has to show an effect on substantial 

9  rights on appeal, if you have -­

10

 QUESTION:  But I didn't mean this  to be legally 

11  dispositive.  It's in the  same way -- how  could this be 

12  warded  off so  we don't get  a Federal case  out of these 

13  rule 11 slips. 

14

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  Again, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I 

15  don't  think  it's  ordinarily  the  practice  of  U.S. 

16  Attorney's offices to provide Spanish translations of plea 

17  agreements to Spanish  speakers who  don't speak  English. 

18  It's always the  practice, whether the translator is at -­

19  comes at the  defendant's expense or the  court's expense, 

20  for a translator to  translate the plea agreement for  the 

21  defendant in -- in the presence of  counsel.  I -- I don't 

22  know what would be the  source of any requirement for  the 

23  Government to provide a Spanish -­

24

 QUESTION:  I -- I wasn't suggesting that -- that 

25  it was a requirement.

 May  -- may I  ask just one  more puzzling thing 

2  about this  case, background of it?  The reason  that the 

3  deal didn't -- wasn't possible was that this man had three 

4  priors  instead of everybody thought -- well, at least the 

5  judge  thought  or  the  prosecutor  thought,  until  the 

6  presentence report, there was only one.  But the defendant 

7  must have known how many priors he had. 

8

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's right.  The defendant, 

9  of course, knew  that he had  three prior convictions  and 

10  not just one.  I'm not sure what bearing that fact  has on 

11  the  plain error  analysis in  this case because  it's not 

12  just the fact  of the  prior convictions  that would  have 

13  rendered  this defendant  ineligible for a  sentence below 

14  the  mandatory minimum. 

There has  to  be a  guidelines 

15  calculation and  assignment of criminal history  points to 

16  each conviction, and if you get above one criminal history 

17  point,  you're  not  eligible  for  a sentence  below  the 

18  mandatory minimum.  So you would -­

19

 QUESTION:  Well, you might -- you might say that 

20  the fact  that the defendant must  have known that  he had 

21  three priors would  have made  him realize  that the  plea 

22  agreement probably wouldn't be accepted. 

23

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  One could  reasonably conclude 

24  that he should have had substantial doubt about whether he 

25  would have been eligible for the -­

 QUESTION:  Are you  assuming he  understood the 

2  sentencing guidelines in that detail?

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  No.  That's -­

 QUESTION:  It'd  be rather  unusual.  The  basic 

5  problem here is we're dealing with dumb defendants. 

6

7

 (Laughter.) 

 QUESTION:  That's  the problem.  That's  why you 

8  have to tell them twice. 

9

 MR.  HIMMELFARB: 

Well,  that's true,  Justice 

10  Stevens. 

11

12

 QUESTION:  Yes. 

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  Rule 11  imposes a requirement 

13  on the  district  judge to  advise  the defendant  of  his 

14  rights.  Nobody disputes that  that didn't happen here for 

15  one of the advisements and nobody disputes that there  was 

16  therefore rule 11 error.  Nor does anybody dispute that it 

17  was a plain error.  But since defendant didn't object 

--

18  respondent didn't object in the district court, we're in a 

19  plain error  posture.  That  is a  difficult standard  to 

20  meet.  He has  to show  not  only that  there's an  error 

21  that's  plain,  but  he has  to  satisfy  these two  other 

22  requirements that I'll mention. 

23

 QUESTION:  Why  shouldn't it be as  an objective 

24  test,  do you think?  I don't know  why you focus on -- on 

25  something  else.  I  mean, can't  we assess whether  -- in 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

21 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  determining whether it affects substantial rights, how the 

2  evidence against the  defendant was, what the  benefits of 

3  the plea  were, and  what he  was told  in just  objective 

4  terms? 

5

 QUESTION: 

In  other  words, 

reasonable 

6  probability. 

7

 QUESTION:  Yes.  I mean, why do you want to make 

8  it something else? 

9

 MR.  HIMMELFARB: 

Justice  O'Connor,  it  is 

10  absolutely the case  that in undertaking this  analysis, a 

11  court  should  and  ordinarily  will  look  at  objective 

12  factors.  In most cases -­

13

 QUESTION:  I would think you would win under an 

14  objective test.  I don't know  why you're trying  to urge 

15  something else. 

16

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  We think  that -- we agree that 

17  we win under either an objective or a subjective standard, 

18  given  the  strength of  the  case against  respondent and 

19  given the fact that he received a substantial benefit from 

20  pleading.  We think that  a -- a  subjective test is  the 

21  appropriate one because this  is not a situation  like you 

22  have  when there's trial  error and you  have to determine 

23  whether the jury  objectively would have reached  the same 

24  decision -­

25

 QUESTION: 

But

but  if  you're  doing  a

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  subjective test, you might as  -- as long as you're  doing 

2  that, why not accept the Ninth Circuit test:  did he know? 

3

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well, Justice Kennedy, we think 

4  that if he did knew -- if he did know, that's a sufficient 

5  basis for rejecting his claim because if he knew, the fact 

6  that the judge didn't tell him a second time -­

7

 QUESTION:  No, no.  I -- I thought that this was 

8  the Ninth Circuit test that you disagree with.  And my -­

9  my point  is if you're going  to go this  objective route, 

10  you might  as well  ask the  basic question  as the  Ninth 

11  Circuit did. 

12

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  We  -- we have no  problem with 

13  the question the Ninth Circuit asked.  Our problem is that 

14  they stopped after they asked  that question.  That should 

15  probably be the  first question.  If there's evidence  in 

16  the record that  the defendant was otherwise  aware of the 

17  omitted rule 11 information, it would be very difficult to 

18  say that  he would  have gone  to trial  if the judge  had 

19  omitted to say something that he already knew.  That's why 

20  we think that's a sufficient --

21

 QUESTION:  I still would  like to understand why 

22  you think an objective test is not acceptable. 

23

 MR.  HIMMELFARB: 

In 

--  

in  the 

--  

when  a 

24  defendant is confronted  with a choice of  pleading guilty 

25  or  going  to trial,  he  has -- he,  of  course, has  an 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

23 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  absolute right to go to  trial.  No matter how  strong the 

2  evidence is  against him, no matter what benefits he could 

3  get  from  pleading guilty,  if  he chooses,  for whatever 

4  personal or idiosyncratic  reason, to go to  trial despite 

5  those things, he's  got the right to do it.  That's why we 

6  think -­

7

 QUESTION:  Maybe  -- maybe you think  the courts 

8  would not -- would not  stand by an objective test in  the 

9  situation where the  facts are  such that any  intelligent 

10  defendant would have -- would  have made the plea even  if 

11  he knew  that it couldn't be revoked.  But this particular 

12  defendant, for whatever  reason -- and  it's clear on  the 

13  record he  told his counsel or he left  -- left a note and 

14  said, well,  there's no harm in making this plea because I 

15  can always  withdraw it if the judge doesn't go along with 

16  the recommended sentence.  And  in that situation, I think 

17  it's very hard for  a court to say, oh, yes,  a -- since a 

18  reasonable  defendant  would 

--  

would  have  gone  ahead 

19  anyway,  this -- this  defendant who  would not  have gone 

20  ahead anyway must be held to his guilty plea. 

21

22

 MR. HIMMELFARB:  I think that's right. 

 Let  me -- let  me just  add this point  to what 

23  I've  already  said. 

While  the objective  question  of 

24  whether  a  reasonable  defendant  in  the  defendant's 

25  circumstances would  have pleaded  is not,  we think,  the 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

24 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  correct analysis under  the third  component of the  plain 

2  error rule, we do think it  could be taken into account in 

3  connection  with  the  fourth  requirement, which  is  the 

4  discretionary component. 

5

 So,  in  other words,  if  you have  a situation 

6  where a defendant for some idiosyncratic reason was intent 

7  on going to trial, even though it was essentially suicidal 

8  for him to  do that, he might be able to satisfy the third 

9  requirement  because it  affected  his  decision to  plead 

10  guilty, but a  court could  permissibly say, that  doesn't 

11  serious  affect  the  fairness,  integrity,  and  public 

12  reputation of judicial proceedings  because he undoubtedly 

13  would have  been convicted  if he  had gone  to trial  and 

14  would have gotten a longer sentence. 

15

 I'd like  to reserve the balance of  my time for 

16  rebuttal.

 QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Himmelfarb. 

 Ms. Mossman, we'll hear from you. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MYRA D. MOSSMAN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 MS.  MOSSMAN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice, and  may it 

22  please the Court: 

23

24

 I have three points to make. 

 First, Olano created a framework  that the lower 

25  courts have  been  consistently applying 

--  

applying  in 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

25 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  evaluating  forfeited errors in  a rule 11  context for 11 

2  years. 

3

 Second, now having suffered an adverse ruling in 

4  a fact-specific case, the Government  is urging this Court 

5  to  adopt  a strict,  heavy  burden, bright  line, but-for 

6  prejudice test  in every  case that  eliminates the  lower 

7  court's flexibility. 

8

 Third,  not  only  is  the  Government's  test 

9  incorrect, but the  Ninth Circuit cited and  applied Olano 

10  and was consistent with Olano in Benitez. 

11

 Now, first,  the  Olano standard  is a  national 

12  standard under plain  error review where an  error affects 

13  the  substantial rights.  And that means  -- generally is 

14  taken  to  mean  it's  prejudiced. 

And  in  most  cases 

15  prejudice  means  that  it  affects  the  outcome  of  the 

16  proceedings.  In  Benitez, this is what  the Ninth Circuit 

17  held as  well because  in Benitez,  if it's  not minor  or 

18  technical, that means it's prejudicial. 

19

20

21

 QUESTION:  Why? 

 QUESTION:  But that's not so. 

 QUESTION:  Has -- has --

 QUESTION:  I mean -­

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Or consistently can be -­

 QUESTION:  I read the Ninth Circuit.  It  seemed 

25  to me we said just what you said  we said.  What the Ninth 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

26 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  Circuit says  is Benitez must prove that the error was not 

2  minor or  technical, which by the  way, has nothing  to do 

3  with  it  because a  minor or  technical error  could well 

4  affect the outcome.  And then it says, and that he did not 

5  understand the rights at issue, which again is a necessary 

6  but not sufficient condition. 

7

 Now,  where  did  they  say  anything  about 

8  substantial  rights? 

They  used  those  words,  but  if 

9  substantial  rights  means what  I  -- we  just discussed, 

10  which  I'd like your  view about, they  never talked about 

11  substantial rights. 

12

 MS.  MOSSMAN:

don't  talk  about 

13  substantial -­

14

 QUESTION:  Well, didn't  they say  just what  I 

15  read? 

16

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Yes, but if -­

 QUESTION:  So why isn't it like summary reverse? 

18  We said this.  You say that. 

19

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Well, it's -- we -- we  see that 

20  not  minor or technical  means it  has -- it  affected his 

21  substantial rights, and they actually cite to Olano. 

22

 QUESTION:  Oh,  I see. 

Now, then  what  does 

23  affect substantial  rights mean?  Now,  we have  an error 

24  here that's not minor or technical.

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  Breyer, and that was Chan and they cite to that in Benitez 

2  where they got  exactly the  sentence that they  bargained 

3  for.  Therefore, the error is not minor or technical. 

4

 QUESTION:  Oh, I'm  sorry.  A terribly  minor, 

5  terribly important error, terribly important.  Indeed, the 

6  judge has  a whooping cough fit  and nothing comes  out of 

7  his  mouth, but he  gives them  the sentence he  asks for. 

8  Okay? 

9

10

11

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  What about that? 

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Well, I  think what's coupled here 

12  is  that  it  has  to be  knowing. 

There  has  to be  a 

13  knowingness and a  voluntariness.  And in  that situation, 

14  if the -- if the defendant  knew that he was  possibly -­

15  that the sentence that he bargained for was -­

16

 QUESTION:  No.  The -- he knew nothing.  The 

17  defendant knew nothing.  It was a  major error.  He  just 

18  got what he asked for. 

19

 MS. MOSSMAN:  We believe that is consistent.  He 

20  -- he got what he -- if the sentence is less than he -- or 

21  got  the  sentence that  he  bargained for,  where  is the 

22  error?

 QUESTION:  So --

 MS. MOSSMAN:  -- in and of themselves. 

 QUESTION:  But  just a moment ago,  you said not 

8  every  rule  11  violation  is  necessarily not  minor  or 

9  technical.  You say it's -- you -- I thought you intimated 

10  some of the could be. 

11

 MS. MOSSMAN:  It's  part of  the  analysis.  I 

12  think you have to complete the analysis. 

13

 QUESTION:  Well, but  I'm trying to  get you to 

14  answer  a rather  specific question.  How  do you  define 

15  minor or technical? 

16

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Well, I think that was brought out 

17  in  actually  the  advisory  committee  notes. 

So,  for 

18  instance, if  the -- if the  judge failed  to advise  the 

19  defendant that  if he lies on the stand, he'd be subjected 

20  to perjury charges.  That's  considered not a minor or 

--

21  that's  considered  basically  a  minor  or  technical 

22  advisement.

 Also, if there  was -- the judge  failed to cite 

24  to  an  element  of  the  offense,  but  the  defendant

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

 MS. MOSSMAN:  They were  just giving -- it was

12

 QUESTION:  Examples. 

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  In  -- in assessing how  weighty this 

13  particular lapse is,  should we take into account  that as 

14  far  as  I know,  this  defendant has  never  said in  the 

15  district court or  on appeal that he indeed wants to go to 

16  trial. 

17

 MS. MOSSMAN:  It's our  position that I wouldn't 

18  be here if he didn't want his plea vacated. 

19

But he

20  vacated is one thing.

 QUESTION:  Because  then you have -- given that 

23  he has three priors, his  sentence -- he was sentenced  at 

24  the mandatory minimum.  How much better could he  do on a

3

 MS.  MOSSMAN: 

Justice  Ginsburg,  it's  our 

4  position  that this particular  defendant at  every single 

5  proceeding, he  -- he expressed  his dissatisfaction  with 

6  his counsel,  and the  respondent's second  letter to  the 

7  court,  which is  at the  joint appendix,  number 96,  was 

8  exactly  -- could be  construed, because  it was a  pro se 

9  filing, as a motion to withdraw.  He asked for new counsel 

10  to look at his case anew. 

11

 QUESTION:  But  that's not the question  I asked 

12  you.  I  asked did he  ever say at  any stage, judge,  I'd 

13  like to have a trial.  I want to plead not guilty. 

14

 MS.  MOSSMAN: 

Justice  Ginsburg,  after  the 

15  conference on  the substitution  of hearing,  a sentencing 

16  date was -- was set, and this particular defendant did not 

17  object to the -- to a trial date -- excuse  me -- a trial 

18  date  was  set,  and  this  particular defendant  did  not 

19  object.  His attorney made some comments  about maybe it's 

20  not necessary. 

21

 QUESTION:  It's not  -- one thing not  to object 

22  to a setting of  a trial date, but did this man ever say I 

23  want to exercise my right to trial by jury? 

24

 MS. MOSSMAN:  His first statement to  the court 

25  at that  substitution of -- of  counsel hearing was  at no

2  conclusive.  He needed more -­

3

 QUESTION:  I thought he  was stronger than that. 

4  I thought -- thought he had said at one point I don't want 

5  to go to trial. 

6

 MS. MOSSMAN:  He never said that specifically or 

7  definitively.  He said at no time have I decided not -­

8

 QUESTION:  But in any  case, if he -- if -- but 

9  his concern is that his substantial rights or -- have been 

10  violated.  And  the possible  effect  on the  outcome  is 

11  relevant.  And my  question is  how could the  outcome be 

12  affected if  he got  the mandatory  minimum?  He got  the 

13  lowest  sentence that the law allowed the judge to impose. 

14  So unless he wants to go to trial, he isn't harmed by what 

15  happened.  And so I'm asking if there's any stage where he 

16  said, I want to go to trial. 

17

 MS.  MOSSMAN:  This  particular defendant  made 

18  requests  of his  attorney that  were not  brought  to the 

19  court's  attention. 

He  acted pro  se  in

in three 

20  instances.  We -- the record is actually void  to know if 

21  he -- and  he was actually silenced when he  wanted to ask 

22  this -- the judge questions at his change of plea hearing.

 MS.  MOSSMAN:  Basically  his own confession and

 QUESTION: 

And  risk  getting  more  than  the 

11  mandatory minimum? 

12

 MS.  MOSSMAN: 

In  our  opening  brief,  we 

13  completely briefed out the defense of entrapment, and this 

14  is  brought  out  through  the -- the  language  of  this 

15  defendant through the three letters that were submitted to 

16  the court through his own pro se actions.  We believe that 

17  he had a possible  defense of entrapment.  I was not  his 

18  trial attorney.  So -­

19

 QUESTION:  But you  -- you  have looked  at the 

20  cases on entrapment. 

21

22

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  And if you've got  a predisposition, 

23  you don't have much of a prayer on a entrapment claim. 

24

 QUESTION:  And  he had three  priors.  Were -­

25  were  the  three priors  of  the  same

 MS. MOSSMAN:  No, they were  not.  No,  they -­

3  they were not, Justice Scalia. 

4

 QUESTION:  If -- if  you were to prevail and  he 

5  were to have a trial and be convicted, could he get a more 

6  lengthy  sentence  or  would  that  raise  problems  of 

7  vindictive  prosecution? 

Would  failure  to  accept 

8  responsibility be a ground for an increase? 

9

 MS. MOSSMAN:  I don't think that would be fair. 

10  He has a fundamental right to go to trial. 

11

12

13

 QUESTION:  That's not --

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Also, the -­

 QUESTION:  My question is can  he get -- if he 

14  gets a new trial, can he get an increased sentence? 

15

 MS.  MOSSMAN: 

It's  possible,  but 

--  

it's 

16  possible, Your -- Justice Kennedy. 

17

 QUESTION:  There's 

--  

there's  no  vindictive 

18  prosecution problem? 

19

 MS. MOSSMAN:  There possibly  is.  I mean, I 

--

20  he would not get the  acceptance of responsibility points, 

21  but that -- but the  acceptance of responsibility  points 

22  doesn't make  the -- the bottom  line here because  of the 

23  mandatory minimum.  So he still would be looking at a 10­

24  year mandatory  minimum, even  if  he went  to trial,  and 

25  often  defendants  that  go  to  trial  on  these  drug 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

36 

Alderson Reporting Company

1  convictions do get the  mandatory minimum, irregardless if 

2  they  have gone to  trial or  -- and even  irregardless if 

3  they don't get the acceptance of responsibility points. 

4

 QUESTION:  Let  me 

--  

let  me  ask  you  this 

5  question.  You argue for a subjective test in a context in 

6  which the defendant can't take  the stand to say what  his 

7  understanding was.  That doesn't make  a lot of  sense to 

8  me. 

9

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Well,  defendants plead guilty for 

10  all types of reasons.  We don't know what's in the mind of 

11  defendants. 

12

 QUESTION:  No, no.  But you're saying  that you 

13  want a  subjective test.  You  want -- you want  to defend 

14  the Ninth  Circuit which said  the question is  whether or 

15  not he knew  that he had this specific burden, that he was 

16  waiving the specific right the minute he entered the plea. 

17  And you want a  -- a test to say that  he didn't, in fact, 

18  know that.  And yet, we can't put him on the stand.  That 

19  -- that seems to me an odd test. 

20

21

22  system. 

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Well -­

 QUESTION:  An  odd -- an odd  way  to run  the 

23

 MS. MOSSMAN:  I think it's important  to see if 

24  the -- this implicates the constitutional principles under 

25  the  Due  Process Clause.

2  of built into the rule 11 -­

3

 QUESTION:  But  the Ninth Circuit didn't  follow 

4 

--  

didn't  find  that  his  plea  was  involuntary  in  a 

5  constitutional sense. 

6

 MS.  MOSSMAN:  Excuse  me,  Chief -- Mr. Chief 

7  Justice.  They did  under the fourth prong of Olano.  They 

8 

--  

the  actual  citation  would  have  been  he  did  not 

9  understand  the -- the consequences  of his plea, which is 

10  therefore not voluntary. 

11

 QUESTION: 

Did 

--  

did  they  say  it  was  a 

12  constitutionally invalid plea? 

13

14

 MS. MOSSMAN:  They cited to Graibe. 

 QUESTION: 

Ms.  Mossman,  you've  been  asked 

15  questions by several  different members  of the Court  and 

16  you don't  seem to really respond  to the questions.  I'm 

17  asking you a very specific question now. 

18

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  They cited  to 

19  Graibe with cites to the Constitution. 

20

 QUESTION:  I'm  rather confused because  are -­

21  where -- there -- there  are two kinds of questions  we've 

22  been  discussing.  One is whether  in fact, if he had been 

23  told specifically,  what he  was supposed  to be  told, he 

24  would  then  have  withdrawn  his  guilty  plea. 

That's 

25  question one.  And most  of what we've been talking  about 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

38 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  is that. 

2

 But  I  thought  we're actually  here  to  ask a 

3  different question and the different question is I thought 

4  the Ninth Circuit -- and I did think that from reading its 

5  opinion 

--  

said  what  we've  just been  discussing  has 

6  nothing to do with the matter. 

7

8

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  All that -- all  that the person has 

9  to  show is that  he didn't  understand his rights.  Now, 

10  what do you think about that question? 

11

12

 MS. MOSSMAN:  I think, Justice Breyer -­

 QUESTION:  So let's assume  -- it's  absolutely 

13  clear.  They can come in  with 52 bishops who are prepared 

14  to swear that  if he had understood  everything perfectly, 

15  he nonetheless would have gone ahead and pled guilty.  But 

16  it's also clear he did not understand his rights.  Okay? 

17

18

19

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  What's supposed to happen? 

 MS. MOSSMAN:  If he -- is he  alleging a rule 11 

20  violation? 

21

 QUESTION:  Oh, there -- look, what happened was 

22  the judge  never told him that you're stuck with your plea 

23  if I  don't give you what  you think you're  going to get. 

24  He never told  him that.  It's  clear in rule  11 he  was 

25  supposed to.  And now, in addition, we know for  sure that 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

39 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  this person  didn't understand that.  But we also know for 

2  sure it  made  not one  whit of  difference  to his  plea. 

3  What's supposed to happen? 

4

 MS.  MOSSMAN: 

Justice Breyer,  this  is  -- I 

5  believe  you're  talking  about  a  motivated  pleader,  a 

6  pleader that was --

7

 QUESTION:  I'm talking  what I  think is  about 

8  this case. 

9

10

 MS. MOSSMAN:  This case. 

 QUESTION:  Yes.  I think as  it's presented in 

11  the  questions  presented  and  in  the opinion  that  was 

12  written by the Ninth Circuit.  Now, I might be  wrong and 

13  you  could explain to me  why I'm not.  But -- but in any 

14  case,  if  you  think  that  might  be  this  case  that's 

15  presented here,  I -- in the Ninth Circuit opinion, I'd -­

16  I'd like an answer or your best answer. 

17

 MS. MOSSMAN:  I -- Justice, if I can answer your 

18  question, it's  the -- a defendant  that's caught in  the 

19  justice -- a  criminal justice  labyrinth  and he 

--  

he 

20  doesn't understand,  he doesn't  understand the  language, 

21  he's not  confident in his counsel, and he believes he can 

22  withdraw his plea.  Is that correct? 

23

 QUESTION:  Yes.  But  in fact, we know he  never 

24  would have.  We know it for sure.

 MS. MOSSMAN:  But he -- he should -­

 QUESTION:  He's written  secret letters  to his 

2  relations --

3

4

 (Laughter.) 

 QUESTION:  -- and whatever.  Do it in any  sort 

5  you want, but -- but I mean, that's -- that's a little bit 

6  of a technical matter  here.  But  I did think in  reading 

7  the  Ninth Circuit  opinion and  reading  the Government's 

8  brief, that that's what they're  worried about, that there 

9  could be  cases where he does not understand the nature of 

10  that rule 11 right, but nonetheless it makes no difference 

11  to his decision to plead guilty. 

12

 So that -- that's a  bit of  a technical  point 

13  here,  I agree. 

But  as I  read  the  Ninth Circuit,  I 

14  thought, well,  that's what's going on in this case.  Now, 

15  you could  explain to me, if you want, that I'm completely 

16  out to lunch, so to speak. 

17

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Well, Justice  Breyer, if he  was 

18  motivated to  plead guilty and there  was an error  in the 

19  rule 11 colloquy and he had the opportunity to replead, he 

20  could replead  to another type of plea agreement, a C plea 

21  agreement.  He  could ask for different  provisions within 

22  that -- that plea agreement, for instance, less supervised 

23  release.  He could ask for a type C plea agreement. 

24

 QUESTION:  Why -- why  would they  give him  a 

25  better deal the second time  around?  I mean, they'd  say, 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

41 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  you know,  okay, we forgot to  tell you that  you couldn't 

2  withdraw it.  We now tell you you can't withdraw it.  And 

3  we offer you the same deal we  offered you last time.  Why 

4  -- why would he get a better deal? 

5

 MS.  MOSSMAN: 

Well,  he  would

if  he's 

6  motivated to plea -­

7

 QUESTION:  In fact, they  might -- they might be 

8  mad at him for having backed  out and -- and not give  him 

9  as good a deal.  But I can't imagine that he'd -- he'd get 

10  a better deal the second time around. 

11

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Justice Scalia, I believe he would 

12  have  an  opportunity  to  renegotiate  or  he  could  be 

13  repleading to the -- and have confidence in the process. 

14

 QUESTION:  What leverage  does he  have?  What 

15  leverage  does he  have when he's  faced with  a mandatory 

16  minimum that  he can't  escape from  and that's  what he's 

17  got? 

I -- I  can't 

--  

could you  describe  for  this 

18  defendant what that better deal would be? 

19

 MS.  MOSSMAN: 

Justice Ginsburg,  it  possibly 

20  could be  less time on supervised release, less time -- or 

21  -- or actually a type C plea agreement instead of the type 

22  plea agreement.  You're correct in saying they  might not 

23  offer him that type, but 95 percent of criminal -- Federal 

24  criminal  convictions go  by  way  of  guilty pleas. 

So 

25  they're going to offer him something.

 QUESTION:  But how could -- could he escape from 

2  the mandatory  minimum in  any way  other  than what  they

 MS. MOSSMAN:  The mandatory minimum just becomes 

5  the bottom line then. 

6

 QUESTION:  And  that's what  he got, and  that's 

7  why I can't understand any better deal that this defendant 

8  might have received.

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Well, Justice Ginsburg,  he could

 QUESTION:  You'd do  it all over again  with the 

13  same bottom line, but he's  going to feel better about  it 

14  the second time? 

15

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Possibly, yes.  I mean, maybe that 

16  means something to this motivated pleader. 

17

 QUESTION:  Well, I'd like to ask you  a question 

18  that I asked Mr. Himmelfarb and that it seemed puzzling to 

19  me that the safety valve which everyone  hoped would allow 

20  a sentence below  the mandatory  minimum could never  work 

21  from day one because he had two additional prior offenses. 

22  Now, if anyone knew about those priors, which were under a 

23  different  name,  which  is  why  they  weren't  found 

24  immediately, certainly the defendant knew.

9  been in my case. 

10

 From the beginning,  I never  had any  knowledge 

11  about the points  of responsibility, the safety  valve, or 

12  anything like that.  I  honestly, from  the beginning,  I 

13  accepted through my -- responsibility through my attorney, 

14  but he never paid any attention to me, what I had told him 

15  about  the  problem that  I  had.  I  told  him from  the 

16  beginning that I had a  problem, that I was attending  the

15  history.  Is that what you're saying?

17  when he went -- when he came  to see me, I explained it to

 The Defendant:  Yes. 

 So he -­

 QUESTION:  And the  trial judge  told him,  you 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

46 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  know, if you don't qualify, I might give you 10 years.  Do 

2  you understand that?  And he says, yes. 

3

4

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Yes. 

 QUESTION: 

And  he says,  knowing  you  have a 

5  mandatory minimum, I  have to give you  10 years.  Do  you 

6  still want to go forward with your plea?  He says, yes. 

7

8

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Yes, correct, but this -­

 QUESTION:  So it's pretty hard to argue  that -­

9  I mean -- go ahead. 

10

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Justice Breyer, but this defendant 

11  -- it's not clear that he  did not know that he could  not 

12  withdraw his  plea.  He was under the impression, which is 

13  common sense  impression, that he -- if -- if  he doesn't 

14  get the sentence  that he -- that he asked for,  he could 

15  withdraw his plea. 

16

 QUESTION:  Well, how -- how could he  have had 

17  that  when the  thing  in the  plea  agreement itself  was 

18  explained to him in Spanish saying that he couldn't? 

19

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, our  contention 

20  is  that the -- the fact that the plea agreement wasn't in 

21  Spanish is fatal here because  his attorney couldn't speak 

22  Spanish. 

23

 QUESTION:  Well, but  there was  an interpreter 

24  there. 

25

 MS. MOSSMAN:  But his  -- his attorney didn't -­

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

47 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  if his attorney  couldn't speak  Spanish, he doesn't  know 

2  exactly what the interpreter is saying. 

3

 QUESTION:  Well, the  interpreter can presumably 

4  speak English. 

5

 MS.  MOSSMAN: 

The 

--  

well,  there  was  a 

6  contention here between  the defendant and his  counsel in 

7  numerous instances before the court.  He expressed to the 

8  court that he  couldn't communicate with his  attorney and 

9  the prosecution knew about this.  They also characterized 

10  the case  as -- under paralysis,  and yet they  still gave 

11  this defendant -­

12

 QUESTION:  This is new to me.  I -- I didn't see 

13  any -- any indication in your briefs or in the record that 

14  he claims he was never told by the interpreter.  I thought 

15  it  was  -- I  thought  it  was  common  ground  that  the 

16  interpreter  had  correctly  explained  the  written  plea 

17  agreement to him.  You're now saying that he contends that 

18  he was deceived as to the meaning of the plea agreement? 

19

 MS.  MOSSMAN:  No,  Justice Scalia,  we're  not 

20  contending that,  but we agree with the Ninth Circuit that 

21  the plea agreement in and of itself  in -- in this case is 

22  not conclusive of understanding. 

23

 QUESTION:  Because?  Because?  Because the plea 

24  agreement was read to him in Spanish.  Is that right? 

25

 MS. MOSSMAN:  That's part of it, Justice Breyer, 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

48 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  yes. 

2

3

4

 QUESTION:  That is right. 

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Yes, but also -­

 QUESTION:  All right.  The plea -- so he  hears 

5  in  Spanish someone  read  to him  the  words, you  cannot 

6  withdraw your plea  agreement -- cannot withdraw if  they 

7  don't accept it.  And that's conceded in  this case.  Is 

8  that right? 

9

10

11

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Yes, it -- this was -­

 QUESTION:  Okay. 

 Then  afterwards  the  judge  tells  him,  in 

12  addition, if -- has anyone explained to you that -- do you 

13  understand that  if you -- that  if you don't  qualify for 

14  the safety valve, you go for 10 years.  Yes. 

15

 Has anyone promised you you will qualify for the 

16  safety valve?  No. 

17

18

 So you realize you could get 10 years.  Yes. 

 All  right?  Knowing that,  you still want to go 

19  ahead with your guilty plea?  Yes. 

20

 MS.  MOSSMAN: 

Our 

--  

Justice  Breyer,  our 

21  position is consistent with the Ninth  Circuit that he was 

22  under an  expectation,  a  highly 

--  

a  highly 

--  

high 

23  expectation that he  would -- would get  the safety valve, 

24  and like  the Ninth Circuit said,  he had no  incentive to 

25  read  or  double  check  the  provisions within  the  plea 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

49 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  agreement himself.  And this -- this -­

2

 QUESTION:  I thought  one -- one of your  points 

3  was  that this was  a rather  long agreement and  this was 

4  paragraph 19. 

5

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Yes, Justice  Ginsburg, that  was 

6  going to be  my next point.  This  provision was buried in 

7  the  plea  agreement  and one  doesn't  know,  because his 

8  counsel couldn't  -- doesn't speak Spanish.  If he  -- if 

9  the  -- if  the interpreter  inadvertently misstated  that 

10  provision -­

11

 QUESTION:  I -- I didn't  know  that you  were 

12  claiming that this hadn't been an accurate translation. 

13

14

 MS. MOSSMAN:  We -­

 QUESTION:  I thought your -- your point was that 

15  it was a  lot to absorb without  having a written  copy to 

16  follow. 

17

 MS. MOSSMAN:  In our -- Justice Ginsburg, in our 

18  opposition  to the petition for  writ of certiorari, we -­

19  we  claimed  that that  point,  that -- that  we have  no 

20  certainty  because  there  was  not  a transcript  of  the 

21  Spanish interpretation. 

22

 QUESTION:  Did  you claim that before  the Ninth 

23  Circuit? 

24

25

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 QUESTION: 

Did the  Ninth  -- did  the opinion 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

50 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  reflect that at all in the Ninth Circuit? 

2

3

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  That -- that  you said that it was  a 

4  not a correct translation? 

5

6

7

8

9

 MS. MOSSMAN:  They -- yes -­

 QUESTION:  Did it or did it not? 

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  Whereabouts? 

 MS.  MOSSMAN:  I can read -- excuse me, if I may 

10  correct myself, Mr. Chief Justice. 

11

12

 QUESTION:  Yes, please do. 

 MS. MOSSMAN:  They didn't say that it was not a 

13  correct  translation,  but  they  did  hold  it  as  not 

14  conclusive.  And they state  that in their  decision when 

15  they say that Mr. --

16

 QUESTION:  Well, finish.  Go ahead.  Finish the 

17  rest of your argument. 

18

19

20

21

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Just move on? 

 QUESTION:  Yes, please. 

 MS. MOSSMAN:  Okay. 

 I'd  just like  to  say  that  the  Government's 

22  burden is -- the Government's  test, the prejudice  test, 

23  the but-for test, is asking  this defendant to go back  in 

24  time  and to prove  a counter-factual.  It's not  in this 

25  record, that if not for the error, he would not  have pled 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

51 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1  guilty.  That's a very heavy burden here.  And we believe 

2  it  emasculates  the  knowing  requirements  and  makes 

3  awareness of the consequences of the plea irrelevant.  And 

4  the -- a defendant, if he does not understand the scope of 

5  the prosecution's  promise, he cannot  evaluate the  risks 

6  inherent in the type of plea agreement that he's  signing. 

7  We think that's  critical.  The Ninth  Circuit agreed that 

8 

--  

that the rule  11(e)(2) warning  and the type  of plea 

9  agreement that  this particular defendant entered  into is 

10  highly critical  and affords a high degree of risk to this 

11  defendant  because  it  couldn't  withdraw. 

And  it's 

12  counterintuitive  to  enter  into  an  agreement  when you 

13  understand that one  party could  withdraw, to think  that 

14  you can't. 

15

 That's why the  Congress has asked -- has asked 

16  that  this  warning  be  expressly made  in  the  rule  11 

17  colloquy, that if we -- if I -- I -- I'm not bound by the 

18  recommendation.  The judge has  said I'm not bound by  the 

19  recommendations, but you cannot withdraw if I  do not give 

20  you the sentence that  you bargained for because that's  a 

21  counterintuitive understanding.  I  believe Justice Scalia 

22  was getting at this when he talked to Mr. Himmelfarb. 

23

 And in closing, I'd just  like to say this Court 

24  should adhere  to the Olano prejudice test  and reject the 

25  Government's  invitation  to  adopt  a  but-for,  highly 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

52 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005

2  line ruling  test.  And this Court should affirm the Ninth 

3  Circuit's result, but if they do not -­

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Ms. Mossman. 

 Mr. Himmelfarb, you have 5 minutes remaining. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR.  HIMMELFARB: 

Unless  there  are  further 

9  questions, we'll waive rebuttal. 

10

 QUESTION:  Well,  I do have a question.  I -- I 

11  think that  her strongest point there  is that he  said in 

12  the later sentencing hearing that he told his lawyer about 

13  the priors.  Now, if that's  true, the lawyer  would have 

14  known immediately he couldn't qualify for the safety valve 

15  and  would have told  him this  whole agreement is  a joke 

16  because  the judge  doesn't  have the  power  to give  you 

17  anything less than 10 years. 

18

 So if -- if that's true, she must have some kind 

19  of a claim. 

20

 MR.  HIMMELFARB:  He  may  have an  ineffective 

21  assistance of counsel claim -­

 QUESTION:  An ineffective assistance claim. 

 MR.  HIMMELFARB:  -- Justice  Breyer, which  he 

24  would  be -- which  he  would have  to  raise  in a  2255 

25  proceeding.  But the plain  error rule should not be  used
