CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next this morning in Case 16-309, Maslenjak v. United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States. 

            

Mr. Landau. 

 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU 

 

 

 

 

               

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Section 1425(a) of the Federal Criminal Code 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorizes the government to strip a naturalized 

   

 

 

 

 

American of citizenship if it was procured contrary to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  Our position in this case is simple.  The words 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"procured contrary to law" require a causal link between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the procurement of citizenship and the underlying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of law.  At the government's urging, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court read such a causal link out of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, instructing the jury that it could convict if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner obtained United States citizenship and 

 

 

 

 

 

violated at least one law governing naturalization.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

instructions didn't require the government to prove that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the underlying violation of law had any effect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatsoever on the naturalization decision.  To the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

contrary --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even -- even assuming I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

bought your argument, that's a very broad statement, any 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect.  How about a natural tendency to effect? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, your Honor --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because you can never 

  

 

 

 

 

predict what will actually happen in the end.  You can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only talk about what might happen. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  And we would be happy -- what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we asked for was a materiality standard, which I think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

is very much along the lines, as Your Honor, just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggested.  What -- what's amazing here, and I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

what makes this case so extreme, we're really at one end 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the spectrum.  The district court specifically 

  

 

 

 

 

 

instructed the jury, and here I quote, "Even if you find 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that a false statement did not influence the decision to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approve the defendant's naturalization, the government 

 

 

 

 

 

need only prove that one of the defendant's statements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was false." 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but -- but what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Sotomayor said, in essence, means sometimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we -- causality is known only after the fact.  You can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a statement that everyone thinks is immaterial, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

it's subjectively immaterial, but it might have a causal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

connection at the end of the day. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, the government, if it

wants to strip an American of citizenship, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

about the most grave thing it can do, probably short of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking away someone's --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I fully -- I fully 

    

   

 

 

understand that. 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the idea of what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

material and what's immaterial, and -- and what's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causal link and what is not in a sense can be understood 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and analyzed only after the fact. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, I think, Your Honor, the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

government has the burden -- if it wants to show that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Petitioner or the defendant procured citizenship 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary to law, the government has to show, at the very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

least, that, based on a false statement, that the false 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement was material. 

 

 

            

            

Our basic submission --

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you explain why this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't be harmless area?  You're arguing about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

material or not, but why isn't this obviously material? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

She lied about her husband's -- what he was doing in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bosnia, right?  She said he -- he was trying to avoid 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

military conscription when, in fact, he was in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service and in -- in the unit that was committing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

atrocities.

immaterial? 

            

Under what circumstances would that be 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor, we would like a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

chance to argue the materiality question to a jury, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is the general decider of what is material under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court's decision in Gaudin.  We -- we did not have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the chance, given prevailing Sixth Circuit law, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said there was no materiality to contest this issue at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial.  And we very much --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  I -- I understand that. 

    

   

 

 

What -- they were given refugee status based on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well-founded fear of persecution where and for what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason? 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, this is the crux of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute, Your Honor.  The government's position was that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was based on the fear of persecution by the Serbs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on her husband's evasion of military service. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Where?  In -- in Bosnia? 

  

  

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  In Bosnia, yes. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  This is -- yes. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  Yes.  And so this is now --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're out of Bosnia.  They're at the American Embassy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Belgrade seeking refugee status. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Right. 

  

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  And this was, in a sense, the

heart of the dispute at trial.  And, in fact -- this, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, relates also to Justice Ginsburg's question --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

the jury sent a note, but what was the refugee status 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on?  We're a little bit confused because we see 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here a document that says that it was apparently based 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on ethnic persecution by the Muslims in Bosnia.  So I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think this is really the heart of the factual dispute on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what was the refugee status based on.  Was it based 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on --

 

            

based on? 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  We don't know which it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  No.  That's the -- that was the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hottest -- that was the -- that -- that's the key issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we would like to have an opportunity for our day in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if -- I mean, if --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

this isn't the issue that we -- that we took cert to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide, but it does raise the question whether there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really anything at stake here.  I assume that every Serb 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Bosnia-Herzegovina is not entitled to asylum in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States. 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So merely being a Serb there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

where I think they're about 30 percent of the population 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not be --

MR. LANDAU:  That is correct.  No.  And in 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

8 

this case is -- if you read the -- the naturalization --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's read the refugee application, which is at Pet. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

App. 62a to 64a, you can see that -- that they were --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the concern was their house was -- they -- they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got death threats.  Their house, I think stones were 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

thrown at the window. 

 

 

 

              

I mean, this was not just any particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

area.  This was a majority Muslim area within Bosnia. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

It was a -- Bosnia was a patchwork of ethnicities at 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this point.  And they were in a majority Muslim area, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and they had to flee Bosnia. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think this is really the crux of their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument, that this is not -- that the -- the whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue about her husband's military service was really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not the basis for it.  And this is what we would like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the chance to argue this before a properly-instructed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

jury.  We may win or we may lose on that.  I mean, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the issue that we would like the opportunity for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our day in court on that issue, materiality, which is --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you explain to me how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the good moral character works into this, because even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it's immaterial, it is a lie.  And there was more 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than one lie in this application. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  The -- the good moral character

provision, Your Honor, which is 1101(f)(6), 8 U.S.C 

   

 

 

 

 

 

9 

1106(f)(6), is our friend in this case, because you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely right.  We have conceded that she told a lie. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

But 1101(f)(6) does not make every lie preclusive of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good moral character.  It only makes a particular kind 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of lie preclusive. 

 

 

            

There's a list of things that preclude good 

   

 

 

 

 

 

moral character, and among them is a lie for the purpose 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of obtaining an immigration benefit.  That was one of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the things that the government had to prove at trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And they charged her with that.  And if, in fact, she 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were convicted of that, that would preclude -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would disqualify her from naturalization, because you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot establish good moral character categorically if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have told that lie for that purpose.  But I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that underscores, Your Honor, that Congress did not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intend to make every lie on the form per se 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disqualifying. 

            

To be sure, they may be relevant to good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moral character.  But where Congress wanted to make a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular kind of lie preclusive of good moral 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

character in 1101(f)(6), it did so specifically.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and so the applicant has the burden under Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1427(a)(3) of proving good moral character. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And so, again, I think that section is our 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

10 

friend here because it shows the anomaly of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's position that basically any lie 

 

 

 

 

 

automatically makes you liable under Section 1015.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 1015, under their view of -- of Section 1425 as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a pure look-through statute to 1015, sucks up any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of 1015(a), which, again, has no materiality 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there for them, has no materiality in 1425(a), and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, that's -- that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

anomaly I'm stuck with, and maybe you can help me with, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Landau, is that 1425 doesn't contain an express 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

materiality provision.  1451 does, in one provision, one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clause, but not another. 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  And then some of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

predicate acts for 1425 do and others don't. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So it seems like, 

  

 

 

 

 

linguistically, we have to do some somersaults to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where you want to go, because no one would say that to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violate 1425, you have to prove, say, a material 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

genocide, right? 

 

            

Your Honor. 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  I couldn't agree with you more, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Okay.  So we have to -- it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be material -- not only would we have to add the

word "material" to 1425 that isn't there, we'd have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

limit its impact to some predicate offenses and not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

others. 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor, I --

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Statement-based ones, I 

  

 

 

 

think your position is.  That's a lot of linguistic 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

somersaults to add to a -- a statute, isn't it? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  I -- I don't think so at all, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor.  I think -- I think you have to look --

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again, I think the contrast with civil denaturalization 

   

 

 

 

 

 

provision, 8 U.S.C 1451(a) is a very powerful point in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

our favor. 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  How is that?  Because it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

says illegally procure, and then it talks about material 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misrepresentations in two separate clauses. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Correct.  And if -- if Your 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor wanted to take a -- the most natural kind of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

textual reading, you would say, okay, here in 1425, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only have the general one, procured contrary to law.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the most natural, pure, textual approach would be to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, well, then, that shouldn't cover statement offenses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all, because statement offenses were broken out and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would render the statement offenses in 1451(a) it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

referenced --

interpreted the language "procure," and doing it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

illegally, is anything in the course of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeding --

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  -- right?  So that's the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

answer to that, isn't it? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  No.  No.  But I think -- I 

   

  

  

  

 

 

 

think the point is, Your Honor, we -- nobody is fighting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that Section 1425(a) is broader than statements. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But I think what you can't do is --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, then -- then, that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

concession right there answers my problem, doesn't it? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  I mean, it's -- I -- I might 

    

   

   

 

 

 

have misspoken if I said -- 1425(a) includes -- it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

includes bribery, it includes things to which the word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"material" wouldn't naturally apply, which I think 

   

 

 

 

 

answers your question right there, in the sense that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have been nonsensical for Congress to put in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general illegally-procured statute the word "material." 

 

 

 

 

 

It just wouldn't fit there because it's a general one. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Where they use the word "material" in 1451, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's because historically, 1451 has had illegally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procured, the kind of the catch-all, and a separate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement one.  But what you can't do is say 1425 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies -- is a general catch-all, but when it's applied

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

to statements, they're not material.  I mean --

    

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Landau --

  

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  -- it just doesn't make sense. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- hasn't the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

briefing in this case really clarified what the issue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is?  And in a way, it seemed to me that what was being 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debated in the district court was the wrong issue about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether to charge the jury on materiality, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

materiality is not in this statute.  But as you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refined the argument, the issue is the meaning of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term "procure" --

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  That's absolutely --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- which may or may not mean 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly the same thing as "materiality." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  I think you are absolutely 

    

 

 

 

 

correct, Your Honor.  And that's one of the things -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, it's the same issue we've been arguing all along. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think you've put the point exactly right.  I think we 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a textual basis for what had been a line of circuit 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court decisions going our way, starting in Puerta, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went our way based on policy concerns, which are very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

powerful, but really didn't grapple with the text of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  And I think --

   

  

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Within your brief, you, I --

   

  

 

 

 

 

I think, have possibly tried to read more into "procure"

than you can, because in a number of spots you seem --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you argued that it means "but for causation."  Now, this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

morning you have said that's not your argument.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

not -- you don't have to prove that, but for the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

false statement in the immigration proceeding, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person would not have been naturalized. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor, our position in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this case was always relying on the line of circuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent going our way was that it was materiality.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think if you didn't -- I mean, if we hadn't -- but for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way this case evolved where it was really based on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

materiality, I think there is a good argument that the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

most natural reading of procure contrary to law, goes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to the general causation principles in our law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which as this Court underscored just last week in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Goodyear, is but-for causation. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I -- I don't know 

   

   

  

 

 

whether you can get that out of "procured."  Let me give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you this example.  Let's say there is a -- a municipal 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

ordinance that says that it is illegal to buy or sell a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scalp's ticket within 200 feet of the entrance of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stadium or a concert hall, and I buy -- knowingly buy a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scalped ticket within 199 feet of the entrance of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

facility. 

            

Now, in order for me to have procured that

ticket contrary to law, would it be necessary to prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that I couldn't have purchased this from another scalper 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

around the other side who was outside of the 200 feet, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or I couldn't have gotten a ticket if I had waited in 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

line at the box office? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor, I think your 

   

  

 

 

 

question points out some of the very difficult questions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of causation that -- that are really, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implicated by the word "procure," and -- and on which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court, frankly, fractured in Kungys.  And I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

those are difficult questions that really haven't been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefed before you.  I think our position here is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

really, at the very least, it has to be material.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can't establish a causal link in this context, where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statement doesn't even have the tendency. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If I could refer the Court to the definition 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of materiality that was actually used by the majority 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in -- in Kungys.  This is at -- 485 U.S., at 772.  A 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement with a natural tendency to produce the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion that the applicant was qualified for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah -- please, finish. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  I'm sorry, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

That -- I mean, my point really was there is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some starch in the -- the standard of materiality, and

it really goes to qualifications for citizenship.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

judge -- the -- my friends on the other side seem to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a pretty watered-down version of materiality. 

   

 

 

 

 

Well, that anything that might launch an investigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is per se --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask you, Mr. Landau --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Sure. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- about a -- a different 

   

   

  

 

 

interpretation of the statute.  Neither you nor the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government supports it, but it's raised briefly in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's -- in footnote 4 of the government's brief, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is this idea that what we really should be doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here is we should be interpreting 1425 in exactly the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same way that we interpret the civil statute, 1451, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which talks about illegally procuring something. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And that both are limited to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

failures to satisfy the prerequisites to naturalization. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that's really what we should be thinking about when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we interpret that. 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  I think that that -- you know, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think that makes a lot of sense, that -- that this is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really -- that's what it's about.  You're stripping 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody of their citizenship.  So you kind of think the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

natural question is, were they qualified for the

citizenship in the first place.  I found footnote 4 --

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And that would, in this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case, presumably, be because of bad character; is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, I mean, no, the -- well, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the government, I think, thinks a lot more than that.  I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean, they did not -- they tried to prove, but again, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a general verdict, so we don't know whether they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proved, that her lie was for the subjective purpose of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtaining an immigration benefit.  That's one way they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could try to prove -- that if they did prove that, we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would agree she would not be qualified.  That -- there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no question that there's a causal link there if you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could say the person wouldn't have been qualified.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not sure this helps 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you under our case law under Ginsberg and Ness, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

line of cases --

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that the government 

  

 

 

 

 

relies on.  If it's a prerequisite to getting 

   

  

 

 

 

 

citizenship, one of the -- their argument is that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prerequisite is not telling a falsehood, an intentional 

   

 

 

 

 

 

falsehood in your application. 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  But so --

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do you win, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

how do you get causation into that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  But that is -- that is what I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

was trying to get at before with 1101(f)(6), which goes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the things that categorically preclude a finding of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

good moral character, does not say any falsehood in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

application process is enough to disqualify you.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, any falsehood for the purpose of obtaining a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

natural -- an immigration benefit. 

 

 

 

 

            

If they prove that -- then I think this goes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to Justice Kagan's question -- they would prove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that we were disqualified.  And I think that line of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases is very consistent with footnote 4. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I hate to be --

    

 

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  I find --

    

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- inconcrete.  Suppose 

  

  

 

 

you're right and there is a materiality requirement that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

says you should have an opportunity to present that to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury.  On the facts that we have here, how could you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argue this is immaterial -- it is immaterial, these lies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were immaterial? 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, we would go back to -- we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would get a witness to talk about, you know, how her two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sisters got here, for instance, that -- that they were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

victims of ethnic persecution by the Muslims in Bosnia,

and that she would have gotten the refugee status 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

regardless of the -- the point about the husband's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

military service.  That that was not the crux.  That 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was -- this was, in a sense, the issue -- I think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury note on Pet. App. 90, really nicely points out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the jury in this very case asked the judge a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, what was her refugee status based on?  Was it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on fear of persecution by the Muslims, on ethnic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

persecution, or was it based on fear of persecution by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ethnic Serbs, based on his avoiding military 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service. 

            

We can see that that is a -- a fair question 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to debate, but we would like an opportunity to debate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in front of a jury that is properly instructed and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at least --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I don't know 

    

  

 

 

 

how you can do -- that answers only a part of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

materiality issue.  If she lied to get her husband a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit, that's an immigration benefit that she was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking. 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, but --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  She had to lie about his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

military service, otherwise, he would have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disqualified --

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, but they didn't do it.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- from naturalization. 

  

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  They allege -- and this is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

exactly right, Your Honor.  That was one of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

predicate offenses they alleged here, that one was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 1015(a), which we discussed in our brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The other one is that she didn't have good 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moral character, because she lied to obtain an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immigration benefit.  But we have a general verdict 

   

  

 

 

 

 

here.  We have no finding here that the jury actually 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

agreed with the government that, in fact, she lied to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtain an immigration benefit. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there any way they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

could have found otherwise? 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well, I -- I think --

   

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I understand there 

    

   

 

 

are case laws. 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  No.  I mean, we don't know 

    

  

 

 

 

 

why -- we don't know why she said that.  That's -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, one would have to speculate to say -- I mean, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people lie for many different reasons.  They lie because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are embarrassed about certain things or -- I mean, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think it would be speculative to say, basically, as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter of law, we can say there is only reason she could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have lied.  I -- you know, I don't think we're basically 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the practice of directing verdicts in criminal cases.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think this well --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

this well-instructed jury would be entitled to hear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence about Srebrenica and about her husband's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

military service? 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  I think, you know, that that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

raises some interesting questions.  And I --

MR. LANDAU:  Well, yeah.  And --

MR. LANDAU:  -- Your Honor, again, I am not

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, I -- I understand. 

   

   

  

 

MR. LANDAU:  -- that people are going to be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

throwing roses in our path on remand.  I do -- do not 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deny that this could be a very tough row to hoe on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remand.  What -- what I'm here to do is, basically, to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, as far as this case has gone along, the Sixth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Circuit so far has thrown roses in the government's path 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the lower courts, to allow them specifically to get a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal conviction to strip her of her citizenship 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without even proving that the statement is immaterial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There's nothing -- you can come up with a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chart that goes from 1015(a), which they say has no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

materiality, to 1425(a), which they say adds nothing, is

a pure look-through statute, and leads to the direct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequence of denaturalization.  So under their view, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

any lie leads -- can lead to automatic denaturalization. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress could have come up with that regime, but it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't, because I think Congress recognizes that not all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

lies are created equal.  They come in different shapes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and sizes.  And that's why when Congress wanted to make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one kind of lie particularly significant, it did so in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1101(f)(6) by saying it has to be a lie for the purpose 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of obtaining an immigration benefit.  If they prove that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lie, they are golden, then they actually -- then they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

win. 

            

The problem is, in this case, my client 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could have been convicted without that finding.  We just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't know that.  And so, again, I think part of the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem is here, the government's fundamental conception 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of 1425(a) is wrong.  They really do look at it, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically, as nothing more than a sentence enhancer for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the underlying convictions.  But it is its own distinct 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision of the criminal code, with its own distinct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute of limitations and its own very distinct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalties.  For instance, in 1015(a), the maximum 

  

 

 

 

 

 

imprisonment term is 5 years.  Under Section 1425(a), 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you can go to prison for up to 25 years, plus automatic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denaturalization, which flows as a result of 1451(e).

So 14 -- you know, the -- the -- the essence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

of that 14 -- that distinct 1425(a) crime is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unlawful procurement.  You're taking the unlawful 

  

 

 

 

 

predicate act and you're using it to procure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship. 

            

And so our basic position is if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government wants to strip you of citizenship, on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ground that you were not qualified for citizenship that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was procured contrary to law, it's very important for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them to show that you would have been qualified if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- would have been disqualified if the truth had been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

known. 

            

And going back to your point, Justice Kagan, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just to round out on footnote 4.  I found that footnote 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incomprehensible because the government basically starts 

 

 

 

 

 

out with talking about a standard we actually like, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is the disqualification standard for -- for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causation, essentially.  But then they go on to say, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well, that would have been met here.  I think the most 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they can say, is that could have been met here, and, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, they can't possibly prove that, as a matter of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law, that -- that this was the contested issue at trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So we're okay with the legal standard there, but the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inference they draw in the next sentence, I think they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

used the wrong verb tense.  That -- that -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

particular footnote, I think, if you focus on that, that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can answer the case in a sense. 

   

 

 

 

 

24 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But failing to meet the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

qualifications for naturalization sounds to me like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but-for causation. 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So is that your argument, or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is it something less than but-for? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, you can say it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

should be but-for but I -- I'll win if it's anything. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  What is your -- do you have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a firm position or --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. LANDAU:  We -- if we were starting this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on tabula rasa and we had not argued materiality below, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I would say that it's but-for.  I think that is the best 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation of the statutes. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's -- I mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

that's awfully hard, because then you have to go back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and determine, even if somebody says something that has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a real potential to affect the naturalization decision, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you still would have to go back and show that in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case it actually did make the difference.

crux of the debate in the plurality opinion in Kungys 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

between Justice Scalia and Justice Stevens.  And, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, that's a very interesting debate. 

   

 

 

 

            

But, actually, in the majority part of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kungys in part 2(a) the majority there, the Court, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speaking through Justice Scalia, defined materiality, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think in a way that is pretty darn close to but-for.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said -- it -- it's not quite there, but it said:  A 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

natural tendency to produce the conclusion that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicant was qualified for citizenship. 

 

 

 

 

            

So, again, I think the real crux here is not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just might this have led to an investigation.  It really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has to go to the qualifications for citizenship, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's what this whole thing is about.  We're trying to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure out, did we naturalize somebody who shouldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have been naturalized. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  Well, if that's the case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

how do we distinguish between 1425(a) and (b)?  (a) says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it has to be a procured contrary to law; (b) says, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, procured when it's not -- when you're not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitled to it.  It seems to me that (b) does the work 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're describing, that -- that the lie or the illegal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act has something to do with the underlying entitlement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as opposed to a lie or something illegal in the process 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of.

citizenship -- you know, that's an interesting point, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor.  The government has never really drawn any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinct between 1425(a) --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  You have to do something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

different; right?

please the Court: 

 

 

            

Naturalization is the highest privilege the

fundamentally changes the relationship between the

required that individuals who seek that high privilege 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must scrupulously comply with every rule governing the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization process. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But, scrupulously, 

  

 

 

 

I -- I looked at -- on the naturalization form, there is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a question.  It's Number 22.  "Have you ever" -- and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they've got "ever" in bold point --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- "committed, 

  

 

 

 

assisted in committing, or attempted to commit a crime 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

or offense for which you were not arrested?" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Some time ago, outside the statute of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations, I drove 60 miles an hour in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

55-mile-an-hour zone. 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

            

arrested. 

            

MR. PARKER:  I'm sorry to hear that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I was -- I was not 

    

   

 

 

 

 

Now, you say that if I answer that question 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

no, 20 years after I was naturalized as a citizen, you

American citizen after all. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Well --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that right? 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. PARKER:  If -- well, I would say two 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

things.  First, that is how the government would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret that, that it would require you to disclose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those sorts of offenses. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, come on.  You're 

  

  

 

 

 

 

saying that on this form, you expect everyone to list 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

every time in which they drove over the speed limit --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  No. 

  

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- except when they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

were arrested. 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Well, what I think the -- what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

I think that particular question demonstrates is -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I will readily acknowledge, number one, that is a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broad question, and, number two, and I think that there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a great deal of ambiguity in what exactly is meant by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"crime and offense."  And --

  

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but just --

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's worse.  If you look in Black's --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In Black's Law 

  

 

 

 

 

Dictionary, I looked up what's an offense?  And this is

what it says:  It says it's a violation of the law, a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

crime, often a minor one. 

   

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you really are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

looking for the listing of every time somebody drove 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over the speed limit. 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  But here's -- here's what I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think is important, though:  What you would have to show 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to denaturalize someone, at least under Section 1425, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be that, number one, they were aware that that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the question was asking for --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I knew  --

    

  

 

 

MR. PARKER:  -- they knew --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- I drove over 55. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR. PARKER:  Right.  You are aware that that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

happened.  You are aware that a truthful answer to that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question would require you to disclose that.  And yet, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notwithstanding the fact that you had taken an oath to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

truthfully answer that question, you chose to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deliberately lie.  And if -- if all of those things 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be proved beyond a reasonable doubt -- and that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an awful lot of ifs, and I think that --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, it's not a lot 

   

  

 

 

 

 

of ifs.  I knew that I drove over 60. 

    

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  I understand 

    

  

 

 

30 

the question.  I saw that it even says "ever." 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I researched it in 

    

 

 

 

 

Black's Law Dictionary and it said an offense --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- no matter how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

minor.  The conditions that you set forth were fully 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied, and I would say fully satisfied in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

everybody's case who don't -- who drives at -- at -- at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any time.  And your position is still, you answer that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question no, we can take away your citizenship. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  If we can prove that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

deliberately lied in answering that question, then yes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about -- let me give 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you another example.  One of the requirements is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you list any nickname that you've ever had. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right?  When I was a 

   

  

  

 

 

 

child -- not me, but some imagined applicant --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I was very slight of 

    

 

 

 

 

built -- I wasn't.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The applicant was.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

31 

his buddies were calling him the F word in terms of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gender identity.  He's not; never was.  Or is and 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclosed it in another part of the application.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that word embarrassed him, continues to embarrass him, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it has no importance to the decision-making process. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is that failure to disclose the use of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

childhood nickname that is embarrassing, that has no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship to anything whatsoever, could you prosecute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that person? 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  No -- well, I -- I think that 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

you may be overreading that particular question.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think what the -- what that question is requesting are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

names that you yourself have gone by.  And the reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that is requested is because the FBI conducts a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

background check on all of these individuals, and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

needs to know if there are other names that you may be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

known by that would --

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  There are.  There are. 

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly. 

  

 

MR. PARKER:  But I -- I mean, I don't mean 

   

   

   

  

 

 

to -- to push back against that hypothetical.  I only 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that what you're suggesting is that this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that other people called you in childhood, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

I don't think that that would be asked for in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

question, but --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, but that isn't the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

point.  The point is that I think, of all these 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions, the same thing. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You've read the briefs. 

  

 

 

 

 

The questions are unbelievably broad.  All right.  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

can think of 1,000 examples -- not 1,000, but maybe only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

500 --

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- of the kind that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chief Justice gave.  And it's, to me, rather surprising 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the government of the United States thinks that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress is interpreting this statute and wanted it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreted in a way that would throw into doubt the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship of vast percentages of all naturalized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizens. 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Well, I --

   

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, isn't -- now, you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

explain -- you explain to me why that isn't so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  I don't think that it would 

    

 

 

 

 

 

throw into doubt -- I -- I --

such as the one that the Chief Justice gave? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Well, I --

   

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm truly shocked by the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

one he gave, by the way. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  But -- but -- so -- so what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the answer?  You want to fight that?  Do you want to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, no, I don't have listed on the page in front of me 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 such examples and the briefs didn't list 23 and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and we couldn't think of 100 others? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  I think that we can -- look, I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- I would readily agree with you that there are a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number of questions on this form that, taken in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isolation, would appear to be, if -- if you gave an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

untruthful answer to one of those questions --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  It wasn't just --

  

 

 

 

 

MR. PARKER:  -- it would be --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- the questions. 

  

 

 

 

MR. PARKER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I walked into the 

    

 

 

 

immigration hearing with a pocketknife in a government 

   

   

 

 

 

building, a Boy Scout knife I carry on my key chain.  By 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way, no one ever saw it.  No one ever saw it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It was there the whole

time.  And then I walked out.  Okay?  Subject to 

   

  

  

  

 

 

 

deportation. 

34 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  No, I --

   

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I knew there was.  I knew I 

    

    

 

 

 

 

wasn't supposed to do it, but I thought, oh, so what? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And there it's been on my key chain for 30 years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  No.  I -- I actually think that 

    

   

  

 

 

 

that would not -- I think there were -- there were a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple of questions there.  I could just very briefly 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

address the last one. 

 

 

 

              

I don't think that the crime that you just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Forget my last examples. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. PARKER:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Look to the general 

  

 

 

 

 

example, and you've read through the ones in the brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't want to repeat it. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

It's the same underlying question. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  There are a number of answers 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that could be given in the naturalization process that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be false and might seem to be, in isolation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immaterial, completely immaterial, for example.  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

you could, you know, lie about your weight, let's say. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You're embarrassed that you weigh 170 pounds and so you

claim that you weigh 150. 

 

 

 

 

            

The point, though, is, Congress has 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically attended to all false statements under oath 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in these types of proceedings.  It has specifically 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided that it is a crime to lie under oath in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization process, even about an immaterial matter, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it has provided that certain of those immaterial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lies are categorical bars to naturalization. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Parker? 

  

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Please, I'm sorry.  Finish 

  

  

 

 

 

up. 

            

MR. PARKER:  I -- I was just going to say 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

that there are a number of reasons why Congress did not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to require that the government prove that a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular lie is material or immaterial in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context, and I -- I think it's important to understand 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

what those are. 

 

 

            

The first is, when an individual lies, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even -- remember, this has to be a lie under oath after 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've sworn that you will tell the truth and you are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deliberately lying about something, it calls into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question the veracity of your other answers, and that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very important in the naturalization process, for the

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  But isn't --

  

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Go 

  

  

 

 

 

36 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And you'll be glad to know I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have another of these questions for you. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Although I am a little bit 

   

   

  

 

 

horrified to know that every time I lie about my weight, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it has those kinds of consequences. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Only -- only under oath. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah. 

  

 

Can I just ask you -- can I ask you to take 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you through a few parts of your brief? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because I guess I felt a 

   

   

  

 

 

little bit confused on reading what your standard is. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So on page 14, you say that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the question is whether Petitioner violated the law in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the course of procuring naturalization, in the course of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procuring naturalization.  Then on page 9 and page 17, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you say that the question is whether a person procures 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization in a manner that violates very -- that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violates other laws.

Which are we talking about?  Is it in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

course of or in a manner that violates other laws? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Well, I -- I -- my -- my 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

37 

apologies if that wasn't clear.  I think we're just 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying two ways of saying exactly the same thing, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that is exactly how the jury was instructed in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  I mean, it seems sort 

    

  

 

 

 

 

of different to me.  "In the course of" is what creates 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the hypotheticals that Justice Breyer was talking about, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the penknife or the gun or something like that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But what -- so what you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying -- but we -- you -- I can just choose, you -- you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can tell me, your standard is in a manner that violates 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other laws. 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Well, I think that's right. 

   

  

 

 

 

And I think what that means is the same as what the --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury was instructed in this case.  It has to be --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  So then -- I mean, it 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

makes me want to say, okay, what does it mean to procure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization in the manner that violates other laws. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And then you talk about that.  And you talk about that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on -- this -- the -- this is the only time I found in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the brief where you actually suggest what it means to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

procure naturalization in a way that -- in a manner that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violates other laws.  And you say on page 18, what that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means is by violating those various laws.  By violating 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

those various laws.  And that made me think that's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causal requirement. 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  No.  I mean, what --

    

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You procure 

  

 

 

naturalization -- this is, again, on page 18 -- a person 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who knowingly procures naturalization in an unlawful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

manner, and then you clarify that that means by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violating the laws Congress has enacted.  So when you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that you procure naturalization by violating laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress has enacted, all you're saying is that -- is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the naturalization results from the violation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those laws. 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Well, I --

   

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And I guess if that's not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

what you meant to say -- and I don't mean to trick you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here --

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- if that's not what you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant to say in this brief, although it suggests --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- it -- I think it is what you say, but if it's not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what you meant to say, well, how could it be anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else?

MR. PARKER:  Well, I -- I think it is not. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

And my apologies if that sentence is unclear.  I think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

it's actually described in -- in more detail on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preceding page, on page 17.  Our -- our interpretation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of that provision is that it means that you have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procure naturalization in violation of the laws that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

govern the naturalization process.  These are laws that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

address naturalization and --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, number one, where is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that in the statute? 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Well, I think that it is a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

necessary construction of the -- of the phrase, "procure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary to law naturalization."  So --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it doesn't say the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  It just says contrary to law.  It doesn't say 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what laws.  It doesn't say laws governing the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization process.  So that's -- that's one issue. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But -- but that's a different issue from the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

one I'm talking about. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Whatever laws it is, whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it's all laws or whether it's laws relating to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization process. 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh.

mean when you say in a manner that violates the laws, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 

it's when you say, you say it's by -- you -- you procure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization by violating the laws, you very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturally -- I think it's a totally naturally --

   

   

 

 

 

 

natural --

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- construction of the 

  

 

 

 

 

language, you very naturally say you got the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization by violating those laws, meaning that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization is the result of those -- that violation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because what else could you mean when you say -- when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- when you have a naturalization and you have these 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation of laws? 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Well, again --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Again, that the violation 

  

 

 

 

 

led to the naturalization. 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Well, again, I mean, just with 

   

  

 

 

 

 

respect to the sentence that you're quoting, I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what we were -- what we were saying is by violating the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laws, we were trying to describe what it means to act in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an unlawful manner.  I don't think we were trying to say 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that means procurement of naturalization. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I know.  I'm sort of 

    

  

 

 

 

suggesting that in trying to describe that you ended up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using the Petitioner's formulation, and that seems quite

natural to me because I don't know what other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

41 

formulation you could use --

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Well, I don't think --

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- to describe what it means 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and say in a manner that violates those laws. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  I don't think that it is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

natural, and -- and let me explain why.  The statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says procure contrary to law naturalization.  We know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what procure naturalization means.  That means to obtain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization.  And then the phrase is "contrary to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

law."  Well, the question then is contrary to what laws? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think that law has to be interpreted consistent with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the two words that bookend that provision, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"procure" and "naturalization." 

 

 

            

Now, I don't think --

   

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can I -- can I ask you 

   

   

  

 

 

 

this --

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This may be a 

  

 

 

 

 

simpleminded question, but how can an immaterial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement procure naturalization? 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  I think that the -- the --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's such a shorter 

   

  

 

 

statement of my question.  It's perfect. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.)

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  I think the answer is, we at 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

least don't read the statute to require that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement be procuring the naturalization.  We don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

42 

read the statute to say that the violation has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procure, and I think that this goes to a difference in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

how we may be using the term "materiality" here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The Petitioner is saying that it means that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the person has to have lied about a material matter, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning that a truthful answer would be more likely to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get them naturalization than an untruthful one.  Or, as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner has also said several times, that it would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the but-for cause of getting that naturalization. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But what Congress was concerned here with is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not what people lied about; rather, it was the fact that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they lied.  And the lie itself --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  That's the same question. 

  

 

 

 

 

It may be the same question in a -- in a different form. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Just give me a sentence that has this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

pattern.  Jane Doe procured something.  Jane Doe 

  

  

 

 

 

 

procured X contrary to law, where the thing that she 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procured had no potential -- I'm sorry -- where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing that she did had no potential to help her get X. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Had no -- well --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  She -- she procured X 

  

 

 

 

 

 

contrary to law, but the thing that she did had no

potential to help her get that thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  If -- if what we are saying, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as -- as Petitioner has argued, is that it has to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that -- where you either could not get it, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

it would be much less likely to get it if you did Y 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead of X, I think one example might be, you know, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- you go to a gallery.  You can procure the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

painting that's in the gallery in one of two ways.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can procure it unlawfully by stealing it, or you can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procure it lawfully by buying it.  If you steal it, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirely natural to say that you have procured the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

painting contrary to law, even though, presuming that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you had the money, you could just as easily have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchased it.  And that, I think, is the difference. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But the -- the thing -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing that was done there, stealing the painting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly had the potential to help the thief get the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

painting. 

            

MR. PARKER:  That's true.  It was the means 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

by which they walked away with the painting.  But I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think that it is -- that there was any causal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship there of the sort that we've been talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about.  Had we have been talking about --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what about, what sort 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would you accept; that is, you've heard two right there.

Forget the word "materiality."  From your point of view, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you don't.  Okay?  And I take it, but-for condition, you 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

44 

don't.  And I take it that proximate cause, you don't. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But what about had a tendency for -- to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

affect a reasonable immigration officer in his judgment? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

What about that? 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Well --

used?  It was a means towards getting.  That's tougher 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

than you're usually accepting.

JUSTICE BREYER:  But which ones -- well, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

here I have about five -- would influence the decision? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It had the possibility or tendency to influence the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision. 

            

            

wrong? 

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You say all those are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. PARKER:  I think they are, but the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

reason is that Congress has said that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

accept? 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, which one do you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. PARKER:  I -- I don't think I would 

    

   

   

 

 

accept any of them.  I think that the problem here is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress has said --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, I know -- I know you 

   

   

  

 

 

 

45 

say Congress said that.  But the question, of course, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for us is whether Congress said that.  And we have some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words.  So I want to know if those words, in your mind, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are capable of any interpretation that suggests any kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of tendency of the unlawful act to move an immigration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge -- if not this one, some other one -- towards a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plus decision. 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  I -- I don't think so, because 

    

   

 

 

 

 

Congress has said, for example, that even -- and -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this was the Court's decision in Kungys -- that even an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immaterial false statement about the most immaterial of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matters can be a categorical bar to the abilities --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ability of the person to be naturalized. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the -- the point there is that it would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be very odd, I think, to read the statute to say that if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a person procures naturalization despite having done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, that somehow that was not done contrary to law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because materiality or some -- some other formulation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be required in addition in order to establish 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Parker, let me --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

let me try this another way.  If you take this phrase, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is a kind of a stilted phrase, because the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

"contrary to law" comes in between.  But -- but it --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

46 

all it really means is procure naturalization illegally. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Do you agree with that? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  I think so. 

    

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Procure contrary to law and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization, it's procure naturalization --

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Yes, if you violated laws 

  

 

 

 

 

 

governing naturalization, right. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So the idea that procuring 

  

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization illegally somehow includes illegal acts 

 

 

 

 

 

that have no effect on naturalization, or on procuring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization, it's -- it's just not how we use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language. 

            

How could it be that that is true? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  But it's not.  Well, my 

  

  

 

 

 

 

disagreement there is that it is not that it has no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect.  The effect, though, is the fact that the person 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lied.  It is not what the person lied about. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it has -- but it has no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect on the decision to naturalize. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Whether a truthful answer would 

   

  

 

 

 

have had an effect on the decision to naturalize versus 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an untruthful one?  I -- I think that Congress has said 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite clearly that that is not the relevant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consideration for purposes of these --

 

 

 

 

 

  

applying these 

 

statutes.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  And I guess what I'm 

   

  

  

 

 

 

47 

saying is that, how do you use that phrase in a statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and not mean that there has to be a relationship between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the illegal acts and the procurement of naturalization? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Well, I think there does have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

to be a relationship.  I -- we don't dispute that.  We 

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

just don't --

 

 

            

            

nexus. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Will you tell us --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. PARKER:  -- think that there is a causal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Will you tell us what that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship is? 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  That -- that relationship, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

our view, is that the laws have to be the laws governing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization.  And what that means is there are laws 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governing who may be naturalized and there are laws 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

governing how they must do so. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  If that's true, though, 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr. Parker, what do you do with 15 -- 1425(b)?  What's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the difference between (a) and (b) on the government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account?  (a) says you -- you procure contrary to law, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization; (b) says you procure naturalization 

 

 

 

 

 

you're not entitled to. 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Well, I think that the 

   

  

 

 

 

reference to being entitled in subsection (b) reinforces

our point that "contrary to law" doesn't necessarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean that you weren't entitled to the naturalization. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

It means that you violated the rules that Congress had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set forth governing who can be naturalized and how they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must do to. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GORSUCH:  So (b) would be you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

were -- you were not entitled to begin with, and (a) is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you may have been entitled, but you lied in the process 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of. 

            

MR. PARKER:  I think that's a fair reading. 

    

   

 

 

 

I mean, I would note that -- that (b) also sweeps more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broadly than (a), because it includes things like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obtaining a certificate of naturalization rather than 

   

 

 

 

 

the actual procurement of naturalization. 

 

 

 

 

              

I think --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Parker --

  

 

 

 

MR. PARKER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The government -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

Congress doesn't have the power to denaturalize someone. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At least so far we haven't let them do that as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

punishment for a criminal act. 

   

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh.

prerequisite to naturalization -- that's what this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

means -- that that's the only time Congress can deprive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you of citizenship is when something actually would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

barred you from getting it. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Well, the only point that we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were trying to make in that footnote --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know the point you 

    

 

 

 

 

were trying to make --

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- but answer the point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

he has made --

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Yes.  Well --

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and the point I have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

made, which is, if Congress doesn't have the power, ex 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

post facto, to denaturalize you, we're giving them this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power, should we be reading it narrowly or broadly? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Well, I don't think that there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is -- I think that it shouldn't necessarily be read 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broadly, but I think that any fair reading of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute would include this.  And let me just explain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what we think about eligibility because, frankly, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that it may be a way to get to the same point. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I --

   

  

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- ask you before that, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

50 

we've been concentrating on this statute.  Is there any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other statute in the entire U.S. Criminal Code, any --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any false statement statute that is violated by an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immaterial false statement? 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Yes.  Section 1014 is --

  

  

 

 

 

 

criminalizes false statements made to a bank.  And in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Wells, this Court held that it could be a completely 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immaterial false statement. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think 

    

 

 

Justice Sotomayor has a question pending. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Yes.  So let me just explain 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

for a moment how eligibility would work in this context. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Let's say that somebody makes a false statement in their 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization process, and that false statement is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discovered.  One of two things will happen.  Either the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

false statement is of the sort that is mentioned in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 1101(f)(6), and therefore, is a categorical bar 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to naturalization.  You are immediately deemed 

  

 

 

 

 

ineligible. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is -- is that the false 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement for the purpose of obtaining an immigration 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit? 

            

MR. PARKER:  Yes.  And it can be an 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

immaterial one, yes. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.

MR. PARKER:  So that would be one. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

51 

If it is not that, let's say it's a -- it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a violation of Section 1015, but it didn't involve oral 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony, and in -- in Kungys, this Court held that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that 1101(f)(6) requires oral testimony.  Then what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

happens is it would have to be analyzed under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residual provision of 1101(f), which says, the fact that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we have enumerated certain grounds above does not mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that those are exclusive, and there are other grounds on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which the person's good moral character may be denied. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What happens at that point is, either the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person could be denied because they are actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ineligible based on that statement, or they could be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denied naturalization because, at every stage, the alien 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bears the burden of persuasion, and it could be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concluded that they did not satisfy their burden of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establishing eligibility.  What they have to do in order 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to obtain naturalization, notwithstanding having made a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

false statement, is do what -- what the regulations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

refer to as demonstrating extenuating circumstances. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Demonstrating --

  

 

 

MR. PARKER:  This is a whole -- I'm sorry? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Demonstrating what? 

  

 

 

MR. PARKER:  Extenuating circumstances.  So 

  

  

 

 

this would be a whole record evaluation by the agency of

all of the circumstances involved, and the alien bears 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the burden of doing that. 

 

 

 

 

52 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In which of those 

  

 

 

 

 

processes has there ever been the kind of immaterial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statement that the Chief Justice gave, lying about a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traffic ticket, where there's been no injury to anybody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and no claim of reckless driving, other than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speeding? 

            

MR. PARKER:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Where has the agency 

  

 

 

 

 

ever denied naturalization because of an -- an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immaterial statement? 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  I'm not aware of a particular 

   

  

 

 

 

 

case in which that has occurred.  These are not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

published decisions, so I -- I couldn't say.  But I 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

would note, however, that if the alien -- if that lie is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not discovered, and the alien manages to procure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization notwithstanding it, the government's 

 

 

 

 

position would be that at that point, that person has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

procured naturalization in a circumstance in which they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

are not eligible, because as a factual matter, they had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lied.  And because they lied, they were then -- it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incumbent upon them to show extenuating circumstances. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They did not do that, and so they would be ineligible.

MR. PARKER:  I don't think so. 

    

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's not a serious 

   

  

 

 

constitutional question of whether an American citizen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can be -- have his citizenship taken away because 40 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years before, he did not deliberately put on paper what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his nickname was or what -- or what his speeding record 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was 30 years before that, which was, in fact, totally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immaterial.  That's not a constitutional question? 

   

  

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Well, I -- I don't think so, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

because Congress has, number one, specified that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immaterial false statements are grounds for denying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization.  But I also would note that -- I mean, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

there are a few responses.  One is, the criminal 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

provision, at least, has a 10-year statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

limitations, so it wouldn't be 40. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But I -- I think that it's important to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

remember that denaturalization is not, like, a lifetime 

   

 

 

 

 

 

bar on -- on citizenship.  All denaturalization does, is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it returns you to the status of a lawful permanent

resident.  You then have to wait 5 years, and if after 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54 

the end of those 5 years, you can demonstrate that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're -- that you're entitled to citizenship, you can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be renaturalized.  It also doesn't --

  

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't think this 

    

 

 

 

 

is problem of -- of a constitutional statute, but it is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly a problem of prosecutorial abuse.  If you take 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

the position that refusing to -- not answering about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speeding ticket or the nickname is enough to subject 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that person to denaturalization, the government will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have the opportunity to denaturalize anyone they want, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because everybody is going to have a situation where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

they didn't put in something like that -- or at least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most people. 

 

            

And then the government can decide, we are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to denaturalize you for other reasons than what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might appear on your naturalization form, or we're not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And that to me is -- is troublesome to give that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraordinary power, which, essentially, is unlimited 

 

 

 

 

 

power, at least in most cases, to the government. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Well, I --

   

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

 

 

   

That strikes me as 

 

 

 

a serious problem. 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  I certainly understand your 

    

 

 

 

concern, Mr. Chief Justice.  All I can say is I -- I

don't think that the statute says anything that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

necessarily prevent denaturalization from occurring --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

other --

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it --

  

 

 

 

MR. PARKER:  -- but there are a number of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It -- it seems to me that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your argument is demeaning the -- the priceless value of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship.  You say, oh, he just restored her -- or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

she could -- her former status.  That's not what our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases say.  That's not what citizenship means. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  I would --

    

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're arguing for the 

  

 

 

 

 

government of the United States, talking about what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

citizenship is and ought to mean. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  Right.  And I -- well, we would 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

readily agree that it is a priceless treasure.  We are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not disputing that at all.  One of the consequences of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the priceless nature of citizenship, is that Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has surrounded it with a number of protections to ensure 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the individuals seeking it square every corner and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are absolutely and completely honest. 

 

 

 

 

              

I do want to point out, though, that there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are a number of other protections built into the system, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that would prevent this sort of problems that the Chief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice has raised; and one of those is that we would

have to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that -- that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56 

this was a deliberate lie.  I think that convincing a --

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

a unanimous jury of that, is very difficult. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But I also would note that there are 780,000 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalization petitions filed every year.  It would be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an extraordinary undertaking to do what you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggesting.  I don't want to --

    

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Before you finish, may --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. PARKER:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- I ask you one other 

   

  

 

 

 

 

thing about the character of this statute.  So we have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here for denaturalization, the parallel civil way to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a person denaturalized --

 

 

 

            

            

MR. PARKER:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- and a criminal.  In 

   

  

  

 

 

other cases where there are parallel criminal penalties, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil penalties, is there any other one where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal disqualifications is easier to establish than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the civil one? 

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  May I? 

  

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

            

MR. PARKER:  I -- we would say no, because 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

we believe that the language "illegally procured" in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

civil provision is effectively synonymous with 

 

 

 

 

 

procurement contrary to law.  It would only be that in

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. LANDAU:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I'd like to make three quick points, if I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might.  First, to go back to Justice Gorsuch's questions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he asked both sides about the relationship between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1425(a) and (b), I think they are largely overlapping. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is true that the -- the -- (b) covers some more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things that (a) doesn't cover; (b) uses the language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"entitled." 

            

That may inform exactly the nature of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

causal link that one would infer in (a), but I think it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't in any way affect our central argument here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is there has to be some causal link that it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely -- you cannot procure something contrary to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law, based on an immaterial false statement, which, by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition, is the kind of thing that doesn't even have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the tendency to do that. 

 

 

 

 

            

Again, to go back to Kungys, the natural

tendency to produce the conclusion that the applicant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was qualified for citizenship. 

 

 

 

58 

            

Second, the -- the government said a number 

   

 

 

 

 

 

of times, oh, yeah, this -- it's not a big deal.  We --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, the government under Kungys, it said you don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

need material false statement.  And -- and it said in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wells also, that -- in response to another statute where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was true. 

 

 

            

In both Wells and Kungys -- and we make this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point in the 1015 section of our brief -- the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court made the point of addressing the concerns that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking out materiality would open up the defendant to an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incredible array of sanctions based on something that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, presumably, Congress doesn't mean to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminalize minor offenses.  But it said:  There is a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose requirement in both of those, and that's what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gave the Court comfort in saying you didn't need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

materiality in addition to that purpose requirement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So it is not true when the government is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, oh, immaterial false statements are a basis for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

denaturalization under 1101(f)(6).  That is only -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as Kungys stressed -- because there is already a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for-the-purpose-of requirement in that same provision. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the same exact thing is true on -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Wells, which is based on Kungys.  The government has

identified no case in the history of American law where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court has upheld a statute without a materiality 

   

   

 

 

 

 

59 

requirement if there wasn't some functional equivalent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to materiality, such as a purpose requirement.  And I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

think some of the hypotheticals that were posed here 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show just how drastic this would be, and how extreme the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's position is here. 

 

 

 

            

The third and final point I'd like to make, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that I think, as some of Justice Kagan's questions 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed out, the most natural way to read "procured 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contrary to law," is to have it mean procured by means 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a violation of law.  Contrary to law is an adverbial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

phrase that modifies the way in which you procure it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you --

  

 

 

 

MR. LANDAU:  If you --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you read Wells as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

having a causal requirement -- as being a causal 

   

   

 

 

 

 

requirement. 

            

MR. LANDAU:  I think it's -- it's -- it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically says for the purpose of --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If the speaker knows the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

falsity of what he says and intends to influence the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

institution. 

            

MR. LANDAU:  Correct.  I think that 

    

  

 

 

that's -- basically, that's why I think it's

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

functionally the equivalent of materiality.  So I think 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the Court felt some comfort in Wells.  The Court didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60 

just say, oh, we -- we -- we are fine with -- you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are dispensing with de minimis non curat lex.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the background norm against which all of our laws are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enacted, because we have to assume that this -- the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the government -- you have to look at how the harshest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor in the land will apply this.  And I think the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questioning today makes it chillingly clear that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's position in this case would subject all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naturalized Americans to potential denaturalization at 

 

 

 

 

 

the hands of an aggressive prosecutor. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That is not what Congress intended.  That is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not what is in the language of the statute.  Nothing in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute compels this Court, that -- this would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

breaking entirely new ground, and we urge this Court no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to go there. 

 

 

            

            

            

            

Thank you very much. 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
