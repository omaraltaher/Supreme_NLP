 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-586, Jones v. 
Harris Associates.

 Mr. Frederick.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 In 1970, Congress amended the Investment 

Company Act to provide a cause of action when an 
investment adviser breaches its fiduciary duty with 
respect to compensation.

 The Seventh Circuit upheld summary judgment 
for Respondent under a legal standard for fiduciary duty 
that Respondent here no longer defends.

 For three reasons, the Seventh Circuit's 

judgment should be reversed.  First, under the Court's 
longstanding precedent, in this context a fiduciary duty 
requires a fair fee, achieved through full disclosure 
and good-faith negotiation.

 Second, the best gauge of a fair fee is what 
the investment adviser charges at arm's-length in other 
transactions for similar services.

And, third, applying that standard here, 
Harris charged twice as much in percentage terms for 
providing virtually identical advisory services in 
arm's-length transactions with institutional investors.

 With respect to the first point, the 

standard for fiduciary duty has been clear from this 
Court's cases, at least since Pepper v. Litton, in which 
the Court said that a fair result in the 
circumstances -- a fair fee -- was an important 
component of a fiduciary duty.

 Congress was aware of that standard when it 

enacted the 1970 amendments to the Investment Company 
Act.  The SEC brought the case to the Congress' 
attention, and that standard, we submit, is one that 
Congress intended to incorporate.

 Applying that standard, where Pepper said 
that the best gauge of a fair fee is what the person --
the fiduciary charges in arm's-length transactions, 
applied here, the best way to understand how that 
fiduciary duty is being breached in this context is what 
Harris is charging for same or similar services at 
arm's-length to institutional investors.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is Harris a fiduciary in 
the same sense as a corporate officer and a corporate 
director?  Or does his fiduciary duty differ?  Is it

higher or lower, same with a guardian, same with a 
trustee?

 I mean, the word "fiduciary" -- does 

fiduciary imply different standards, depending on what 
kind of fiduciary you are?

 MR. FREDERICK:  The basic concept, 

Justice Kennedy, is the same.  There are two components, 
where there must be full disclosure of information and a 
fair result, and that fair result translates in 
different contexts in different ways.  Here, because of 
the statutory references to fiduciary duty with respect 
to compensation, one focuses on the fairness of the fee 
charged.

 But, as Professor Dumont points out in her 
amicus brief, the idea of a fiduciary duty is one that 
is well known in various circumstances of the law, and 
as applied here the concept goes to the fairness of the 
fee.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, would the test for 

compensation in this case be the same as any director or 
any officer of a corporation?

 MR. FREDERICK:  The difference here, Justice 

Kennedy, is that in those circumstances the indicia of 
an arm's-length transaction may be achieved.  The 
directors can fire the head of a company.  They can call

for changes.

 Here, the investment adviser has appointed 

the members of the board.  As this Court said in the 
Daily Income Fund case, the earmarks of an -- of an 
arm's-length transaction are absent precisely because --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I just want to know, is 

the fiduciary duties the same?  Is the fiduciary 
standard the same, without getting into how its applied?

 Is the fiduciary standard the same for 

Jones, for a guardian, for a trustee, for a corporate 
officer or a corporate director, always the same?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.  The concept is fair 

result through full information and good-faith 
negotiations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And for lawyers?
 MR. FREDERICK:  For lawyers --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Lawyers have a fiduciary 

obligation to their clients; right?

 MR. FREDERICK:  That is true.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So courts should review 

lawyers' fees for -- on the basis of whether it's a fair 
result.

 MR. FREDERICK:  That is how courts do it 

every day in this country, Justice Scalia, when they are 
asked to make fee applications for reasonableness.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but this is 

different.  I mean, this is part of an expense of a 
fund.  They don't get fees, but -- but they get -- they 
have to pay for the lawyers, just like they have to pay 
for management advice.

 So why wouldn't you review the lawyers' fees 

to make sure they are fair?

 MR. FREDERICK:  The lawyers' fees in which 
context, Mr. Chief Justice?  I'm not sure I understand 
the question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel for the 

fund.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Counsel for the fund is --
that is actually not at issue here, but the issue of 
what constitutes reasonable expenses may arise in 
various circumstances.

 The statute prohibits fees that are 

unreasonable in terms of their unfairness to the fund. 
The concept here is that the board cannot fire the 
investment adviser.  So in evaluating the fairness of 
the fee the adviser is charging the fund, the normal 
indicia of an arm's-length transaction is absent, and 
that is the key principle here because this adviser is 
using the same manager to provide the same research 
analytics from the same research group, from the same

meetings, buying the same stocks, and simply allocating 
them to different accounts and charging those to whom it 
owes a fiduciary duty twice what it is getting at 
arm's-length.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there was in this 

record, was there not, a submission by the adviser 
comparing what mutual funds this fund was charged, what 
institutional funds were charged, but explaining the 
differential in terms of the services provided, that 
more services were provided to the fund and less 
services were provided to the institutional investors.

 MR. FREDERICK:  And, Justice Ginsburg, that 

is where there is a disputed issue of fact for which 
summary judgment is not appropriate, because the 
plaintiffs submitted evidence that in fact the services 
provided to the institutional investors were greater, 
even though they were being charged a lower amount of 
money.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who would have the 

burden?  You said that is an issue that has not been 
decided, it's a disputed issue of fact, appropriate for 
remand.  Who -- would you have the burden if they came 
forward and said, look, this is what our situation is. 
These are the services.  Would you have the burden to 
show that in fact they were comparable and the

differences did not warrant the differences in the fee?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You would have the 

burden?

 MR. FREDERICK:  We have the burden.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's different from 

normal trust law, isn't it?

 MR. FREDERICK:  It is.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Normally where you are a 

fiduciary, it's up to you to prove that it was 
reasonable.

 MR. FREDERICK:  That's true.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So Congress evidently did 

not mean ordinary trust law to apply in this context.

 MR. FREDERICK:  We disagree with that last 
part, Justice Scalia.  We agree that Congress did make 
modifications to the way a cause of action ordinarily 
would have been brought at common law for breach of 
fiduciary duty in several respects, including imposing 
the burden of proof on the investor.  Where we disagree 
is that when they used the phrase "fiduciary duty" they 
intended to mean something less than what fiduciary duty 
had meant at common law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if -- if you 

are having courts decide -- review what is fair, a fair

fee, what if the adviser had given such good advice that 
the fund beat the industry average for his category of 
fund by 5 percent over the last 5 years.  Does he get 
double the normal compensation of the average fees? 
Does he get triple?  50 percent more?  How is the court 
supposed to decide that?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, there is an issue of 

fact as to how relevant performance is.  They didn't 
give the money back when their performance lagged behind 
the market, Mr. Chief Justice, in this case.  So the 
question of whether or not a performance metric is 
relevant is certainly a factor that will be entitled to 
less --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, surely you 
think it is.  When you say they don't give the money 
back, you are not suggesting that the amount of the fees 
should be the same regardless of whether they outperform 
by 10 percent or not?

 MR. FREDERICK:  My point, Mr. Chief Justice, 

is that when they charge the same amount, buying the 
same stocks, to institutional investors and achieve the 
same performance, there is no reason why the mutual fund 
should be charged twice as much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but there is 
different parameters, right, in the sense that you're

trying -- the company is trying to attract investors to 
the mutual fund.  If you are advising a pension fund, it 
is not the case that they are trying to attract 
pensioners who have other choices.

 MR. FREDERICK:  But the investor doesn't 
gain because of the marketing skill of the adviser. 
Simply having a larger asset pool which increases the 
fee that the adviser can charge doesn't inure to the 
individual benefit of the investor.  And the point of 
this statute was to provide protection against investors 
so that when the adviser charged excessive fees that 
excess would be returned to the fund for the pro 
rata benefit --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You said that Congress 
used "fiduciary" in a special sense.  Then -- then, I 
have to conclude that your earlier answer is confusing 
for me, because I thought you were going to tell us that 
this investment adviser has the same fiduciary standard 
that officers and directors of corporations have.  Then 
you say that Congress used it in this special sense.  So 
that doesn't quite square.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, Justice Kennedy, let 

me just add the extra words of the statute, because what 
Congress said was a fiduciary duty "with respect to 
compensation."  And so when I say special sense, I mean

that Congress used additional words to elaborate on the 
circumstance in which the fiduciary duty would be 
examined.

 Here what is happening is that an 

arm's-length transaction for the same services -- the 
same manager is going out and touting his services to 
the institutional investor, but simply charging them 
half as much money for providing the same portfolio of 
management.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do technological 

changes make a difference in terms of disclosures 
required?  These days all you have to do is push a 
button and you find out exactly what the management fees 
are.  I mean, you just look it up on Morningstar and 
it's right there and you can make -- as an investor you 
can make whatever determination you'd like, including to 
take your money out.

 MR. FREDERICK:  The fact that an investor 
may know going in what the fee is does not address the 
problem Congress was intending to address, which is that 
as larger and larger sums of assets were accreted to the 
mutual fund, the investor was not obtaining the benefits 
of economies of scale.  And that's the central point --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So we could look 

at -- you know, as the fund grows bigger and he doesn't

get those benefits he can go look at another fund.  It 
takes 30 seconds.

 MR. FREDERICK:  And that again doesn't 

address the problem Congress was trying to get at, which 
is to protect the company, not the individual investor. 
The individual investor might lessen the damages that 
that investor suffers, but the fund, the people 
remaining, continue to pay excessive fees.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, but he protects the 
company ultimately, because when investors leave the 
company that is charging excessive fees to go to other 
companies, the company that they are leaving sees that 
something's wrong and has to lower its compensation to 
its adviser.  Why doesn't that affect the company at 
issue?

 MR. FREDERICK:  A large number of assets 

under management in mutual funds, something like 26 to 
35 percent according to materials that are in the 
record, are from 401(k) plans, where the investor is 
essentially locked into the fund that his or her company 
chooses to make that investment.  And even as to 
investors who are not locked in, there are significant 
tax consequences where over time an investor might be in 
the Oakmark Fund and have to suffer large tax 
consequences in order to get the benefit of the

statute --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Companies --

companies change who they invest with under the 401(k)'s 
all the time.  The employees are not happy with the 
return they are getting because the company has limited 
their choices, they change.  It happens all the time.
 MR. FREDERICK:  And Mr. Chief Justice, as 

the Court recognized in the Daily Income Fund case, this 
is a unique cause of action in which Congress was 
intending to protect the entire corpus of the investors 
in the fund, because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You told me just a 

little while ago, or told somebody, Congress wasn't 
interested in protecting investors; they were interested 
in protecting the companies.

 MR. FREDERICK:  The company is comprised of 

the investors, Mr. Chief Justice.  What the right of 
action does not do is to provide individual damages to 
the investor who brings the suit.  The recovery inures 
to the entire benefit of all the investors.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, can I unpackage 

your argument a little bit.  Because using the word 
"fair fee" in my mind is meaningless, because it has to 
be fair in relationship to something.  And so what is 
your definition of what that something is that it's fair

to, and -- or unfair against?  And start from there, 
because I understood the Seventh Circuit to be saying: 
Look, a fair fee is paying market value.  If one takes a 
sort of reading -- whatever negotiation goes on between 
the two, as long as there has been full disclosure as 
required, that's the market.  So that's fair.  You're 
saying it's something else.  What's that something else?
 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, what the Court said in 

pepper is that fair is what is reflective of what an 
arm's-length agreement would produce.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So you start 

there.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So let's 

stop confusing this -- the articulation of the standard, 
which is -- that's fair.  What would an arm's-length 
transaction produce?  And let's go to what seems to be 
part of your argument and sort of what everyone's 
skirting around, which is what's the proof that a 
particular transaction is not arm's-length?

 The Seventh Circuit appeared to be saying, 
it's arm's-length when the parties have done all of the 
disclosure that is required, because then the buyer can 
decide whether they want to pay that fee or not, and 
once they choose to it's a fair price.  It's an arm's-

length transaction.  You are saying not, and that's 
what -- that's where I am trying to get to the nub of 
why not?  Why is --

MR. FREDERICK:  Because the directors can't 

fire and walk away from the advisor.  In any arm's-
length transaction, if I sell you a car and you don't 
like the price can you walk away.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's -- now, that's 
begging the question, because Congress hasn't said a 
reasonable fee.  It did say fiduciary duty, but it 
didn't -- there is a subtle but very important 
difference between reasonable and -- a reasonable fee 
and a fiduciary duty with respect to fees.

 MR. FREDERICK:  True.  There are two 

components:  Was there full information and good faith 
negotiating; and was the result fair.  In Pepper, the 
Court said if the result is not fair there can be a 
breach of fiduciary duty.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm still begging the 

question, fair against what.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Fair against what the 

adviser actually charged for same or similar services to 
an outsider who had the right to walk away.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Frederick, I don't 
understand your statement that they can't fire the

investment adviser.  Maybe they can't fire him, but they 
can insist that he accept a lower fee, right?  Surely 
they can do that, can't they?

 MR. FREDERICK:  They --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can they insist that he 

accept a lower fee?  Can they do that.

 MR. FREDERICK:  In practical terms, no.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?
 MR. FREDERICK:  Because the adviser picks 

the board of directors.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, no, that's something 

different.  Let's assume you have a disinterested board 
of directors, which is what the statute requires.  You 
tell me even though they are disinterested, they can't 
fire the adviser.  It seems to me, while they can't fire 
him, they can say:  We are going to cut your fee in 
half.  Whereupon they don't have to fire him.  He will 
pack up and leave, and they will get a new adviser. 
Doesn't that work?

 MR. FREDERICK:  There is actually no 

evidence in any record I am aware of where that has 
actually happened.  The directors have no leverage.  And 
that's the problem the Court -- this Court recognized in 
the Daily Income Fund case.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON
 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. GANNON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The fiduciary duty imposed by section 36(b) 
prohibits an investment adviser's fee from being outside 
the range that arm's-length bargaining would produce. 
The courts below erred by failing to consider evidence 
about what the investment adviser in this case charges 
its unaffiliated clients when it provides services that 
Petitioners claim are, in fact, comparable to the 
services at issue here.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you think Congress used 

the term "fiduciary" in a very special sense here?  I 
will just tell you the problem I'm having with the case. 
If I look at a standard that the fees must be reasonable 
and I compare that with what a fiduciary would do, I 
thought a fiduciary has the highest possible duty.  But 
apparently the submission is the fiduciary has a lower 
duty, a lesser duty than to charge a reasonable fee.  I

just find that quite a puzzling use of the word 
"fiduciary."

 Now, if Congress uses it as a term of art or 

in some special sense, fine.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, we do think that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it seems to me an odd 
use of the term "fiduciary."  I don't know why Congress 
didn't use some other word.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, we do think that the term 
"fiduciary duty" is here used to counterbalance the lack 
of arm's-length bargaining that exists between the board 
of directors and the investment adviser, and we do think 
that it drew upon the established term of art in 
Pepper v. Litton, the case that counsel for Petitioners 
was already referring to.  That's a case that actually 
involved corporate directors and there the same test, 
the same ultimate standard, was stated, which is whether 
the bargain carries the earmarks of an arm's length 
bargain and whether it's inherently fair.

 And so we do think that in the development 
of the legislation in 1969, the memorandum that the SEC 
submitted to Congress in 1969 explained that the shift 
from reasonableness to fiduciary duty largely achieved 
some procedural objectives of shifting the focus from 
the board of directors to the investment adviser, and

the text of the statute specifically makes it a 
fiduciary duty with respect to receipt of compensation.
 We think one salutary affect of that was to 

-- to make it clear that the Court's burden here, the 
Court's duty here, wasn't just to establish what the 
single most reasonable fee would be, but harking back to 
the Pepper v. Litton test, whether the bargain fell 
within the range of what arm's length bargaining 
otherwise would have achieved.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, if we are 
going to have regulation of what fees can be charged, 
you cite in your brief the various regulations the SEC 
has issued.  It makes a lot more sense to have the SEC 
regulate rates than to have courts do it, doesn't it?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, in the abstract, it might 
make more sense, Mr. Chief Justice.  I think the choice 
that Congress made here was to counterbalance the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You are not 

suggesting the SEC wouldn't have authority to do that, 
are you?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, even under this statute, 

the SEC has the authority to file suits under section 
36(b).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Has it filed any?

since 1980, Justice Ginsburg.  I think that the SEC in 
this context -- it has -- it has primarily directed its 
resources and energies into encouraging there to be 
better disclosure of fees, both the disclosure of 
information to the board, disclosure to investors, 
better education to shareholders so that they would be 
able to go --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it must be aware of 

the -- of the divergence between the fees that 
investment advisers charge to these companies and what 
they charge to other clients.  Isn't the SEC aware of 
that?

 MR. GANNON:  It is aware of that.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And yet has brought no 

suits against this industry?

 MR. GANNON:  Since 1980 it hasn't used 

section 36(b).  It has used less formal mechanisms in 
the context of examinations and investigators -- -

JUSTICE SCALIA:  For disclosure, just for 
disclosure.  But that suggests to me that the SEC may 
think that this is indeed a self-contained industry and 
that the comparison with investment advice given to 
other entities is -- is not a fair one.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, when the SEC helped draft 

the statute in the 1960s, it recognized that there was

this systematic disparity between the amounts that 
mutual funds were being charged by investment advisers 
and the amounts that investment advisers were charging 
their unaffiliated clients, and in the 1969 memorandum 
that I referred to, which is reprinted in an appendix to 
the amicus brief by John Bogel in its entirety, the SEC 
mentioned that comparison as being something that may 
well be relevant in proving in an individual case that 
that particular investment adviser's fees are excessive.
 And we think that the test here of whether 

under all the circumstances, which is what section 
36(b)(2) points the Court towards, of having to weigh --
having to weigh the board's approval of fees in light of 
all the circumstances, that those circumstances include 
things like the evidence that petitioners have presented 
here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Gannon, the -- all 

the circumstances, that comes from the Second Circuit's 
Gartenberg case?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, it also comes, 

Justice Ginsburg, from the text of section 36(b)(2).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in -- in that case, 
at least there was a footnote that seemed to say, you 
don't have to engage in a -- in the comparison with what 
institutional investors are paid.

MR. GANNON:  The footnote that you are 
talking about did point out that in that case the 
comparison that the plaintiffs were attempting to draw 
between the money market fund at issue and a pension 
fund wasn't a particularly relevant one, because the 
services at issue were so different.  And here the 
parties appear to dispute how different the services 
are.  And at the summary judgment stage, the Respondent 
stated that it disputed how comparable the relevant 
services were.

 The district court and the court of appeals 
considered that dispute immaterial because, instead of 
comparing, instead of determining whether this 
investment adviser is selling the same services at half 
the price to its unaffiliated clients who actually can 
engage in arm's length bargaining, those courts simply 
said that if it -- if it falls within the range that is 
charged by other mutual funds, that would be acceptable. 
And we --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, the statute 

does not say, in considering the rates you look at all 
the circumstances.  Am I right?  It says, in considering 
whether to defer to the board, you look at all the 
circumstances.

 MR. GANNON:  It does say that you should

give the board --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The board.
 MR. GANNON:  -- such consideration as is 

deemed appropriate under all the circumstances.  That's 
correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  But isn't 

that different than saying, in looking at what the rates 
should be or whether they are excessive, you look at all 
the circumstances?  It may well be that you don't defer 
to the board, but that doesn't mean it's a free-for-all 
in deciding what you do look at.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that it 

demonstrates that the Court is obligated to look to all 
the circumstances simply to determine whether the 
board's approval -- how much weight it should be given.
 And as this Court explained in Daily Income 
Fund, the entire point of section 36(b) is to provide an 
independent check, the -- independent of the fact that 
the directors approved the fees.  We think that an 
appropriately informed board that asks the right 
questions, that gets the right information and fully 
considers the sort of factors that are discussed --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even if they agree to 

pay double the price?

 MR. GANNON:  We think that -- that the right

process followed by the board would be probative, but 
something like double the price may -- may demonstrate 
that that is an unfair bargain.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- that's what --

are you advocating that there is a stand-alone cause of 
action or breach of duty when there isn't full 
disclosure, even if the fee is within arm's length --
normal -- begging the question of what's normal, but 
assuming that it's within an arm's-length transaction 
range in the market?

 MR. GANNON:  If there was a lack of full 
disclosure, that might in the abstract be a breach of 
fiduciary duty even under the Seventh Circuit's test. 
We think that if it didn't actually have an effect on 
the fees, then it wouldn't be actionable here because 
there would be no actual damages flowing from the lack 
of disclosure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But even if there is full 
disclosure, your position is in every case a court must 
decide whether the fee is reasonable or not.

 MR. GANNON:  A court would need to decide 

whether the plaintiff has met its burden of proving that 
it falls outside the range of fees that arm's-length 
bargaining would have arrived at, and that's a cause of 
action that would be --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, how much deviance, 

and what is the scope of the range?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I think that the term of 
art of "fiduciary duty" doesn't necessarily demonstrate 
how much deviance away from the range there would be.  I 
think that depending upon the segment of the market the 
range might be more or less narrow.

 In segments of the market where services are 

more commodified and standardized, perhaps with index 
funds, there might be a much narrower range of fees that 
are arrived at through arm's-length bargaining, and even 
-- and smaller disparities might be inappropriate there.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How is the -- how is the 

standard you've just described different from a standard 
of reasonableness?

 MR. GANNON:  It -- I think that the chief 

way it differs from reasonableness, Justice Kennedy, is 
in saying that the Court doesn't actually have to decide 
what the single most reasonable fee is.  But as the SEC 
explained in 1969, the shift from reasonableness to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I would be very 

surprised if "reasonableness" always meant one -- one 
figure.  It could mean a range.

fairness inquiry that this Court referred to in Pepper 
v. Litton as being part of the fiduciary duty status as 
to whether the transaction --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you a question 
going back to Justice Kennedy's early question?  Do you 
think the fiduciary status of the defendant in this case 
is different from the fiduciary status of a president of 
a corporation?

 MR. GANNON:  I -- I -- I think that it is 

different from the status of a president of a 
corporation; that -- that the term of art, "fiduciary" 
which Congress was invoking here can mean different 
things in different circumstances.

 Pepper was a case that involved corporate 

directors.  The chief difference here and what Congress 
was intending to counteract was the inherent structural 
impediment to arm's-length bargaining between the 
investment adviser and the board of directors.  And 
that's what makes that high burden that was used in 
Pepper v. Litton for controlling shareholders the 
relevant analogy, we believe.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. DONOVAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The point that Mr. Gannon just made and that 

Mr. Frederick made before, that there was some 
structural impediment to negotiations between a mutual 
fund board and adviser, is at the heart of this dispute, 
because that is a judgment that Congress made.  The 
Investment Company Act in the first instance delegates 
responsibility to the board of directors to approve 
fees.  A fee may not be approved that does not have the 
consent of a majority of the independent trustees in the 
first instance.

 The independent check on fees that is 

erected by section 36(b) --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's assume -- let's 
assume that all of the independent board of director 
members vote for a particular fee, but the fee is 
negotiated by an insider, and the insider is the one who 
does the evaluation, looks at them and says:  I think 
this is really a great deal, guys.  And they just fell 
for it.  Is that a process that would guarantee an 
arm's-length transaction in the sense that Congress 
intended in this act?

 MR. DONOVAN:  It may not and it may give

rise to a cause of action.  But as I started --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Which cause of action --
MR. DONOVAN:  A cause of action --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- under what?
 MR. DONOVAN:  It may give a cause of action 
under section 36(b) if the circumstances you described, 
Justice Sotomayor are -- have an impact upon the fee. 
And the reason --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, then their process 

is part of your definition of "fiduciary duty"?  A court 
has to look at the nature of process?

 MR. DONOVAN:  If there is an impact upon fee 

that is outside of the range of what could have been 
bargained.  The reason for that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now -- now you are 
adding what has been added, which is outside of the 
range, correct?

 MR. DONOVAN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.
 MR. DONOVAN:  If I understand your question 

correctly, will a process flaw alone justify a 
section 36(b) cause of action?  My answer is no.  Will a 
process flaw that affects a fee justify a 36(b) action? 
Yes, it will.

are -- but what you are arguing is, if the process is 
fair, even if the fee is outside the range of an arm's-
length transaction, there is no cause of action?

 MR. DONOVAN:  No, I -- I -- I doubt that as 

well.  There are two separate causes of action, I can 
imagine, under 36(b):  One, a process flaw that has a 
fee impact; and second, a fee that is so far outside of 
the bounds of what could have been bargained that it 
justifies independent review.

 The question under 36(b) is whether, having 

delegated responsibility in the first instance to a 
board, there is a reason to second-guess their judgment. 
And the independent check that Mr. Gannon referred to at 
section 36(b) or (a) should not be a de novo judicial 
review of the size of the fee for a couple of reasons, 
the first of which is section 36(b)(2).  That statute 
instructs courts to give such consideration as they 
consider due to the deliberations of the board.  What 
did they see?  What did they get?  Did they negotiate?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a wonderfully clear 

command, isn't it?  Such consideration as is 
appropriate?  What is the language?  Read it.  What is 
it?

 MR. DONOVAN:  The language is "such 

consideration that the court considers due under the

circumstances."

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wow.
 (Laughter.)
 MR. DONOVAN:  But there would be no reason 

for that instruction at all, Your Honor, if a court were 
to make its own judgments about what is fair and 
reasonable.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, it's meaningless.  It 

tells the court to make its own judgment.  Such 
consideration as the court deems due.  Give it 
whatever -- whatever consideration you -- you feel like. 
It's utterly meaningless to me.

 MR. DONOVAN:  What I think Congress was 

doing was considering what the source of the common law 
had been before.  The corporate context, 
Justice Kennedy, I think was what inspired.  At 
corporate law, a decision would not be second-guessed by 
a court unless there was a reason to do so, unless the 
judgment of directors and the presumption of regularity 
that attached to their decisions could for some reason 
be second-guessed.  Was there a process flaw?  Was it so 
far out of bounds?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what is "so 

far out of bounds"?  In other words, you are saying, you 
can look at what the directors did if it's, as you said,

too far out of bounds, but 10 percent off, 50 percent 
off?

 MR. DONOVAN:  Mr. Chief --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Double, as they say 

is the case here?

 MR. DONOVAN:  I'm sorry?
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Double, as they say 

is the case here?

 MR. DONOVAN:  As the plaintiffs say is the 

case here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.
 MR. DONOVAN:  I suggest there is no 

numerical basis, because in fact every kind of mutual 
fund and ever stripe of mutual fund is different.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then you say: 
Look to see if it's outside the bounds, and now you tell 
me there is no way to look to see if it's outside the 
bounds.

 MR. DONOVAN:  Well, I think -- the first 
comparative would be other funds of a similar stripe. 
So, for example, you could imagine that a mutual fund 
with the same investment objective and style that is two 
times might be inappropriate.  You could also imagine a 
different circumstance where, passively managed funds 
for example, a multiple of fees would be inappropriate.

You could also, though, imagine a case where 

there is substantial risk taken, where the types of 
securities that are invested in are unusual, where 
substantial differences could be justified.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that the test that the 

court of appeals here applied?

 MR. DONOVAN:  Pardon?
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that the test that the 
court of appeals here applied, whose judgment you want 
us to affirm?

 MR. DONOVAN:  The court of appeals did not 

apply the test.  Judge Easterbrook --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So we should remand it for 

application of the test that you propose?

 MR. DONOVAN:  I don't think you have to. 
And the reason is because of what the district court 
did.  And there I get to, Justice Ginsburg, what you 
said.  The -- the argument is made that services are the 
same.  In fact, that is not the record.  And if you look 
at page 161 of the Joint Appendix and following, there 
is a list of services that the trust -- the investment 
adviser gave to the trustees in this case, about all of 
the services that they did for their fee in the case.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Surely that's a disputed 
fact, isn't it?  And you want us to dispose -- or you

want this to be disposed of on summary judgment.  The 
other side says the services aren't that much different.
 MR. DONOVAN:  They are very different.  Page 

161 and following will tell you how.  And the district 
court at page 360 -- 16a, excuse me, of the district 
court's opinion, notices that the services were 
different.  So, under --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It wasn't talking about 

this particular case.  It was talking about in general, 
wasn't --

MR. DONOVAN:  No, he was talking about this 

case, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Except that they claim 

that you were receiving additional payment for the 
services, or some or at least a substantial number of 
the services, that you claim are attributed by the 
difference.  So they're saying if you compare apples to 
apples, you are charging twice the amount.  If you 
compare apples to oranges, there are differences because 
the oranges were different, but you were getting paid 
for those oranges separately.  I think that was their 
argument.

 MR. DONOVAN:  That is their argument and 

it's not accurate, Your Honor.

of disputed fact.  So let's go back.  Are you disavowing 
the Seventh Circuit's approach?  Because I read your 
brief and it doesn't appear as if you are defending 
their market approach that says so long as the process 
was fair, any fee is okay.  That's how I thought they 
had reached their conclusion.

 MR. DONOVAN:  I think what Judge Easterbrook 

said, and we don't agree, is if there is deceit of 
directors that would justify a cause of action under 
36(b).  But in the absence of, in his words, "pulling 
the wool over the eyes of the trustees" --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what I'm talking 

-- I am using his words in terms of case --

MR. DONOVAN:  I do --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And you're disavowing 

that?

 MR. DONOVAN:  I do not defend that, because 

I can imagine, as your hypothetical asked earlier, 
directors or trustees who -- are not paying attention --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Your positions is no 

different than the solicitor general's, that there has 
to be some measure of fair process and some measure of a 
fair fee, at least within -- in terms of it not being 
outside the range an arm's length transaction?

right when she describes Gartenberg as the standard.  Is 
this a result that could have been fairly bargained at 
arm's length.  Where we part company is with respect to 
two things:  One is, she says and Mr. Gannon said today, 
that the most important consideration is a comparison to 
other kinds of fees, and that is required in the 
calculus in the district court.  In fact, that would 
make mandatory what the SEC rules only make 
discretionary.

 Chief Justice, you asked earlier about the 

SEC's rules in this area.  And in fact, they compel 
disclosure of fees charged by advisers to their funds 
and their conflicts of similar investment objectives. 
They do not require disclosure of accounts within an 
advisor's business operations that are institutional 
accounts.  Now to be sure --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That are what?
 MR. DONOVAN:  That are -- advisers --

institutional accounts adviser services.  If --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the -- the fund 
adviser here -- I mean, the investment adviser did 
disclose -- that's in the record -- did disclose the 
difference between what were charged mutual funds, what 
were charged institutional investors, and then explained 
that the services were different and that justified the

difference.  But they weren't trying to think, no, we 
don't have to come forward with this information.

 MR. DONOVAN:  That's precisely correct, Your 

Honor.  In this case the trustees did have the 
information.  The adviser did disclose it, but the SEC 
does not require them to ask that question.  All it 
requires them to do is if they do ask the question, if 
they do study the material, they must disclose the 
weight they put on to it.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose you were appointed 
to a committee, just set my pay, that might be helpful. 
I'd say I'll pay you $50,000 a year to do it, as long as 
I am satisfied with your results.

 Now, would you, for example, not have in 

your mind, I would like to know what he's paid by other 
people that don't have someone like me setting his pay? 
Wouldn't that be in your mind?

 MR. DONOVAN:  It could be, sure.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, so wouldn't that be a 

normal question to ask?

 MR. DONOVAN:  And the trustees did ask it 

here.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I don't know if they 

asked it -- I mean, I think we are reviewing the

are reviewing -- sorry.  We're reviewing.

 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I have laryngitis; I don't 

speak accurately.

 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I think we are reviewing a 
-- a decision of a court of appeals setting a standard, 
and so wouldn't, when we set the standard, say, we can't 
say if in every case you are not going to go out and ask 
him what he charges when he mows the neighbor's lawn, 
but we would like to know what he charges when he asks 
for money from people who do not have this kind of 
supervision, and we would like if it's a lot different 
to ask him why.

 MR. DONOVAN:  Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay, so what's the problem 

then with saying that in the opinion?

 MR. DONOVAN:  There is no problem with 

saying that if it is a relevant consideration.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, it's pretty unusual 
that it won't be, and I think certainly you have in the 
case in front of us a case where it would be relevant. 
You may have an answer to the question.  There may be a 
perfectly good answer, so let's listen to it.

that the Solicitor General and the plaintiffs would make 
the question and the answer dispositive in every case. 
I would acknowledge as --

JUSTICE BREYER:  The answer dispositive? 
Well, I don't see it should be dispositive, maybe the 
answers would be quite different.

 MR. DONOVAN:  Precisely.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So -- but you 

no objection, then I'm not sure there is much of an 
issue.  There might -- I mean, maybe there is some. 
That's the only issue, whether this should be 
dispositive always, or whether it should be a factor to 
take into account where relevant?

 MR. DONOVAN:  It is a factor that I consider 

that is likely to be relevant --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So you have no objection to 

send it back and say look, of course this is relevant, 
perhaps quite often relevant; why don't you look at it?
 MR. DONOVAN:  My objection -- my objection 
to sending it back is only that that analysis was done.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But did -- but in the 

Seventh Circuit, Judge Easterbrook said, mainly you have 
to look to see if there was full disclosure, and then 
there might be cases where it's so out of line.  And he 
said the comparison would be to other mutual funds.  He

excluded the comparison with institutional investors. 
So to that extent, was the Second Circuit wrong, saying 
this is not a relevant factor; what other mutual funds 
pay investment advisors may be a relevant factor?

 MR. DONOVAN:  I think the Seventh Circuit 
made that comparison.  Judge Easterbrook did say that 
the services of institutional accounts ordinarily are 
different from mutual fund accounts.  I agree that in 
the first instance, the first comparator usually should 
be mutual funds, and regrettably Judge Easterbrook did 
not cite to the record for the reasons to identify those 
differences.  But it is in fact in the record, and there 
is no other record that suggests that they were the 
same.  All we had below was the assertion that on the 
one hand, an advisory contract for an institutional 
account said advisory services.  And in the other we had 
a mutual fund advisory contract that said advisory 
services.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When you say you 
should look at the range and how far it's off, do you 
mean that in the Gartenberg sense -- in other words, if 
it is way out of line, then you assume or can at least 
look further at whether there was a fair process?  Or do 
you mean it in the normal case, in sort of setting the 
rates you just look how far it is off.

MR. DONOVAN:  I look at it in the Gartenberg 

sense, Your Honor.  And the reason is because as I --
from what I said the first question is, is when do you 
ask courts to substitute their judgment?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's probably --

you're not the person to -- to ask, but do you 
understand the Solicitor General's position to be your 
understanding of the Gartenberg sense or something else?

 MR. DONOVAN:  I believe they interpret in 

the Gartenberg sense.  I think that the Solicitor 
General's position and the Respondent's, with respect to 
the standard that you ought to apply, is Gartenberg.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What do we do about 

Gartenberg?  That is to say, the key sentence you can 
read either way.  The key sentence could mean -- it just 
depends on tone of voice.  You must charge a fee that is 
not so disproportionately large that it bears no 
reasonable relationship to the services rendered and 
could not -- could not have been the product of 
arms-length bargaining.  Or you could say, look, it's 
unlawful where it's so large -- it doesn't -- where 
there is no reasonable relationship.  And if there is no 
reasonable relationship, how could it have been the 
product of arm's-length bargaining?

upside down.  I think they turned it upside down --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You object if we turn them 

upside down?

 MR. DONOVAN:  I think they turned them 

upside down for a reason, and the reason is 36(b)(1), 
which imposes the burden of proof upon --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I'm saying the tone, 

be a little careful here.

 MR. DONOVAN:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So we can say the substance 

is -- I'm just trying this out -- the substance is to 
look and see if it's reasonable, and if it's reasonable 
it certainly is the product of arm-length bargaining, if 
it's not reasonable, how could it be?  Got to get an 
answer to that, okay?  So, that way you see the tone is 
be careful, you are a judge, you are not a rate-setter. 
How's that?

 MR. DONOVAN:  I would accept the proposition 

that it is reasonable if it is outside of what could 
have been bargained at arm's length.  I think they 
turned it upside down the fact for the reason that the 
statute reverses the burden of proof and I think that 
they also acknowledge that it is a process-oriented 
thing for judges to do, because after all you are asking 
here a standard for judges to apply in a contested

situation that recognizes the responsibility of the 
board in the first instance.  That's what 36(b)(2) is 
all about.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would -- would you give us 

the citations of the parts of the record that you say 
render it unnecessary for us to remand for the lower 
court to consider a comparison with non- -- with 
institutional charges?

 MR. DONOVAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  I start at 
page 16a and 17a of the district court's opinion where 
at page 16a at the bottom the district court said the 
services supplied are different.  And --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  At 16a of the Joint 

Appendix you are talking about?

 MR. DONOVAN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor, the 

petition.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of the petition.
 MR. DONOVAN:  Correct, it's 16a of the 
petition, which is Judge Kocoras' opinion.  At the 
bottom of the page you will see that he said, the 
services Harris provided to institutional clients varied 
but in all events were more limited than those provided 
the funds.

 If you then go on to page 17, he goes 

through with respect to each of these three funds and

chronicles the fees they paid and by comparison the fees 
charged to institutional accounts with similar 
investment objectives.  The statement by the plaintiff, 
Petitioners here, that the fee charged was a 2X 
multiple, does not refer to that array of institutional 
accounts.  It takes one in order to make the comparison 
what it is.

 And then, Justice Scalia, I would then go to 

page 32a of the district court's opinion where he 
describes what appear to be disputed issues of fact. 
And what he said those dispute issues of fact were about 
were what the Petitioners claimed were flaws in the 
negotiation process, in substance, what they would have 
done had they been negotiating, rather than the 
trustees.  It is not a dispute about the ultimate test, 
was this fee so far out of bounds it could not have been 
reasonable.

 To be sure, throughout a record that is as 

large as this one, you could imagine the parties 
disputed lots of things.  What you could not fairly 
dispute is whether these fees, for these funds, using 
comparable funds and using institutional accounts, as 
Judge Kocoras did, were so far out of bounds, they could 
not have been fairly bargained, and if that is the test, 
there is no need for remand.

If, as I suggest and as the Solicitor 

General suggests, Gartenberg is the appropriate 
standard, Gartenberg is what the district court applied.
 This Court has to be sure, on occasion, and 
it is rare, both announce the test and apply it in the 
same circumstances.

 In circumstances where courts are looking 
for guidance on what the standard is and how to apply 
it, I suggest this is a case in which affirming what the 
district court did would be appropriate.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the 

petitioners' allegation that the investment adviser did 
not provide full and accurate information?  And they 
mention particularly concerning economies of scale, 
profitability, and several other matters, that what 
everybody agrees is necessary, full disclosure, had not 
occurred.

 Is that a disputed issue of fact or of 

further inquiry?

 MR. DONOVAN:  I don't think it is, Your 

Honor.  And, again, I would go back to what Judge 
Kocoras said on 32(a).

 There was absolutely suggestions in the 

record by the plaintiff that they would have negotiated 
differently, but, for example, with respect to

ostensible misrepresentations on -- among other things, 
profitability and the rest, this was because the 
plaintiffs' expert did an accounting and accounted for 
costs differently and said, had you accounted for costs 
and allocated them the way I did, you would have reached 
a negotiated result that was different.

 Well, that just isn't what happened.  That's 

why Judge Kocoras said, this goes to the integrity of 
the negotiation.  Would the negotiation have been 
different?

 The plaintiffs say, I would have done it 
differently, but that's all they said, and it's not a 
misrepresentation to say, I would have accounted for 
costs differently.

 Finally, I would -- the other question you 

asked is where in the record -- Justice Scalia, I'm 
sorry.  It's at page 161 and following, where the 
background of all the difference in fees and the 
difference in services is chronicled.

 You can tell, from the pull-out charts at 
page 171, what fee is charged for each of these mutual 
funds and what fee is charged for institutional 
accounts.

and say that a comparison to institutional accounts is

always required and may be dispositive and is always a 
fraction of what mutual fund charges and that judges are 
the, in the first instance, the ones to decide who is 
fair and reasonable or what is fair and reasonable, as 
opposed to directors, I suggest you consign 8,000 mutual 
funds to a trial.

 On this record, these were funds that had 

best in class performance for fees that were at or below 
industry averages.

 That is not a record upon which a reasonable 
person could conclude that the adviser has over-reached. 
That is at the heart of fiduciary duty.  I see my time 
is about to expire.

 Thank you, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Mr. Frederick, you have three minutes 

remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FREDERICK:  At this recording here did 
not make findings -- this was a summary judgment case, 
and in fact, the Court didn't find that the disputes 
were nonexistent.

 In fact, on page 30a, the district court 
said that the disputes were nonmaterial, and that's a

very important distinction because the joint appendix 
that you have before you contains a lot of evidence in 
which it is disputed whether or not these were similar 
services.

 The Harris manager on page 6 -- JA 650, the 
portfolio holdings of the funds, are very similar.  On 
512, the Harris fund manager testimony that, when he 
buys a stock, he buys it for all mutual funds and 
independent accounts, with the same investment 
objective.

 On 505 to 506, the Harris research director 

testimony that the managers of the mutual funds and 
independent accounts share equally all work done by the 
research department, and 513 to 514, that the Harris 
fund manager says all of our analysts do research for 
all of our clients.

 There is disputed evidence here as to what 

constitutes similarity, Justice Sotomayor, these are 
comparing apples to apples because the record indicates 
that there are separate contracts for the additional 
fees that they charge to the mutual funds for the 
additional services provided.

 We're simply talking about comparisons of 

money management, but --

correct, that these funds have better than average 
performance and lower than average fees?

 MR. FREDERICK:  In one small aspect of the 

damages period, that is correct, and after that was 
found, they had lower than average performance and 
higher than average fees, Mr. Chief Justice.  It's a 
damages period that encompasses several years.

 If I could go back to the point, though, 
about the fiduciary duty, what Judge Cardozo, when he 
was on the New York Court of Appeals, said, a fiduciary 
represents the punctilio of honor, and that is 
contrasted with the morals of the marketplace operating 
at arm's-length.

 It surely cannot be the case that, where you 

are dealing with a fiduciary duty -- which is a higher 
standard recognized in the law -- that you can charge 
twice as much as what you are obtaining at arm's-length 
for services that you are providing.

 The Gartenberg court, Justice Breyer, in 
fact, had the opposite language that you are averting 
to, and that is at page 694 F.2nd 928, where the Court 
said, "The test is essentially whether the fee schedule 
represents a charge within the range of what would have 
been negotiated at arm's-length in the light of all the 
surrounding circumstances."

JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought, by reversing 
that, picking out what the essence was, you would get 
pretty close to what you are arguing for, without 
getting into all this thing of whether it's just like a 
trustee or whether a lawyer should be a trustee or --
you know, there are a lot of questions here that could 
float around, of any language we use.

 MR. FREDERICK:  That's right.  The Second 

Circuit that went on to flip it and say, we had to prove 
a negative, which is not ordinarily what a plaintiff has 
to prove in any law case, by showing it -- it is so 
disproportionate it could not have been achieved at 
arm's-length, and that is where we think the court --
courts have gotten this wrong.
