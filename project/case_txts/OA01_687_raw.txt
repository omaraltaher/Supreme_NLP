CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 01-687, the United States v. Leonard Cotton, et


al.


Mr. Dreeben.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


This case is typical of many Federal drug


prosecutions that were tried before this Court's decision


in Apprendi v. New Jersey.  Respondents were indicted on a


superseding indictment that alleged a conspiracy to


distribute cocaine and cocaine base without alleging a


specific threshold quantity of drugs that were involved in


the offense. 


Respondents were convicted of that offense at


trial, and the evidence established at trial that the


offense involved well in excess of 50 grams of cocaine


base, the threshold quantity of drugs to authorize a


minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum sentence of


life imprisonment. 


At sentencing, as all parties expected, the


judge made findings of drug quantity and determined that

the quantities of drugs involved in the offense justified


a sentencing range up to life imprisonment and imposed


sentences on several respondents of life imprisonment and


others of 30 years imprisonment. 


Respondents made no objection to the judge's


procedure in determining drug quantity himself without a


jury trial determination on that issue or without an --


QUESTION:  Well, at -- at sentencing, is it --


it -- it's really not that much of a burden to just send


it back to the judge and tell him to do it right.  Suppose


he had sentenced under the wrong section or something like


that.  We'd just send it back. 


MR. DREEBEN:  The problem in this case, Justice


Kennedy, is that the court of appeals has held that the


omission of a drug quantity allegation from the indictment


is a jurisdictional error that always requires automatic


correction on plain error review regardless of the


strength of the evidence against respondents on the


question or on whether respondents had notice that they


would face an increased sentence as a result of enhanced


quantities of drug --


QUESTION:  Well, but -- but in order to test


that, I'm just asking -- it's not as if we have to have a


new trial.  In fact, I -- I doubt that you could have a


new trial unless everybody stipulated to it.

 MR. DREEBEN:  It's --


QUESTION:  All that happens is there's a new


sentencing hearing.  That -- that's not that big of a --


of -- a great a burden on the courts and on their


resources.  We don't have to have some huge trial.  It's


just a resentencing hearing. 


MR. DREEBEN:  What will happen if the -- this


Court affirms the judgment of the court of appeals is that


respondents will not be subject to the sentences that


Congress authorized and that the evidence unequivocally


showed in this case were justified. 


QUESTION:  You're not objecting to --


QUESTION:  Aren't we really just arguing about


-- are we really just arguing about retroactivity then? 


MR. DREEBEN:  In this case we're not arguing


about retroactivity.  What we're arguing about is plain


error.  Respondents never made a constitutional objection


in the district court to the procedure by which they were


sentenced.  They never even objected as a factual matter


to the proposition that their offenses involved 50 grams


of cocaine base or more, which is all that is required in


order to support a statutory increase in the sentence. 


And notwithstanding their failure to object, the court of


appeals concluded that plain error analysis always


requires vacation of the enhanced sentence, and the

Government does not get a chance to seek the enhanced


sentence on --


QUESTION:  Here, the -- the verdict of the jury


corresponded to the indictment, I take it.  It -- it


wasn't a case where the indictment failed to allege an


element of the offense which the jury found. 


MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct.  The indictment in


this case charged a complete offense under 21 U.S.C. 846,


the drug conspiracy --


QUESTION:  Except that under Apprendi, the --


the quantity may become an element, in effect.  This was


tried before Apprendi --


MR. DREEBEN:  Correct. 


QUESTION:  -- came down. 


MR. DREEBEN:  This case was tried before


Apprendi.


QUESTION:  If it had been tried after Apprendi


came down, there might, in fact, be a notice problem I


assume. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, absolutely, Justice O'Connor. 


Post Apprendi, the Government understands that it's its


obligation to include an allegation of drug quantity in


the indictment.  This case, which was tried pre Apprendi,


was done in a regime in which all parties understood that


an allegation in the indictment of a conspiracy offense,

with no specification of drug quantity, did not limit the


Government to proving increased quantities of cocaine


base.


QUESTION:  Well, for your position to prevail


here, do we have to overrule Ex parte Bain or somehow set


that aside, which seems to suggest that if it's not in the


indictment, it's a jurisdictional problem? 


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice O'Connor, this Court


already has overruled Ex parte Bain on its square holding,


which is that the narrowing of an indictment is


impermissible and deprives the court of jurisdiction.


QUESTION:  But the -- the Government can surely


also argue that Ex parte Bain by its terms doesn't


apply --


MR. DREEBEN:  Ex parte --


QUESTION:  -- to this case because the


indictment and the verdict corresponded, and that was


different from Ex parte Bain. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, that -- that is a difference


from Ex parte Bain, Chief Justice Rehnquist, but we don't


dispute that in this case, post Apprendi, there is an


error in the sense that drug quantity is treated as a


constitutional element. 


QUESTION:  Yes.  There can be an error but not a


matter of -- not going to a matter of jurisdiction.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Correct.  And the fundamental flaw


in Ex parte Bain was to treat a constitutional error


arising under the Fifth Amendment's Indictment Clause as


if it were a jurisdictional error.  And it's our


submission that the reason that the Court did that is


because at the time, in the 19th century, on habeas


corpus, relief was available only for jurisdictional


errors, which led this Court to treat a variety of


constitutional errors as though they were jurisdictional.


QUESTION:  Well, and because there was no right


of direct appeal.


MR. DREEBEN:  Correct.  So, the -- the result


was that a -- the Court had broadly characterized a


variety of constitutional errors as if they were


jurisdictional errors, but later decisions of this Court


make clear that the failure of an indictment to charge any


offense is not a jurisdictional error. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, you would like us to


make that clear, wouldn't you, because it isn't in our


cases so far, that that kind of error, whatever it is,


doesn't qualify as, quote, jurisdictional?


MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  We think


that the time is -- is right in this case to make it clear


that that's not a jurisdictional error.


QUESTION:  There -- there are many instances

where the Court has said that an error is -- that -- that


a requirement, certain requirement, is mandatory and


jurisdictional.  That word has been used in -- in many


different contexts.  And are you suggesting some approach


to the -- what is jurisdictional so that there won't be


this string of things that the label jurisdictional is


appended to? 


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, jurisdictional has been


appended as a label to a variety of kinds of errors, but


the relevant sense in which it's being invoked in this


case and in which the lower court understood it was a kind


of defect that may be raised at any time regardless of an


objection and that is tantamount to subject matter


jurisdiction, the sort of error that is so fundamental to


the proceedings that harmless error review and plain error


review simply don't apply. 


Now, the court of appeals in this case did, as a


formal matter, apply rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of


Criminal Procedure, the harmless error rule.  But it also


repeatedly stated that errors relating to the indictment


process are jurisdictional, and the failure of an


indictment to charge an offense violates a mandatory rule


and creates a jurisdictional error.  And that led to the


conclusion that this Court's precedents in Neder v. United


States and Johnson v. United States simply don't apply and

that the weight of the evidence against respondents in


this case and their possession of notice that they would


face increased sentences under the drug statute --


QUESTION:  May I ask what you rely on for the


notice proposition?


MR. DREEBEN:  In -- in the factual record --


QUESTION:  Are you relying on the general run of


cases or the fact there was a preceding indictment?


MR. DREEBEN:  In this case, Justice Stevens, we


rely most fundamentally on the fact that the state of the


law at the time of respondents' indictment was that all


defendants understood that notwithstanding the absence of


a --


QUESTION:  But you're not really relying on the


fact there had been a prior indictment that was withdrawn


and superseded. 


MR. DREEBEN:  We don't have to rely on that.  I


think the prior indictment makes clear that the Government


believed that this conspiracy --


QUESTION:  It believed at the time they filed


the prior indictment, but when they withdraw it and file a


second indictment, you normally would think they've


withdrawn the charges that have been withdrawn. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, not in view of the fact that


at the prevailing legal regime at the time --

 QUESTION:  That's a separate point, and I


understand that point.  But it seems to me you'd make that


point even if there had been no original indictment.


MR. DREEBEN:  I would.  And I think it's


important to underscore that the superseding indictment


didn't give the defendants the impression that the


Government was retreating in the scope of its proof.  To


the contrary, the superseding indictment expanded the


conspirators from 9 to 14.  It expanded the length of the


conspiracy --


QUESTION:  Yes, but it withdrew the quantity


allegation.


MR. DREEBEN:  It didn't withdraw all references


to quantity, Justice Stevens.  If you look at the


superseding indictment, it alleges that there were multi-


kilogram cocaine shipments and multi-kilogram --


QUESTION:  Well, I thought we were taking the


case on the assumption that the indictment did not charge


enough to get the sentences that they received.


MR. DREEBEN:  And that's correct.  But what --


QUESTION:  Whereas the earlier indictment did.


MR. DREEBEN:  The earlier indictment in terms


said this offense involves more than 50 grams of cocaine


base.  The later indictment didn't say that.  But if you


do read the allegations in the later indictment, it's

impossible that anyone could come away thinking that the


Government had narrowed the scope of the conspiracy it


intended to prove. 


And respondents didn't take it that way.  There


is information in the detention hearings of at least four


other respondents that indicates that they understood that


this was the kind of cocaine conspiracy -- cocaine base


conspiracy that, if proved, would expose them to a life


sentence.  They had a full opportunity to try to contest


that evidence if they wished to do so. 


What the respondents did instead was attempt to


say we weren't part of this --


QUESTION:  Let me just interrupt you by saying I


think it would be most unfortunate if we decided this case


on the particular fact that there was an original


indictment and a superseding indictment.  This was case


would mean nothing if that's all we have. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I don't think it would mean


nothing, Justice Stevens, but we are asking the Court to


rule on the broader ground that when an indictment fails


to allege what we now understand to be an element of the


offense, but the evidence is sufficiently powerful so that


any rational grand jury, if asked, would have found that.


QUESTION:  What does the -- what does the


Government's position do to the Stirone case?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Nothing, Chief Justice Rehnquist,


because Stirone was a case in which two features are


present that are not present here.  First of all, the


defendant in Stirone repeatedly objected to the broadening


of the indictment in that case.  There the indictment had


alleged that there was an effect on interstate commerce


from an extortion as a result of obstruction of commerce


in sand.  And the Government got to trial and attempted to


prove that the sand would have been used to build a steel


mill, the steel mill would have exported steel to other


States, and that was the effect on commerce that had been


obstructed.  The defendants vociferously objected, but the


judge allowed that to go to the jury.  So, that case is


not like this case, a plain error case.  It is a harmless


error case. 


And furthermore, the respondents -- or the --


the defendants in Stirone had a plausible claim that they


were deprived of notice of the kinds of charges that they


would actually face at trial; whereas in this case, there


is not a claim, a plausible claim, that the defendants did


not know that they would face an increased sentence if the


Government established that the crime involved more than


50 grams of cocaine base. 


QUESTION:  Can you tell me, post Apprendi in the


trial courts, can the defendant agree with the Government

to plead guilty but leave it to the judge to determine the


amounts of the drug involved? 


MR. DREEBEN:  It's a little unclear, Justice


Kennedy, whether the defendant can do that because


typically the Government has not acquiesced and the courts


have not been hospitable to partial pleas of guilty.  And


in effect, the defendant would be tendering a partial plea


to an aggravated drug offense and then asking the judge to


decide one element of the offense.  Under pre-Apprendi


law, that procedure would not be followed in any circuit.


Now, there have been some defendants who really


would be willing to plead to the underlying offense and


contest drug quantity, and I haven't had a chance to see


whether that has played out in the district courts with


any courts allowing that to happen. 


QUESTION:  And what does the Government do when


it indicts?  There's -- there's no stipulation of any


kind.  Does it have three or four counts and -- and it


alleges the -- the maximum amount and then -- and then a


smaller amount and then another amount?  Three different


counts? 


MR. DREEBEN:  No, Justice Kennedy.  We allege


the amount of threshold quantity of drugs that we believe


we can prove at trial.  If the trial evidence then


establishes that a rational jury could find guilt on the

underlying offense but still have a doubt about drug


quantity, then the Government would be entitled to a


lesser included offense.


QUESTION:  Lesser included offense.


MR. DREEBEN:  Correct.  And -- and the lower


courts have understood that that's the appropriate


analysis in a case like that. 


QUESTION:  I guess part of the problem in this


case is that if we say that defendants are entitled to the


benefit of a change in the law before their conviction


becomes final, there's not much you can do because you'd


have to issue a superseding indictment and you can't do


that.


MR. DREEBEN:  We can't do it in this case,


Justice Kennedy, which is why, in effect, the result that


the court of appeals achieved is a tremendous windfall for


the defendants.  They never raised a constitutional


objection at trial.  They never contested the amount of


drugs involved in the offense.  The statute clearly


authorizes a life term for the conduct that was proved,


and the evidence supports that --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I don't know they'd


object.  Does he stand up during the prosecution's case


and say, well, we just want you to know that you're not


doing a very good job of proving the amounts?  I mean,

what's -- what's he supposed to do?  That -- that -- I


don't understand when the objection would take place.


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the objection could take


place at trial when a defendant could have said the


Government has to prove this quantity up to the jury or it


could --


QUESTION:  No, but it -- it doesn't.  I mean,


the -- the point at which the -- the failure to indict and


allege on quantity becomes objectionable is at sentencing.


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, that's --


QUESTION:  So, there would be no reason to.


MR. DREEBEN:  That was just what I was about to


say, Justice Souter.  The -- the most pertinent time for


the defendant to object would be at sentencing, and there


are defendants who raise the kind of constitutional


objection that this Court alluded to in the Jones decision


in 1999 and later accepted in the Apprendi decision in the


year 2000.  There were defendants who raised that


constitutional objection, and they are entitled to the


benefit of harmless error review.  Those defendants who do


not raise that constitutional claim are subject to plain


error review.  And this Court has repeatedly recognized


that even the type of error that might entitle a defendant


to reversal on harmless error review, regardless of the


strength of the evidence, does not automatically entitle

the defendant to relief on plain error review. 


In Johnson v. United States, this Court


considered a very analogous type of error.  There the


trial court convicted the defendant of a perjury offense


without sending materiality to the petty jury.  So, there


was no petty jury determination of materiality.  The


defendant made no objection to that, and on appeal, this


Court held that the appropriate standard is plain error


review because the defendant had never objected.  And when


the evidence is overwhelming and uncontestable -- and


uncontested at trial, the Court concluded that it is


affirmance that supports the integrity of the judicial


system rather than reversal. 


QUESTION:  The prejudice to you is that you


cannot reindict, but the objection would be irrelevant to


that.


MR. DREEBEN:  The objection --


QUESTION:  So, I mean --


MR. DREEBEN:  The objection would not be


irrelevant because -- for two different reasons.  First of


all, the -- the defendant, had he objected at the


pertinent time and had the Government concluded that this


was an objection that we should worry about, could have


sought indictments on other counts relating to substantive


drug violations if it believed that the sentence that it

position today because it's the year 2002, and the statute


of limitations will have run on many other drug offenses


that we might have brought. 


QUESTION:  Oh, you mean you could have just hit


him with another -- hit the defendants with another


indictment in another case without a double jeopardy


problem. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, any -- a substantive drug


count is a separate offense from a conspiracy offense. 


This Court has held that in Felix v. United States and


reaffirmed it more broadly in United States v. Dixon.  So,


there would have been no double jeopardy objection.


But the Government is no longer in the position


where we can extricate ourselves from the -- the dilemma


that the court of appeals has placed us in.  These


defendants will not receive the sentence that the


sentencing guidelines called for and that the statute


authorizes.  And the fact that they did not make a timely


objection puts them in a very different position than a


defendant would be who had timely objected. 


QUESTION:  The difference is --


QUESTION:  The actual difference, as a practical


matter, is between life -- a life sentence and 20 years. 


Right?

 MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.  That's right. 


QUESTION:  And that, Mr. Dreeben, seems to me a


substantial difference.  So, I follow your argument at the


-- the very last step in a plain error analysis, but you


seem to stop short of that and you said there wasn't any


substantial difference.  And I think that that's


troublesome because the disparity in sentencing is large.


MR. DREEBEN:  The disparity in sentencing is


large both from the Government's point of view and from


the defendant's point of view.  The way that the


Government looks at this question is would the defendant


have gotten the same sentence if he had been accorded the


procedures that he now claims that he should have been


given.  If the Government had understood that it had to


obtain an indictment that mentioned drug quantity and it


had understood that the Constitution required the jury,


not the judge, to make that finding, would the defendant


be better off or the same off? 


That is exactly the kind of analysis that the


Court used in Johnson v. United States and Neder v. United


States.  It looked at whether the -- the availability of


the procedure that the defendant has been deprived of


would have made a difference to him.  Of course, it would


make a difference to him if he could have compelled the


sentencing judge to drop down to 20 years as a result of

the Government's failure to put drug quantity in the


indictment, and that's what would happen today if this


case were unfolding in a post-Apprendi world. 


But in a pre-Apprendi world, particularly where


the defendant didn't object, it makes more sense to look


at the problem as one of a deprivation of procedure and to


ask whether the possession of the procedure would have --


QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, can I ask you this


question?  I understand it's not this case, but would the


Government -- what -- what would the Government's position


be if the evidence of quantity came out after the trial


was concluded just as a result of a pre-sentence


investigation and then a finding by the judge?  What would


-- what should happen in that kind of case? 


MR. DREEBEN:  In that kind of case, our position


would be the same, that particularly on plain error


review, the Court should look to the entire --


QUESTION:  Even though the evidence was not


before the jury.


MR. DREEBEN:  Right, even though --


QUESTION:  Because Neder wouldn't apply to that.


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, it's not clear that -- that


Neder wouldn't apply to it.  It's true that in Neder


itself, the Government proved up all of the evidence


relevant to materiality at the trial.  But in many cases,

that were tried --


QUESTION:  But you would take the same position


even if all the evidence developed post-trial during the


pre-sentence investigation.


MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.  We would.  But, as


Your Honor has indicated, the Court wouldn't have to agree


with that in order to sustain in this case. 


And this case is the far more typical one in


which the grand jury investigation itself developed


substantial evidence of drug quantity.  Everybody knew


that before the trial, and the trial evidence itself is


where the evidence of drug quantity was adduced.


QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, I -- I'm not sure I --


you say we should determine whether substantial rights


have been affected by -- by asking whether if the


procedure that has been omitted had not been omitted, he


would have been -- he would have been convicted anyway.  I


-- I just -- that -- that seems to me extravagant.  I


mean, that -- that would mean that if there were no


indictment at all, you just go to the jury without an


indictment and the jury convicts him of murder, you could


come in and say, well, his substantial rights weren't


affected because had there been a murder indictment, there


was plenty of evidence to -- to convict him of murder.  Is


-- is that the position the Government's taking?

 MR. DREEBEN:  No, it's not the position that


we're taking, Justice Scalia.  And the logic of -- of the


Government's position in this case doesn't have to go to a


total omission of any grand jury indictment at all.  Just


as in Neder, the Court made perfectly clear that although


harmless error analysis would apply to the omission of an


element, it would not apply to a directed verdict --


QUESTION:  No, but my -- my point is it seems to


me the way you decide whether substantial rights have been


affected is not to ask the question would he -- would he


have been convicted anyway.  Even though he would have


been convicted anyway, in some cases you simply say there


was no indictment.  His substantial rights were affected. 


Period. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, there -- there is a class of


cases in which the Court will find an effect on


substantial rights without regard to the strength of the


evidence. 


QUESTION:  I don't think so. 


MR. DREEBEN:  And those cases are called


structural error cases.  And as the Court is well aware,


that's a very narrow category.  It was hotly debated in


the Neder case whether structural error did apply to the


petty jury's failure to decide an element to the offense,


and the Court held that it was not a case of structural

error. 


Even the dissenting view in Neder, however,


recognized that when there wasn't an objection at trial


and the case comes up on plain error review and the Court


might find an effect on substantial rights, it's still not


required to reverse.  It applies the -- the test that was


articulated in United States v. Olano and in Johnson v.


United States, was there an effect on the fairness,


integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.


QUESTION:  It seems to me that's the step that


you -- that you should put your -- your emphasis on in


this case, not the -- not the substantial right.


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, that's all the Court needs


to hold in order to conclude that the court of appeals


erred in this case because the court of appeals in this


case got to the fourth step of plain error review, after


finding an effect on substantial rights, and then it held


that we really can't say what the grand jury would have


done.  We're not permitted to speculate about that because


the grand jury is a body that operates without any legal


restrictions at all on whether it can charge or not.


That proposition that the grand jury is


essentially free to charge or not, regardless of the


evidence, is inconsistent with the historical record of


the way grand juries operated.  The charges that were

given by members of this Court sitting on circuit in the


early years of this Nation made clear that grand juries


had a duty to indict when there was probable cause to


believe that an offense had been committed.  And the grand


jurors' oath similarly reflected that grand jurors should


indict when the evidence justifies that. 


QUESTION:  Yes, but can I just give you sort of


an intermediate hypothetical?  Supposing all the evidence


of quantity developed after the grand jury had returned


its indictment that it developed, but in the plea


bargaining they found out how much drug there really was


involved, you'd treat that as the same case even though


the grand jury could not have indicted. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, if that case took place, as


this one did, in a legal regime in which the Government


didn't believe it had to get a grand jury indictment on


the point, then I suppose my answer to that is if we had


known, we could have gone back to the grand jury and


gotten a superseding --


QUESTION:  No.  But you didn't know the evidence


at the time is what I'm saying. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Oh, we could have gotten a


superseding indictment. 


QUESTION:  Oh, I see.  Okay. 


MR. DREEBEN:  And -- and that's what's odd about

this case.  All parties in this case proceeded on the


theory that it wasn't necessary to go to the grand jury,


and that's the explanation on this record for why there's


nothing --


QUESTION:  Well, except that the defendant


doesn't have to proceed on any theory.  It's your


prosecution.


MR. DREEBEN:  That's true, but the defendant on


this case proceeded on the same theory as we did.  The


defendant never objected.  The defendant never believed


that there was a contest as to the amount of drug quantity


in question that increased the sentence.  And the result


is that the entire sentencing proceeding unfolded with all


parties fully well understanding that the legal regime in


place at the time meant that drug quantity did not have to


be charged in the indictment. 


And the proposition that a grand jury is free to


reject the evidence of drug quantity and determine itself


that it just doesn't want to charge the greater offense


would be fundamentally at odds with the democratic system


in this country.  Congress has voted a regime in which


drug quantity can increase the penalties.  The evidence in


this case established to the satisfaction of the


Government that those increased quantities were there, and


therefore the increased penalties should be applied.

 QUESTION:  Of course, if we see it your way, it


would be open to prosecutors all the time simply to make


the grand jury proceeding a short-cut and not bother to


get into quantity and, hence, not, in -- in effect, advise


the -- the grand jury that it's -- that it's going for


something that might have the -- the potential for life.


And even in a post-Apprendi regime, I suppose you could


say, well, it was harmless error because the -- the


quantity -- the -- the evidence of quantity was there and


therefore we -- we shouldn't regard it as structural and


we should overlook it. 


MR. DREEBEN:  You could make that argument,


Justice Souter, but in a post-Apprendi environment,


Apprendi is a sufficiently well-known decision of this


Court that no prosecutor would responsibly go to


sentencing and say I would like to have an increased


sentence regardless of the fact that we didn't charge drug


quantity.  And it's hard for me to imagine that there are


defendants or judges that wouldn't catch the error if the


prosecutor didn't itself bring it to the attention of a


court.


QUESTION:  How about in this case?  If -- if the


standard were harmless error rather than plain error,


would you maintain that the Government should still


prevail?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we would


because of reasoning analogous to -- the Court used in


Neder v. United States.  The underlying values of the


right in question are not impaired.  The evidence was so


strong that no rational grand jury could have failed to


find the increased drug quantity and the defendants were


not deprived of notice and an opportunity to contest it. 


So, even though there was error, the error has to be


weighed against the important values of essentially


depriving society and the Government of the sentence that


Congress prescribed for the kind of offense in question. 


And weighing those against each other, the conclusion


should be that the court of appeals should affirm rather


than reverse. 


QUESTION:  But the Court could well conclude


otherwise were the test harmless error and you could still


prevail.


MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct.  And most of the


cases that we are dealing with in this transitional era of


drug prosecutions that were tried before Apprendi but are


now on appeal after Apprendi, do not involve objections by


the defendant in the trial court.  They are almost all


plain error cases, and a ruling on the fourth prong of


plain error analysis that concludes that in this scenario


it doesn't offend the integrity and public reputation of

judicial proceedings or their fairness to affirm rather


than reverse would be a outcome that would resolve almost


all of the litigation that has occurred in this area.


If the Court has no further questions, I'll


reserve the remainder of my time. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Dreeben.


Mr. Sullivan, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY J. SULLIVAN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. SULLIVAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


I'd like to direct my first comment to the


question that the Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice asked about


didn't the indictment and the verdict correspond.  Mr.


Chief Justice, you're exactly correct.  The problem is


that the sentence didn't correspond.  And these defendants


were on notice for what later turned out to be a (b)(1)(C)


drug case that had a 20-year statutory maximum and they


ended up receiving a life sentence.


QUESTION:  I think my point was that Bain


involved a situation where the verdict and the indictment


didn't correspond, and that a rule that says that's


jurisdictional might not extend to this situation.


MR. SULLIVAN:  The issue with jurisdictional is


twofold in this case.  One deals with the Court's

sentencing jurisprudence, which goes back all the way to


In re Bonner, which is essentially unchallenged by the


Government, which sets the proposition that any excess


sentence beyond the statutory maximum is void. 


And that was at the heart of Apprendi.  And


Apprendi says and recognizes that a district court judge,


like Judge Blake in Baltimore, was limited necessarily at


her outer limits with what's charged in the indictment and


what's found by the petit jury.  A district court does not


have a sense of roving jurisdiction under 3231.  If a


defendant comes into that courtroom charged by the grand


jury with a specific offense, that sentence must be


rendered for that specific offense.


QUESTION:  In re Bonner was one of those old


habeas cases. 


MR. SULLIVAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, I don't


believe that a -- a case that's old somehow loses its


force after Apprendi.


QUESTION:  Well, but I -- I think you have to


recognize that the Court at that time, because there was


no direct appeal, kind of expanded the concept of


jurisdiction to reach constitutional error.


MR. SULLIVAN:  And I think that is exactly what


the Apprendi Court and the majority is restricting now is


-- is that -- that exact caution of the Court.  Until -- I

-- I don't think that when a defendant goes into court and


has notice that he's charged -- let me just back up to say


this. 


The rule of law in this case is much more


important than what happens to these defendants.  As


Justice Kennedy pointed out, all we were challenging is


the illegal sentence in this case.  We're not challenging


the conviction.  We were convicted of a 21(b)(1)(C)


offense.  We recognize that.  We recognize the court had


jurisdiction over the offense.  We recognize that the


court had jurisdiction over our defendants or our clients. 


What we challenge is the illegality of the sentence.


QUESTION:  Well, that's all, but I mean, that's


-- that's pretty big.  Your -- your clients were -- were


convicted, if you accept the Government's case, of being


drug kingpins, of running and managing a massive drug


operation, and -- and you say all we're asking is that


they be given the same sentence as a mule who was just


somebody, you know, carrying a -- a small amount of drugs. 


I don't consider that an insignificant difference. 


MR. SULLIVAN:  Justice Scalia, the burden is


upon the Government in their prosecution to indict the


appropriate offense.  I disagree with my friend, Mr.


Dreeben, that somehow the error solely belongs to us.  The


genesis of the error is the Government's failure to indict

drug quantity. 


QUESTION:  Well, I think he might concede that


your -- you're both equally at fault, but that -- but that


doesn't get you all the way. 


You began by saying that this later became a (b)


case, and that's the problem.  It was tried on -- on a


pre-Apprendi assumptions. 


MR. SULLIVAN:  Much like Neder, Justice Kennedy,


this case is the product of a laboratory test tube.  I


acknowledge that, and the propositions and the fundamental


beliefs that all of us went into the trial with are far


different because none of us could ever imagine that the


Apprendi case was forthcoming.  Both Jones and Apprendi


were decided while this case was on direct appeal.  So, I


don't see how we could forfeit an error that we could


never even imagine would -- would result in --


QUESTION:  Now, wait, wait, wait.  It wasn't


that much of a bolt from the blue. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Nobody could imagine Apprendi?


QUESTION:  The dissenters couldn't imagine it.


(Laughter.) 


MR. SULLIVAN:  Justice Scalia, let me -- as a


trial attorney, let me just --


QUESTION:  I mean, Apprendi was -- was based on,

I assume, the long common law tradition.  There had been


Almandarez-Torres before.  Was -- was that decided before


this case was tried? 


MR. SULLIVAN:  I don't know the answer to that.


QUESTION:  I think it was.  And -- and that case


made abundantly clear that there was a big problem even --


even with respect to the proof of -- of prior offenses for


recidivism, in -- incremental sentences. 


So, you know, both out of the blue?  No, no, no,


no, no.


MR. SULLIVAN:  Perhaps I overstated --


QUESTION:  No, I don't think you did. 


MR. SULLIVAN:  Right. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. SULLIVAN:  In -- in -- my point is simple,


Justice Scalia, is that in pre-Apprendi practice, the --


the Fourth Circuit made it abundantly clear to defense


attorneys and to Government attorneys that we were not to


concern ourselves with sentencing factors of drug quantity


at the time of sentencing.


QUESTION:  Did some defense attorneys make the


objection for the record in any case?  I'm thinking back


in the old days when there was jury discrimination and the


courts routinely said no, but many defense attorneys,


knowing they were going to lose on it, made it for the

record anyway, hoping that their case on appeal would be


the one that changed the law? 


MR. SULLIVAN:  Justice Ginsburg, I'm sure there


are attorneys who did that.  That was not done in -- in


our case.  We challenged drug quantity in the typical pre-


Apprendi way under the sentencing guidelines. 


I'm reminded that in Johnson, this Court


indicated that sometimes defense attorneys aren't expected


to make laundry lists of objections, and I would dare


suggest that many of the judges that I appear in front of


would not be too welcoming of my trying to speculate what


this body would do two or three terms from now. 


So, I don't think that -- I'm sure that there


are attorneys throughout the country who were making these


types of objections, sensing the change from McMillan and


Almandarez-Torres, sensing the direction of this Court,


but we -- we did not.


QUESTION:  That's -- I -- I'll take that as a


given.  I'll say, yes, it is a surprise.  I couldn't


expect you to -- to object to all these things. 


But in terms of recognizing plain error, where


I'm having a problem is I don't see how you could treat


the grand jury any differently from the trial.  That is to


say, if you have a trial and there is a failure to object,


what we've said in our cases is it's not plain error

unless it's very unusual circumstances. 


Now, whatever those unusual circumstances are,


if they're present here, it should be both, and if they're


not present here, how could you possibly say that a person


who goes through a full trial and it has the defect can't


object, but a person who's had that defect at the grand


jury stage, but it's cured at the trial stage, could


object?  I just don't see how a system could function that


way. 


MR. SULLIVAN:  Justice Breyer, my -- my answer


is that it all goes back to the Indictment Clause of the


Fifth Amendment and to the jurisdictional end-run that


Justice Souter was alluding to.  The -- you can't guess or


speculate -- no court, most respectfully this Court or any


other reviewing court, can't guess what the grand jury


would have, could have, or should have done.


QUESTION:  But we face many, many cases in which


the normal tendency of the courts has been to say, forget


about errors at the grand jury stage.  If you're suddenly


going to recognize this as an error at the grand jury


stage, when it's cured at the trial stage, well, why


wouldn't that throw open the doors for all kinds of


challenges of grand jury proceedings?


MR. SULLIVAN:  Justice Breyer, Mechanik and Nova


Scotia were not -- were not constitutional rules.  They

were procedural rules under rule 6, which had a trial that


followed through and the court could -- had a record, and


the court could look at the record to see if the grand


jury problem affected the validity of the trial. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Sullivan, I have the same problem


that Justice Breyer has.  I didn't -- you know, I didn't


agree with -- with Neder, but -- but given Neder, you say


we cannot second guess what the grand jury would have,


could have, should have done.  But Neder says we can


second guess what the petty jury would have, could have,


should have done.  And why -- why is second guessing the


one any -- any worse than second guessing the other?


MR. SULLIVAN:  I think it goes back to the


historical function of the -- the grand jury, Justice


Scalia, and the fact that what happens to the grand jury


is absolutely --


QUESTION:  Is it any greater than the historical


function of the -- of the petty jury? 


MR. SULLIVAN:  The petty jury is an -- is the


product of an adversarial process where a judge acts as a


referee and the law is well defined and the evidence is


well known.  And the judge sits there and makes


determinations.  So, there's a certain sense of


reliability to entire trial process. 


We don't have that given the secrecy of the

grand jury, the fact that no matter how many times I knock


on the door to be asked to enter the grand jury, the


Government will not let me or my client --


QUESTION:  But the defendant could certainly


waive a grand jury.


MR. SULLIVAN:  A defendant can certainly waive a


grand jury and proceed by information.  But just if a --


if a defendant chooses to waive the grand jury and go by


information, that doesn't mean that they can be sentenced


for a crime that they don't waive the indictment for.  So,


for example, if a defendant waives jurisdiction on an 841


case and allows to go by indictment and --


QUESTION:  What -- what do you mean when you say


waived jurisdiction?


MR. SULLIVAN:  I don't mean waive jurisdiction,


Your Honor.  I meant waive -- waive indictment and -- and


go by an information. 


You can only be sentenced for the crime that


you've waived for, that you've knowingly and intelligently


waived for.  You can't be sentenced for another crime.


QUESTION:  Well, but the idea that you can waive


a grand jury suggests that perhaps it is no -- certainly


no higher than the -- the petty jury right.  And it was


argued, you know, when the idea of harmless of error first


began to be applied, how can we possibly second guess what

a jury would have done here.  Well, the answer was that in


many cases you can.  If the evidence is overwhelming, you


can. 


MR. SULLIVAN:  And following up on that, Mr.


Chief Justice, I don't agree that the evidence in this


case, despite Mr. Dreeben's articulation, was that


overwhelming.  One of the defendants in the trial court


were acquitted, Roger Evans.  And I would suggest that now


in a post-Apprendi practice, we would do things a lot


differently attacking drug quantity that we never did when


it was a detectable amount because no one ever had to


worry about it. 


QUESTION:  Mr. Sullivan, you -- the fact that


one defendant was acquitted I'm not sure is -- is


relevant.  If the jury believed the testimony that was


necessary to support the verdict, I understand the


Government to be arguing they must have been describing


transactions in amounts that would qualify them for the


sentence they had.  Do you disagree with that proposition?


I thought we were sort of assuming -- if I'm


wrong, tell me -- that it was a case in which the -- if


you believed the Government's evidence, as the jury did,


you would necessarily have -- had also believed there was


more than the quantity to change the -- the guidelines


range.

 MR. SULLIVAN:  I -- well, I can't argue with


that.  I think that's a mathematical, you know,


formulation, but I agree that -- what I would suggest is


that what the Fourth Circuit said which is that the


quantum of evidence is irrelevant when the problem stems


from a defect in the indictment from the very beginning


But I would suggest, Justice Stevens, that now


in the post-Apprendi environment, defense attorneys are


taking a much different strategy and not giving up or --


or just resting on drug quantity or challenging drug


quantity, challenging the laboratories, challenging the


weights of the drugs, distancing ourselves like we would


normally do in conspiracy cases farther away from clients


who are holding heavy amounts of drugs because we now know


that drug quantity is -- is very important. 


QUESTION:  It was an issue before the judge


before, wasn't it? 


QUESTION:  You had every incentive to do that


before, too.  I find that peculiar.  I mean, surely it


made a difference before. 


MR. SULLIVAN:  A detectable amount -- when --


when you're charged with a detectable amount, it doesn't


behoove you, as a -- as an attorney, to challenge a


detectable amount.  It's almost a impossible task.  Any


amount is detectable.

 QUESTION:  But you would before the judge.  It's


just a question now you do it before the jury, but you


made the same kind of attacks.  It was still the


difference between 20 years and life. 


MR. SULLIVAN:  And -- and the problem is,


Justice Ginsburg, that under Apprendi Judge Blake -- she


was the wrong judge applying the wrong standard of proof.


She was the wrong fact finder and the wrong standard of


proof. 


QUESTION:  I guess that's your point.  I guess


that's a fair point that there's -- there is more of an


incentive to raise it before the jury because the jury has


to find it beyond a reasonable doubt.  And therefore, your


chances of -- of winning a -- a contest of the amount


before the jury are much better than your chances of


winning one before the judge. 


MR. SULLIVAN:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  Which is what Apprendi was all about,


I assume. 


QUESTION:  But -- but if we said we want to send


this back so that you can have the advantage of Apprendi,


there's nothing the Government can do because it can't


reindict. 


MR. SULLIVAN:  The Government cannot -- I take


the position, Justice Kennedy, that the -- that the

Government cannot reindict on double jeopardy grounds, but


our clients would still receive 20-year sentences in the


Bureau of Prisons. 


QUESTION:  I -- I understand that.  But assume,


as the courts of appeals uniformly seemed to have held,


that Apprendi is not retroactive to convictions that are


final, and assume that the Government can protect itself


in a post-Apprendi world.  What we're talking about is


this narrow line of cases where you seem to have an -- an


automatic escape hatch and the Government can't retry.


MR. SULLIVAN:  And I find that fantastic because


it's usually the other way around. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. SULLIVAN:  That -- the rule of law -- I


mean, sometimes you -- you roll the dice and sometimes the


defense wins and oftentimes the Government wins, Justice


Kennedy.  And perhaps the results in this case are not


palatable to some -- to some people.  But in this case --


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. -- Mr. Sullivan, in light


of the Johnson case and the Neder case, I think the


Government has a very strong argument here.  I mean, you


-- you could fail under Johnson to include an element in


the jury instructions and, nonetheless, conclude that it


was not plain error.


MR. SULLIVAN:  Judge Blake instructed the jury,

the petit jury, that drug quantity was not a concern of


the court -- I mean, concern of the jury.  In Neder and


Johnson, Justice O'Connor, again there -- there was a


trial.  There was an adversarial process.  And we don't


know to this very date, quite frankly, whether the grand


jury was ever asked to make a determination on drug


quantity in the superseding indictment, and that's the


problem. 


In Neder and Johnson, there was a record.  There


was a great record that this Court could apply the


appropriate test.  You can't do that in this case, in the


Cotton case, because there is no complete record for this


Court to go back and basically usurp the responsibilities


of the indictment because we don't know whether on a


certain date the Government brought in their witnesses to


establish drug quantity.  We simply don't know that in


this case, and I think that is the fundamental difference


that distinguishes the line of cases of Neder and Johnson


that go to trial problems as opposed to indictment


problems. 


QUESTION:  Under the first indictment, would the


jury have been instructed that it had to find the amounts?


MR. SULLIVAN:  I think in pre-Apprendi practice,


no.  I think there was -- the instruction from the judge


that drug quantities are not your concern would have been

the judge's instructions at that point. 


QUESTION:  You said that some people might


differ about this particular case and maybe this time it's


roll of the dice.  But the last part of the plain error


test is just that.  Is this something that's fundamentally


unfair that will affect the reputation of the courts?  And


it seems to me that what you just told us goes against any


such finding. 


MR. SULLIVAN:  Justice Ginsburg, I had -- the


Olano test is quite clear that you don't -- well, that a


decision on a basic right that is forfeited doesn't matter


on -- if somebody is innocent or guilty.  It's much


stronger and much more important than that. 


I do suggest, most respectfully, that the


integrity of the court under the fourth Olano prong would


be impaired if the -- the decision is that you can be


indicted for one offense and convicted for another


offense, that that's why the fairness and the integrity of


the judicial proceedings comes into question.  The very


integrity of the court, the power of the court to do the


most -- one of the most important things to a person who's


charged with a crime -- oftentimes people don't care what


they're charged with.


QUESTION:  In -- in a transition case, in -- in


a case where the -- the law was -- was in flux, this would

not be a determination -- a plain error determination


wouldn't be that routinely this kind of omission could


occur.


MR. SULLIVAN:  I think this is the exception


rather than the rule.  That's correct.


QUESTION:  I thought that the -- the lack of


conformity between the indictment and the conviction is


not in this case.  You said --


MR. SULLIVAN:  No.  It's --


QUESTION:  -- you can be indicted for one


offense and convicted of another.  That's -- that's not in


this case, is it?  It's just a question of whether the


grand jury decided upon what was in the indictment.


MR. SULLIVAN:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  Okay. 


QUESTION:  What was the defense?


MR. SULLIVAN:  I'm sorry. 


QUESTION:  What was the defense at trial?


MR. SULLIVAN:  Justice Breyer, in this multi-


defendant 846 conspiracy, the defense was one part that


the Government cooperators lacked credibility, that they


weren't reliable.  It was one part attacking the Baltimore


City Police Department.  This is what we call a historical


case.  It was a series of arrests that the Government put


together at the end and made it into a conspiracy.

 QUESTION:  I mean, was it basically they didn't


do it?


MR. SULLIVAN:  It was that and there was also


multiple conspiracies.  The judge instructed the jury on


multiple --


QUESTION:  I just wonder on the harmless part or


whether it's harmful.  If they were arguing, well, we


didn't do it, is it likely that they would have presented


to the jury evidence that even though we didn't do it, the


amount involved was only 500 grams or less and not more?


MR. SULLIVAN:  I -- I don't think that that --


that that would have been -- you never use drug quantities


as a defense. 


QUESTION:  All right.  So, that's -- that -- you


see the reason -- the reason that I say that is because


they're saying, look, this error is harmless, and part of


the strength of your claim I think is that they never


could have thought of it at the trial before Apprendi to


raise it. 


But if it is harmless and you're really arguing


for us to make an exception from Neder, as well as the


grand jury, I wonder if there's any response to the view I


just stated.  I mean, that it was harmless. 


MR. SULLIVAN:  I don't think it can be harmless,


Justice Breyer, because the very thrust of Neder, the very

thrust of harmless error analysis is the Government must


prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error didn't


affect substantial rights.  And I don't know how the


Government could make that burden of proof in this case --


QUESTION:  Well, in Neder, didn't the Court


assume that substantial rights were affected? 


MR. SULLIVAN:  I think -- I think --


QUESTION:  I think in either Neder or Johnson,


it did.  I forget which one it is. 


And then -- so they went to the fourth prong and


said, you know, even assuming substantial rights are


affected, you know, this -- this is not going to reflect


on the integrity of the -- the court system or whatever


the fourth prong reads. 


MR. SULLIVAN:  That -- I think you're obviously


correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think the important


thing too about Neder is that the Court was -- was


convinced -- I think part of its position was that the


correct standard of proof that the district judge on the


materiality element found it by -- beyond a reasonable


doubt.  So, I think that we don't have a problem with a


mishmash of different standards of proof like we do in


this case here where -- where some elements of the


indictment are found beyond a reasonable doubt and some


elements are found by a preponderance of the evidence and

you have different fact finders performing -- performing


different functions. 


QUESTION:  What I was trying to direct your


attention to, which is -- and maybe this doesn't help you. 


But I thought that Neder -- and I'd have to reread it to


be sure -- was saying the omission of an element doesn't


always automatically mean no clear error, but it might


sometimes.  And so, I guess if it might sometimes, maybe


this is one of those unusual cases or exceptional cases


where it would.  But if so, your clients must have been


treated very fairly -- unfairly and the criminal justice


system must have suffered in its reputation.  Now, you


might have something to say on that point, and I wanted to


be sure you did if you do.


MR. SULLIVAN:  And my point is, Justice Breyer,


that I agree with the premise of your question and my


answer would be that Neder and that harmless error rule


enunciated there would be utterly meaningless in this case


because there's no object and no gap that any reviewing


court could fill because we don't know and we will never


know what happened in front of the grand jury when that


element was not returned. 


And it's precisely that no object to scrutinize


for harmless, which you'll never have in a trial for the


most part because of the adversarial process, because of

the judge refereeing what goes on -- there's a reliability


factor there.  There's not that reliability factor before


the grand jury.


QUESTION:  Well, but if you're right in that,


then Mechanik was wrongly decided.


MR. SULLIVAN:  I -- I don't believe that


Mechanik was wrongly decided, Mr. Chief Justice.  Mechanik


was not a constitutional issue.  It was -- it was a --


more of a procedural issue --


QUESTION:  But it said that, you know, you can't


attack the indictment rendered by the grand jury even


though you might have some -- some reason to do so.


MR. SULLIVAN:  That's correct, but there was


never a challenge to the validity of the indictment -- the


indictment itself in Mechanik, which is the root of our


contention here.  The Mechanik indictment was concededly


free of error.  I think that's what the Court -- what the


Court found to be a very important distinction.  And that


-- we don't have that in this case.  The indictment is the


cause of -- of our problems in this case.  So, I think


Mechanik is -- is distinguishable, and the Court did apply


harmless error in Mechanik but found that it didn't rise


to the level to -- to challenge the structural integrity


of -- of the grand jury process itself. 


QUESTION:  May I go back to your argument that

you made a second ago that we never know what the grand


jury would have done if it had been presented with the


evidence?  The difficulty that I have with that argument


is, number one, I think we have a pretty clear body of law


that tells the grand jury what its duty is, if it is


presented with evidence which would justify an indictment


with respect to quantity and hence the severity of the


crime. 


And if we're going to respect that law on duty,


then in order to see it your way, we have to say, well,


regardless of what the grand jury's duty is and regardless


of what the probability is that it would indict and -- and


would specify the quantity, we have to assume that there's


a wild card element in the grand jury.  And on the basis


of that wild card element, you never absolutely know what


they're going to do.  We are -- we are going to hold that,


in fact, you can never assess the harmfulness of the


error.


How do we get to the point of dispensing with


our law on grand jury duty and emphasizing the wild card


element, in effect, of the grand jury when it refuses to


follow that obligation?  How -- how are we able to do


that?


MR. SULLIVAN:  Justice Souter, I think the


answer is that we try to remain as true as we can to the

Framers' intent and the Framers' fear of a corrupt


judiciary or an oppressive prosecutor.  And that bulk --


that bulk word or whatever -- whatever that barrier that


exists between the process, that very threshold that


brings someone into the criminal justice system that that


cannot be -- that is indispensable to our system. 


QUESTION:  Well, wasn't that a fear --


QUESTION:  Go ahead. 


QUESTION:  Wasn't -- wasn't that a fear, in


effect, that grand juries are simply going to be puppets


that are going to be indicting without regard to evidence? 


Whereas, here the assumption is the evidence is


overwhelming, and so that policy of wanting the grand jury


to stand between the state and the individual is not


really a policy that's implicated here.


MR. SULLIVAN:  I -- you're right in that regard,


Justice Souter, but we don't know if the Government did


its duty and presented to this grand jury drug quantities


in the superseding indictment.  So, we don't even know,


based on any record that we can discern, whether or not


that major element, that critical element that -- that


drives the sentences in this case was ever presented to


them.  So, sure, I guess that, you know, grand juries can


charge greater offenses of it.  And that's one of the


beauties of it.  They can charge greater offenses, lesser

sentence, no -- no -- I mean, not -- offenses, or none at


all, and they can even nullify, although it's not -- we --


we shouldn't encourage it. 


QUESTION:  But they tend not to nullify, I


think, except when there are political considerations that


the grand jury sort of smells in the circumstances.  And


one thing it seems to me clear is that the grand juries


are not likely to smell political considerations when the


Government decides to go after kingpins as opposed to when


the Government decides to go after mules.  And so, I -- I


don't see that concern as coming to the fore in this case.


MR. SULLIVAN:  And I -- and I guess it goes


back, Justice Souter, to where I began this morning.  It's


the Government's responsibility to indict each defendant


based on their roles and their culpability.  You can't go


in and just do a blanket 846 indictment.  You must


delineate each and every element of each and every offense


for each and every defendant.  And that's the Government's


failure in this case. 


Look, I -- I understand the fact that it's not


terribly difficult for the Government to obtain a Federal


grand jury indictment.  I mean, I -- it's very rare that


they -- a Federal grand jury will no-bill what the U.S.


Attorney wants him or her to do or them to do.  There is a


tension there.

 But I think the rule of law and the purpose of


the grand jury and why we need the grand jury is far


greater than whether or not Mr. Hall, the leader of this


drug conspiracy, is going to do life or 20 years or by


whether other people who may have had different roles in


the conspiracy which no drug quantity has ever been


attributed to them -- there's evidence that they have been


involved in multiple conspiracies.  Whether they're mules


or couriers or street vendors or kingpins, sometimes the


rule of law requires that -- that fairness be done.  And


-- and fairness in this case is a sentence based on what


you were charged with, not a sentence based on something


that you weren't charged with.


QUESTION:  I think you -- I think you've got a


good argument there except for the fact that we've got to


find a distinction between the role of the grand juries


and the petty grand juries given the fact that Neder is --


is on the record.  And that's -- that's why I was fishing


for something and kind of shooting down everything that I


could come up with.  And that's the dilemma I have.


MR. SULLIVAN:  The dilemma is, Justice Souter --


is that what -- this would crack open the gate to allow, I


would suggest, the Government to trample into the -- the


grand jury function.  They already go into the grand jury


room each and every day, but now they can indict for one

thing, prove another thing, if their position is adopted


here, charge one thing --


QUESTION:  But that didn't happen here.  They


didn't indict for one thing and prove another thing.  You


agreed --


MR. SULLIVAN:  But --


QUESTION:  -- the -- the verdict corresponded to


the indictment.


MR. SULLIVAN:  No.  I'm talking in a different


case, a more broader case, not this actual case.


QUESTION:  Well, wait.  You don't -- you don't


agree that the verdict corresponded to the indictment, do


you?  I -- I thought the only reason that that issue was


not in this case is because of Neder.  It doesn't matter,


under Neder, whether the verdict corresponded to the


indictment.  That can be harmless error.  Right?  Which is


why you're driven back to the -- to the grand jury


argument. 


MR. SULLIVAN:  That's correct, but it's also


correct that I told the Chief Justice earlier that --


(Laughter.) 


MR. SULLIVAN:  -- that the -- that the problem


is a sentencing problem in this case and not a difference


between -- well, it is a -- my time is up. 


(Laughter.)

 QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, you have 1 minute


remaining. 


MR. DREEBEN:  Unless the Court has any


questions, the Government waives rebuttal.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well.


The case is submitted. 


(Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
