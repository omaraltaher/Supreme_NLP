 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument now


in 02-1794, the United States v. Manuel Flores-Montano.


 Ms. Blatt.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may


it please the Court:


 Customs officials have the responsibility to


protect the Nation's borders against the entry of dangerous


or unwanted items.  Consistent with that fundamental and


sovereign necessity, customs officials have historically had


the power to open containers and conduct a thorough search


of items without a warrant, probable cause, or any


particularized suspicion.


 QUESTION: Well, now in this case, I suppose the


Government did have reasonable suspicion.


 MS. BLATT: That's correct, but we did not rely on


it and the evidence was suppressed on -- based on the Ninth


Circuit's rule that a gas tank cannot be removed and opened


without reasonable suspicion.


 QUESTION: Can you make us, i.e., I'm not saying


this pejoratively, but can this Court be required to decide


what might be a hypothetical question, it seems to me, the

dog barked and therefore they had grounds for thinking their


were drugs in the gas tank, and he kicked the gas tank and


it was hollow, and no one disputes those facts.  But you


want to decide -- us to decide this case, as does the other


side, as if those facts didn't exist.  It sounds to me like


a hypothetical question, almost in the direction of an


advisory opinion.  What would we have decided if those facts


didn't exist?  But they do.  So how does that work?


 MS. BLATT: Well, I don't think it's an advisory


opinion in that the evidence has been suppressed.  But,


Justice Breyer, let me directly answer your question on why


the case is here.  In 2002, the Ninth Circuit held that the


Constitution is violated if customs officials remove and


open a gas tank without reasonable suspicion, and in that


case there was reasonable suspicion, making the case very


difficult to challenge.


 The Government legitimately wanted to challenge


the case in a -- in a -- in a case where the officers


actions could not be subject to a potential Bivens liability


for violating the clearly established law of the Ninth


Circuit.  At the same time, customs officials viewed the


Ninth Circuit's decision as posing an immediate and present


danger to their ability to protect the border, and they


thought it imperative to try to challenge a -- bring up a


case that challenged that rule as soon as possible.

 So two weeks after the Ninth Circuit's decision


was decided, respondent drove across -- drove across the


border with a gas tank full of 80 pounds of marijuana, and


the Government, we think legitimately, told the district


court, and there was no secret at any time in this case,


including at the petition stage, that we were not going to


put on evidence that there was reasonable suspicion, even


though the dog alerting and the solid-sounding tap of the


gas tank, we could have established or presumably could have


established that that was reasonable suspicion.


 And both the district court and the Ninth Circuit


summarily affirmed the -- suppressed it and then affirmed


the suppression, because there was not reasonable suspicion,


and that's why this case is here. 


The customs officials see 

this case as a threat to their ability to deter and detect


smuggling at a container that is relatively large and that


is commonly used -- in fact, it is the most common container


used along the Mexican border -­


QUESTION: Can we go back to your -­


MS. BLATT: -- to conceal contraband.


 QUESTION: You gave a Bivens justification for what


is extraordinary.  I mean, it's not a violation of article 3


for us to decide it on your basis, but still, this Court


deals with concrete cases with actual facts and not with


abstract questions.  So is it -- is it your notion -- is it

correct that what the Ninth Circuit says becomes clearly


established law so that an officer would genuinely be -- be


subject to Bivens liability when this Court hasn't addressed


the question?


 MS. BLATT: No, but we didn't want to have to tell


the men and women who were in charge of enforcing the border


that they should be subject to a potential suit, at least


being named in their personal capacity in a lawsuit.  It


seemed more appropriate from our perspective to try to bring


a case as soon as possible where we think we could have


proven reasonable suspicion, but it squarely fit within the


Ninth Circuit's rule that reasonable suspicion was required.


 QUESTION: I suppose you could also say it's a


question of resources. 


The Government does not want to have 

to put on witnesses, get officers up from the border, have


them sit in court, go through the motion to suppress, so


that you have a very real interest simply in expediting


trial procedures by taking the course you did.  I don't know


if that helps you on this article 3 problem or -­


MS. BLATT: It -- it helps to explain why we


thought there was a paramount interest in getting the case


as soon as possible.  We didn't want to divert resources


away from the border into having to prove our reasonable


suspicion.  In fact, there's already been serious fallout in


terms of trying to prove reasonable suspicion when we search

gas tanks, because the Ninth Circuit has said that all of


our discovery on how we train our dogs has to be produced,


and this is extremely sensitive information.


 QUESTION: This is a -- I wasn't doubting the


Government's motive here.  I think you have excellent


motive, though maybe Bivens, maybe it was a little


overconcerned about the Bivens, maybe it wasn't.  But what


I'm interested in is the law.  That is, this isn't the first


case where this has happened, not necessarily involving the


Government, and I'm not sure how the law's supposed to work.


 Parties come in and they say, we would like you to


decide this issue.  I'm sure they would.  But in order to


get to that issue, we have to assume out of the case certain


facts that everyone agrees are there.


 MS. BLATT: Well, that -­


QUESTION: Have you ever looked this up?  Are there


any -- have you come across this kind of a problem?


 MS. BLATT: I think it's -- it's clearly an -- as


Justice Ginsburg said, it's not an article 3 problem.  Let


me say, Justice Breyer, there's no finding that there was


reasonable suspicion, nor do we put on any evidence that


would have permitted that.


 QUESTION: No, all there is, is there happens to


be, I think, in the record, undisputed facts that the dog


barked and that they kicked the gas tank and it was hollow.

is our position that we could have put on proof that this


constituted reasonable suspicion by putting the dog's


handler on and the agent explaining what a -- what a solid-

sounding tap means.  We didn't do that, so there's no


finding, but let me just say -­


QUESTION: But the Ninth Circuit would require


evidence of the training of the particular dog and so forth?


 MS. BLATT: Well, at least that the defense is


titled to discovery on that so that the -- the handler.  But


let me just say, Justice Breyer, as a prudential matter, I


think that that is a legitimate concern at the petition


stage when we petitioned, and there was no secret that we


intentionally brought this case for the purpose of having it


reviewed.  But the case has been briefed, there's no


question about standing, and we think it's appropriate to


reach the issue.  Twenty-five percent of all drug seizures


along the Mexican border are hidden in gas tanks, that we've


not only found marijuana, cocain, heroin, currency,


methamphetamine, there have weapons and ammunition -­


QUESTION: Does it matter how -- how much you have


to take apart of a car to make a search?  Does that enter


into the ultimate resolution in the Government's view or do


we look at how easy it is to remove a gas tank and look at


it?  Does that matter?


 MS. BLATT: Well, it might matter, but it certainly


doesn't matter where the -- the compartment or container in


question is designed to be removed and put back together by


mechanics.  A gas tank removal is something that can be done

QUESTION: To take it off and put it back?


 MS. BLATT: Well, in this case it took under a half


an hour, but, Justice O'Connor, I want to stress that in


other cases, depending on the type of car, it might take an


hour or two hours, and the last thing we want is our customs


official to be on a Fourth Amendment stopwatch and telling


the mechanic to rush.  So they need -­


QUESTION: On the 25 percent figure, you say 25


percent of all seizures from vehicles?  Does that include 25


percent of seizures where you search the person or?


 MS. BLATT: No, it's 20 -­


QUESTION: What's -- the 25 percent is a percentage


of what?


 MS. BLATT: Twenty-five percent of narcotics


seizures in terms of amount of seizures along land borders. 


That doesn't include seaports -­


QUESTION: Oh, 25 percent in terms of quantity?


 MS. BLATT: In terms of number of seizures.  It


doesn't necessarily mean how much volume, but it's a lot,


given that the gas tank is one of the largest containers.


 QUESTION: But included in that base is seizures


from the person where somebody has it in their pocket and so

forth?


 MS. BLATT: Yes, that's correct, but -­


QUESTION: Well, the gas tank here had 80 pounds in


it, didn't it?


 MS. BLATT: Eighty pounds of marijuana with five


gallons of gas, and that's an enormous amount, and this


could have been another -- another -- other dangerous items,


it doesn't have to be just marijuana.  And they have seen it


all.  At the same time, someone does not store personal


effects in their gas tank.  It's just a repository for fuel. 


And this involved far less of an intrusion on privacy


interest than the type of searches that can happen and do


happen at the border, such as the traveler's baggage and the


passenger compartments in the vehicle.


 QUESTION: May I ask of you if the Government has


procedures in place for the cases in which inadvertently


they damage the car or -- or maybe the thing might blow up


on some occasion or something like that?  What -- what's


remedy does the citizen or the maybe an alien or the citizen


have in that situation?


 MS. BLATT: Any time there's damage to any types of


property at the border, the person is handed a claims form,


which is processed through customs, first under the Federal


Tort Claims Act.  Now, there's an exemption for claims


arising out of the tension of properties by customs under 28

U.S.C. 2680(c), but assuming that happens, customs can pay,

and does pay, up to $1,000 under the Small Claims Act, under


31 U.S.C. 3723.  And Justice Stevens, there's another


statute, a customs-specific statute, 19 U.S.C. 1630, that


would permit customs to pay up to $50,000, but the


restriction is for -- it has to be for non-commercial


properties, so that would be personal property that customs


damage.  So there's -­


QUESTION: I would think there are a lot of cases,


repair bills are getting pretty expensive now, where $1,000


wouldn't cover it, the damage to a car.


 MS. BLATT: Well, that may be, Your Honor, but this


case doesn't involve claim of damage and -­


QUESTION: No, I just -- but it's -- it's sort of


in the background as we're asking whether it's reasonable in


the -- in the -- in an ultimate sense, and I just -- that's


one of the things that I'm concerned about is -­


MS. BLATT: Well, sure, a gas tank is about $100,


$200 item, and it's conceivable that any search can result


in damage.  Now, respondent has never claimed -­

MS. BLATT: Well, you're right.  You could have -­


you could have -­


QUESTION:  When you say $100, to reconnect it,


it's about $100?

item itself probably costs under $200, but you would have


labor costs.


 QUESTION: Well, that's not true.  I recently had


to get one, and it's quite expensive, I can tell you.


 (Laughter.)


 MS. BLATT: Well, depending on the car, the ones


I've seen have been under $200, but you would have


associated labor costs and maybe other parts.  But the basic


point is that this is a container, it's a paradigmatic type


of item that can be opened up by the -- at the border


without any particularized suspicion.  And -­


QUESTION: Ms. -- Ms. Blatt, may I just go back


before you go on with your argument to follow up on Justice


Stevens' question?  You spoke of the $50,000 limit as being


for damage or, I guess, destruction of non-commercial


property.  Does -- does the non-commercial mean, as I would


assume it would mean, that a truck or lorry that is driven


as a -- as a carrier would not be covered, damage to that


would not be covered by the $50,000 coverage?


 MS. BLATT: That's right.  And property is -­


QUESTION: So if the -- if the -- if the truck, I


mean, if the commercial truck catches fire as a result


because there's a spark in the gas tank and everything goes


up in flames, in effect there's no redress?

 MS. BLATT: Excuse me?


 QUESTION: I'm -- this would happen in a search


where there is probable cause as well, it could happen,


couldn't it?  When there's -- when there's reasonable


suspicion, the same thing could happen, couldn't it?  And


you also wouldn't have to pay for the truck?


 MS. BLATT: Well, that -- that's absolutely true,


but -­


QUESTION: Right, and you would also -­


QUESTION: And that would -- and that would not


render what was otherwise a reasonable search unreasonable,


would it?


 MS. BLATT: It would depend.  As long -- assuming


they're acting reasonably in carrying out the search, it's


still reasonable and -­


QUESTION: The mere fact that there's no

compensation for actual damage, accidental damage to -- to

 MS. BLATT: That's correct.


 QUESTION: And the reason -­


QUESTION: So why should it do it here?


 MS. BLATT: There have been thousands of


disassemblies at the border -­


QUESTION: But isn't -- isn't the point that in -­


in the -- in the hypothetical that Justice Scalia puts, with


the probable cause, we start with the assumption that the


offices are in there acting reasonably.  The question in


this case is posed by Justice Stevens' question.  Would the


potential for damage -- is it reasonable to go in there in


the first place without probable cause?  So that is a


different issue, isn't it?


 MS. BLATT: Well, no, I think it's reasonable to


search property at the border by virtue of the fact it's at


the border, and given the Government's overriding interest


and the person's reduced expectations.  But Justice Souter,


there has been no known or reported instance of this


hypothetical risk materializing at the border with respect


to a customs search.


 QUESTION: Ms. Blatt, you mentioned, you started to


give a number, 1,000 searches, fuel tank searches, and then

you gave a number earlier about how many gas tanks turned


out to have contraband or something.  Do you know what


percentage of those gas tanks were -- was there disassembly


and what percentage were done by a less intrusive means by


the dog and the tapping on the fuel tank?


 MS. BLATT: Well, all gas tank seizures, which


there have been thousands, have to be done by removal and


disassembly of the tank.  There are, you could call them


searches, because that's what they are, of gas tanks that


don't involve removal and disassembly, if you use


sophisticated equipment such as density busters and X-rays. 


But all these seizures that are occurring at the border, in


order to get to the drugs, you have to unscrew the bolts


that are holding the tank to the undercarriage of the


vehicle and remove the tank and open it up.


 QUESTION: Is the practice then to just go straight


to that procedure and skip the dog and the tapping, or do


they go through the whole thing?


 MS. BLATT: Well, they have dogs at all the major


ports of entry, but the dogs don't always alert, so I


wouldn't say it's necessarily skipping, but the dog may not


alert.  They also at some of the facilities have what are


known as fiber optic scopes, which are extremely


sophisticated and effective equipment.  Unfortunately, 75


percent or higher of all tanks have, in the filler tube,

have an anti-siphoning valve that blocks the entry of the


scope into the tank, but they will try that if they have it. 


It's not always available.  It's an extremely expensive


piece of equipment.  It costs $16,000 per unit.  But if they


have that, presumably they try that first, and if it's


blocked, then they put the car up on a lift and unscrew the


metal bolts that are holding them that -- to the metal


straps that are holding the tank and they'll remove the


tank.  And then from there on it's pretty straightforward on


how to open up the tank.


 QUESTION: But if we -- if you prevail in this case


and they don't have to do that, they can just say it's good


enough to go right to the disassembly and we don't have to


bother with dogs and maintaining dogs and anything else?


 MS. BLATT: Yeah, that's right.  Our position is


where the procedure imposes only a modest intrusion on


interests protected by the Fourth Amendment, the officers


don't have to exhaust every least intrusive method.


 QUESTION: Obviously that would be the result if we


were to support the Government's view here, and I think


we're interested in knowing how often people's gas tanks


would be disassembled if the Government's view prevails


here.  How many times percentage-wise would people crossing


a land border expect to have their gas tank removed if the


Government prevails here?

QUESTION: I mean, let's say 1,000 cars cross the


border point in an hour.  What percentage of those will have


their gas tanks removed?


 MS. BLATT: Not very many, Justice O'Connor.  Let


me give you these statistics.  There have been 120 million


vehicles that passed through this country's borders last


year, and over the last four years, four years, there have


been 8,000 gas tank disassemblies.


 QUESTION: Yeah, but you didn't have this rule


established that you didn't need reasonable suspicion.  What


we're asking you to speculate on is if the Government


prevails and we say, fine, you can take the gas tank off,


you don't have to have any degree of reasonable suspicion. 


Then how many will there be?


 MS. BLATT: Exactly the same.  It has always been


the rule up until the Ninth Circuit that we could take apart


a gas tank without reasonable suspicion.  Customs officials


--

QUESTION: Have any of the other circuits followed


the Ninth Circuit's -- other circuits have that -- which


have land borders?


 MS. BLATT: No, no, they've always been able to


take apart a gas tank on something less than reasonable


suspicion.  But Justice O'Connor, it is true that as a

practical matter customs does not take the time or energy to


take -- to call the mechanic, pay for the mechanic to take


apart the gas tank unless their suspicions are focused on


the gas tank, and it will usually be because of the dog


alerts, or the more common situation is it -- that they're


just not sure whether that gas tank has been altered.  Maybe


a bolt looks different than another bolt or it looks like


it's been unscrewed, and it may be the person had their gas


tank worked on, but they're just not sure, they have some


concern about the person's travel plan story and so they -­


they want to go ahead and make sure the gas tank's not


containing contraband.


 QUESTION: Suppose -- suppose you prevail.  Are


there any regulations or -- or procedures under which you'll


keep statistics and data, so that say over -- suppose you


prevail, then over the next five years we can -- we can look


back and see that there have been 10,000 searches and


contraband has been discovered only 5 percent of the time or


something?


 MS. BLATT: Yes, they keep statistics on seizures


of narcotics and what are known as positive and negative


seizures.  And in the last four years of the 8,000 gas tank


seizures that have happened, 85 to 90 percent of those have


been what are known as positive hits or there's been a


presence of contraband, and so 10 to 15 percent of those

have been so-called negative searches where the tank is


reassembled and the motorist sent on their way, and I -- we


would expect that those statistics to continue, that they


have limited resources and they conduct a search when they


think it's appropriate and necessary.


 QUESTION: But you don't know of the 8,000 what


percent were without any suspicion?


 MS. BLATT: No, but there's never been any kind of


requirement.  I -- I think we can -­

were focused on the gas tank, whether or not that that would


have convinced a court that it was reasonable under -­


QUESTION: Yeah, I see.


 MS. BLATT: -- this Court's definition I think is


unclear.


 QUESTION: Are there any rules or administrative


procedures in the customs that would say -- that would apply


in respect to suspicionless searches of gas tanks?  For


example, random searches, do it once a month or here's -- we


have a random program or we check up to see how it's going


or -- are there -- are -- is it just each customs agent for


himself when -- if you win, is it each customs agent for


himself with no check whatsoever?


 MS. BLATT: No, well --

 QUESTION: Or are there internal administrative


checks that would be a kind of substitute for a judicial


check?


 MS. BLATT: There are extensive training of customs


officials -­


QUESTION: But what does it say -­


MS. BLATT: -- about how to go about searching a


car, where to look, where -- where smugglers typically hide


their drugs, and what type of evidence they may leave


behind, and that's what the agent is looking for.  The


agents are also trained though, Justice Breyer, to rely on


their experience and intuition and hunches, and over time


border officials gather extensive experience about what


they're looking for.


 QUESTION: When -­


MS. BLATT: They also can consult with a supervisor


if they have a question about whether a search should


actually be done.


 QUESTION: So, for example, you have a customs


agent whose experience leads him to believe that parents


with small children are more likely to be smuggling heroin. 


Now, this would be an odd customs agent.  Is there anything


in the system that would discover that this is the person


who's doing all the suspicionless checks and something's


gone wrong here, so there's -- do you see what I'm looking

for?


 MS. BLATT: Well, his -­


QUESTION: I'm looking for some way of -­


MS. BLATT: -- supervisor would be aware of the


search, but with a 85 to 90 percent success rate, that


possibility seems rather remote.


 QUESTION: But then you have the suspicion searches


in that 85 percent.  I'm trying to figure out if we have


each customs agent for himself to conduct whatever


suspicionless searches he wants, and you have a few of the,


perhaps in every organization there are a few unusual ones


who cause some problems, are there any internal checks


within the system, because you're going to not have a


judicial check?  I wonder if there are any administrative


ways.


 MS. BLATT: There may be checks where people can


file complaints, I don't know.  But the same officer could


be instructing that the spare tire compartment be taken


apart or that a tire be taken out or that every scrap of


luggage can be taken off or that the person could empty


their wallets, their shoes, their purses, their clothing,


and put the person to a considerable inconvenience.


 But a gas tank is not a container, Your Honor,


that there's some sort of heightened expectation of privacy. 


It stores fuel.

 QUESTION: So assume that if there's any de facto


check, there's more likely a check on the gas tank than


there is on emptying your wallet and taking your shoes off


and everything else, namely the expense that it causes to


the customs service in time -- in terms of the time of its


agents, and I suppose you have to pay these mechanics that


come and do it.


 MS. BLATT: Yeah, it's about -- cost runs about a


cost of $90 to $140 per visit, but Justice Scalia, there are


also, very consistent with your point, hundreds of cars in a


lane that this inspector has to get through, and they always


are concerned about moving through the legitimate traffic


and legitimate trade.  They want to get people in, they want


to get people past the border.  At the same time, they're


extremely concerned about what's in -- what people might be


concealing in their vehicles, and a vehicle is an extremely


large container and a gas tank is a relatively large


container, and given that it is 25 percent of all drug


seizures have been hidden in the gas tank, they have an


essential interest in being able to not only detect it when


they think it might be there, but also deter it.


 It has been customs' experience over many, many


years that smugglers are looking to exploit any weakness


along our border security efforts, and they will readily


place their drugs where they're least likely to be detected.

 QUESTION: Does that mean, for example, that you


could rip out all the upholstery because you can hide drugs


inside the upholstery?


 MS. BLATT: Well, ripping out the upholstery would


first present a question of what kind of intrusion there is


on -- under the Fourth Amendment or an interest protected on


the Fourth Amendment, and there may be a significant


deprivation of a property interest.  Now, we would probably


contend that we could rip whatever upholstery was reasonably


necessary to conduct the search.


 QUESTION: I thought -- I thought you would, and


maybe I'm recalling your brief incorrectly, but I thought


you -- you made a distinction between the kind of intrusive


bodily search like a strip search and said that's the only


one where you would need reasonable suspicion.  All others,


all that involve only property and not the person, the rule


should be at the border, anything goes, no reasonable


suspicion required.  Is that the position the Government is


taking?


 MS. BLATT: There's a small nuanced caveat to that. 


We think we can search property without suspicion and use


whatever force is reasonably necessary.  At the same time,


Justice Ginsburg, the Constitution still applies with


respect to the property and the search has to be carried out


in a reasonable manner, and if someone took a giant axe and

starting whacking away at leather upholstery, that would


very well constitute an unreasonable search.


 But this case doesn't involve a claim of damage


and respondent has never said that he was deprived of a


significant possessory interest in his gas tank.  Rather,


what happened, it was taken apart and it could have been


easily put back together.


 QUESTION: But your -- your answer to my question


about property is, as long as you're not wantonly


destructive, you can -- any -- anything that's in the car as


distinguished from a person?


 MS. BLATT: That's our -- that would be our


position, but I'm saying it also involves a very distinct


factor, and that is that there's a deprivation of a


significant property interest if the item is going to be


obliterated or its value going to be destroyed, and that's


not the contention made in this case or the type of


deprivation of a privacy -- of property interests you would


have with a gas tank.  But sure, if you took a vase and


smashed it when you could have looked in it, or let me just


say if you wanted to open up the trunk -­


QUESTION: Well, but not just on the -- the -- if


you smash it unnecessarily, but suppose the only way to get


behind the fabric in say a seat cushion or something like


that is to cut it open.  It -- does your policy apply to

that situation too?


 MS. BLATT: Well -­


QUESTION: Because I don't suppose you have a


seamstress who sews up the seat right away.


 MS. BLATT: Right.  Well, we would look at first


what the type of deprivation is, and if it's a teeny little


tear that can be easily repaired, maybe there's not a


significant deprivation.


 QUESTION: But suppose it's something that cannot


be repaired.


 MS. BLATT: Let's -­


QUESTION: You have to cut up a seat -- a seat


cushion.  What -- what do you do?


 MS. BLATT: Let's suppose that there's a


significant deprivation.  It would at least be reasonable


for the court to look at what kinds of alternatives were


available to the Government.  As a practical matter, Justice


Stevens, we -- customs officials have long, skinny metal


probes which are like needles that they use to search


upholstery, so if it's fabric you wouldn't even see it going


in and out.  If it's leather, you probably are going to get


a tiny hole.  Now, whether that would constitute a


significant deprivation -­


QUESTION: I see.


 MS. BLATT: -- might turn on the facts and

circumstances, but these are wonderful pieces of equipment


that customs officials use all the time to look inside


places that are hard to see, and they use them exactly on


seats. 


But to be sure, Justice Stevens, customs gets


complaints about upholstery.  They let a dog into a car and


the dog scratches the upholstery or the agent's going in


there and searching and he steps on something. 


These kinds of things happen at the border and


customs have to -- have a job to do and they've got to use


whatever force is reasonably necessary.  But I think these


cases are separate because they involve some arguably


significant deprivation of the owner's possessory interest


in that piece of property. 


If it's a leather seat and it's 

torn, the value's gone down. 


But the Ninth Circuit applies a rule that doesn't


let customs officials open up a container even where they


can put it back without damaging the tank, and so we think


that case is quite distinct.


 Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance


of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN F. HUBACHEK


 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


 MR. HUBACHEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


 The Court's decision in Montoya established that


for a search other than the routine border search,


reasonable suspicion was required.


 QUESTION: Well, Mr. -- Mr. Hubachek, Montoya


discussed that in the context of a search of the person.  It


-- it said we reserve judgment on whether a strip search of


his body --- it was talking about people, not gas tanks.


 MR. HUBACHEK: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, but


four courts of appeals have unanimously applied the analysis


in Montoya to searches of property or effects under the


Fourth Amendment.  The Ninth Circuit's decision in Molina-


Tarazon is consistent with those cases in that it applied


the Montoya paradigm to the search of the gas tank and the


seizure of the gas tank.


 QUESTION: Well, would you say that a ship coming


in at a port in our country from elsewhere cannot be


searched thoroughly without reasonable suspicion?


 MR. HUBACHEK: A ship could be searched thoroughly


without reasonable suspicion.  I -- but -­


QUESTION: But a land vehicle coming from, for


example, Mexico at the land border crossing cannot be?

would draw would be the point -­


QUESTION: What is the difference?


 MR. HUBACHEK: -- of disassembly.  I don't think


that you can disassemble conveyances that come to the


border.


 QUESTION: You think that if the ship came in that


the gas tank could be removed and examined for presence of


illegal goods?


 MR. HUBACHEK: I -- I don't think that it would be


reasonable to disassemble a ship either, particularly in


light of all of the various methods that are available.  I


don't think it's supported historically either.  You know,


the initial statutes that the Solicitor General cited in the 

brief don't support any sort of disassembly of conveyances,


the -- particularly the 1790 statute.  What it talks about


is allowing customs officials on board to look around, to


mark items, to take records and so on and so forth, and then


when items are being passed through customs, then the


customs officer -­


QUESTION: But in today's world, the figures, the


statistics are staggering about how many narcotics are


brought into our country by way of the use of gas tanks.  I


mean, that's an incredibly large figure.


 MR. HUBACHEK: And I certainly would --

 QUESTION: And -- and what are we supposed to do


about that?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice O'Connor, I think that


what we're supposed to do about it is to use the methods


that are tried and true by the customs service itself.  If


the customs service itself wants to move away from


dismantling-type searches into searches that involve the use


of the -- their technology -­


QUESTION: Well, they have to dismantle to get into


a gas tank where it -- the opening will not permit the entry


of a -- the little looking device.


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, sometimes -- maybe in the


brief I was too excited by all this technology that's


available, but I think that sometimes it's important to


start back at the initial things.  Molina-Tarazon, for


instance, the case that developed this rule, found


reasonable suspicion based upon mud spatterings on the


bottom of the tank.  Carreon, the Tenth Circuit decision,


found reasonable suspicion in large part based upon the fact


that certain bolts were shiny.  So -­


QUESTION: Mr. Hubachek, now you say, you give the


impression that all courts of appeals have agreed with the


Ninth Circuit.  Ms. Blatt gave the impression, at least to


me, that the Ninth Circuit was alone on this.  What is the


state of decisions, say in the Fifth Circuit, which has so

much land border like the Ninth Circuit?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Mr. Chief Justice, no court but the


Ninth Circuit has addressed this specific issue here, the


dismantling of gas tanks.  The Fifth Circuit, though, has


held -­


QUESTION: Is it not done along the Texas border?


 MR. HUBACHEK: I'm sure it is done, but there just


hasn't been a case that has arisen.


 QUESTION: But there hasn't been a reported case


where it was challenged?


 MR. HUBACHEK: That's correct.  But however, the


Fifth Circuit has decided that intrusive searches of


property are subject to the Montoya analysis and that


reasonable suspicion is required in a drilling case called


Rivas.  And in that case, you know, they used a drill to


drill into the vehicle.


 QUESTION: Is -- is it the -- you -- you described


the search as intrusive, but as I understand it, your


objection is not to the intrusion, your objection is to the


disassembly.


 MR. HUBACHEK: Yeah, yes, that's correct.


 QUESTION: So -- so the -- the -- I -- I assume


your objection rests on either or both of these grounds,


either the value of the property, which is either lessened


or placed at risk, or the inconvenience to the driver and

passenger while the -- while the intrusion or the


disassembly goes on.  Which is it?


 MR. HUBACHEK: I would say it's both of those and I


think that the -- of course, the Court's Soldal decision


establishes that a meaningful interference, even if there's


no privacy interest at all, still implicates the Fourth


Amendment.  But certainly there are issues with respect to


value.  If my gas tank has been dis -­

on value?  They'll put it back together again, there's


apparently no record that -- that these things blow up all


the time.


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well -­


QUESTION: So -- so what is the -- the property


concern?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think that there a number of


concerns.  Number one, do -- if I resell the car, do I have


to disclose that the gas -- the fuel system was


disassembled?  I mean, what if I have a warranty?  Does that


exclude things from a repair by the warranty because it's


been worked on by someone who's not authorized by Ford or


whatever company owns the car?  Are there issues with


emissions?  You know, this is a 1987 vehicle that we're


talking about and the systems are much more complicated now.

 MR. HUBACHEK: It -- it certainly is -- is not a


tremendous privacy interest.


 QUESTION: Well, is there any?


 QUESTION: Well, all right.  So there's no privacy


interest and all there is is an interest that you don't want


the Government hurting your property, which is conceivable


in an interest.  But on the other hand, they say no privacy


interest, conceivable the Government will hurt your

property.  Every day of the week we deal with government


people might hurt our property.  And on the other side, 25


percent of all the drugs that come into the United States


outside -- by land, come in in gas tanks, so this is an


overwhelming interest for letting you do it.  After all,


they search your suitcases, they search my pockets, they


search every piece of luggage, they -- they search anything


you're bringing in, and it's not an unusual thing at a


border.


 So -- so, how -- how do you respond to this strong


interest on their side and no privacy interest and very


little property damage risk on the other side?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I don't agree that there's


very little property damage risk based on the -- the other


things that I've just mentioned.  Plus there's also the


issue of the security of the individual, which was focused


on in Molina-Tarazon, you know, what confidence do you have


that this crucial system in your vehicle is going to be


reliable when it's been taken apart -­


QUESTION: Well, presumably the person filling the


gas tank with drugs had to disassemble the tank to put the


drugs in there, so apparently willing to take that risk -­


MR. HUBACHEK: But -­


QUESTION:  -- but not willing to let the customs


service do the same thing?

 MR. HUBACHEK: Right.  Well, people who smuggle


drugs in gas tanks are willing to take a lot of risks, but


the average traveler who comes to the border and is faced


with the possibility of random disassembly of their gas tank


is not going to be willing to take those risks.


 QUESTION: Well, how -- how often does that happen


that an innocent person has his gas tank person random -­


randomly disassembled?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, there's -- one of the


weaknesses of this record is -- is that although the customs


service claims that it's important for them to be able to do


random disassemblies, they haven't established any sort of


program under which they do random disassemblies, but there


were several hundred gas tank disassemblies in which there


were no drugs found.


 QUESTION: Well, we were told that 15 percent or 20


percent of the time nothing is found, 80 or 85 percent


something is.  That -- that's my understanding of the


Government's submission.


 MR. HUBACHEK: Right.  And I think that that


supports the notion that when they act upon suspicion and


their experiences, we've heard detail this morning that they


can be effective.  That doesn't mean though that it's


essential to have the ability randomly to disassemble based


upon those suspicions.

 QUESTION: They're not talking about randomly. 


They're -- they're talking about -- I -- I think -- I think


Ms. Blatt said hunches.  I mean, there, you know, there -­


there are just some intuitions that agents get that may not


rise to the level of what a court may acknowledge is an


articulable suspicion, and they shouldn't -- they shouldn't


have to worry about whether they have to prove that or not. 


I -- do you really think they're going to do it when -- when


there's no reason whatever to do it?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, that -- that's the problem


with absolute discretion.  Any -- any officer across the


United States can make the rules for that particular day. 


But I think that it's important to bear in mind that these


hunches have, you know, there are many -­


QUESTION: But we're talking about border searches


with customs officials who are trained and they have limited


budgets.  Why do they want to pay the cost of having a


mechanic disassemble an engine unless they have a good


reason for doing it?  I mean, it's inconceivable to me that


they try to run up the number just to run up the number. 


It's too expensive.  They don't have that kind of money.


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think that any seizures that


the Court has required there actually be founded suspicion


are troublesome for the officers.  I mean, if they pull


people over randomly, that's time that's taken away from

other activities that they could be undertaking, so there's


always a natural disinclination to do that.  But that


doesn't change the fact that this Court has repeatedly in -­


QUESTION: But -- but not as easily observed and


not as easily recorded by supervisors.  I mean, it seems to


me if you have an agent who repeatedly has a -- cars backing


up at the -- at the gate that -- that he's controlling, and


who repeatedly comes up empty on -- on gas tank searches,


that fellow's not going to be there very long.  I mean, it,


it's easy to observe somebody who's abusing the system, it


seems to me.


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, again, I think that it's


important though that officers not be able to act


arbitrarily across the United States. 


It's not -- it's not 

necessarily going to be limited to one officer so that we'll


always be able to weed them out.


QUESTION: In -- in your answer to Justice Souter's


question a few minutes ago, you said that not only was the


property interest important, but the inconvenience was a -­


was a factor, and I don't know that we've ever said much


about that that would -- would support it.  Certainly


there's going to be some inconvenience any time you cross a


border, and this thing, if it takes half an hour, is that


really a Fourth Amendment factor?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I -- I think it's a factor,

but I don't think it's as important as the other factors


we've talked about, the potential diminution in value, the


lack of security upon the -- the individual who's driving


away in a vehicle that's been altered by unknown


individuals, and the fact that, you know, that -­


QUESTION: When you -- when you -- once you -- you


-- the -- the trunk is fair game, any luggage is fair game,


fancy Gucci shoes might be fair game, it seems to me that


the fuel tank, if we're looking at it from the point of view


of the -- the -- how much damage there might be or the cost,


is -- is a lesser thing than personal items, and also that


the privacy interest is much stronger in what we already say


can be done without suspicion.


 MR. HUBACHEK: I -- I agree that the suspicion -­


that the privacy interest in the gas tank is not as high as


the other items that you've mentioned.  However, it still is


true that when you put your Gucci shoes on, you're planning


to take them off, so if an officer takes them off to look at


them, that's not a problem.  If they open up your luggage,


your luggage is expected to be opened, and in fact, 1461


requires that you furnish an opportunity to open up that


luggage.  But no one expects that their gas tank when they


buy a new car to a tremendous expense that they put their


family in, no one expects that that part of their vehicle is


going to be open like they know that their luggage is.

of property and -­

-- so what about taking the cap off of a -- off of a bottle


that's there.  Is that -- is that disassembly?

is similar to the luggage.  You would just open up the cap


and that -- that's what's expected to happen, but no one -­

be necessary -­

where that shouldn't be done without -­


QUESTION: Suppose it's the same as a -- suppose

QUESTION: Wow.


 QUESTION: -- they say that we want to search every


fifteenth truck that comes in, there might be anthrax or


bombs or whatever and we want to give the agents the power


to look thoroughly into these big trucks even without


suspicion.  Now were you saying the Fourth Amendment would


stop that?


 MR. HUBACHEK: If we're talking about a specific


threat, where there is, you know, a specific -­


QUESTION: No, no, non-specific threat, it's the


present situation.  The Government simply says, we're


worried about our borders, they're not secure, and we want


to look at the trucks, that we want the -- the customs


agents to be able to look at trucks that are coming in. 


They may have dangerous items on -- in -- on board, and we


want them to look whenever they want.  It's at the border,


just like your purse, just like your valise, just like your


bag.  Now, what -- what's your view of -- is your case the


same, different, or what do you think of that case?


 MR. HUBACHEK: I -- I think -- I don't think that ­


- that suspicionless searches under those circumstances

would be reasonable because there's not been any showing

that random searches or disassemblies of gas tanks would be


at all effective.  In Delaware v. Prouse, this Court


disapproved the process of pulling over people randomly to


check registrations, both because it was not demonstrated to


be effective, but also because it was not demonstrated to


have any sort of deterrent effect.


 QUESTION: All right, so in your view,


suspicionless searches of trucks, whether for bombs,


anthrax, weapons, or drugs all stand or fall together?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think that -- I think that


there -- at least with the every 15 cars, there would be


more of a deterrent because then they would know that every


fifteenth car is being searched, but there is no program in


place now, there was nothing offered below, in fact, there


was no evidence offered below -­


QUESTION: That's a different question.  My


question was, do they stand or fall together?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Right.  I -- I think that the -­


that our case is stronger than your hypothetical.


 QUESTION: Delaware against Prouse had nothing to


do with the border.  I mean, that was on a highway -- inland


highway in Delaware.  The Fourth Amendment has always been


much relaxed at the border.


 MR. HUBACHEK: No, I -- I agree with that, Mr.


Chief Justice, but my point from Delaware v. Prouse is that

in -- in examining a random program, the Court looked to two


things.  It looked to whether or not it was demonstrated to


be effective.  It's not demonstrated to be effective here. 


And it also looked to whether or not there was going to be a


deterrent effect from it, and there was no -­


QUESTION: But -- but you just can't transplant a


case involving a car on a highway inland to the border.


 MR. HUBACHEK: No, I understand.  My point is -- is


that the empirical evidence was important in the Delaware v.


Prouse case, and that's how this Court distinguished it in


Sitz, which is a case that the Solicitor General cited in


support of the notion that the Court shouldn't look to other


alternatives.


 QUESTION: What -- what do you do about United


States v. Ross when -- when you're urging your -- your -­


your disassembly point?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well -­


QUESTION: Now that -- that was a case involving a


border search statute, not -- not the one at issue here, to


be sure, but nonetheless what we said, to quote it, is


certainly Congress intended custom officers to open shipping


containers when necessary and not merely to examine the


exterior of cartons or boxes in which smuggled goods might


be concealed.  During virtually the entire history of our


country, whether contraband was transported in a horse-drawn

carriage, a 1921 roadster, or a modern automobile, it was


been assumed that a lawful search of a vehicle would include


search of any container that might include the object of the


-- of the search.


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I -- I think that -­


QUESTION: Now, why isn't that applicable here?


 MR. HUBACHEK: I think that it -- actually, it's


consistent with our position, because the statutes that Ross


was talking about were the statutes from 1789 and 1790 that


I was referring to earlier, and what they allowed was the


customs officers to go on board the ships to mark things and


to make their records and so on and so forth, and then the


packages would then be opened by the customs officer, and


the first Congress thought this was a very significant act,


because not only did they require the customs officer to


open up the packages, but they had to have two reputable


witnesses, merchants outside the customs service, to observe


those.  So that was a very significant event.


 But nothing in those statutes allowed disassembly


of vessels.  It, in fact, it did authorize -­


QUESTION: Well, now, your -- your -- your position


is -- is -- is any container, you're not just talking about


gas tank, you say nothing can be disassembled.  So if I have


some gizmo that is assembled and is not meant to be opened


again, you say if I bring that across the border the customs

have -­

 MR. HUBACHEK: If they have reasonable -­


QUESTION: They can't -- they can't open it.


 MR. HUBACHEK: If they have reasonable suspicion,


they can.


 QUESTION: No, but without reasonable suspicion. 


I'm -­


MR. HUBACHEK: No, I don't think they can open up


the gizmo without reasonable suspicion, but they still have


all of the abilities they have to bring to bear on that, all


the -- the experience, all of their technology, all of their


ability to examine things.


 QUESTION: I think I -- I -- I lost what you were


saying when you started referring to the gizmo.  If -- if I


bring in -- if I buy a valuable statue in Europe and I have


it elaborately crated so it won't be hurt in transport, when


it gets to New York, can they open the crate to see what's


inside?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Yes, they can, and that would be


consistent with the 1790 statute, which said that you could


open up the packages.

the crate and the gas tank is, I take it, your concern that


after they've put the gas tank back together, there may be


some risk that it won't function or that the emissions


system will be affected?  I mean, is that where you draw the


line between the crate and the tank?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think that the -- the line


that I'm drawing is -- is the line that was drawn by the


first Congress when they said that you can open up packages


and they didn't provide any additional authority on board


the vessels -­


QUESTION: Well -­


MR. HUBACHEK:  -- to disassemble -­


QUESTION: Yeah, but you're -- you're arguing a


constitutional restriction here.  Your -- your argument is


not that Congress has not provided the authority.  Your


argument is Congress can't provide the authority.  So what,


it seems to me what Justice Souter is asking is, if Congress


can provide the authority to uncrate the statue, what


constitutional prohibition is there to uncrating the gas


tank?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, of course, in their brief, the


Solicitor Generals argued that that statute is -- does go


along with the constitutional protection, so I think that


the fact that the same Congress that passed the Fourth

packages with the two witnesses there.  And they were also


obligated if there was -­


QUESTION: No, but, I mean, we -- we didn't have


this problem in 1790 or 1799, and the question is, what is


the difference in principle for constitutional purposes


between opening up, disassembling my crate, and


disassembling the gas tank?  And the only thing that I can


think of is, based on what you've said so far, is the


concern that maybe the gas tank won't work or I'll have to


disclose it to a subsequent purchaser, or the emissions


system will be hurt.  Do you have anything else to


distinguish in principle between the -- the uncrating and


the opening of the tank?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well -- well, yes.  There's also the


notion of the -- that was relied upon in Molina-Tarazon, the


security of the individual who's in the vehicle, and there's


also the -­


QUESTION: Well, the security is -- is the -- is


the concern that maybe the tank won't work or -- or are you


saying maybe -- maybe the -- it'll blow up?  Is that what


you mean by the security?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Right, yeah.


 QUESTION: Okay.  Well, the individual, I assume,


is not in the car when they take the tank out, so we're

talking simply about property damage.  When they uncrate the


statue, they might knock the hand off, but they can still


uncrate the statue.  What -- anything else in principle


between the two situations?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think that crates are


intended to be open.  If, you know, you packed it carefully


and ultimately you intend to unpack it, so you intend to


pack the -- the crate.  I don't think it's reasonable though


to disassemble a valuable piece of property that has safety


implications -­


QUESTION: So it depends on my intention?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think what -­


QUESTION: I intend the crate to be opened, but


when I buy a gas tank I don't intend it to be opened?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Right.  I think that that's --


that's -- if there's -­


QUESTION: But that's not the expectation of

 MR. HUBACHEK: No, I think it's -- it's the


property -­


QUESTION: So this is a new test, I take it?


 MR. HUBACHEK: No.  Soldal establishes that even if


there is no invasion of privacy, there is still a Fourth


Amendment intrusion if there's a seizure of property.  This


is a meaningful interference with the -- your enjoyment of

the possession of your property.


 QUESTION: No, but the distinction between the two


cases, I take it, now is the intent of the owner of the


property that is disassembled.  In the one case, the owner


ultimately intends the crate to be opened up.  In the other


case, he does not intend the gas tank to be opened up.  Is,


is that it?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I don't think it's a


subjective test.  I think it would be -- we're talking about


reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment and -­


QUESTION: Well, if that -- it can't be that he


doesn't -- well, expected to be opened up.  If it's -- if


it's a container where things can be carried, one of the


things that the Government said in its brief is that if


luggage is free and then this will become the container of


choice, and we know that in a very high percentage there


have found drugs there.  So it is a container, we know it's


been used as a container.  Why should it not be treated like


any other container?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think it's different from


any other container because it's part of a vehicle that was


never expected or intended by its designers to be taken


apart in this manner.  But I would also say that there's


been 15 years of history in which, you know, courts of


appeals have applied Montoya to searches of property.  If

15 years ago, the Fifth Circuit rendered its decision 5


years ago.  The Government offered no evidence below that


there have been changes in smuggling patterns based upon


those courts' decisions applying a reasonable suspicion


standard.


 QUESTION: Yeah, but those -- those cases it didn't


involve gas tanks, if I understand correctly.


 MR. HUBACHEK: That's -- that's correct.  They


didn't involve gas tanks, but they involved vehicles, and


basically the theory was is that if smugglers -­


QUESTION: May I -- may I ask you a hypothetical? 


Supposing Congress passed a statute specifically authorizing


gas tank searches and providing in the statute that after


the search shall be conducted, the -- there will be two


people on hand, one, Mr. Goodwrench, and one Mr. Value


Appraiser, and they would have to give a good certificate,


both of them have to give a certificate that the value of


the car has not been impaired by what has been happened, and


if it has, the amount of value will be reimbursed


immediately by the Government to the owner.  Would that be a


constitutional statute?


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think that, you know, since


ultimately we're talking about reasonableness, that would

address some of the objections that I've made today, but I


still think -­


QUESTION: Would it -- would it cure enough of them


to be constitutional is the question?


 MR. HUBACHEK: I don't -- I don't think that it


would, because I still think that that's beyond what the


First Congress envisioned and that's a -- our best guide to


what the Fourth Amendment was intended to mean.  They didn't


authorize the disassembly of the ships that were coming into


port.  They didn't say that, you know, if you took two ship


builders on board.  What they said was, you can take apart


the packages, things that are intended to be opened, but you


have to have two witnesses, and if it turns out that there's


nothing in there, you have to -- the customs officer would


have to pay -­


QUESTION: My hypo gave you your two witnesses.


 MR. HUBACHEK: I -- I understand, Your Honor.


 QUESTION: If 85 percent of the people with the gas


tanks that were searched have the contraband, what you're


asking us to do is to protect the expectation of the other


15 percent.  I -- I suppose that's the rule, but it -- when


the percentages get these high, it -- it seems to me to put


the exclusionary rule somewhat into question with reference


to the border.  Suppose it was 95 percent.  Do we still have


to protect the 5 percent of the people?  I mean, I guess

that's the law.


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice Kennedy, there's no


showing that adopting the rule that we're asking for would


have any effect on the effect -- effectiveness of the border


searches.  There's no evidence offered below that, you know,


the -- if you deprive them of the ability to do random


searches that there will be even one more person who would


get through.  So I think that if they -­


QUESTION: Well, that works the other way around as


well.


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, that's true, but it would


still vest the absolute discretion across the border for any


customs inspector for no reason at all to disassemble


valuable property.  That's inconsistent with the history of


the Fourth Amendment, it's inconsistent with the Nation's


earliest statutes, it's even inconsistent with section 1461,


which applies directly to entries from contiguous countries,


and that -­


QUESTION: Well, for -- for no reason at all they


can -- they can conduct searches of -- of the person, right,


without any suspicion?  That's okay.


 MR. HUBACHEK: That's correct.


 QUESTION: The Gucci shoes and everything else. 


But somehow when you -- when you reach this -- this magical,


what, disassembly of a vehicle, that that has some special

constitutional status.  I -- I find that quite implausible.


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice Scalia, I think that


the importance is, is that it is very -- we're asking for a


standard that's -- comports with what was adopted in 1789


and 1790, and the 1461 statute that's currently applicable


talks about allowing the customs inspectors to look inside


the vehicle by providing a key, not by providing a lift or


providing tools, but by providing a key.  That's what's


reasonable, that's what's routine, that's what's should be


protected by the Fourth Amendment.


 QUESTION: Do you -- do you question the -- the


Government gave an example, I think from fiscal year 2003. 


They said 300 fuel tanks were disassembled and put back


along the southern border without incident, that is, no


explosion and no malfunction in the vehicles for the


travels.


 MR. HUBACHEK: I don't have any additional


information about those.  I mean, I don't know if that


violated those individuals' leases, whether they felt a lack


of security as was discussed in the Molina-Tarazon case,


whether their warranties were any way affected, they simply


don't have any information.


 QUESTION: But it would be a graver concern than a


warranty if the vehicle might blow up after.  And -- but


there doesn't seem to be any evidence of that, that there's

a high risk that that would occur.


 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, there's no risk -- apparently


there's no evidence of anything blowing up, but that doesn't


mean that individuals' security was implicated as they drove


away from the border knowing that their valuable property


had been altered by unknown government functionaries.


 If the Court has no further questions, I'll


submit.


 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hubachek.  Ms. Blatt, you


have three minutes remaining.


 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  Justice


Kennedy, you asked about the 25 percent figure, and in the


appendix to the petition at 12a, that 25 percent figure


relates to vehicle drug seizures, so what customs meant by


seizures was from the vehicle.  That wouldn't include stuff


found in someone's pockets.


 Justice Breyer, you asked about how we track


searches.  There's apparently a nationwide computer tracking


system where customs tracks all of their searches, both


positive and negative, and when there's a positive report


search, it's called a seizure.  When there's a negative,


it's called an incident report, and the agent is in fact


required to document what his reasons were -- were for

conducting the search, and the supervisor must read that,


and if there was a problem developing about improper use of


his resources at the border, the agent would be either


trained or disciplined.


 QUESTION: Are those public documents?


 MS. BLATT: I would doubt it.  I don't know,


Justice Kennedy, but given that it includes the reasons for


conducting the search, but I -- I just don't know.  I know


it's called the TECS, but I don't know whether that's public


or not.


 QUESTION: Is it public that such a thing exists? 


Is there -­


MS. BLATT: I've just made it public.


 (Laughter.)


 QUESTION: But -- but -- I mean besides your word


for it.  I trust you implicitly, but I'd like to be able to


cite something other than you.


 (Laughter.)


 MS. BLATT: I -- I'd have to go -­


QUESTION: Okay.


 MS. BLATT: -- on the Internet or something like


that, Justice Scalia.


 QUESTION: I don't want to cut you off if you had


something else to say.


 MS. BLATT: No, that was --

 QUESTION: I just want -- I do think it's correct


though, is it not, that what really we're asked to decide is


whether you have the power to make random searches?  I know


that they're costly and unlikely, but I think it -- it's --


it's not unlikely in today's world that you might decide you


want to search every one-hundredth vehicle or ever twenty-


fifth vehicle to let the world know that even if they hire


Ronald Coleman they might get searched.  That is correct,


isn't it?


 MS. BLATT: That's correct, Justice Stevens, and


it's quite conceivable if the country ever went on a red


alert that the commissioner of customs might say, or if


there was some vague intelligence about smuggling in pick-up


trucks, they might want to do very extensive searches of


pick-up trucks.  Now whether they'll actually ever come to


that I hope not, but yet, this -- the -- the border power -­


the power to conduct a border search is one without any


particularized suspicion.


 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Blatt. 


The case is submitted.


 (Whereupon, at 11:12 a.m., the case in the above-


entitled matter was submitted.)
