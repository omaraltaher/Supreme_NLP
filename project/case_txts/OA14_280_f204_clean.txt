BERNSTEIN           ON BEHALF OF THE COURT­APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE                   MR. BERNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may        it please the Court:                The issue is whether to decide the question        of Miller's retroactivity in this case or in a Federal           habeas case such as Johnson v. Manis, No. ­ on this           Court's docket.              In today's case there is no jurisdiction       over that question because the point of Section is          to enforce the Supremacy Clause. And the Supremacy         Clause States that when, quote, "the laws of the         United States," unquote, apply, quote, "the judges" ­­       and this is ­­ these are the key words ­­ "in every            State shall be bound thereby."                 There is no such thing as supreme Federal        law that depends on whether a particular State         voluntarily makes Federal precedence binding. When a        State does that, when a State voluntarily adopts         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review nonbinding Federal precedence, that creates no right       under Federal law, which is what requires, and         Michigan v. Long does not apply.                  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So how would you describe        the adequate and independent State ground on which        the ­­ this decision rested?                 MR. BERNSTEIN: I would say that the lack of           a binding Federal law question is an antecedent        requirement, to borrow the terminology of the S.G.'s        brief, before you get to the adequate and independent         State ground analysis.               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why don't we have        jurisdiction to answer that question?                 MR. BERNSTEIN: You certainly have      jurisdiction to answer the question whether Teague is        constitutionally required in State collateral review      courts.             The second part of our brief said why it is          not constitutionally required in State collateral review       courts, and that's basically this Court's precedence       from Danforth back to the beginning in Desist and in          Kaufman, have said that the Teague ­­ what have become          the Teague exceptions are matters of equitable       discretion and not matters of the Constitution, and the         Federal habeas statute on its face only applies in         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Federal court.              So the Federal habeas court can grant relief        if relief is warranted under the Teague exception.                    JUSTICE KENNEDY: If a State says, we         acknowledge that we are holding a prisoner in         contravention of Federal law but we choose to do nothing          about it, then the answer is Federal habeas corpus;         there is not a second answer that the State can be            required under the Supremacy Clause, under its own        procedures, to enforce the Federal law?                  And if ­­ if I'm ­­ and if I were to take ­­             to argue that second position, I'm not quite sure what          case I would have to support me. It wouldn't ­­                       MR. BERNSTEIN: Well, I think that Your         Honor's opinion for the Court in Martinez v. Ryan ­­                                 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.    MR. BERNSTEIN: ­­ Supreme Court at         to suggested that there are advantages to citing         the Federal habeas right in the Federal habeas statute         rather than what the Court called a freestanding         constitutional claim. A major advantage here is if you           say that the State courts are bound by the Teague          exceptions by the Constitution, then when it goes to         Federal habeas, there will be very deferential AEDPA        review. Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             If you say that the redress question, as the         rationale of Danforth indicated, in State court is a         matter of State law, then when the issue goes to Federal           habeas, AEDPA will not apply because the State court         will not have decided the Federal issue. And that is a            ­­ it is a major difference. You would actually be            weakening the Federal habeas statute to recognize       jurisdiction in this case.                And this Court will benefit from having de        novo percolation in the lower Federal courts, the lower         habeas courts, all of which will be out the window if           there's jurisdiction in this case, because the lower        Federal habeas courts will only be able, and the courts          reviewing them on appeal, to apply the highly        deferential AEDPA review.               JUSTICE KENNEDY: In effect, are you ­­ we         saying that the Supremacy Clause binds the States only         in direct criminal proceedings?                            MR. BERNSTEIN: No.    JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, is that another         way of phrasing your argument?                 MR. BERNSTEIN: It would be that the        Supremacy Clause only binds the States in direct        proceedings and in collateral proceedings where it's an        old rule, because that's the equivalent of a direct          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review proceeding. But if you are talking about the         retroactivity of a new rule, then the ­­ that's where           the Teague ­­ the two Teague exceptions apply. They          apply to new rules. They apply to collateral review.          And those are based in statutory equitable discretion        rather than the Constitution. But the Court has already          held that both direct review and the application of old          rules present Federal questions.                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you differentiate       this case from Standard Oil?                 MR. BERNSTEIN: Because in Standard Oil, the        issue was the underlying status of the Federal        government arm, and the Court said that question is         controlled by Federal law. Standard Oil is like Miller          itself, where the issue was: What does the Eighth          Amendment require? That's a Federal constitutional        issue it applied.               In Standard Oil, as a combination of statute         regulations and Federal common law, Federal law       controlled the question. Here the statute doesn't apply         in State court, as Danforth and numerous other cases         have held, like the Federal Rules of Evidence don't         apply in State court, even though many courts follow         similar provisions and certainly follow Federal      precedence in interpreting those similar rules.      Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But we did say that that         State could define the exemption any which way it         wanted.                         MR. BERNSTEIN: Correct.    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so it could ­­ it's         almost identical here; we would announce what the        Federal law is, send it back. The State has already           said it's going to follow Teague, but I guess it might            or might not be free to change its mind about doing           that.             MR. BERNSTEIN: I think the difference and         what makes this case special is that this Court has held           since Murdock v. City of Memphis, almost years ago,           U.S. at to , that the jurisdiction is           question by question. It is not like , case by           case. It is question by question.                   And I do not believe the Court has         jurisdiction to skip over the question of whether        Federal law applies and then answer the hypothetical if         Federal law applied, what would it be. I think the            question of whether Federal law applies is a        jurisdiction question.              JUSTICE BREYER: How ­­ how ­­ suppose ­­        let's think of the first Teague exception. Suppose ­­         substantive matters. Suppose that many States had        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review sedition laws that make certain conduct unlawful so        there are a thousand people in prison. This Court in a             new rule holds you cannot criminalize that behavior.        All right. What is the law that would make that           retroactive to people in prison? It sounds to me that           it isn't like some kind of statutory discretion.        Rather, there are human beings who are in prison, who          are there without having violated any valid law, because         it was always protected by the First Amendment.                    And if that's right, then it's the       Constitution, the Due Process Clause, that says they are         being held ­­ even though they committed the crime          years ago, they are now being held in confinement         without due process of law because you cannot        criminalize their behavior.                                                   MR. BERNSTEIN: Well ­­    JUSTICE BREYER: Do you see where I'm going?         MR. BERNSTEIN: Yes.    JUSTICE BREYER: That being so, it's a        Federal Constitution rule, the exceptions of Teague,       Teague drops out of the case. The only question is           whether they satisfy the two exceptions.                  MR. BERNSTEIN: Well, in your hypothetical,       respectfully, I don't think that would be a new rule.            It would be an old rule ­­      Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review JUSTICE BREYER: I've made it a new rule.          MR. BERNSTEIN: If it were ­­      JUSTICE BREYER: For purposes of my                                           hypothetical, I'm making it a new rule.                    rule ­­                         MR. BERNSTEIN: If it were a genuinely new          JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.    MR. BERNSTEIN: ­­ then under Danforth and        going all the way back, the ­­ Justice Harlan's opinion          in Mackey said, we're not creating the substantive        exception because the Constitution requires that ­­                  JUSTICE BREYER: Danforth was the case       saying that the States could be more generous. It          wasn't a case ­­ this is a case that ­­ the opposite of               being generous: Can they be more stingy? And I cannot             find anything in ­­ in Harlan ­­ maybe I'll read it           again, but I can't find anything there, nor can I find             anything in Danforth that answers the question.                   So I thought it is a new question. Hence,            that question I posed to you, because I want to get your              response. I don't think you can answer it by means of             precedent. I think you have to try to figure it out             without the help of precedent.                 MR. BERNSTEIN: Well, if it is a new rule,           the Court has held ­­ and sorry to cite a precedent ­­            Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             JUSTICE BREYER: That's all right.                  (Laughter.)             MR. BERNSTEIN: Linkletter has held that       retroactivity on collateral review is not      constitutional. That aspect ­­                JUSTICE BREYER: That's true. But then we         have Teague, and Teague is saying we don't like         Linkletter ­­ and ­­ and ­­                 MR. BERNSTEIN: But Teague said, we don't        like Linkletter.              JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But you're        saying that we have ­­ then maybe that's wrong.                                 MR. BERNSTEIN: Because ­­    JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, why doesn't it         violate the Constitution to hold a person in prison for            years for conduct which the Constitution forbids        making criminal?              MR. BERNSTEIN: Well, it does violate the        Constitution.             JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it wasn't criminal at        the time. I mean, it wasn't prohibited by the           Constitution at the time he was convicted, right?                                            MR. BERNSTEIN: Fair enough.     JUSTICE BREYER: That would be the reason.        MR. BERNSTEIN: Fair enough. But the ­­ the          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Constitution, according to the cases, is satisfied by        the Federal habeas remedy. I think this is where           Schweiker v. ­­              JUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything else you        can say? Because I can make ­­ you know, I can say,               which witch is being a witch? There were some people in             Salem who were imprisoned for being a witch. And lo and             behold in , it was held by this Court that that           violated the Constitution.               Now, you see, I just make a more outrageous           example of the same thing.                             MR. BERNSTEIN: Well ­­    JUSTICE BREYER: And ­­ and what I want you           to say, okay, I got your point. It didn't violate the             Constitution at the time. I've also got the point you           have some authority.               Anything else?              MR. BERNSTEIN: This Court has been       reluctant, even when there is a violation of the Due           Process Clause, to create a judicial remedy, an implied          judicial remedy on top of the Federal statutory remedy.         That's Schweiker v. Chilicky, cited in our briefs. And          I think you should be especially reluctant ­­                   JUSTICE KAGAN: But that's ­­ that's not        what is happening here, Mr. Bernstein ­­ I mean, if you            Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review assume the premise of Justice Breyer's question, which        is that there is a Constitutional violation in keeping          somebody in prison for some conduct that can't be         criminalized.             The State has set up a collateral review         mechanism. We're not asking it to set up a new            mechanism that it hasn't had before. It has a          collateral review mechanism, and the only question is        whether it's going to comply with Federal constitutional        law in that collateral review mechanism.                  MR. BERNSTEIN: And the other question is        whether that issue of retroactivity is itself a Federal          constitutional issue. If it is, obviously there's        jurisdiction. If it is not, I would submit there is not             jurisdiction, and that the proper remedy is Federal        habeas.             Thank you.              If I may reserve the remainder of my time.          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   Mr. Plaisance.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK D. PLAISANCE                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER                 MR. PLAISANCE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may        it please the Court:                Miller v. Alabama established a new       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review substantive rule prohibiting mandatory life without      parole for juveniles, which should be applied       retroactively.             This Court has jurisdiction to hear Henry       Montgomery's claim because the Louisiana Supreme Court       relied exclusively on Federal jurisprudence.                 In Miller, this Court held that mandatory       life in prison was unconstitutional. It also held that          life in prison would be an uncommon, rare sentence, even          today.             JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it just like a        State saying: We have a Fourth Amendment, and the           Federal Constitution has a Fourth Amendment; we are         going to apply our own Constitution, but in applying it,          we will follow the Federal precedent?                    I think we would say, in that case, the case         has been decided on the State constitutional ground,        even though the State court, in interpreting that        ground, is looking to Federal decisions.                  MR. PLAISANCE: In this case, Your Honor,        the Louisiana Supreme Court did not state that it was          exercising any independent grounds at all. Under        Michigan v. Long ­­               JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that the ­­ the          case it cited said that.     Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review MR. PLAISANCE: Well ­­    JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it cited an                                 earlier Louisiana Supreme Court case which made it very         clear that it was following the Federal rule as a matter            of discretion and not because ­­ not because it had to,           and it could in a later opinion decide not to follow            Federal law.              MR. PLAISANCE: It is my interpretation of        that earlier case that the Louisiana Supreme Court said,         we have a choice, and they made the choice to apply            Teague. In fact, they said in that opinion, we are           dictated by the Teague analysis. And that's what was          done in this case.                            Under Michigan v. ­­   JUSTICE ALITO: Did they not say in Taylor         that they were not bound to follow Teague? Didn't they           say, we're going to follow Teague but we ­­ we want to            make it clear we're not bound to do that?                                 MR. PLAISANCE: They did say that.       JUSTICE ALITO: They've never ­­      they've never retracted that, have they?                 MR. PLAISANCE: Correct, but the       choice itself is not necessarily a matter of State          law. While   the Supreme Court had the authority to make         that decision, it said, we believe ­­ by choosing         Teague, we  Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review believe that is the better law, and therefore, we will          follow the Federal guidelines from Teague, the Federal        jurisprudence, in doing so.                And I believe that under Michigan v. Long,         unless they state a clear and independent ground, this          Court can conclusively presume that they applied Federal        law as they believed this Court would apply ­­                    JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I thought ­­ I         thought it's unless they clearly state otherwise, we        will assume that they're applying Federal law. And here          they did clearly state otherwise. They said, we don't          have to follow Federal law, but we're going to model our           State law on Federal law. It seems to me that satisfies            the ­­ the exception requirement of ­­ of Michigan.                     MR. PLAISANCE: It is my opinion that        Michigan v. Long indicates the reverse, Your Honor, that         the State must say, we are following State law in making           this decision. We're applying State law rather than         Federal law.              JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they did say that        here. They said that. This is a matter of State law;              we don't have to follow Teague, but we choose to as a            matter of State law. I thought that's what they said.                        MR. PLAISANCE: And I believe that that's         sufficient to indicate to this Court that it is applying          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Federal law; it is not applying State law.                    JUSTICE KAGAN: But Mr. Plaisance, I think         what people are saying to you is that this is different           from your standard Michigan v. law question ­­ Long         question. It's a different question. It's a State that             says, we're not bound to follow Teague, we know we can           do something different, but we want to follow Teague.         That's what we want to do.                  And then in ­­ in all its particulars. All          right? And then the question is: If the State commits            to following Teague, it's not ­­ it doesn't think         anybody else has committed it. It self­commits to         following Teague and to following Federal law. Then         what happens? Is there enough of a Federal question to            decide this case?               Now, that's not a Michigan v. Long question.         It's more like a Merrell Dow question or something like           that, where Federal law is ­­ the State has chosen it,           but it's just part and parcel of the claim, because the           State is so committed to following Federal law in all          its particulars.              MR. PLAISANCE: I agree with Your Honor.         And even in Danforth, this Court said that the question          of retroactivity is a pure question of Federal law.                      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what's ­­      Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review MR. PLAISANCE: That ­­    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Why                                don't you finish?               MR. PLAISANCE: That's the answer to ­­ to         your ­­ to your explanation or hypothetical, that you ­­         you said if the State decided that they were choosing          Federal law, then what ­­ what's the next step? And in            the next step the question is retroactivity, which both         the majority and the dissent in Danforth said the         question of retroactivity is a pure question of Federal          law.             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Federal statutory      law, right? I thought that was the point of Danforth,            that the reason the States can go beyond what the          Federal interpretation is is because we're talking about        the Federal habeas statute. Right?                  MR. PLAISANCE: That's correct, Your Honor,       but even in Yates, this Court said that on State habeas,           if the State considers the merits of the Federal claim.          And the merits of this claim are: Is Mr. Montgomery           serving an unconstitutional sentence? Is Miller       retroactive to address the fact that he's serving an         unconstitutional sentence?              JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you deal with        Mr. Bernstein's point that your client would be worse         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review off if ­­ if you are correct? That is, if the question             comes up on Federal habeas, then the Federal court         decide ­­ decides it without any AEDPA problem. But if           the State court goes first, then the Federal review is          truncated.             MR. PLAISANCE: That would be my       understanding, Your Honor, that while Mr. ­­ while        Henry ­­ while jurisdiction in this Court does not         depend on what has occurred so far, it depends upon what           this Court does decide. But again, whether he can go to            Federal court or this Court doesn't affect this        jurisdiction that this Court, I believe, has today. And           the question is: If ­­                 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in ­­ in ­­ how do          you answer the argument: All right, suppose you're         right, but your victory is going to leave your client in           a worse position because when he gets to the Federal          court, he will be saddled with AEDPA?                   MR. PLAISANCE: Well, not if this Court        rules it has jurisdiction and makes Miller retroactive.        Then obviously, at that point, he would not be going to           Federal court.              And the question is: Is Mr. Montgomery        being held unconstitutionally? This Court in Miller        said that a mandatory life­in­prison sentence is        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review unconstitutional because it fails to address the fact of         the matter that this Court believed kids are different.                     JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Plaisance, on the       jurisdictional point, let me see if I understand what          you're arguing. A lot of State rules of procedure are            modeled after Federal Rules of Procedure, and a lot of           State courts simply follow the Federal Rules. But they          follow it as a matter of choice and not because they            think they're bound by the Federal rules.                   So let's say that there is a ­­ a          disagreement in Federal court about what Federal Rule of         Evidence means. The State court says, well, you          know, we're going to follow the ­­ the Federal rule, and           we think that the right course as between these two          divergent Federal courts of appeals is the Second        Circuit. So we're going to follow the Second Circuit's          interpretation of Federal Rule . What ­­ would we          have jurisdiction to ­­ to review that decision as ­­ as           a decision on a question of Federal law?                     MR. PLAISANCE: If it was clear to this         Court that the State court made a conscious choice and           sent enough of a signal to this Court that it was            adopting Federal law to use as State law. But in this            case, there is no indication that the State of ­­         Supreme Court of Louisiana was making that decision.        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review They said that we are ­­ our analysis is dictated by           Teague, and in doing so, they found that Mr. ­­ they           would not apply Miller retroactively. That's the real         issue of this case.                 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose we hold that we can        review the ­­ the ­­ we have jurisdiction because the          State court said it was going to follow Teague. And           then we go on and we say that under Teague, Miller can            be applied on collateral review. And then the case goes           back to the Louisiana Supreme Court, and they say, well,          we said previously in Taylor that we were going to          follow Teague, but that was based on our understanding         of Teague at that time. But now that we see what it's             been interpreted to mean by the U.S. Supreme Court,         we're not going to follow Teague. Then what would          happen?             MR. PLAISANCE: I think Louisiana would be         bound to follow this Court's ruling as you set forth.          It's ­­             JUSTICE ALITO: It would be? Why? Because          it said that we would voluntarily follow it in Taylor?          That bound them?               MR.

In doing so, it must follow this          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Court's jurisprudence, as I've said before.                  JUSTICE SCALIA: They changed their mind.       They have now chosen the course not to follow our          jurisprudence. What forces them to stay where they         were? It's a matter of State law. They've decided,            we're going to change State law.                    MR.

And doesn't that make us look foolish?                                   MR. PLAISANCE: No, it doesn't, Your Honor.        JUSTICE SCALIA: That we render decisions       that can be overruled by somebody else?                   MR.

PLAISANCE: Thank you.     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Dreeben.                                                                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN         ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,                           SUPPORTING PETITIONER               MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,       and may it please the Court:                  This Court does have jurisdiction to decide       the question of Miller's retroactivity, because      Louisiana has voluntarily incorporated into its law a        wholly Federal standard.               And in this Court's decisions in Standard       Oil, Merrell Dow, Three Affiliated Tribes, and most        recently, Ohio v. Reiner, the Court has recognized that         when a State chooses to adopt Federal law to guide its            decisions and binds itself to Federal law, there is a          Federal question.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think they        can change ­­                          MR. DREEBEN: The United States ­­      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They can change       their mind, right? You said "voluntarily chose to         follow it."  Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review MR. DREEBEN: That's right.     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And      they can                          voluntarily  choose they're not going to      follow it  anymore.             MR. DREEBEN: That's right.                 And the same is true in any        Michigan v. Long   case. What    Michigan v. Long said is that this Court has         jurisdiction under Section to resolve State court        resolutions of Federal law, and it will presume that a          State constitutional decision of a mirror image, say, of          the Fourth Amendment, will be binding, but recognized        that the only circumstance in which the Court will not          treat Federal law as governing both questions is when         the State makes clear that it would reach the same          result under State constitutional law as it did under         Federal law.              It did not preclude the option of the State         going back and reaching a different decision once         enlightened by this Court as to the content of Federal          law.             Standard Oil is completely clear on this.       It says the State chose to use Federal law to determine           whether a Federal post exchange was a Federal          instrumentality. And we're going to correct its        understanding of Federal law.    Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             But on remand, the State can now, freed from         its misapprehensions of Federal law, decide what it        thinks State law requires. And if it does that, then           there may be a Federal constitutional question.                    JUSTICE BREYER: How ­­ how ­­ how does it          work? It ­­ it should be pretty elementary, but ­­ I            mean, I looked at the Indian case, and that seems a            little far out.               The ­­ the ­­ the ­­ though it definitely         gives you support on your statement here, suppose you         took Justice Scalia's example: We have Iowa State Rule          . We interpret Iowa State Rule the same way as the             Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. That's our rule. And           now this is what it means in that case. And they say,             but we're doing it under Iowa State rule.                    Now, you say we can review that because they         said that Iowa State rule is the same as the Federal.                                                           MR. DREEBEN: So I ­­ I ­­         JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right?      MR. DREEBEN: I ­­     JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I just ­­ how do you           fit that in the words in ?                   MR. DREEBEN: Well, I doubt ­­ I doubt that            that would satisfy the Court.                 There's a theoretical answer, and then       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review there's a practical answer. Let me give the practical           answer first.              The States that copy the Federal Rules of        Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil ­­                               JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.    MR. DREEBEN: ­­ Procedure pretty uniformly       say, we will treat Federal precedent as guidance in our          decisions as ­­ for its persuasive value. They         recognize that there are State rules of procedure and         State rules of evidence that will belong to the State.                      JUSTICE BREYER: Well, they say in a        particular case, it's guidance. It's great guidance.        We agree. Our interpretation is the Federal        interpretation.             MR. DREEBEN: Well, I ­­ I think that ­­                       JUSTICE BREYER: Now, can we review that ­­        because, in fact, it wasn't the Federal interpretation?        But can we review it?                 MR. DREEBEN: I ­­ I ­­                    JUSTICE BREYER: Yes or no?                  MR. DREEBEN: There ­­ there is a        distinction between this case and that that may suggest         that this case, the Court has jurisdiction over, and         that one, the Court does not.                  JUSTICE BREYER: So you say the Court does         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review not in the example of the Federal Rules of Civil          Procedure that Justice Scalia gave?                 case.                         MR. DREEBEN: I think this is a stronger           JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. It's a thought.         MR. DREEBEN: I'm doubtful that the Court        would have jurisdiction or choose to exercise it,        because ­­ I accept, for premises of the argument, Your           Honor's hypothetical. But in the real world, it doesn't          happen.             JUSTICE ALITO: Well, but when you say that         that's a doubtful case, I think you are implicitly           acknowledging that, if we adopt your argument, we are         going to get that case and lots of similar cases, and           we're going to have to parse the words that were ­­          were ­­ the words that were used by the State Supreme           Court: Well, we're following ­­ we're going to be          guided by it. We're going to be strongly guided by it.            We're going to adopt it. We're going to get all of            those cases.                                      Why should we go down that road ­­       MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think the Court ­­         JUSTICE ALITO: ­­ when there's a perfectly         available and possibly superior remedy available to the        Petitioner by filing a Federal habeas petition?        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             MR. DREEBEN: So there are several reasons,        Justice Alito.              First of all, I don't think that it is          that ­­ going to come up in that way to this Court,            because that's not the way States treat their own rules          of procedure. I don't think it will be very difficult.                        There is a principle in the Court's cases         that when Federal law has been adopted as Federal law,          the Court will review it even if the State could have           chosen a different path.                 So ­­             problem ­­ JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Dreeben, what's the                   JUSTICE KENNEDY: Pardon me.                 Did you misspeak? When ­­ when Federal law         is adopted as State law, the Federal courts can review          it. Isn't that what you meant to say? Or ­­ or ­­ I               mean, you're very ­­ you're very careful, and you don't          make mistakes, but I ­­                 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I ­­ I think, Justice           Kennedy ­­             JUSTICE KENNEDY: You ­­ you said ­­                   MR. DREEBEN: This is ­­ this is what I'm          trying to ­­              JUSTICE KENNEDY: ­­ when ­­ when State law         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review adopts Federal law as Federal law, then there's review.         Okay.             MR. DREEBEN: The State has adopted Teague        for a reason that does not exist in any of these civil             procedure cases, and that is that the State knows that          that Federal law will be applied to the very case in a            habeas case. So the State has decided consciously to          synchronize its law with the law that it knows will be           applied.             And this actually serves a very important        Federalism purpose. The State says, if we have to          rectify in ­­ a ­­ a constitutional error in our case             that's become final, we would like the opportunity to do          it. And if the Federal habeas court is going to treat            this decision as retroactive, we would like the first         crack at it.               California ­­             JUSTICE SCALIA: You're ­­ you're ­­ you're        saying "hooray" that ­­ that the Federal habeas court         will thereafter be bound by it ­­                              MR. DREEBEN: No, because ­­     JUSTICE SCALIA: ­­ because the State got        there first.              MR. DREEBEN: No. There's an elementary        reason why that's not so, Justice Scalia, and this         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review answers Justice Ginsburg's question earlier.                 (d) applies to State determinations on      the merits. That's the only time that the deference          provision kicks in. And a determination under Teague is           a threshold determination that comes before the decision        on the merits. This Court has said that in any number            of cases. It's not a merits resolution of the case. So              deference to a State determination on retroactivity        would never occur.               What I ­­               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you ­­                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to          suggest maybe we hear a little bit more on the merits.                        MR. DREEBEN: Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice.                   The ­­ the rule in Miller v. Alabama, in our          view, is a substantive rule, because it goes far beyond           merely regulating the procedure by which youths are        sentenced for homicide crimes. It compelled the State         to adopt new substantive sentencing options, an option        that is less severe than life without parole.                    The only other time that this Court has ever         invalidated a mandatory sentencing provision was       Woodson v. North Carolina in . So we went something           like years before we had another decision that         concluded that the law must change to accommodate the         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review compelling interests in having the characteristics of       youth that mitigate culpability considered in the       sentencing process.               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it be      enough ­­ is ­­ is it enough if the States simply say,            okay, with respect to people who have been mandatorily         sentenced to life without parole, we're going to provide         parole?             MR. DREEBEN: Yes. I believe that it would           be. That would be the same remedy that the Court           ordered in a Graham v. Florida case for ­­ which is the             case that held that youths who do not commit homicide          but are convicted of other crimes cannot be sentenced to          life without parole at all.                 And the Court's remedy for that problem       could either be a sentence of term of years, but it            could also be simply converting the life­without­parole       sentence to a life­with­parole sentence.                              So that would be ­­    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Dreeben, how do you        explain how your articulation of your test wouldn't        apply to the guideline changes in Booker that we made?                      MR. DREEBEN: So I ­­ I think, Justice           Sotomayor, the key difference is that, with respect to         the guidelines, there was always a ­­ a minimum and a             Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review maximum set by statute. And the guidelines, even when          they were mandatory, did not preclude judges from        sentencing outside the guidelines, depending upon the       presence of aggravating or mitigating factors that       weren't taken into account.                And as Justice Alito's opinion for the Court        in United States v. Rodriguez recognized, even the top         of a mandatory guidelines range was not truly mandatory.          So even under the mandatory guidelines, which for Sixth         Amendment purposes were treated as if they established        elements of the offense, for the purposes that we're         looking at here, they are not mandatory in the same way,           so that Booker brought about a procedural change.                     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is the substantive       difference ­­ if you pardon the use of that word ­­          between your formulation and Petitioner's formulation?                  He says this is substantive because it did        away with mandatory life imprisonment. You're       articulating it slightly different. Tell me what you         see as the difference and why your articulation is ­­                     MR. DREEBEN: Justice Sotomayor, I don't        think there is any substantive, to use the word,         daylight between Petitioner's position and ours. The        description of the crime at issue as punishable by         mandatory life imprisonment and treating that as a        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review category, I think, sums up the reality of what is           happening.             We broke it out into its component parts        because I think it facilitates the analysis of it to           understand that Miller does have a procedural component.         Sentencing courts must now consider the mitigating       characteristics of age, but it also, and more        fundamentally in our view, contains a substantive        component that required a change in the law.                     Now, the change here was expanding the range        of outcomes. Previously when this Court has analyzed         substantive changes in the law, there have been changes         that restricted the form of outcome; say, for example,         in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, forbidding punishment      at all.              But I think that if you trace back the          origins of the substantive category to Justice Harlan's        opinion in Mackey, this is still faithful to what         Justice Harlan had in mind. Justice Harlan said the          clearest case of an injustice in not applying a rule           retroactively is when it puts off­limits altogether       criminal punishment. He did not say that it was the           only case.              And I think that if you consider what is          going on in Miller and the reasons for the rule, the           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Court made very clear that it believed that of the ,           people that were in prison and under mandatory life for          juvenile homicide, the Court believed that that penalty        was frequently disproportionate, that it would be       uncommonly imposed in the future, and that it was not a           sentence that was consistent in most cases with the         mitigating characteristics of youth that have been       recognized in Roper and in Graham and then in Miller.                      JUSTICE ALITO: Would it be accurate to say         that a rule is substantive if it makes a particular            outcome less likely or much less likely or much, much          less likely than was previously the case?                   MR. DREEBEN: Probably the last, Justice       Alito. When ­­ when the Court characterized substantive         rules, most recently in the Summerlin opinion ­­                   JUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference      between much less likely and much, much less likely?                     MR. DREEBEN: Well, I would put it in the           words that the Court has used previously. The Court has           said that a substantive rule creates a significant risk           that the person is serving a sentence that's not          appropriate for that person, maybe not even legally        available for that purpose. It did not say absolutely          conclusively proves it. It said significant risk.                    And in contrast, when the Court has talked        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review about procedural rules, rules that govern the manner in         which a case is adjudicated, it has said that the           likelihood or potential for a different outcome is         speculative.             And I think if you put this case on the           speculative­significant risk axis, this case falls in       the significant risk domain precisely because of the        reasons why the Court said it was deciding Miller.                     The reasons why the Court decided Miller had        to do with the reduced culpability of youth and the          capacity of youth to mature, change, and achieve a         degree of rehabilitation that is consistent with       something less than the most harsh sentence available        for youths who commit murder ­­ a terrible crime, but           still the harshest sentence, the Court thought, would be         reserved for the worst of the worst, which is, in fact,           what Louisiana said when it amended its statutes        substantively to conform them to Miller. It said life          without parole should be reserved for the worst        offenders who commit the worst crimes.                  And so when you combine the fact that this         is not a rule that ­­ that only governs procedure ­­ it             doesn't just govern evidence; it also mandates changes        in outcomes as an available option ­­ with the very          genesis of the Miller rule in a conclusion that, for the            Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review people in this class, the appropriateness of the        punishment of the harshest degree, life without parole,        will be relatively uncommon, it seems clear that the         Miller rule falls on the substantive side of the axis          rather than on the procedural side of the axis.                     JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have any States treated       Miller as retroactive ­­                                       MR. DREEBEN: Yes.    JUSTICE GINSBURG: ­­ on State habeas?       MR. DREEBEN: Yes. The majority of        States ­­ it's a close call. I think it's maybe about              ten to seven or ten to eight. But the majority of            States that have reviewed this have concluded that        Miller is retroactive. Most of them have done it as a            matter of substantive law. There are a couple of           opinions that talk about the watershed exception, which        is not the way that we think that this case should be            analyzed.             But not only the ­­ the States have done         that, but the United States has taken that position with          respect to the juveniles that were sentenced before        Miller to life without parole as a mandatory sentence.          And in the resentencings of those that have taken place          so far ­­ it's only been about ten, but those ­­ those            defendants have almost uniformly received sentences that       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review are terms of years significantly shorter than life.                    JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what is the population        we're dealing with if most States do apply Miller         retroactively? I think that there was a figure of ,             people with life without parole.                 MR. DREEBEN: I haven't broken it down ­­         may I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?                               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.     MR. DREEBEN: I have not broken it down          numerically, Justice Ginsburg, but Michigan has not       applied it retroactively, and it has a very large          population of juveniles who are in the Miller class.         And I don't think that Pennsylvania has resolved it,          certainly not favorably yet for the defendants.                                           CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       MR. DREEBEN: Thank you.     CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Duncan.                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. S. KYLE DUNCAN                      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                 MR. DUNCAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:                 I was going to begin by saying I would         proceed directly to the merits, but I gather from the           drift of the argument that the Court has serious         questions about jurisdiction, and so I'd like to briefly         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review begin there.              We're in an odd position with respect to        jurisdiction because we won below and we'd win in the          Fifth Circuit on Federal habeas, which has found that         Miller is not retroactive. Why then do we not contest           jurisdiction?             We believe and still believe that this is a         straightforward case. Not ­­ and Justice Kagan, it's         not a standard Michigan v. Long case, but it's an           interwoven case, meaning that the ­­ the State court         took Teague lock, stock, and barrel.                  Now, there is no doubt, Justice Scalia, that        in the ­­ in the Taylor ­­ in the previous Louisiana           Supreme Court opinions, that the State said we are         voluntarily adopting Teague. There is no doubt about         that. So we think the question is whether that raises           the possibility of an advisory opinion from this Court.         And why do we say it doesn't?                   Well, because in cases like Coleman v.       Thompson and Eddings v. Oklahoma, the Court said where         the Federal law holding is integral to the State court's          disposition of the matter, there is no risk of an          advisory opinion. And later, in Coleman, the Court said          only if resolution of the Federal issue in court could          not affect the judgment is it at risk of an advisory           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review opinion.             So here we don't think there is a risk of an            advisory opinion. Of course, it is within the realm of           possibility. We doubt that it's going to happen, but it           could happen that on remand the Louisiana Supreme Court         could say, well, we've seen what you think about Teague          and we're going to adopt our own retroactivity        standards, as some States have done. They could do          that. The question is: Does that make this Court's           opinion advisory? And we think not.                   The Solicitor General ­­ the Assistant      Solicitor General has talked about cases like Standard        Oil v. Johnson, where the ­­ the State was under no           obligation to tether its State law to Federal standards,         and ­­             JUSTICE SCALIA: It didn't say so, though.        In ­­ in ­­ in Standard Oil, the ­­ this is a quote from               the opinion: "The relationship between Post Exchanges;        and the government of the United States is controlled by          Federal law."              MR. DUNCAN: Right. That's right. My         point, Justice Scalia, is that the ­­ the tax ­­ that           was embedded in a tax­exemption statute. The tax          exemption made certain taxes exempt from the statute,        and ­­ and the exemption ­­     Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that would have been        true no matter what the State did, right?                                MR. DUNCAN: Well, no, the State ­­       JUSTICE SCALIA: We're deciding a question        of Federal law that ­­ that would have applied on its           own.             MR. DUNCAN: Well ­­ well, no ­­ well, with          respect to Standard Oil, I think the ­­ my point is, is             that the State didn't have to make its tax­exemption         status turn on a Federal question. It did, and so the             Court had jurisdiction to resolve it. That's all.                     JUSTICE ALITO: Well, don't you think that        the State made its tax­exemption law turn on Federal law          because there are Federal constitutional requirements in       that area? Could the ­­ could the State have taxed ­­ I             mean, there was the question of whether or not the ­­          the Supremacy Clause would permit the State to tax sales          to the Post Exchanges.                MR. DUNCAN: I think that's possible, but         this Court didn't make its jurisdiction dependent on        that. And so take a case like Ohio v. Reiner ­­                        JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it did. In the         provision I just quoted, it said that the relationship          between Post Exchanges and the government of the United         States is controlled by Federal law. That's what our          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review opinion says.              MR. DUNCAN: Well, so take the ­­ the         Assistant Solicitor General brought up the case of Ohio         v. Reiner, where a State made its transactional immunity          statute turn on the validity of a Fifth Amendment          privilege. This Court ­­ this Court addressed that         embedded and discrete Federal issue with ­­                  JUSTICE KAGAN: And Mr. Duncan, isn't it        quite similar when Justice Scalia used this "controlled"        language? The Louisiana Supreme Court has used similar         language. It's dictated by Teague. Now, it's only          dictated by Teague because they've chosen to make it         dictated by Teague, but once that choice has been made,          all outcomes are dictated by Teague. It's the same          issue.             MR. DUNCAN: Well, we think ­­ we agree with          that. We think it's binding ­­ quote/unquote, "binding"         within the meaning of binding Federal law, because the         State has chosen to do it and it's never shown that it            wouldn't do it. You know, so ­­ we ­­ we think that.             Look, if the Court disagrees with us on that, we don't           take a position ­­                JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in Ohio v. Reiner,        which you just cited, was there any other way in which           the State could have obtained review of the State         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review supreme court's erroneous determination that the witness       in question there did not have a Fifth Amendment          privilege because she said that she didn't commit the         crime?             this ­­             MR. DUNCAN: Well, I don't think so, because          JUSTICE ALITO: And do you think that's not         a distinction between that case and this case?                    MR. DUNCAN: Well, if ­­ if ­­ if the          Teague ­­ if the Teague standard is a discrete Federal           standard that the State has made ­­ has ­­ has          incorporated, then the only way ­­ well, the Louisiana         Supreme Court could ­­ the defendant could go to Federal          habeas, sure, and you could get an interpretation that         way.             But it doesn't seem to us that the        difference between Federal habeas and review of the        State supreme court decision makes any difference with        respect to this Court's jurisdiction. It might mean         that this Court would wait, you know, for a ­­ for ­­ I              don't know, a more robust split to develop and take a            Federal case that way.                But in this case ­­ and this ­­ this goes to           the second reason why we haven't strongly contested        jurisdiction at all ­­ because there is a robust split           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review on this direct ­­ on this specific issue that extends to           something like State and Federal courts, they're all         deciding the same Federal issue, so it seems to us that           as a practical matter, this Court ought to weigh in.           It's going to weigh in sooner or later. It's going to            weigh in either on a Federal habeas case or from a State              court.             JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we weigh in when we         have jurisdiction. You don't think that matters at all?                      MR. DUNCAN: No, of course jurisdiction       matters, Justice Scalia. We just ­­ of course it does.                       JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, so what you said        doesn't make much sense.                            MR. DUNCAN: Well, I think it makes sense.          JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's get in there quickly,        whether we have jurisdiction or not. You're not saying          that, are you?               MR. DUNCAN: Well, no, we're not saying        that. We're not saying that. We're saying if the           Federal issue is genuinely interwoven with State law and         there's no independent State grounds, then this Court        has jurisdiction to decide the question. Otherwise,        it's going to have to wait for a Federal habeas case.                        Proceeding to the merits: In Miller, this        Court was invited ­­   Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             JUSTICE BREYER: We clearly have      jurisdiction, don't we? Why ­­ I'm just trying to          figure this out in my mind.                  We have jurisdiction where there is a       person ­­ that's the defendant ­­ and the defendant says          the court's decision ­­ that's your court's decision ­­        is contrary to the Constitution or statute of the         United States. That's just what they say.                    MR. DUNCAN: That answers the question ­­                   JUSTICE BREYER: So we have jurisdiction to        answer the question.               Now, the question is: How do we dispose of          the case ­­              MR. DUNCAN: Exactly.                JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ in which we have        jurisdiction? And in three instances, I guess, the          Court has done, in disposing of such a case, what the            Solicitor General says; namely, they have said, we        are ­­ we are not going to say whether he's right in            saying it's contrary to the Constitution. That's        because there might be an adequate State ground; there         might not be. Their adequate State ground was one that           was ­­ was elucidated or explained as being ­­ flowing          from a certain interpretation of Federal law.                    MR. DUNCAN: Well, that's ­­     Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             JUSTICE BREYER: We will say their       interpretation of Federal law was wrong, and now we'll         send it back to see what they do.                                it right?              the way ­­  MR. DUNCAN: Yes. The cases that we all ­­          JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? Have I got           MR. DUNCAN: That's our position. And by                     JUSTICE SCALIA: What is ­­ what is the         Federal law you're talking about?                 Miller.             MR. DUNCAN: The application of Teague to        JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. That's not a Federal          law, it's ­­ the Federal habeas statue is a Federal law,            right?                         MR. DUNCAN: Well, the interpretation ­­      JUSTICE SCALIA: And Teague is an       interpretation of that Federal law.                             MR. DUNCAN: Well ­­    JUSTICE SCALIA: Was that Federal law at        issue in this case?                standard ­­                         MR. DUNCAN: The Teague ­­ the Teague        JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it wasn't.       JUSTICE BREYER: But the Teague standard ­­       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review the Teague exceptions could well be constitutionally       required. The Teague exception ­­                 said that?              apply.             JUSTICE SCALIA: Have we ­­ have we ever         JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ means Teague doesn't       MR. DUNCAN: You have not. That's why we          don't take a position on it. That's particularly ­­                      this case?              JUSTICE SCALIA: You want us to hold that in          MR. DUNCAN: We do not want you to hold that           in this case, Your Honor.                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did we say the        opposite in Danforth, or did the majority say the         opposite in Danforth?               MR. DUNCAN: You left the question open in         Danforth, Your Honor.               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me why        you would think that something like Atkins would not be          retroactive to States? As a compulsion, meaning not as           by election of Teague retroactivity.                 MR. DUNCAN: That is a difficult question         that we don't take a position on.                    But to answer your question, Justice      Sotomayor, the ­­ the ­­ the argument goes that Danforth          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review made clear that Teague is an ­­ is an equitable          interpretation to Federal habeas statute, it's not       constitutionally binding on the States, and the Court        left open whether the exceptions are binding, but the         exceptions were part and parcel of Justice Harlan's        Mackey understanding of ­­ of how he thought Federal         habeas ought to apply.                 And so whereas ­­ whereas Atkins ­­ I mean,         Atkins creates a binding constitutional right. The         question of remedy, though. The question is: Is the           State constitutionally bound to offer that remedy? And         this Court has recognized, in cases like Pennsylvania v.         Finley, for example, that States have wide discretion in         structuring their post­conviction.               And the ­­ the next point, though, has to do          with finality.              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It has to do something        different, because as Justice Breyer pointed out, you        have wide discretion to structure it as you want, but if           you structured it in a way that you're going to say, I'm             offering due process, isn't there a check, a substantive           check by due process ­­                            MR. DUNCAN: Well ­­    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ that you have to        offer the minimum?   Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             MR. DUNCAN: Well, I mean, that is ­­ that           is the question. So this Court has found that there's a            substantive check on due process in Griffith, where        we're talking about direct review.                 When we're talking about collateral     review ­­ I mean, our view, although we haven't taken a            position on it, collateral review is a different animal          for purposes of ­­               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But we have any number        of cases where States have viewed the exceptions as         controlling the fact that they have to offer the         constitutional minimum.              that.                                     MR. DUNCAN: But this Court has never held         JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Hasn't yet.     MR. DUNCAN: Unless ­­    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And why shouldn't we?                   MR. DUNCAN: I understand.                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's really the      serious question.              MR. DUNCAN: It ­­ it ­­ it is a serious            question. We ­­ we ­­ and, again, we have not taken a             position on that question because we feel that this case          is interwoven with Federal law as a matter of State           retroactivity. Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             In Miller, this ­­ on to the merits: In          Miller, this Court was invited to categorically bar the         penalty of life without parole for juveniles who commit         murder, but it decided not to do so.                    Now, that decision leads directly to the       conclusion, in our view, that Miller is not a         substantive rule under Teague's first exception.      Consideration of the Teague framework, Teague policies,       and Teague precedent points instead to the conclusion        that Miller is a procedural and not a substantive rule.                        So we think Summerlin most helpfully sets       out the framework that ought to govern this question.                                             JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Duncan ­­     MR. DUNCAN: Yes.    JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ can I give you just a           hypothetical? I mean ­­                             MR. DUNCAN: Sure.    JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ suppose that there is a         State and it has a ­­ a mandatory minimum for a theft.               It says the mandatory minimum for theft is years.                      And suppose a court looks at that and says,          you know what? That's incredibly disproportionate to a         lot of theft, and so strikes the mandatory minimum.         Says, you just can't have a mandatory minimum like that;           make it lower.   Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review                         Would that be a substantive ruling?       MR. DUNCAN: We don't think so, Justice        Kagan, because the mandatory aspect of it goes to the          manner of imposing a penalty.                  JUSTICE KAGAN: It does not go to the manner          of imposing. It says nothing about the manner of          imposing.             What it does is it just increases the range         of sentencing possibilities. It actually leaves it to         the ­­ to the courts. It says absolutely nothing about           what factors ought to be taken into account. Nothing          about that at all.                All it says is, you can't have a mandatory          minimum of years for theft; make it lower.                     MR. DUNCAN: Well, so in ­­ in ­­ if in that            hypothetical that doesn't go to the manner of imposing         the penalty, then it's different than Miller, because        Miller made very clear that the mandatory aspect of the          penalty goes to the manner of imposing the penalty ­­                     JUSTICE KAGAN: But I think ­­                   MR. DUNCAN: ­­ not something substantive.                   JUSTICE KAGAN: So if you're saying, no,        that's different because there was something else in        Miller ­­ there is something else in Miller. There is a            bunch. There ­­ there is ­­ there is a process            Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review component of Miller, no question about it, where the         Court says what courts are supposed to look at is ­­ are            the characteristics of youth and are supposed to try to          figure out whether these terrible crimes are functions,        in part, of immaturity or ­­ or ­­ or not, whether           you ­­ you really are looking at an incorrigible         defendant.             So there is that process component. But        that process component does not take away the fact that          there is a completely separate, self­sufficient       component as to what the range of punishment has to be.           That's completely on all fours with the hypothetical        that I gave you.                 MR. DUNCAN: Well, your ­­ Justice Kagan,        the ­­ the relevant difference in terms of the Teague          analysis is that this Court in Miller did not take the           punishment of life without parole, the distinct category        of punishment of life without parole, off the table.         This Court has never held that a noncategorical rule is           substantive under Teague.               And it's done that for good reasons:       Because that would fly in the face of the policies that           inform the Teague analysis.                JUSTICE KAGAN: No, you're exactly right.       It did not take the LWOP punishment off the table. But            Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review similarly, in my hypothetical, a ­year sentence for         theft has not been taken off the table.                    What the Court has done is to say, there         have to be other options. There has to be an option of             ten years or five years or two years, whatever it is.                       So they've expanded the range of      possibilities. They've just made the sentence       different, because a sentence is defined both by its          upper end and by its lower end.                               MR. DUNCAN: I ­­     JUSTICE KAGAN: And so they've made the        sentence different.              MR. DUNCAN: I understand that. But making          the sentence different doesn't necessarily mean make it        substantive under the Teague framework.                 Here's another way of looking at it. The         defendant in a ­­ a juvenile murderer who committed ­­           who committed murder and is serving a       life­without­parole sentence today, pre­Miller, is not      facing a punishment that the law cannot impose on him.           And we know that from Miller because Miller said the          Court's decision does not preclude that punishment.                   And so that goes to finality. The finality         interests underlying convictions do not yield where the        State still has the power to impose that punishment.         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Finality interests yield ­­ Justice Harlan explained in        Mackey and this Court adopted in Teague, finality        interests yield only where the State lacks the power.         That's where the finality interests crumble, so to        speak, because the State no longer can impose that         category of penalty.               So that would go for Roper. It would go for           Graham. It would go for Justice Breyer's sedition or          witch crimes. If ­­ if ­­ if somebody's in jail because            they were accused of being a witch, then the State has            no finality interest in keeping that person in jail.         But by the same token, if ­­ if ­­ if the punishment is             death for a juvenile, the State has no finality interest           in doing that.               So leaving the punishment on the table is        crucial. If he doesn't take it off, it's not          substantive.             The second policy reason for Teague is       avoiding the adverse consequences of retrial. And we         think Miller is even more clearly not substantive under         that standard, because categorical rules apply      retroactively, Justice Harlan explained, because they      don't carry the adverse consequences of retrial. They         don't make you go back and redo the trial and unearth           old facts and ­­ and drain State resources and come up           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review with distorted ­­ distorted retrials.                 Miller, by its nature, envisions a      fact­intensive hearing that considers multiple     characteristics at the time of the crime.                   JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you don't have a        distorted new trial if you just grant a parole hearing.                       MR. DUNCAN: That's right. That ­­ that's         right. But that's, of course, not what Miller would          require. That's what Graham would require, Justice        Kennedy, because Graham is obviously a categorical rule         that says you can no longer impose that punishment, so          you have to give them a parole hearing or some           meaningful way of release.                Miller is about the step before whether to        give a parole hearing, whether the person can be          eligible for parole at the outset. That's the inquiry          that we're talking about in Miller, and that's quite         different from a parole hearing.                  The fact of the matter is, though, is that         applying Miller retroactively inevitably turns the      Miller ­­ the retroactive Miller hearing into a parole          hearing, which ­­ which shows that it doesn't quite work          in terms of adverse ­­                JUSTICE BREYER: You were going to say ­­ at          some point you started ­­ suppose you look at the          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review watershed procedural change. My ­­ my impression from         the case you cited, Summerlin, is that deciding whether         that's retroactive has two parts. I think we were           unanimous on this point.                 The two parts were: Is it implicit in the         concept of ordered liberty? And here it would seem to           be, because it's applicable to the States. And the          second is: Is it central to an accurate determination          that life without parole is a legally appropriate         punishment? And the ­­ the ­­ the rule that a mandatory             can't exist is central to making that ­­ that was the           whole point of the Miller opinion.                  So if that's the correct analysis for       watershed rule, procedural rule that's retroactive ­­ if        I'm right about that, why doesn't it fit within that          category?             the point.              MR. DUNCAN: Well, let's take the first one,         It's not just implicit in the concept of        ordered liberty. The way that the ­­ the watershed rule           has been stated, the first ­­ the first prong of it is            it has to alter our understanding of bedrock procedural         elements necessary to fundamental fairness. And this        would be a strange case to find that in, because Miller            itself doesn't represent a bedrock revolution in        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review sentencing practices. It takes a sentencing practice         from another area and puts it in this new area. So it's             an incremental change in that sense. It's not a          wholesale discovery of a new bedrock procedural element,         the way we had in ­­ in a case like Gideon v.             Wainwright.             So ­­ and ­­ and I think this Court          explained in Whorton v. Bockting that it's not enough         that the rule be fundamental in some ­­ in some abstract           sense ­­ right? ­­ but it has to itself represent a           change in bedrock procedural understandings. And we        don't think Miller does that.                 We also don't think it's necessary to an        accurate determination of a sentence. It would enhance          the accuracy of the sentence, but it's not necessary.                     And the other point there is this Court has         never hold that a ­­ held that a pure sentencing rule             can qualify under watershed, because, after all, this        Court has on many occasions said that a watershed rule           is necessary to the accurate determination of guilt or         innocence, and here we're talking about a sentence.                     So we ­­ we agree with the United States         that watershed procedural analysis is not the way to go          here, but it does raise an interesting question.                    In Summerlin ­­ because, after all, we do ­­        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review we do part company quite strongly from the United States          when ­­ when the United States says we need an          outcome­expanding alteration to the definition of      substantive rules under Teague. We say that's ­­ that's          not just a slight tweak to Teague. What that is is a              change in the understanding of what a substantive rule          is.             Substantive rules under Teague analysis have      never depended on the frequency with which new outcomes         might ­­ might come about under the new procedures. In           fact, in Summerlin ­­ and this goes back to my original           point about the framework. Summerlin explained that a         criminal defendant under a procedural rule does have the          opportunity of getting a more lenient outcome under the          new procedures. So ­­ and nonetheless, Summerlin said         that such procedural rules are not applied       retroactively.             And so, as ­­ Justice Alito, as you were         saying, the difference between a substantive and a         procedural rule under Teague is not whether it's very         likely or very, very likely to result in a new outcome.            It's about whether the new rule categorically removes        the power of the State to impose a category of           punishment. That's what a ­­ that's what a categorical            rule does. That is not what Miller does, right?          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             Miller may express an expectation about the       way that Miller hearings will come out. And that may or            may not come ­­ come to pass in the future. Who knows,             right? We can point to cases where criminal defendants          have had Miller hearings and have still received life         without parole, and I can point to several in particular           from the State of Louisiana under its new Miller         procedures, but the point being is that the idea of          changing outcomes, which is what the United States'        entire argument depends on, is built into the procedural         side of Teague and not the substantive side.                                The substantive side is about ­­     JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Duncan, I ­­ I ­­ I            think not. I think by your own definition this fits on             the substantive side.               You said you ­­ you categorically remove a        certain outcome. And ­­ and ­­ and that's exactly what          Miller does. If you ­­ as long as you understand a            sentence, which I think you agreed with, as defined both           by its upper end and by its lower end, effectively what           the Court said in Miller was that that sentence, which          was the mandatory LWOP sentence, cannot control for        juveniles.                         MR. DUNCAN: And ­­    JUSTICE KAGAN: There has to be a different          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review sentence, one that includes other punishments.                              range.                         MR. DUNCAN: Well, there's no doubt ­­       JUSTICE KAGAN: That ­­ that increases the        MR. DUNCAN: Right.    Miller ­­ Miller quite clearly said, as you        know, Justice Kagan, that it does not categorically bar         a penalty, but ­­ and ­­ and so ­­ and what did it mean              by that penalty? It's ­­                 JUSTICE KAGAN: It allows something within       the range, but it has ­­ it has completely changed the           range that's ­­ that is ­­ that is given for any           juvenile defendant.                          MR. DUNCAN: Well, we think that's ­­       JUSTICE KAGAN: The range is important.       It's not just the top end. This is what we said in             Alleyne, that you can't think about a sentence without          thinking about both parts of the sentence, both the         maximum and the minimum. And when you decide whether a           substantive change in that sentence has been made, you         look at both the maximum and the minimum.                    MR. DUNCAN: Well, I ­­ look, I ­­ I ­­ I               hope this is responsive. I mean, I think after Miller             we would see two categories of punishment on the table.          We would see a life­without­parole category and a         Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review life­with­parole, for example.               But my point is, is that Miller doesn't ban         the first category, and that is determinative for        whether something is a substantive rule or not.                     JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm ­­ I would ­­ I would            not describe changing the range of sentences available        as changing the sentence.                MR. DUNCAN: It ­­ it puts an element on the           table, I think, is the most you could say.                      sentence ­­                                                             sentence.             JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't change the       MR. DUNCAN: Yes.    JUSTICE SCALIA: ­­ necessarily.     MR. DUNCAN: Right.    JUSTICE KAGAN: But this is what we ­­        JUSTICE SCALIA: You still get the same        MR. DUNCAN: You could still ­­ absolutely        still ­­ and what ­­ what did you ­­                    JUSTICE KAGAN: Which is what we said last         year. We said, it's impossible to disassociate the         floor of a sentencing range from the penalty affixed to           the crime. And similarly, we said criminal statutes         have long specified both the floor and ceiling of         sentencing ranges, which is evidence that both define        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review the legally prescribed penalty.                                                                MR. DUNCAN: Well ­­    JUSTICE KAGAN: That is the penalty ­­       MR. DUNCAN: Right.    JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ is the range.       MR. DUNCAN: It ­­ it ­­ life without parole          has the same floor and ceiling, of course. It's ­­          it's ­­ it's got the same floor and ceiling. What           Miller does is create the ­­ the ­­ the procedural          circumstances for finding ­­ for putting a new penalty          on the table, which is the ­­ the ­­ that's the point of             the United States' argument: There is a new          possibility.             And our point is to say that putting a new           possibility on the table doesn't take away the State's         power to impose the old category of punishment.                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Winsor ­­     Mr. Winsor ­­                          MR. DUNCAN: Duncan. I'm sorry.       JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know that we didn't         ever look at this issue.                 I'm sorry. Reading the wrong one. I         apologize.             But do you really think that we ­­ that any          State would have not applied Woodson retroactively?       Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review MR. DUNCAN: That ­­ that ­­      JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They all did.      MR. DUNCAN: Probably ­­ probably not, Your                                            Honor. But the ­­ the question ­­ that ­­ that, of            course, is a pre­Teague case. It raises the question:           Is Woodson substantive or procedural under Teague? And         our argument is it's a procedural rule.                                            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why?    MR. DUNCAN: It's a procedural rule ­­        JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It just said you       couldn't have mandatory death penalties, just like here:        You can't have mandatory life without parole.                   MR. DUNCAN: But it required an       individualized sentencing ­­              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The sentence ­­ exactly       ­­            MR. DUNCAN: ­­ process, which we say is a          procedure.             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And to give sentences       less than ­­              MR. DUNCAN: It ­­ it would put new ­­                     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: ­­ mandatory death. But        they could have still given death.                  MR. DUNCAN: They certainly could have, so        the question is whether it's substantive or procedural        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review under the Teague rubric, which, of course, it was a          pre­Teague case. And I think the most we can say about             it is it's not substantive under Teague for the reasons          that we've said.               Now, raise the question: Is it a watershed          procedural rule? Perhaps that's ­­                 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But that's the         language ­­ "bedrock" is ­­ I don't think is the right            language, because that was the language he referred to         in a sentence in Mackey, correct? I've just been           looking it up.               And ­­ and ­­ but then in Teague itself,         Justice O'Connor tries to get the right words, and ­­         what she ends up with here is that the procedural is the            first test, the first part, is ­­ can be addressed by           limiting the scope of the second exception ­­ that's the          watershed rule ­­ to those new procedures without which         the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously        diminished. Okay.                           MR. DUNCAN: That's the first one.       JUSTICE BREYER: And that's joined by the        Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and the fourth I can't          remember.             But ­­ so is it seriously diminished? Now,         we read through Miller. It's pretty hard to say ­­ I            Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review mean, my goodness, Miller is just filled with paragraph         after paragraph about how a mandatory requirement for         life without parole fails to take account of all the          characteristics or many characteristics adherent in      youth.             And it's pretty hard to come away from that         without thinking, gee, accuracy under a mandatory life         without parole does seriously diminish the accuracy of        imposing life without parole when you apply the        mandatory to a youth.                 MR. DUNCAN: But in ­­ every Eighth        Amendment sentencing rule goes to accuracy in some        significant ­­             JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. But you have to          say the accuracy is seriously diminished. And she says,          then I don't think there will be too many such cases.                        MR. DUNCAN: Well, again, take a ­­ we          haven't talked about the capital sentencing cases, but        take a case like O'Dell, where the capital jury was not            informed of the defendant's parole and eligibility while        considering his future dangerousness. I mean, one could          easily say that the accuracy of the resulting death         sentence under the old rule was seriously diminished,        and yet this Court said in O'Dell that that is not a            watershed procedural rule. And you can go down the line           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review with all those cases, the Beard case and the Sawyer          case. Those are cases in which the defendant could have           said, well, seriously ­­ seriously diminished accuracy.       And yet the Court found no watershed rule. And, of           course, the bedrock is what the word that this Court has           used in referring to that exception, particularly in        Whorton v. Bockting.                 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any watershed     procedural rule other than Gideon?                 MR. DUNCAN: Well, this Court has said it's         ­­ it's doubtful that any will emerge. And so we think            this case is an implausible case for a new watershed           rule to emerge, since this rule ­­ and back to the           bedrock point ­­ is not a creating a ­­ it's not ­­ it's               not a revolution in bedrock understanding of procedure.         It's ­­ it's an incremental step in sentencing        juveniles. So if a case ­­ if a case like Crawford is               not a watershed procedural rule, then it's difficult to          understand how this one would be.                  JUSTICE GINSBURG: We have one brief that        tells us that this Court has never barred punishment as          cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment, but        refused to make the decision retroactive.                  MR. DUNCAN: Well, we ­­                 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that ­­     Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             MR. DUNCAN: ­­ disagree with that. There         are cases ­­ take the ­­ take the case that refused to            make retroactive the rule in Caldwell v. Mississippi.        That's an Eighth Amendment case that goes to the         accuracy of a capital jury sentence in determination of          death. And this Court didn't make that rule         retroactive, and found that it was procedural and        non­watershed at the same time. So we take issue with           that.             Just a few more words about the        United States' proposed expansion of Teague. It        would ­­ it would shift the whole focus of what a           substantive rule is from the categorical nature of the         rule to the effects of the rule. And so that ­­ if ­­             any defendant in these capital sentencing cases we've        just been talking about, O'Dell and Sawyer and Beard,         would now have the argument handed to them by the          United States new rule that says, well, that new rule          gave me the opportunity for a better outcome. I might             have not gotten the death penalty if my jury had been           properly instructed.              We don't understand how the United States'       new rule in this case can be cabined only to where a            mandatory sentence is taken off the table.                   JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but I think that you          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review yourself cabined it when you said that the difference is          one ­­ there is some category of cases which do refer to            process, to how a decisionmaker makes a particular          result, and another category of cases which refer to         what we've called substance, which is: What results are          on the table? What category of punishment is on the           table? And that's the difference between this and all          the other kinds of things that you're mentioning.                                MR. DUNCAN: Well, I ­­      JUSTICE KAGAN: This is not about the how ­­         or it's partly about the how, but there's also about          what punishments are on the table.                  MR. DUNCAN: Well, I just have to ­­ just           have to push back on the premise a little bit, where ­­            our ­­ our position is not that a substantive rule is            about what punishments are on the table. A substantive           rule is about whether a State categorically no longer          has the power to impose a category of punishment.                      Here, it's clear from the Miller opinion and        from the Grayer ­­ from the Graham opinion that the          relevant category is life without parole. The State         still has the ability to impose that punishment. And          that's what ­­ that's a sharp distinction from what a           procedural rule is. And the United States' new         conception of what a substantive rule is would blur          Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review that. It would blur that, and it would call into           question all of the capital sentencing cases.                   And I heard a question ­­ I don't remember            which Justice asked it ­­ about Booker. And my reaction           to that is ­­ but Booker as a matter of the Sixth             Amendment made a sentencing guideline non­mandatory, and        it surely opened up new sentencing outcomes.                   And so by ­­ by what reason could a ­­ could            a Federal habeas petitioner now not say under the         United States' new test Booker is now retroactive, or         Alleyne, for that matter? Alleyne overturned the        mandatory minimum under the Sixth Amendment, opening up        new sentencing outcomes. Why couldn't a Federal         defendant on Federal habeas say, now I ought to get the            benefit of that rule retroactively?                 Our position is those cases ­­ Booker,       Alleyne, Apprendi ­­ are clearly procedural, as this        Court explained in ­­ in Summerlin ­­ Schriro v.         Summerlin. They're clearly procedural under the Teague        rubric. And what the United States would do is blur           those categories.                                      remaining. If there are no further questions.      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       Mr. Bernstein, you have three minutes      Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review        REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. BERNSTEIN           ON BEHALF OF THE COURT­APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE                   MR. BERNSTEIN: What this fantastic      discussion has shown is why the Court, as it always has           in the past, should keep the Teague exceptions a matter           of equitable discretion, rather than constitutional      requirement.             The Court has much more freedom, generally       speaking, on the matter of equitable discretion than it         does on constitutional requirements. There is no way to          look at the prior precedents of the Court in Teague in           any of those courts to say, oh, here's what our          equitable discretion is. The only time you get         retroactivity is when the Constitution requires it.       That would have been a really short opinion. And that            was not that.               Now, to turn quickly to the cases that have         been cited: The critical difference between this case         on the one hand and Merrell Dow and Three Affiliated          Tribes on the other hand is that jurisdiction under this          statute is question by question under Murdock.                   In Merrell Dow, the question of whether the        defendant's conduct had violated the Federal drug       labeling laws was a Federal question. The Court never           would have gone on to say, and we're also going to           Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review Federalize the remedy. We're going to decide whether         it's lost profits or out­of­pocket costs.                  Similarly, in Three Affiliated Tribes, there      was no question that there was a Federal statute that           limited State court jurisdiction. The only issue was         the scope of that statute.                 Here we have the opposite. There is no         question that the Federal statute does not apply to the          State court, and yet people say you should decide the          scope question, even though the underlying issue may be         one of State law.                And then, finally, to the Solicitor      General's new cake­and­eat­it­too argument that there is       going to be review in this Court and de novo review on            habeas: The statutory language in (d) is pretty         broad. Quote: "Any claim that was adjudicated on the           merits in State court proceeding."                 The only claim in this case is remedy. This          case was filed after Miller was decided. The only issue           in this case is redress. And it would be a very             wonderful turn if you could say on the one hand that           (d) doesn't apply, but on the other hand,         applies when it ­­ when it requires a, quote, "right          claimed under Federal law," which gets to your question,         Justice Kagan.  Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review             Is it enough that a State court says, we          voluntarily want to be bound? And the best answer to           that is not only in the cases I would recommend ­­           Moore, which is cited in Merrell Dow, which goes out of           its way to show how Federal law is binding on the           intrastate commerce conduct in that case before saying        the Court could review it ­­ but it's also plain in the            language of the Supremacy Clause. Binding Federal law         means binding in all States, and that's why the          statute also says "right under Federal law."                   Thank you.                          remaining.             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       And, Mr. Plaisance, you have three minutes       MR. PLAISANCE: Your Honors, I'd like to        make two quick points.                First of all, in jurisdiction: Resolving       this case under Teague avoids the serious constitutional        question of whether due process requires retroactivity       for Miller.                A second point on the merits: Miller said        that juvenile homicide offenders should not have to die         in prison with no chance for rehabilitation and no         consideration of youth. That important rule changed the         substantive outcomes available. Indeed, this Court said        Alderson Reporting Company Official ­ Subject to Final Review that life without prison should be uncommon.                   The individuals sentenced before Miller ­­     that remains about , ­­ deserve a chance at          redemption.             Thank you.                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       Mr. Bernstein, the Court appointed you as an        amicus curiae to brief and argue this case against this          Court's jurisdiction. You have ably discharged that        responsibility, for which the Court is grateful.                               The case is submitted.    (Whereupon, at : a.m., the case in the
