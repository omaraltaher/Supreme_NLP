 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll now hear 

argument in Case 10-179, Stern v. Marshall.

 Mr. Richland.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. RICHLAND:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Pierce Marshall filed a claim in Vickie 

Marshall's bankruptcy case.  He alleged he was damaged 

because she falsely accused him of cheating her out of 

money that her late husband intended to give her.  In 

order to preserve its claim against him, the bankruptcy 

estate had no choice but then to file its counterclaim 

in the bankruptcy court, alleging that those statements 

were in fact true and that far from Pierce being 

entitled to money from the estate, he owed money to the 

bankruptcy estate.  This Court's cases established that 

the bankruptcy court was constitutionally authorized to 

decide that entire dispute.

 Congress drafted the bankruptcy statutes -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you tell me why?

 MR. RICHLAND:  Excuse me, Your Honor?  I'm 

sorry.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the authority at 

4

all for a bankruptcy court to adjudicate proof of 

claims, without violating Article III?  I don't think 

we've ever had a case that's actually said that.

 MR. RICHLAND:  This Court has never 

approached that issue directly.  Of course -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, what's -­

MR. RICHLAND:  Excuse me, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, what's the 

constitutional basis?

 MR. RICHLAND:  Well, of course, it need not 

reach that issue in this case, because the court below 

and the Respondents assume for the purposes of this case 

that, in fact, there was authority for the bankruptcy 

court.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not sure how that 

helps.  If there's no jurisdiction for the bankruptcy 

court to adjudicate proof of claims, then how can it 

adjudicate counterclaims?  Don't both fall if there's an 

Article III violation?

 MR. RICHLAND:  Well, I don't think so, Your 

Honor, because Article III, of course, is not 

jurisdictional in the sense that we think of basic 

fundamental jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction. 

It can be waived, of course.  But beyond that, I think

that Marathon, as I said, assumes that there is Article 

III authority to adjudicate the proof of claim.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, answer the -­

MR. RICHLAND:  Katchen -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Answer the question. 

Don't assume.

 MR. RICHLAND:  Okay.  And -- well, the 

answer is that, under -- under the various theories that 

this Court has put forth, there is a basis for the 

bankruptcy court to adjudicate a proof of claim.

 One theory, of course, is the public rights 

theory, and in Granfinanciera, this Court established 

that the -- the public rights theory was broader than 

just the kind of situation where the government was a 

party, and it said that -- that it -- public rights are 

defined as whether Congress, acting under Article I, has 

created a seemingly private right that is so closely 

integrated into a public regulatory scheme as to be a 

matter appropriate for agency resolution with limited 

involvement by the Article III judiciary.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  The claim here was not one 

that was created by Congress, though, was it?

 MR. RICHLAND:  That's -- that's correct, but 

this Court has never held that in fact the claim had to

be created by -- literally created by Congress.  What 

this Court has always talked about is -- is, is the 

claim one that Congress has established as being 

applicable within the system but that may be based on a 

State law claim?

 For example, when, you know, this Court 

analyzed the claims which were at issue in 

Granfinanciera, it looked at the fact that they were 

fundamentally common law claims.  It didn't depend on 

the fact that they were Federal claims.

 The same thing was -- is true in the way 

that the -- that this Court analyzed the -- the claim in 

-- in Marathon itself.  It made the determination that 

because this was -- I think the way Justice Rehnquist 

stated it was:  This is the stuff that would have been 

adjudicated at common law in Westminster in 1789.  So it 

was not the Federal or State nature of the claim, it was 

the fact that these were common law claims that made it 

important.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Are there any limits, Mr. 

Richland?  Suppose that Congress had authorized 

bankruptcy courts to decide contract disputes between 

two creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding.  Would that be 

all right?

 MR. RICHLAND:  I think that there are

limits, and they must be related to the purpose of 

bankruptcy.  I think that a -- that sort of thing would 

be related to, perhaps, within the "related to" 

jurisdiction of bankruptcy, and that would fall within 

the problems identified in Granfinanciera, for example. 

That would be beyond the scope of what could be 

adjudicated in bankruptcy.

 But what we are talking about here is claims 

and counterclaims that are at the essence of what 

bankruptcy courts do.  The bankruptcy system, of course, 

is set up in order to adjudicate claims to a limited 

amount of money, and in order to do that in an efficient 

manner, in a manner that will not utilize the entire 

amount of the -- the estate in the adjudication process, 

it set up the bankruptcy courts.  And so they are set up 

in order to be efficient, effective, and as soon as, of 

course, as we get an Article III court involved, that 

really does place some brakes on the efficiency.  It 

becomes much more costly.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can the bankruptcy court 

adjudicate permissive counterclaims?

 MR. RICHLAND:  Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And if you posit a no, 

what's the limiting principle?

 MR. RICHLAND:  Well, certainly the

statute -- 157(b)(3), (2) -- does not distinguish 

between compulsory and permissive counterclaims.  And 

it's also true that this Court's authority in 

Granfinanciera, in Langenkamp and in Katchen -- the 

rationale of those cases is broad enough to encompass 

permissive counterclaims, but this Court need not reach 

that issue in this case, because here we do have what 

both the court of appeals below and what seems to have 

been conceded by Respondents is, indeed, a compulsory 

counterclaim.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Richland, isn't there 

this difference:  Just to take ordinary civil procedure, 

compulsory counterclaim doesn't have to satisfy any 

jurisdictional requirements, because it comes in under 

the wing of the main claim, but a permissive 

counterclaim has to independently satisfy a 

jurisdictional requirement.

 So that could be a reason, even though the 

Bankruptcy Code just says counterclaim, to distinguish 

the two.  If there's an authority to deal with the 

claim, then there's authority to deal with the 

counterclaim, but if it's a permissive counterclaim, 

it's not based on the same transaction or premise, then 

it would have to be a self-standing claim.  But, as 

you -- as you have said, this case does present what the

parties have agreed is a compulsory counterclaim.

 MR. RICHLAND:  Well, I -- I think that -­

that is an excellent justification for why one might 

want to make this a very narrow determination in this 

case.  In fact, Justice Rehnquist, in his concurring 

opinion in Marathon, said that this is an area which is 

very touchy and difficult and complex, and it is one 

where we particularly should not, as a court, go beyond 

the facts of the individual case and what must be 

decided for this case.

 Of course, the other thing about compulsory 

counterclaims and what makes it more applicable in this 

kind of situation in an Article III setting is that, 

according to the Schor analysis, what we are talking 

about is how much of an intrusion on the Article III 

process are we talking about.  And if we assume, as 

appears to have been assumed here, that the claim itself 

may be determined by the bankruptcy court, then the net 

intrusion by determining a counterclaim, a compulsory 

counterclaim, is much, much smaller, because there 

almost inevitably will be overlap between what must be 

decided by the bankruptcy court and what -- on the claim 

and what must be decided on the counterclaim.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is there any authority -­

MR. RICHLAND:  Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is there -- is there -­

10

are there any cases in the -- in the Federal courts 

which tell us that a motion for nondischargeability does 

or does not require the pleading of a counterclaim?

 MR. RICHLAND:  I don't believe so, Justice 

Kennedy.  But in fact, what happened here was something 

much, much more than just a motion, a request for 

determination of nondischargeability, because 1 month 

after that was filed, the actual proof of claim itself 

was filed.  And all the courts below have uniformly 

concluded that when that additional step is taken, it 

could have no purpose other than to present the claim -­

beyond just the question of dischargeability, present 

the question of liquidation of the claim to the 

bankruptcy court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the counterclaim came 

at what point?  After the proof of claim was filed?

 MR. RICHLAND:  That is correct.  Some weeks 

after the proof of claim was filed, the -- the 

counterclaim was filed.  The objections and counterclaim 

was filed.

 The -- the statutory structure here is 

something that -- it has been suggested that this is a 

question of statutory interpretation and that, in fact,

the statute does not provide for this kind of treatment, 

that, in fact, there is a two-step process by which one 

determines whether a bankruptcy court can finally decide 

a counterclaim.  But I think that really is belied by 

the plain language of the statute as well as the 

statutory structure.

 Of course, the starting point is 

157(b)(2)(C), which very clearly and straightforwardly 

states that core claims include counterclaims by the 

estate against persons filing claims against the estate.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you make of the fact 

that -- that (b)(2) says core proceedings include, but 

are not limited to, the matters that are listed after 

that?

 How would a court go about deciding whether 

something that is not specifically mentioned constitutes 

a core proceeding except by looking back to (b)(1), 

which is what the court of appeals did?

 MR. RICHLAND:  Well, I think that when -- a 

court would indeed, if one were looking at something 

that was outside the scope of the explicitly mentioned 

categories from (B) to (N) in 157(b)(2), one would in 

fact look beyond the words of (A) and (O) -- those are 

the two catch-all provisions -- and one would look to 

the usual, normal principles of statutory construction

to determine what fit within them.

 But 152 -- 157(b)(2)(C) is very 

straightforward.  It does not require any additional 

interpretation.  There is -- a counterclaim against a 

person filing a proof of claim is just, on its face, 

something that is unambiguous.  And the fact that there 

are more ambiguous categories there would probably 

require a court to go beyond, you know, the four corners 

of the statute and look to the normal kinds of 

principles we use in determining what statutes mean.

 We'd look at the categories that were 

actually included.  We would see, is this something that 

is similar, does it fall within that category, and so 

on.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you think is the 

principle that defines a core proceeding?  Some of these 

specifically enumerated items are very -- potentially 

very broad:  (A) "matters concerning the administration 

of the estate."

 MR. RICHLAND:  That's right.  The -- (A) and 

(O) are very broad.  And so, what -- that category -­

what those two categories would have to be informed by 

and are informed by are the principles of statutory 

construction that are normally used.  And included among 

those, we would contend, would be looking at the words

of the statute that talk about, does this arise under 

the Bankruptcy Code or arise in a bankruptcy case?

 So for those particular categories, the 

lower courts have been comfortable with the idea that we 

look at the language of the statute, apply those words 

and use those as limitations, but with respect to the 

specific categories from (B) to (N), the courts have 

uniformly indicated that those categories do not require 

further interpretation, that they are straightforward, 

and they constitute core proceedings on their face.

 I think the -- with respect to the question 

that you asked, Justice Sotomayor, and the whole issue 

of whether a matter is under -- may pass muster under 

Article III is a very easy one in this case.  And the 

reason for that is that if we look to Schor and Schor's 

Article III analysis, we can see that it really divides 

into two parts.

 Part 1 is:  Was there some -- is the Article 

III -- to the extent the Article III right is a personal 

one, that is to the extent that it guarantees someone 

a -- a decision maker who is not going to be affected by 

the political branches of the government or by the winds 

of politics, that's something that's waivable.  And, in 

fact -­

it when -- when, in order to protect yourself for a debt 

that is owed to you, you make a claim in a bankruptcy 

proceeding.  We do have a doctrine that you cannot -­

you cannot condition a Federal right upon the waiver of 

constitutional protections.  And that seems to me what 

you're saying here.  If you want to get paid by the 

bankrupt estate, you have to waive your -- your right to 

a -- to a jury trial.

 MR. RICHLAND:  Well, Justice Scalia, that is 

precisely what this Court addressed in footnote 14 in 

Granfinanciera.  It explained that, yes, waiver under 

many circumstances and -- under the Schor case, for 

example, waiver involves a choice between two equal or 

optional options.

 However, I should point out that in this 

case, there was another option.  There was a 

dischargeability complaint filed, and, in fact, the 

choice was made not to pursue that but, instead, to 

pursue the proof of claim.  There was already a State 

court suit on file and, instead of requesting a stay, a 

relief from the bankruptcy stay, the proof of claim was 

filed.

 In general, however, the Alexander v. 

Hillman principle, which is also discussed in footnote 

14, is what applies in this -- in this circumstance.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would it have been normal 

for the bankruptcy judge to lift the stay with respect 

to a claim that could be presented in the bankruptcy 

proceeding?

 MR. RICHLAND:  Well, the -- certainly the -­

the principles of -- of permissive abstention, for 

example, encourage, if, in fact, comity is to be 

respected and if there is another suit pending 

elsewhere, that bankruptcy courts will permit the suit 

to proceed in that jurisdiction, so that that does in 

fact occur.  But it was never even tried here, and 

that's -- that's really the point.

 And I'd like to reserve the rest of my time, 

but I would like to make one final point before I sit 

down initially, and that is, if this Court should decide 

to reverse, that as we requested in our -- in our reply 

brief and as we requested in our relief on our 

cross-appeal, we would request that -- that this case be 

sent back to the district court, because it was the 

district court that in the first instance applied the 

improper standard, and we think that would be an 

appropriate way of -- of taking care of this case in 

this instance.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I -- I'd like to begin by addressing Justice 

Scalia's question about the -- what's sometimes referred 

to as the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, whether 

it's appropriate to place a person in a position where 

he has to make a choice whether to assert one of two 

constitutional rights.  And although there is in many 

contexts reluctance to put an individual to that choice, 

there's not an inflexible rule against it.

 And to take one example, a criminal 

defendant has an absolute constitutional right to 

testify in his own defense.  He also has an absolute 

constitutional right to resist compelled testimony in 

which the prosecution will ask him hostile questions, 

but he doesn't have a constitutional right to do both. 

If he chooses -- chooses to take the stand and testify, 

he may be cross-examined at trial by the prosecution, 

and he has no residual Fifth Amendment right to resist 

the hostile questioning.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This is a little -­

right to have a -- a decision before an Article III 

tribunal.  It seems a bit more fundamental than the 

examples you're giving.

 MR. STEWART:  Well, I don't know that it's 

more fundamental than the right not to be questioned 

against one's will in a criminal proceeding in which 

you're -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, not -- not 

fundamental in the sense of is it important or not.  I 

guess "fundamental" is not the right word.  Maybe 

"structural" or -- or something like that.  It's sort of 

the whole basis for the decision that's going to be 

made.

 MR. STEWART:  I guess there are two 

potential objections to the use of a non-Article III 

judge, and one of them would be, as you say, structural; 

that is, one of the objections that is sometimes made to 

the use of non-Article III adjudicators is that if 

Congress can parcel out part of the work of the 

judiciary to other units, the stature of the judicial 

branch will be diminished.

 I think this particular statute doesn't 

create that risk, because the use of bankruptcy judges 

is entirely under the control of the district judges; 

that is, the district court decides whether to refer a

bankruptcy case to the bankruptcy judge; the district 

court can withdraw the referral with respect to 

particular proceedings.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that just 

means that the district court is acting in concert with 

Congress -- take action that undermines the long-term 

institutional and constitutional basis of the judiciary. 

And the district courts have their different reasons and 

incentives to do that.  That doesn't mean that all bets 

are off, and just because they're involved in the 

process it's not a concern.

 MR. STEWART:  Well, to the extent that the 

concern is with fairness to individual litigants, that 

is, the idea that the Respondent in this case has a 

right to an Article III tribunal and should not likely 

be held to have waived it, I think that a person who 

seeks affirmative relief from a court doesn't waive all 

his constitutional rights, to be sure, but should 

ordinarily be taken to accept the consequences that 

ordinarily follow from a request for judicial relief. 

And as a matter of history and tradition, one of the 

consequences that follows from the assertion of an 

affirmative claim is subjection to counterclaims, and 

especially compulsory counterclaims.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That can't be right.

You -- you can take all sorts of matters that belong in 

Article III courts, and so long as you place them in 

some other tribunal where somebody is coerced into 

coming in, supposedly voluntarily, it's all okay.  I 

mean, that's -- that's not an adequate protection.

 MR. STEWART:  Well, the Court has applied 

this basic principle in a number of contexts.  That is, 

in McElrath v. United States, which is cited in the 

Petitioner's brief, the plaintiff filed suit against the 

United States in the Court of Claims, and the United 

States then asserted counterclaims against him, and the 

original plaintiff said that he had a -- a right to jury 

trial under the Seventh Amendment.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's because 

there's a basic sovereign immunity.  The government 

doesn't have to be sued at all.

 MR. STEWART:  The government doesn't have -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- so it can -- so it can 

make conditions, but that's not this case.

 MR. STEWART:  Well, the government can make 

conditions, but -- but the point was the plaintiff in 

that situation had no alternative forum to which he 

could attempt to obtain a recovery from the government.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's because of the 

limitation of sovereign immunity, and you don't -- and

you don't have that analogue here.

 MR. STEWART:  Another example would be Adam 

v. Saenger, which is also cited in the Petitioner's 

brief, in which I believe it was a Texas plaintiff filed 

suit in the California State courts, and the California 

defendant asserted a -- a cross-complaint, basically a 

counterclaim, against him, and the Texas plaintiff 

objected to the California court's assertion of personal 

jurisdiction.

 And this Court said:  By seeking affirmative 

relief from the California court, you have subjected 

yourself to the jurisdiction of that court for all 

purposes for which justice requires.  And it said the 

State can make that the price it pays for seeking 

affirmative judicial relief in its courts.  Now, it may 

have -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  A State can do that, but 

can the Federal Government make it the price that you 

pay for -- for going into a non-Article III tribunal?

 MR. STEWART:  Well -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a different situation, 

it seems.

 MR. STEWART:  Well, let me step back a 

second and address the questions that were posed by 

Justices Sotomayor and Alito at the -- at the beginning

about the initial authority of the bankruptcy judge to 

adjudicate the claim brought against the estate, because 

I agree with my colleague's answer that this is a 

question -- and with Justice Sotomayor, that this is a 

question that this Court hasn't squarely resolved.

 Now, it's true that the initial -- that the 

State law claim, the defamation claim that was made the 

basis for the claim against the estate, was a State law 

cause of action.  But as this Court said in Katchen v. 

Landy, the effect of the commencement of the bankruptcy 

case is to convert the claimant's potential legal claim 

against the defendant into an equitable claim against 

the estate.

 And Respondent's equitable claim against the 

estate seeking a share of the assets was a claim created 

by Federal law.  That is, it's true that in the course 

of deciding whether Respondent was ultimately entitled 

to a share of the estate, the bankruptcy court would 

have been required to adjudicate State law questions and 

conduct something like the same proceedings that could 

have arisen in a State case, but actually obtaining a 

share of the bankruptcy estate requires more than that 

there be a valid debt.

 The whole point of bankruptcy is to deal 

with situations in which the debtor doesn't have enough

assets to go around, and so the bankruptcy court will 

have to not only determine whether a valid debt exists, 

but what are the relative priorities of various 

creditors, what is the appropriate pro rata share for a 

particular claimant, and all of that is to be resolved 

under Federal law.

 So, when Respondent filed a proof of claim 

in the bankruptcy case, it was asserting a Federal right 

cognizable under the Bankruptcy Code.  And, again, none 

of the -- none of the analogues that I've identified are 

precisely analogous to this one, but I think it's 

noteworthy that Respondent cites no contrary authority 

from this Court.  That is, Respondent cites no case in 

which a claimant has invoked the authority of a 

particular court and has asked for affirmative relief, 

and this Court has held that it nevertheless had a 

constitutional entitlement to be free of counterclaims.

 And that seems particularly true of 

compulsory counterclaims, both because they are 

counterclaims that our legal system affirmatively 

encourages to be brought within the same proceeding and 

for the reason that Justice Ginsburg said, that in an 

analogous area of the law, when we ask whether there is 

Federal court jurisdiction over a counterclaim to begin 

with, if the counterclaim is compulsory, there need be

no independent basis for jurisdiction.

 I'd like to address quickly the statutory 

question, and the relevant provisions begin at page 1a 

of the Government's brief.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Will you include in that 

this 157(b)(5), because this whole thing would be a 

futile exercise if that tort claim comes -- comes out of 

the bankruptcy judge's -­

MR. STEWART:  I think the 157(b)(5) is, in 

our view, not jurisdictional.  It deals with the -- the 

respective authorities of the bankruptcy judge and the 

district court within the bankruptcy case, but it 

doesn't go to the question of what the -- the Federal 

courts can adjudicate and the limitations on bankruptcy 

court authority are waivable and subject to consent.

 The court of appeals did not address the 

personal injury aspect of the case.  There is a -- a 

lively dispute between the parties as to whether that 

objection to bankruptcy court adjudication was properly 

preserved, and that would be open to the court of 

appeals on remand if this Court were to reverse.

 On page 1a -­

question if there's some significant possibility that it

wouldn't be necessary because the claims would be found 

to fit into (b)(5)?

 MR. STEWART:  I think -- yes, I mean, this 

could have been a prudential factor that might have 

persuaded the Court not to grant certiorari in the first 

instance, but the Court has obviously identified this as 

an issue that warrants the expenditure of its resources. 

And we think that the -- there is no jurisdictional 

impediment to a decision in this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does the Government have 

a position on what the answer would be?  We've remanded 

it, but that's an open question.  But does the 

Government have a position on whether these kinds of 

claims would have to be heard by an Article III judge?

 MR. STEWART:  Again, we don't have a 

position with respect to the defamation claim.  That is, 

defamation claims may be personal injury claims in many 

contexts, but in this statute, it's linked with wrongful 

death, which seems to -- to cut the other way.  The 

actual counterclaim was not a defamation claim; it was a 

tortious interference claim.  And we don't think that 

would be a personal injury claim.

 With respect to (b)(1), it says 

bankruptcy -- I see my time is up.  Thank you.

Mr. Englert.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.,

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. ENGLERT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 There are three possible grounds for 

affirmance of the Ninth Circuit in this case, one 

constitutional and two statutory; and the 157(b)(5) 

ground which was preserved below received some 

discussion at the very end of Mr. Stewart's argument. 

But I'd like to start the meat of my argument just the 

way Mr. Stewart started his argument, which is by 

addressing Justice Scalia's question, and like Mr. 

Richland, I'd like to talk about footnote 14 of the 

Granfinanciera opinion.

 Now, Granfinanciera had to distinguish 

Schor, which is the only case in which this Court has 

ever said a State law claim could be a public right so 

that it could be adjudicated by a non-Article III forum 

and not subject to the Seventh Amendment.  And Schor 

rested on a consent and waiver rationale and on a 

structural rationale that an alternative Article III 

forum was made available by Congress for everyone in Mr. 

Schor's position.

 In distinguishing Schor, this Court said in

footnote 14:  "Parallel reasoning is unavailable in the 

context of bankruptcy proceedings because creditors lack 

an alternative forum to the bankruptcy court in which to 

pursue their claims."  So with respect, this Court has 

already answered the question Justice Scalia posed by 

saying a creditor may not be put to that choice.  Now, 

the -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counselor, that sort of 

begs the question, because I think what I haven't 

unpackaged -- and I want you to unpackage it with me -­

you're obviously not deprived of a State or Federal 

trial forum to decide your claim.

 What you're -- what you're deprived of -­

you can get your judgment.  No one's telling you, you 

can't go to those courts and get a declaration of your 

rights.  What you're being told is you can't get paid on 

it.  But that happens all of the time, either by the 

vagrancies of the fact that a debtor goes bankrupt and 

doesn't file in the bankruptcy court or does file and 

there's been a discharge.

 What you haven't said to me is what entitles 

you, outside of equity, and what stops either a State 

court or a Federal -- a State legislature or 

congressional legislature from saying, when someone is 

in bankruptcy, this is the res and these are the people

who are entitled to it?  It's a separate claim.  It's 

not the State law claim.  It may be measured by State 

law entitlement, but it's a separate claim.  Why isn't 

it just a separate claim?

 MR. ENGLERT:  Okay, Justice Sotomayor, in 

attempting to answer your question I'd like to 

distinguish sharply between a claim of the creditor 

against the res, which is -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's what you have 

to become to make that claim, meaning you would need to 

adjudicate your State law entitlement.  You get a 

judgment saying she defamed you.  Then what do you do 

with that judgment?

 MR. ENGLERT:  That judgment then is covered 

by the priority scheme of Federal bankruptcy laws, which 

are passed pursuant to congressional authority -­

constitutional authority in Article I, section 8, clause 

4, which is why, in answer to the question Your Honor 

asked first of Mr. Richland, although the Court has 

never squarely addressed it, it's broadly accepted that 

there is no problem with adjudicating what would 

otherwise be State law claims by the creditor against 

the debtor in bankruptcy.

 It's an entirely different subject when the 

debtor tries to bring a claim against a creditor.

That's what Marathon addressed; that's what 

Granfinanciera addressed; that's what Katchen v. Landy 

addressed.

 Now, in Katchen v. Landy, the Court said the 

case turned on or largely turned on the proposition that 

Congress had prescribed that the counterclaim, the 

preference avoidance counterclaim created by Act of 

Congress, must be adjudicated before the main claim 

against the res and against the debtor could or couldn't 

be disallowed.  And the Court returned to that theme in 

footnote 14 of Granfinanciera saying:  "As Katchen makes 

clear, however, by submitting a claim against the 

bankruptcy estate, creditors subject themselves to the 

court's equitable power to disallow those claims."  So 

to the -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's -- that's my 

problem, which is if Congress could do that, why can't 

it do what it did here, which is to say if you -- not to 

make an equitable claim against the estate.  It's not 

going to be in the amount of your judgment because 

they're in bankruptcy because they can't pay your 

judgment.  If you want a piece of this, you have to 

consent to all claims, all compulsory claims -- let's 

not try to get into the compulsory/permissive 

category -- to be adjudicated.

Otherwise, like with preferences, there's an 

unfairness that makes this unequitable.  You're asking 

the estate to give you something, but you're not willing 

to submit in equity to deciding whether there's 

something you should give the estate back.

 MR. ENGLERT:  And -- and -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Compulsorily.  I mean, 

you know, not -- I'm trying to take the permissive issue 

out.

 MR. ENGLERT:  Sure.  And the answer, I 

really do submit, is footnote 14 of Granfinanciera, 

pointing out that there's nowhere else to go for a 

creditor in bankruptcy, which distinguishes bankruptcy 

from Schor, in particular, but from all the other 

settings in which the Court has said that by submitting 

a claim, you subject yourself to the jurisdiction for 

all purposes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Every -- every 

bankruptcy priority rule extinguishes someone's 

entitlement to money.  The security rules mean the 

people who have secured interests get paid before 

unsecured people get paid, and there are insider rules. 

Equity, as in terms of how the bankruptcy sets up the 

res, is at the vagrancies of the legislature.

 MR. ENGLERT:  Exactly.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They choose what they're 

going to permit you to take under what circumstances. 

So why is it inequitable to -- to force you -- not to -­

to force you, we'll use that word -- to say if you want 

money from the res, what you trade off is letting the 

debtor sue you for what you owe.

 MR. ENGLERT:  Well, I don't know if it's 

inequitable, but it's certainly unconstitutional; and 

the reason it's unconstitutional is because -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You don't have a 

constitutional right to collect your debt.  You have a

court.

discharge, you could sue the estate.  You may not get a 

judgment that you can collect after that.

 MR. ENGLERT:  With respect to the claim of 

the creditor against the debtor and against the res, I 

have no problem with that analysis.  When the debtor, 

instead of saying the res is limited and it can only be 

distributed so far, instead says I get to bring my 

counterclaim against the creditor in a non-Article III 

forum and the non-Article III forum gets to hear it and

determine it, not just hear as 157(c)(1) says for 

certain types of claims, then I suggest there is a 

constitutional problem, at least with respect to claims 

that neither, as in Katchen v. Landy, require rejection 

of the main claim, nor, as in Katchen v. Landy, are 

governed by Federal statute.

 This is a State common law action for a 

tort, which has importance for 157(b)(5), which has 

importance for 157(b)(2), and which has extremely high 

importance for the constitutional question.

 In Marathon, as everyone here knows, there 

was no majority opinion, but one point very much in 

common between the plurality and the concurrence of 

Justice -- then-Justice Rehnquist, was that it mattered 

a great deal that it was a common law claim under State 

law.

State common law claim to go forward -- a State common 

law counterclaim to go forward was Schor.  And the 

Court, as Mr. Richland correctly said, divided its 

opinion into a part dealing with the personal rights 

conferred by Article III, section 1, and the structural 

rights protected by Article III, section 1.

 In the part about personal rights, the Court 

held Mr. Schor had waived his personal right to an 

Article III forum.  In the part about structural rights 

at page 855 of that opinion, the Court said that it 

mattered to the constitutional analysis that Congress 

had made an Article III forum available for pursuit of 

that claim.

 So it is terribly, terribly important 

whether an Article III forum is available.  When one is 

forced into a non-Article III forum, as Pierce Marshall 

was, if he wanted to have any opportunity to collect 

from the res, saying that he thereby in some meaningful 

way consents and saying that the structural purposes of 

Article III are not implicated is not in line with this 

Court's cases.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Englert, something 

you just said about if he had any opportunity -- I 

thought his position was this is a nondischargeable 

debt.  Even if it's discharged in bankruptcy, this debt

at any of her pre-bankruptcy assets, he did have to file 

a proof of claim and not just a nondischargeability 

complaint.

 And let me clear up one very minor aspect of 

the record while I'm talking about the proof of claim 

and the nondischargeability complaint.  I doubt this 

ends up mattering to the Court's decision, but Mr. 

Richland misspoke slightly when he said the counterclaim 

came weeks after the proof of claim.  The proof of claim 

was June 12th.  The counterclaim was June 14th, and in 

its very first paragraph, it says it is a counterclaim 

to the nondischargeability complaint.  It doesn't

purport to be a counterclaim to the proof of claim.  I 

doubt this ends up mattering, but it might be important 

for this single purpose:  It is inconceivable that this 

was a compulsory counterclaim to the nondischargeability 

complaint.  It might have been a compulsory counterclaim 

to the proof of claim, but not to the 

nondischargeability complaint.

 Now, I've explained why I believe -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Just one more point about 

the nondischargeability.  He didn't have to bring that 

claim, did he?  I mean, if it's -- if it's a 

nondischargeable debt, he doesn't have to have the 

bankruptcy judge confirm that it's a nondischargeability 

debt.

 MR. ENGLERT:  Given -- I haven't studied 

closely the interaction between the automatic stay of 

section 362 and the nondischargeability complaint of 

section 523, so I'm not 100 percent sure my answer to 

Your Honor is correct.  But I believe that's not 

correct.  I believe that in order to preserve the 

argument that something is nondischargeable, one does 

have to go to the bankruptcy court under section 523 and 

seek a determination of nondischargeability.

 Now, the two statutory arguments are before 

the Court, and I'd like to say something briefly about

each of those two statutory arguments.

 With regard to 157(b)(2), you have heard 

Mr. Richland say this afternoon that the lower courts 

limit subparagraphs (A) and (O) with the language 

"arising in" and "arising under."  You heard Mr. 

Richland say 157(b)(2)(C), subparagraph (C), doesn't 

need to be so limited because it's so straightforward.

 But the point is not how straightforward it 

is; the point is how broad and constitutionally dubious 

it is.  And if the canon of constitutional avoidance 

means anything in limiting the scope of 157(b)(2), it 

should have just as much application to (C) as it does 

to (A) and (O), and the -- it is not as analytically 

neat as some other cases of statutory interpretation, 

but the most obvious way, if one is going to limit the 

reach of (C) as well as (A) and (O), to do so is to take 

the words "arising in" and "arising under" just as Mr. 

Richland concedes they are used in limiting (A) and (O).

 The alternative is to treat those words as 

surplusage, and the alternative is to run headlong into 

the constitutional issues.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you go back to that for 

one second?  I understand the due process issue, which 

is Brandeis's issue in Crowell.  I think I can -- you're 

not going to say anything that I can't read in the brief

on that.  But the other one is worrying me, the 

structural issue.

 So imagine there's no due process concern 

whatsoever.  Now, when I looked at Crowell, your case 

would seem to fall right in it.  It is an adjudication 

under the law as such, you know, between two people -­

whatever that famous line is.  You're captured by that 

one.  So the question is:  Can you get out of it with 

later cases?  And you point to Schor to get out of it.

 And Schor, as I read it, is an all-factors 

case, that when she talks in the structural part of -­

about -- when Justice O'Connor is talking about the 

non-due process part, the structural part, just what you 

said, that there isn't a hard-and-fast rule, that there 

are a bunch of factors that we should look at.  At least 

that's how I read it.  And you were reading it as a 

hard-and-fast rule which means you win.

 Now -- now, who's -- should I just read this 

case further and make up my mind about that, or is there 

something you want to say about it?

 MR. ENGLERT:  Well, no, Justice Breyer, I 

think I can agree with most or all of your premises and 

still argue that we should win under the proper 

constitutional analysis.

 The point is not that the opinion of the

Court in Schor said in so many words that the 

availability of an alternative Article III forum is 

dispositive.  The point is it has to be dispositive, 

given the larger sweep of this Court's cases, because 

otherwise it is simply an all-factors test governing a 

structural provision of the Constitution.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you know, that's what 

she says.  And the -- and what you're interested in 

there, the key thing is not fairness; the key thing is 

maintaining the integrity of the judicial system.  In 

Crowell, Justice Hughes says you've made that integrity 

as long as there were review of matters of fact, the 

independent decision by a court of questions of law, and 

reservation to the court of constitutional facts which 

have never been heard of since.  Okay?

 So we have this case.  And your issue is, 

after all, something that for many, many decades or 

longer has been the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding. 

The bankruptcy judge is an adjunct to the court.  It is 

well-established, this kind of review.  Every part of 

Crowell is met.  So what is -- what is essential to the 

integrity of the judicial process that requires you to 

have a de novo hearing before a district court rather 

than the kind of review that's given here?

Your Honor, I believe are the arguments that were 

rejected in Marathon.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  In which case?

 MR. ENGLERT:  In Marathon, in Northern 

Pipeline v. Marathon.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, Marathon, you know, 

you had four, four and -- and who knows what it stands 

for.  And then we have a sentence of what it stands for, 

and if you read that one sentence, I don't think you can 

say it's a slam-dunk for you.

 MR. ENGLERT:  Well, I'm not saying Marathon 

makes this case a slam-dunk for me, Justice Breyer.  I 

am saying Marathon rejects many, if not all, of the 

premises of your question, starting with -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Of the -- of Marathon and 

saying, where four and four judges really reject a 

decision like Crowell, which is a kind of foundation 

stone?

 MR. ENGLERT:  No, I'm suggesting that they 

reject one particular interpretation of Crowell, a very 

broad interpretation of Crowell, because -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, Crowell involved 

public rights in the -- in the narrow sense, didn't it? 

It was -- it was a public suit.

different standards.  Even if you do not agree with my 

separate opinion in Granfinanciera that that should be 

the only category, there may well be different standards 

for public suits in the narrow sense that were involved 

in Crowell and public suits which are -- are governed by 

some totality of the circumstances test, which -­

MR. ENGLERT:  I -- I agree with that -­

excuse me, Justice Scalia.  I do agree with that, and I 

think one doesn't have to adopt the reasoning of the 

concurrence in the judgment in Granfinanciera to come to 

that conclusion.  I think part IV of Granfinanciera 

itself supports that proposition.

 But I also think -- returning to Justice 

Breyer's question, I do think Marathon does stand for 

certain propositions that this Court has accepted in 

later cases and that -- and that do suggest that Crowell 

is not to be read broadly and that some of the 

limitations on Crowell are the ones suggested in Justice 

Scalia's questions.

 The -- the thing that the concurrence, the 

two-justice concurrence in Marathon, agreed with the 

plurality on was that what was fundamental to the 

disposition of that case was that the claim by the

debtor against the creditor was the stuff of common law 

at Westminster in 1789.  It was a State law claim, not 

by the creditor against the debtor, but by the debtor 

against the creditor.  And -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because there was no 

bankruptcy court handle to start with.  There was no 

claim.  If you're going to go back to equity, equity 

lays hold of a claim that fits within the equity court, 

and then, as you know, there were clean-up and clear-up 

doctrines so they could decide the whole case.

 So I think that the one thing one can say 

about Marathon is that when the debtor has a claim 

against the creditor and the creditor hasn't made any 

claim in the bankruptcy, he can't drag that into 

bankruptcy court.  But once the bankruptcy court has 

authority over the claim, the creditor's claim against 

the debtor, then the court can clear up the whole 

matter.

 MR. ENGLERT:  If all we were talking about, 

Justice Ginsburg, were doctrines of equity, then perhaps 

Alexander v. Hillman would be the governing precedent, a 

non-constitutional case later cited in a Seventh 

Amendment case and now attempts to be imported into an 

Article III case.

 But I do respectfully suggest that the

Constitution places tighter limits on the authority of 

non-Article III tribunals to adjudicate counterclaims 

than just the general and very permissive rules that 

allowed equity courts to adjudicate counterclaims 

without -- Alexander v. Hillman was a case about whole 

Equity Rule 30 and whether it superseded section 51 of 

the Judicial Code and its venue provisions and personal 

jurisdiction provisions.  If all we were talking about 

were equity, that would be a fine analysis.

 But I do read the collection of this Court's 

cases, including the crucial decisions in Katchen and 

Langenkamp which involved Federal counterclaims that by 

statute defeated the main claim, and Schor, which I do 

believe relied heavily on the consent theory and on the 

availability of an Article III forum -- I do read that 

collection of cases to suggest that there are tighter 

limits on assigning State law claims and State law 

counterclaims to non-Article III tribunals -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, by your theory, 

you're basically saying that Congress cannot delegate 

any State law-based claim to which a jury is entitled to 

the bankruptcy counterclaim at all.  So if you have a 

claim by lawyers for their fees in a defense of 

malpractice, maybe they can adjudicate that, but they 

can't adjudicate the malpractice claim.  It would be a

counterclaim.  Correct?

 MR. ENGLERT:  I am saying that, Your Honor, 

but let me say for a moment why that's not inefficient, 

why that's not such a surprising proposition.  Remember, 

the bankruptcy court can hear all of these claims unless 

they're covered by 157(b)(5).  It just can't determine 

them.

 So, the only thing we're talking about is 

the standard of review.  And with respect to -- it's not 

a surprising proposition that the requirement of an 

Article III forum does require that the district court, 

the Article III court, decide those claims.  So -- so 

the -- my position is as broad as Your Honor's question 

suggests, but the implications are not quite as broad as 

Mr. Richland suggested when he said that an Article III 

forum always brings in inefficiency.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Englert, one real 

difference between Marathon and this case is that 

Congress passed legislation in between which brought the 

bankruptcy judges under the control of the district 

courts and made them entirely Article III entities.  So 

you can look at a case like Marathon -- I mean, not -­

supervised by Article III entities, not by the 

President, not by Congress.

 So one can look at a case like Marathon and

say the problem there was that the President appointed 

the bankruptcy judges in a way that the President no 

longer does and that the district courts did not have 

the supervisory control over the bankruptcy judges in 

the way that they do now, and that that makes a 

constitutional difference.

 MR. ENGLERT:  I -- I would respectfully 

subject -- suggest not, Justice Kagan, because there 

remains a difference between a non-Article III court and 

an Article III court, and the degree of supervision does 

not convert the non-Article III court into an Article 

III court.  It simply means that we've gotten to this 

non-Article III forum in a way that gives slightly 

tighter control to the judiciary.

 But as a whole line of cases, including 

Crowell v. Benson, suggests, the degree of substantive 

review of individual decisions by non-Article III 

tribunals matters.  It's not just the front end at which 

the judges or commissioners or whatever they are of the 

non-Article III tribunal are selected.  It's also the 

back end at which the Article III forum is either really 

making the Article III decisions or giving deferential 

review to the decisions of a non-Article I court.  So I 

do think the problem is not solved simply by a different 

method of appointment of -- of bankruptcy courts.

Now, if I may, I'd like to spend a few 

minutes on section 157(b)(5).  It was interesting to me 

that Mr. Stewart said the Government had no -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Just clarify one point, 

Mr. Englert.  As I understand it, before the code was 

amended, when the Federal courts were operating under 

the interim rule, it was standard that the bankruptcy 

judges, given a claim against the estate, routinely 

dealt with counterclaims.  Isn't that what the practice 

was when the interim rule was in effect?

 MR. ENGLERT:  I -- I believe the answer is 

yes, Justice Ginsburg.  I can concede that point.  But 

there was, I believe, de novo review in district court. 

And in any event, the interim rules were in effect for a 

very short time as the arc of constitutional decision 

making goes.

 Marathon was decided in 1982.  Congress 

passed new legislation in 1984, and it took quite 

sometime for the interim rules to be put into effect.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But did all of those court 

of appeals cases involve Article III claims?  Did they 

pass upon the Article III contention?

 If not, it's -- it's our clear law that 

questions -- jurisdictional questions that aren't raised 

and discussed are not decided for precedential purposes.

How -- how many of those cases grappled with the Article 

III question?

 MR. ENGLERT:  I -- I don't have a case count 

for you, Justice Scalia.  Some did, I must concede that 

some did, but certainly not all did.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but not most, I 

don't think.

 MR. ENGLERT:  Not most, and they were only 

decisions of -- of lower courts, not of this Court.

 Now, on the personal injury tort provision 

in section 157(b)(5), which, by the way, is also 

repeated in 157(b)(2)(B) and in 157(b)(2)(O) to give 

emphasis to the fact that Congress really did not want 

bankruptcy judges trying personal injury tort claims. 

The -- the greatest dispute before this Court is not 

whether we are right about 157(b)(5).  Mr. Richland in 

his -- in his reply brief says we're not right, but I 

leave the Court to assess those arguments, but -- and 

Mr. Stewart takes no position.  The greatest dispute is 

whether that issue was preserved for review.

 And I want to suggest to this Court that it 

was clearly preserved for review.  In the proof of claim 

filed on June 12th, 1996, Mr. Marshall, Pierce Marshall, 

checked the box indicating that he was filing a personal 

injury tort claim.  So from literally the first document

that potentially brought this issue before the 

bankruptcy court, it was noted that it was a personal 

injury tort claim.  Twenty-seven months passed before he 

moved to withdraw the reference, that's true.

 What's not true is that anything had 

happened on the defamation claim during those 27 months, 

and what's not true is that any court below held that 

delay against Pierce Marshall.  If you look at pages 109 

to 112 of the Joint Appendix filed in this Court, you 

will see that the timeliness of the motion to withdraw 

the reference was actually discussed in the motion 

itself.  That's a matter easily accessible to this 

Court.

 Judge Keller granted the motion to withdraw 

the reference.  He said, Pierce Marshall, you're right. 

Then he reversed himself.  And you can find his ruling 

reversing himself at pages 138 to 139 of the Joint 

Appendix filed in this Court, but he did not reverse 

himself on timeliness grounds.

 Our respectful submission is that by 

granting the motion and then reversing on other grounds, 

he clearly accepted its timeliness.  In any event, the 

issue was clearly raised in the bankruptcy court and in 

the district court -­

hear.  On what grounds did he reverse himself, do you 

think?

 MR. ENGLERT:  He concluded that the

claim and the counterclaim on the merits.

and suppose you lost, then wouldn't we send it back for 

you -- if you're right on that, for the Ninth Circuit to

there is a reason, and I believe a -- a question from 

one member of the bench earlier suggested that there 

might be a reason to reach the 157(b)(5) issue, and to

easy.  The constitutional question is hard.

 MR. ENGLERT:  Is easy.  The constitutional 

question is hard.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If it's that hard, why 

don't we just DIG the case?  I guess that -­

(Laughter.)

 MR. ENGLERT:  No, but really, the 157(b)(5) 

question is -- is easy, but the strongest argument 

Mr. Richland makes on the merits of the 157(b)(5) claim 

is that Congress meant only bodily injury when it 

referred to personal injury.  But section 522(d)(11) of 

the code uses the term "bodily injury," so we know that 

when Congress means bodily injury, it says bodily 

injury.  It's also been suggested that the phrase 

"personal injury or wrongful death" is a phrase to which 

the canons of interpretation, noscitur a sociis and 

ejusdem generis, somehow apply.  That's not why Congress 

used "personal injury or wrongful death."

 Until 1846, with Lord Campbell's Act, the 

common law of England was that a wrongful death claim 

didn't survive, couldn't be brought by the -- by the 

heirs, because the victim of the tort was dead.

 It is quite common all around the country to 

use the phrase "personal injury or wrongful death" to

make clear that the tort being covered is a tort that 

resulted in injury to someone who survived or is a tort 

that resulted in death.  So there's nothing surprising 

about the use of that phrase.  It doesn't mean bodily 

injury.  And for those who look at legislative history, 

there is legislative history indicating quite 

emphatically that the members of Congress who were 

responsible for adding 157(b)(5), amending 157(b)(2)(B), 

amending 157(b)(O), and putting the abstention 

provisions in section 1334(c) really meant for 

bankruptcy judges to keep their hands off personal 

injury claims.

 The main claim in this case that conceivably 

could have given the bankruptcy court jurisdiction, if I 

lose on the other issues, was Pierce's defamation claim, 

not Vickie's intentional interference claim.  We would 

respectfully suggest they're both personal injury tort 

claims, but it's particularly clear that Pierce's 

defamation claim is an injury to his personal interest 

in reputation.

 So either by resolving the constitutional 

issue or through the canon of constitutional avoidance, 

or simply because it is the best reading of 157(b)(2), 

this Court should affirm the Ninth Circuit.  Thank you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. RICHLAND:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 Let me address immediately this question of 

whether Judge Keller effectively denied this -- this 

withdrawal motion on timeliness grounds or not, because 

that truly is the easy way of resolving this personal 

injury question.  The substantive question of whether 

these particular torts fall within the personal injury 

exception is a most difficult one, and it is one that 

this Court really shouldn't take on unless there's a 

substantial amount more of briefing and input from -­

from others.

 But the waiver issue is an easy one, and the 

reason it's an easy one is the record is undisputed that 

it was 27 months between the time that this claim -­

counterclaim was -- claim was filed and between the time 

that this personal injury issue was raised in a 

withdrawal motion.  During that period of time there 

were numerous sanctions motions and numerous sanctions, 

discovery sanctions imposed upon Pierce Marshall.  And, 

in fact, what happened was Judge Keller, before 

considering the initial withdrawal motion on the 

merits -- before having a hearing on it, he initially

granted the withdrawal.  He then had a hearing, and at 

the hearing what he said was -- he may not have used the 

word "timeliness," but what he said was you've chosen 

this forum, the bankruptcy court is immersed in this 

case, and he used the colorful phrase what you are 

experiencing here is the spawn of what you have begot.

 And I think that that clearly imports the 

nature that you are too late, you have not brought this 

in a timely fashion; everything that has happened in the 

bankruptcy court has made it too late for you to come to 

this court at this time.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I would take that to 

mean you -- you brought it in here, and, you know, the 

same kind of argument that you were making.

 MR. RICHLAND:  And that -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Volenti non fit injuria. 

You chose to come into the court, and this is the spawn 

of your coming in.

 MR. RICHLAND:  And the bankruptcy court is 

so immersed in this because of what has gone on during 

the bankruptcy proceedings that it is not appropriate 

for me to withdraw it.  That seems to connote clearly 

the notion that it is not timely.

rather say 27 months is too long.  That's --

MR. RICHLAND:  And that -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's timely.

 MR. RICHLAND:  Well, 27 months is a long 

time in bankruptcy.

 Let me clear up this issue of whether the 

counterclaim was to the proof of claim or to the 

dischargeability.  On the appendix to the petition, page 

379, it is quite clearly stated that it was in response 

to 170 -- 157(b)(2)(C).  That is a counterclaim to a 

person who has filed a claim.
