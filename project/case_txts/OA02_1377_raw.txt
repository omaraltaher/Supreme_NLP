CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in No. 02-1377, Buck Doe v. Elaine Chao.


Mr. Campbell.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK W. CAMPBELL, IV


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. CAMPBELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


In this case, it is undisputed that petitioner


Buck Doe suffered an adverse effect, the emotional


distress typical of a privacy invasion caused by the


Department of Labor's intentional and willful violation of


the Privacy Act. 


The only question is whether under these 

circumstances, petitioner is entitled to recover the


Privacy Act's modest $1,000 statutory damages remedy.


QUESTION: Before we go further, could you help


me out on one thing?  You spoke of the modest $1,000


recovery.  The argument is made on the other side that, in


fact, it would be $1,000 for every publication in this


case, for example, for every caption of a - of - of an


order that went out, to everyone to whom that order was


sent, so that it would not be $1,000, it would be many,


many thousands.  Is that the proper construction of the


statute?

 MR. CAMPBELL: The answer to that is no, Justice


Souter, and let me answer that in at least two ways. 


First of all, the District of Columbia Circuit has already


held that the number of - that the $1,000 is key to each


individual and not to the number of disclosures.  For


example, in the Tomasello case in the D.C. Circuit, there


was a simultaneous disclosure of information about a


single individual to some 4,000 recipients.  That court


held -


QUESTION: Okay.


MR. CAMPBELL: - and I think correctly, that that


would be considered one disclosure under the act and,


thus, the individual would be entitled to only a single


$1,000 recovery.


QUESTION: What if - what if there had been an


initial disclosure and he had protested it?  He said,


you're violating the statute when you do this and they did


it again.  Would that be a separate offense?


MR. CAMPBELL: That's a closer question - it -


because then you - you've got the - the temporal


separation that did not exist in the Tomasello case.


QUESTION: Yeah, but you'd have temporal


separation if there were 10 pleadings over a period of 10


months.


MR. CAMPBELL: But -

 QUESTION: And I take it in that case you're


saying, no, there would still just be a - a - a one


violation and - and the maximum recovery, at least under


this provision, would be 1,000.


MR. CAMPBELL: I - I - I think that's right,


Justice Souter, and I want to make clear too that for each


of those disclosures you're describing, there would have


to be an adverse effect described and - and a causation


element met in each of those in any case before you even


got to the question.


QUESTION: But suppose the IRS -


QUESTION: But that's so easy to establish, as


shown here.  I mean, it bothers me that somebody else


knows my Social Security number.  You don't think that's a


realistic reason for not assuming application of the


statute, do you?


MR. CAMPBELL: I - if I understand your question,


Justice O'Connor, the answer is, yes, there is a real harm


suffered here, and adverse effect is not a meaningless


standard.  And in this case, you don't just have a


situation in which Buck Doe - it's obviously a pseudonym -


just alleges, I was harmed.  This is a case in which he


submitted an affidavit, and more importantly, testified in


open court as to the severity and veracity of his


emotional -

 QUESTION: Well, but wouldn't -


MR. CAMPBELL: - and was cross-examined.


QUESTION: - wouldn't every person who wanted to


make such a claim make similar allegations?  Is a class


action a reasonable possibility in a case like this?


MR. CAMPBELL: Let me answer both parts of your


question.  As to the first part, I - I don't think we can


presume that plaintiffs are going to make up an adverse


effect.  They are certainly under the obligations to


testify truthfully, and in this case, the Government had


every opportunity that - to - and did cross-examine Mr.


Doe as to the veracity of his adverse effect.  The


magistrate found as a matter of fact he did suffer an


adverse effect, the district court adopted it and the 

Government never appealed that finding, so whatever


arguments they have at this point are gone.


Second part of your question, class actions. 


That's certainly the parade of horribles that the


Government is trotting out here, and I think perhaps,


Justice Souter, may go more - more directly to your


question as well.  The answer is no.  Even if an


individual who has suffered an adverse effect caused by an


intentional or willful violation of the act is entitled to


a statutory damages award without being required to


quantify actual damages.

 There are still at least two individualized


issues that will exist in every case.  One is the pleading


and proof of the adverse effect, which necessarily may


vary among different plaintiffs.  Second is the causation,


and particularly in the causation question, Justice


O'Connor, this is not a - a standard that - that


plaintiffs lightly leap over.


In fact, there are a number of cases, one of


which is the Oroquoia decision of the First Circuit, which


was handed down while this petition was pending, noted


that in cases where the - the adverse effect alleged is a


- an emotional distress-type problem, you may well run


into causation problems.  There could be any number of


other stressors in this person's life.


QUESTION: Let's assume that somebody wrongfully


and intentionally releases Social Security numbers, you


know, just - just a whole bunch of Social Security numbers


of their - their entire list.  They sell their - their


list to somebody.  Why wouldn't that be a perfectly valid


class action?  Every one of them has had the adverse


effect of having his Social Security number out there, and


every one of them has this same adverse effect, which is


the, I don't know, the trauma of knowing that - that your


- your Social Security number is floating out there where


anybody can use it.  Why wouldn't that be a perfectly good

class action?


MR. CAMPBELL: Well, I - I think that the example


you give, the problem remains, particularly one of


causation.  Some folks may not have an adverse effect,


they may not be concerned, I think, particularly if you're


describing a case in which it's only the number that's


released but the number's not linked to a name.  I think


in those cases you might have difficulty.


QUESTION: Those numbers are - are linked to


names.


MR. CAMPBELL: I'd still go back to the - there's


a causation problem.  If - if you're going to talk - that


is an individualized issue.  Now, I -


QUESTION: May I ask, with respect to that, you 

brought this case.  I mean, you tried to get it certified


as a class action and you were unsuccessful.  So I - I


hear you telling this Court, we were way off-base in


attempting to bring this as a class action because the


adverse effect is different for each person.  So you're


giving up on your first loss.  I mean, there are other


circuits that might say, yeah, why not class action?


MR. CAMPBELL: I don't - I don't - I don't


contend that there aren't arguments to be made.  What I am


stating here is that there are some very strong -


QUESTION: But you say you lost fair and square,

and now you've seen the error of your ways?


MR. CAMPBELL: Well, we lost fair and square and


I - and I want to point out too, I want to give another


example of a case, and it's one of the cases that the


Government cites in its brief as the example of - of this


- this problem, and that's the Schmidt case that is


pending in the Western District of Wisconsin, which


involves a putative class action against the Veterans


Administration.  In that case, the Western District of


Wisconsin held, and this has been since cert was granted


in this case, held that, if you prove an adverse effect


caused by an intentional, willful violation of the act,


you are entitled to statutory damages of $1,000. 


Nonetheless, that district court refused to certify a 

class on precisely the grounds that I am describing to you


today.


So is it conceivable there could be a class


action in a case?  Yes, it's conceivable, and I do -


QUESTION: But even if they're not class actions,


I have, I think, the same problem people have expressed. 


In Massachusetts, we put our Social Security number on our


driver's license.  I have it right in my pocket.  I show


it 10 million times a day, or however many.  So suppose


that, you know, the IRS releases - California wants to do


the same thing.  They have 35 million drivers, and the IRS

sends them a list so they can check it out, or the Social


Security Administration does that and, my God, there's 35


million lawsuits, $1,000 each, that's only 35 billion. 


Suppose they do it nationwide.  There's 200 billion, and


that's only Social Security numbers.  All you have to do


is read through these 14 pages of fine print of the


requirements of the Privacy Act, certain days have to be


met, certain deadlines, and it's very easy to imagine


bankruptcy in the Federal Treasury.


All right.  So, I mean, you know, trillions,


it's easy to see that.  I can make up hypotheticals, which


I'll spare you, but you see where I'm going, because what


I want is that is the horrible.  And when I read the


horrible, I think, my God, they're right. 


All right. 

Now, you tell me why they're not.


MR. CAMPBELL: In the hypothetical that you're


proposing, Justice Breyer, I think there are several


answers.


QUESTION: And just make up, you know, it's easy


for both of us to make up a lot.


MR. CAMPBELL: Sure.


QUESTION: I want to know what are the


protections if you win against generating millions and


millions of lawsuits with billions of dollars.


MR. CAMPBELL: In - in the hypotheticals that

you've described, if I could take those on their terms


first. It's very likely that one of the exceptions to the


Privacy Act disclosure is going to apply usual - if it's


the case that - that this is a working relationship


between the Federal Government and various state


governments and the like, that may well fall within the


usual use.


There are a number of these exceptions listed,


so certainly you have to look to those first.  Have to go


- go back to - this would have to be intentionally


wrongful conduct by the Government -


QUESTION: Well, yeah, I can't imagine any


government agency that takes place that isn't intentional. 


You always have people intending to do what they do in the 

Government.


MR. CAMPBELL: Well -


QUESTION: Nobody released these - nobody -


nobody puts anything on a piece of paper, releases it,


isn't intentional. 


MR. CAMPBELL: Certainly the - the intent to


release the - the information would be correct, but that's


not the same as to say there was an intent to violate the


Privacy Act.


QUESTION: Ah, in other words, in order to


recover - now, that's an important point to me - in order

to recover, the plaintiff has to show that the government


individuals or the agency not only intended to do what did


violate the act, but they intended that what they did


would violate the Act.  They knew about the - that's


willful, it's like they knew about the legal obligation


and they intentionally violated it.


MR. CAMPBELL: That's correct, Justice -


QUESTION: Well, then, how did you ever win this


one?


strong -


QUESTION:  That's - that's - that's a very


QUESTION: Yeah, very strong.


QUESTION: - instruction.  Ordinary - ignorance


of the law is - is no defense, and there are all sorts of 

statutes that use the word willful, which simply means


that you intended to do the act that you did, not that you


knew it violated the law.


MR. CAMPBELL: Well, in - in this case - I - the


consistent constructions of - of the Privacy Act is it's -


it's greater than gross negligence.  It - it necessarily


encompasses more than just I intended to do something. 


It's that I - I willfully blind to my obligations in the -


QUESTION: Well, how about this case?  How - how


was that shown in this case?

 MR. CAMPBELL: In pages - if I could point the

96 -


QUESTION: This was a - this was a distribution


by administrative law judges -


MR. CAMPBELL: That's correct.


QUESTION: - of hearing notices and decisions?


MR. CAMPBELL: That - among other things.  The


answer is yes, Justice O'Connor.  On pages 96A to 97A of


the petitioner's appendix, there is the description of the


magistrate judge's finding that there was a willful


violation of the Privacy Act here and that there was a -


there was no attempt even - no even attempt to comply with


the act's requirements, and I - I would point -

QUESTION: But to say there's no intent to comply


isn't the same thing as saying that you knew you were


violating the act when you acted.


MR. CAMPBELL: Well, let me amend my answer in


this way, Mr. Chief Justice.  A willful ignorance - a


willful ignoring of the act's requirements would qualify


as a willful - and I - I want to -


QUESTION: Well, how can you - how can you


willfully ignore an act's requirements?


MR. CAMPBELL: Well, the Department of Labor was


well aware of what the Privacy Act's requirements were and

made no attempt to get the administrative law judges to


comply, and - and I want to go back here this - to one of


the answers I gave with respect to your adverse effect


questions.  This issue was decided by the magistrate


judge, adopted by the district court, and this was never


appealed by the Federal Government.


QUESTION: Well, but our concern -


QUESTION: We're concerned here, Justice Breyer


and I guess - what is going to happen if we rule in your


favor?  That will probably not result in any benefit for


the Government on this ground, but are we just opening a


can of worms or is - by ruling in your favor?


MR. CAMPBELL: The answer is no, and - and


certainly I acknowledge, Mr. Chief Justice, and Justice 

Souter and Justice Breyer, that in future cases there


might well be a lot more time spent litigating the issues


of whether there was an adverse - truly an adverse effect


and whether - and - and whether the - the violation was


truly intentional and willful.  But I want to -


QUESTION: Okay, but can - can we just go back to


that for a second?


MR. CAMPBELL: Sure.


QUESTION: Because we've been concentrating on


willful, and you say, well, willful requires a very high


standard.  As - as you just indicated in your answers, the

statute doesn't require willful.  It requires intentional


or willful.


MR. CAMPBELL: Or willful.


QUESTION: And it would be even more remarkable


to construe the - the term intentional as requiring


conscious disregard of - of a known statutory obligation.


MR. CAMPBELL: Let - let me answer this way in


response, and maybe it will - will help ease the concerns. 


For 22 years, the interpretation of the Privacy Act that


petitioner offers today has been the law of the land, and


in that -


QUESTION: Do you have a case that says


intentional standing alone must be construed to include


this conscious disregard of a - of a known legal 

provision?


MR. CAMPBELL: I can't cite a specific case for


that proposition, Justice Souter, but I again go back to


we were talking about intentional or willful, it's a high


burden under any concept of what intentional or willful


will be, and for years, for 22 years, from 1975 to, at the


earliest 1997, when the Sixth Circuit decided the Reno


case, the interpretation that I am offering this Court is


the one that the courts of appeals had unanimously


adopted, and never in those 22 years had the kind of


parade of horribles that the Government posits in this

case materialize.


Indeed, if anything, if you look - there is a -


a reporter that lists every single case decided under the


Privacy Act since 1975.


QUESTION: But have any of those cases involved


disclosure of Social Security numbers?


MR. CAMPBELL: None that I recall.  That seems to


be a relatively new -


QUESTION: See, this seems to me a particular


kind of disclosure that might happen over and over again


in a very casual way.


MR. CAMPBELL: I - I submit, Justice Stevens, if


it happens in a casual way, that's not going to provide


anyone with a cause of action.


QUESTION: Well, pursuant to a policy such as


they had here of that's the way they use to identify -


driver's license they use it on, the Holiday Inn uses it


for their social - all sorts of people use Social Security


number for another purpose.


MR. CAMPBELL: That's true.  It's certainly true


that Social Security numbers are used for other purposes. 


But what is clear from this statute is that Congress was


specifically focused on concerns about Social Security


numbers being disclosed and the adverse effects that can


result from that.

 QUESTION: That - that may be true.  What's


bothering me, which may be the same thing, as Justice


Stevens says, is that I might have thought that a Labor


Department official could reasonably think, I have a list


of 50,000 people here, several are named John Smith, I


want to be sure we get the right ones so I'll put the


Social Security number as identifier.  That doesn't on its


- on its face seem like such an unreasonable thing to


think, even if it's wrong.


And - and yet we have here a finding that not


only is it wrong, but that it's intentional and willful,


and that's what brings up the problem you come to argue,


and I don't know how to deal with it, because I think,


well, if this statute, intentional, willful really means 

the tough thing that you say, well, then it'll work, then


you're right, there won't be a horrible.  But then I see


this case, which seems to me to stand for the proposition


that that tough standard isn't being applied.  And then I


think, my goodness, you're opening the door to the


horribles and - and I don't know how to do it because the


other part isn't being argued.  That's my honest dilemma. 


I put it to you.


MR. CAMPBELL: I - I - I under - I well


understand your dilemma, Justice Breyer, and I again go


back to, I don't doubt if this - if the statute is given

its natural reading, that the $1,000 statutory damages is


available to those to whom the United States shall be


liable, there will be an awful lot more traction, a lot


more fighting over the adverse effect and the particular


circumstances that would rise to the level of an


intentional or willful violation in the future.


QUESTION: Mr. Campbell -


MR. CAMPBELL: That's simply not an issue here.


QUESTION: Really what - what Justice Breyer is


saying is - is that this issue of willfulness or not is


not in the case and we wish it were, because the answer to


that is important.  Could we talk a little bit about what


is in the case?


MR. CAMPBELL: Yes, yes, Justice Scalia, thank 

you.


QUESTION: Can - can you tell me what - I - I


really have trouble understanding how there can be an


adverse effect without actual damage.  That's a very


strange line.  I mean, in - in the Administrative


Procedure Act, you talk about any person adversely


affected or aggrieved, and that's a person who suffered


damage.  It seems very strange for Congress to use


language that - that sets up two different categories,


adverse effect on the one hand, and actual damage on the


other.  When - when is there an adverse effect without

actual damage?


MR. CAMPBELL: I think there frequently can be an


- an emotional harm that is not quantifiable in dollar


terms -


law.


QUESTION: Well -


MR. CAMPBELL: - and that's very common in the


QUESTION: That doesn't mean that it's not


actual.  It just means that it's hard to quantify, but


you've had the emotional harm.  Why isn't that an - why


isn't that actual - actual harm?


MR. CAMPBELL: I - I want - I - I agree with you


that that is an actual harm, and I think that's one of the


things that the Government is - is trying to cloud the 

issue a bit in this case, and that is to equate actual


damages and actual harm.  I submit they are different,


that the - in - in interpreting the statute, the


deliberate use of a term adverse effect and the deliberate


use of a term actual damages, those must be given


different meanings.


QUESTION: Well, do you agree that, or do you


contend that adverse effect include - includes emotional


distress and that you have to show something like


emotional distress before there is an adverse effect?


MR. CAMPBELL: Yes, yes indeed, Justice Kennedy,

and that is indeed the unanimous position of the Federal


courts on that question.


QUESTION: What - what do you say about the


position of the - which I understood the circuit to be


taking that, on the assumption that there - there was some


emotional damage, at least in the sense that the - the man


said, I was very upset when I heard that the number was


out.  Assuming that, I thought the Fourth Circuit was


saying, there is a category of harm that is generally non­


compensable in the law, and we assume it ought to be non­


compensable here, and that category is emotional damage,


which has no physical manifestation.  And the general


policy behind that is, we don't allow generally, tort law


doesn't allow recovery there because it's too easy to 

fake.


And the Fourth Circuit, I thought, was saying,


you know, whether you're talking about damage or whether


you're talking about effect, this is an effect that the


law simply doesn't generally recognize and it shouldn't be


recognized here.  That's a different issue from whether it


can be quantified or not.  What the circuit was saying is,


you don't even get to the point of proving quantification.


What - what is your response to that?


MR. CAMPBELL: If that is indeed what the Fourth


Circuit's position is, it's squarely wrong.  At common law

and intentional torts generally, and in privacy torts


specifically, this type of harm is compensable in some at


least minimal way, even if it cannot be quantified, and I


think that's why -


QUESTION: What about - even if there is no


physical manifestation?


MR. CAMPBELL: Even if there is no physical


manifestation.  Indeed, I submit, Justice Souter, it's -


there's nothing surprising about the overall remedial


scheme here, because it does track what happened at common


law and intentional torts and with respect to intentional


privacy torts.  In fact, the Privacy Act is more strict


even than what was required at common law.  At common law,


even no damage at all, no - I'm sorry - I don't - I don't 

want to get back into the confusion over the terms.  Even


if there was no harm at all, there would be still be some


at least minimal award, recognizing the invasion.


QUESTION: Sure, because privacy -


MR. CAMPBELL: Here you have to put -


QUESTION:  - I mean, in your - I understand your


privacy argument, but that's because the invasion of


privacy or the infringement of privacy is regarded simply


as - as injury per se, and - and I thought the circuit was


saying, that's not what we're dealing with here.  But


you're saying, what, privacy is privacy and - and -

 MR. CAMPBELL: Well, I - I want to -


QUESTION: But it's - but if that is so, then let


me just get to my question.  If that is so, why did the


statute go into speaking of actual damage at all?  Why


didn't the statute simply say, if they invade the privacy


by publishing something they shouldn't publish, you get at


least $1,000 regardless.  But that's not what it said. 


It's keyed it to actual damage, and it said, if there's


actual damage, the person entitled to recovery for actual


damage gets at least 1,000, which is something quite


different.  It does not take the position that it's a per


se compensable harm.


MR. CAMPBELL: Well, I - I, of course, disagree


with your characterization of what subsection (A) in fact 

says, but let me go back to first part of the answer.  We


are talking about an adverse effect, so we are talking


about having to prove a harm.  We're not just talking


about the ability to vindicate a privacy interest in the


abstract.  You can certainly do that at common law, and


Congress could have written a statute that allowed you to


do that under the Privacy Act.  It didn't.  It did at


least require that you demonstrate an adverse effect and


real harm.


QUESTION: And what - can - can you - and this


goes back to Justice Scalia's initial question, what is

the difference in adverse effect and actual damage?


MR. CAMPBELL: The difference is the ability to


quantify the harm in some dollar amount.


QUESTION: Yes, but if that's - if that's the


case, I don't see why the risk of being subjected to


identity theft would be increased by the disclosure of


your Social Security number, and if that's true, and I


think some people could prove the risk is increased, that


would be true of every release of every Social Security


number.


MR. CAMPBELL: I - I - I would certainly agree


that there is a real risk of identity theft any time


there's a disclosure of a Social Security number,


particularly as here when it's linked directly with the 

name.


QUESTION: So does it not necessarily follow that


every one of those releases causes an adverse effect?


MR. CAMPBELL: I don't think it is.  There could


be - there could be people who aren't bothered by that or


who don't share that fear.


QUESTION: Whether they're bothered about it or


not, they're - they have an increased risk, just if you


increase your risk of death, maybe they're not aware of


it, but it's still an adverse effect.


MR. CAMPBELL: Well, I do not contend that the

Privacy Act is a statute that - that compensates in some


way for merely increased risk.  I think that does go back


to the adverse effect here.  You do have to have some sort


of harm that actualizes, and here it did actualize in his


real emotional distress about the disclosure.


QUESTION: Well, I mean, that doesn't answer it. 


The harm does actualize, as you say it, once the Social


Security number is released, the harm actualizes.  You're


at greater risk than you were before.  That's - that's


actual as can be.


MR. CAMPBELL: I can't support that


interpretation of the act, although candidly, it - it


probably would be a better one for plaintiffs in the - in


the run-of-the-mine case.  And the reason is this: If the


- if the disclosure itself is the adverse effect, what


happens is that the causation language in subsection


(g)(1)(D) becomes superfluous, and I am being careful to


the - the text here -


QUESTION: Well, it's superfluous with respect to


Social Security numbers, but the statute covers a whole


range of activities other than this particular case.


MR. CAMPBELL: Absolutely, Justice Stevens, and I


- I - but I'm not sure - I - I don't think the answer is


that it would be just superfluous with respect to Social


Security numbers.  In every case, if the release of any

information, let's say it's a medical record, not a Social


Security number.  If the release itself is the adverse


effect, the problem is that does not - that does not hew


to the - the causation language contained in subsection


(g)(1)(D).


QUESTION: Well, the release of medical


information doesn't necessarily increase the risk of any


particular harm.  But this particular information does


increase the risk of an identity theft for everybody.


MR. CAMPBELL: It does increase that - it does


increase the risk -


QUESTION: It is not true if you say, well,


you're taking aspirin three times a day or something like


that.  So what?  But this is not a so-what situation.


MR. CAMPBELL: No, it's a - I agree, Justice


Stevens.  It does increase the risk, but - but for some


people, that increased risk may not cause them an adverse


effect, the personal adverse effect.


I would like to reserve the remainder of my time


for rebuttal, if I may.


QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Campbell.


Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:


I'd like to begin by discussing the distinction


as we see it between the terms adverse effect and actual


damages.  And as one of Justice Scalia's questions


indicate, the term adverse effect is not one that


originated in the Privacy Act. It's - it's a term of art. 


The general judicial review provision of the


Administrative Procedure Act grants a right of action to


persons adversely affected or aggrieved, and I don't think


it's the case that a plaintiff under the APA needs to show


that he has suffered the type of harm that would


ordinarily be compensable in damages.


Because the APA excludes money damages as an


available item of relief, the typical inquiry in - under 

the APA in determining whether a plaintiff has standing is


whether he is likely to suffer harm in the future, not


whether he has been harmed in the past.  And if we had a


hypothetical APA suit, for instance, challenging an


ongoing or imminent program by which the Government


intended to release Social Security numbers, and a


particular plaintiff could show there is a likelihood that


my own Social Security number will be released in the near


future, I think that would be sufficient in and of itself


to establish that that person was adversely affected or


aggrieved within the meaning of the act.

 He would be suffering a - a violation of his


legal right to have information about him maintained


within the Government's files and he would also suffer at


least an increased risk of identity theft.  That would be


enough to get him into the - into court to seek


prospective, injunctive, or declaratory relief.  But those


certainly wouldn't be the types of harms that would


ordinarily be compensable in damages.


QUESTION: Well, but that - but that's not the


question.  It - it - the point is it's - it's not only


enough to get him into court, which is what it is said


adverse effect does here, it is enough under the APA to


give him judgment.  He wins.


MR. STEWART: He wins -


QUESTION: It - it is enough to give - to make


his claim a valid - a valid claim.


MR. STEWART: He - he wins but -


QUESTION: And the reason he can't get money


damages has nothing to do with the magic words, adversely


affected.  It has to do with simply the fact that money


damages are not available under the APA.


MR. STEWART: But -


QUESTION: But he wins under the APA.


MR. STEWART: But the fact that a plaintiff can


win under the APA and, in our view, can't win under the

damages provision of the Privacy Act simply reflects what


is implicit in the APA's exclusion of money damages as an


available item of relief, namely the view that agency


action should ordinarily be reviewable in court, and


plaintiffs who can show that they would be injured by


unlawful government conduct in the future should


ordinarily be able to get a judicial order decreeing that


that not take place.  But plaintiffs are not ordinarily


entitled to receive money damages from the Government for


wrongs committed against them.


QUESTION: And I take it you're - you're saying


here - and they're not here because there's a further


requirement of actual damage before they get money.


MR. STEWART: That - that's right.


QUESTION: Yeah.


MR. STEWART: That the damages provisions


restricts the availability of monetary relief to a person


entitled to recovery, and the phrase, person entitled to


recovery, is most naturally construed to mean someone who


has not only established a violation of law, but who has


established the prerequisites to an award of compensatory


relief.


QUESTION: Why - why did they put that phrase,


entitled to recovery, in there in addition to actual


damages?  I'll be candid with you that I - I was thinking

that maybe they put it in there because they anticipated


this - this category of cases like emotional damage


without physical manifestations is non-compensable, and


that - and that they were trying to leave open that kind


of a condition.


MR. STEWART: One - one hypothesis as to why the


phrase may appear as it does.  The phrase originated in


the Senate version of the legislation, and the Senate


version said that a plaintiff who establishes a will - an


intentional or willful violation can collect actual or


general damages, but a person entitled to recovery shall


receive no less than $1,000. And so, in the context of


that provision, the phrase, person entitled to recovery,


could be a shorthand for person entitled to recover either 

actual or general damages.


QUESTION: Well, he is entitled to recover actual


damages if he has any.


QUESTION: Yeah.


MR. STEWART: But that -


QUESTION: And he's entitled to recover it if he


doesn't have any.  He's entitled to recover it, whether he


has some or whether he doesn't have some.  So I will - I


don't understand, you say the most natural meaning of a


person entitled to recovery is a person entitled to


recovery who actually has actual damages.  That isn't how

I'd normally read it.  I'd - I'd read it somebody who's -


who's entitled to get it if he has it.


QUESTION: Well, I guess that's the issue.


QUESTION: Yeah, that is the issue.  So I just


want you to explain a little bit more -


(Laughter.)


MR. STEWART: I mean, I think - I think -


QUESTION: - about why that's the most natural


reading.


MR. STEWART: I mean, the more - I think the more


natural reading is that a person entitled to recovery is


someone who not only has established some of the


prerequisites to an actual recovery, namely a compensatory


award, but who has established all of them.  And if the


only compensatory relief available is actual damages, then


a person who hasn't established actual damages is not


entitled to recovery.


But even if a plausible argument could be made


the other way, then the canon of construction that waivers


of sovereign immunity are to be construed narrowly would


compel the Court to read it in - in the narrow way.


QUESTION: Well, plus - plus the canon that -


that you don't give words a meaning that renders them


totally superfluous.


MR. STEWART: That - that's -

MR. STEWART: Or - or -


QUESTION: Just read it, but in no case shall he


receive less than the sum of 10,000, of $1,000.


MR. STEWART: That's correct.  If - if Congress


had intended that any plaintiff who established an adverse


effect from a willful or intentional violation would


automatically receive at least $1,000, it could have used


the word person or individual or complainant, which was -


which were the words that Congress used elsewhere in the


Privacy Act to describe the individual whose rights had


arguably been violated.


QUESTION: Or just - just drop entitled to


recovery.

MR. STEWART: Exactly.


QUESTION: Shall a person receive less than the


MR. STEWART: And the other point I would - we


would make in following up on one of Justice -


QUESTION: Mr. Stewart, if - and before going to


the words of the statute, this - there are any number of


statutes that have actual damages and it can say, or the


statutory damages, and some of them have this formula,

actual damages and person entitled to recover, and then


there's shades in between.  Do you - do you really think


that Congress, by using those different formulas, meant a


different result in what would seem to be cases that don't


- are not sensibly distinguished?


MR. STEWART: I mean, I think - I think we have


to infer that Congress or presume that Congress meant


something by the choice of words that it used.  And the


phrase entitled to recovery is -


QUESTION: A benign fiction, right?


MR. STEWART: A benign fiction, that's right. 


And I think it is also the case that the phrase, person


entitled to recovery, is used very rarely in the United


States Code. 


There are a number of provisions along the 

lines of actual damages or $1,000, whichever is greater,


references to statutory damages or liquidated damages. 


But the phrase, person entitled to recovery, is very rare


and we would presume that Congress intended something


specific -


QUESTION: All right.  I - I would - rather than


do the presumption of what they intended deduced from


canons, et cetera.  You assume that it is ambiguous.  You


certainly got me there.  I'm - I see it's ambiguous.  And


I also believe that Congress did not want to bankrupt the


Treasury, destroying Medicare, Social Security, and every

other programs we give $1 trillion in damages to people


who have the social - I - I - you've got me there.


Now, how do - what they - what your opponents


say is that is a made-up problem.  It doesn't - it isn't


going to happen, and the reason it isn't going to happen


is because these words, intentional or willful, are not


used, the word intentional, as it normally is.  It's used


in a very special way so that they have to almost - well,


you've - now, you've - I'm cross-referencing our earlier


argument and I'm at a dilemma here because it's not


argued, I don't know how to deal with it, but it seems


relevant to the underlying question that is moving me


about what Congress intended.


MR. STEWART: The petitioner is correct that the 

phrase intentional or willful has been construed by the


lower courts essentially as a term of art, and the


prevailing test in the lower courts is whether the agency


exhibited flagrant disregard for -


QUESTION: Oh, I'm sorry.  The lower court thing


that we've looked up uses an or about that, and one of the


parts of the or is without grounds for believing the


action to be lawful, which means that part of the test,


that if we have an ALJ, or we have people in the agency,


just never think about it, as they might not in this case,


that that cover - is covered by intentional or lawful.

And that's one of the problems I'm having, because it


makes me think that that word intentional is a pretty


complicated issue, which isn't argued.  It seems to be


very important, and I don't know what to do.


MR. STEWART: I - I think, with respect to the -


the language from the court of appeals' opinion that you


quoted, the without grounds to believe that -


QUESTION: I have three of them like that.


MR. STEWART: Right.  I - I think what the courts


are getting at is something at least akin to the standard


that would prevail in a Bivens action, where an individual


Federal officer was sued, where the question would be,


could a reasonable officer in this person's position have


believed that what he was doing was legal? 


Probably the 

courts have applied it in a - in a manner that's slightly


more deferential to the Government.


In - in - it doesn't mean, however, that the


Government has to have been shown either to have


intentionally violated the law or to have intentionally


sought to bring about harm to the plaintiff. 


QUESTION: Do we have to decide that in this


case?


MR. STEWART: No, no, I don't think you need to


decide that.


QUESTION: I'd like a lot more argument on it

before I decide that question.


MR. STEWART: That - that's correct. 


QUESTION: Why -


QUESTION: And some briefing on it.


MR. STEWART: As the case comes to this Court,


both parties are in agreement, or neither party contests


the proposition that an intentional or willful violation


was established.


QUESTION: Mr. Stewart, what has happened in the


28-some years that this has been in effect concerning the


amount of recoveries against the Government?


MR. STEWART: I - I would candidly acknowledge we


have not had a problem with enormous recoveries against


the Government up to this point.


QUESTION: What happened in the 1990 lawsuit you


refer to on mailing of IRS farm - form 1040s, that had a


Social Security number and the name.


MR. STEWART: That - that was -


QUESTION: What happened to that case?


MR. STEWART: That was ultimately dismissed on


the ground that the Social Security numbers were not


records, which is contrary to the general course of the


law, which is that Social Security numbers would be - be


records.  I - I want to be careful about this because we


are not arguing that exorbitant liability would inevitably

follow from a loss in this case.  What we are saying is,


if we lose this issue and if the word adverse effect is


given the same meaning in the Privacy Act that it has in


the APA, the Government would be subject to enormous


potential liability.


To take an example, following up on one of


Justice Breyer's questions, as - as you pointed out, the


Privacy Act is not limited to a prohibition on unlawful


disclosures.  It contains a range of other provisions that


could be best be described as technical or even


bureaucratic.  One, for instance, is that when the


Government collects information from private individuals,


it has to identify, among other things, the source of


authority, either a U.S. Code provision or an executive 

order that authorizes the information to be collected. 


And if an agency circulated 100,000 forms and


left off the U.S. Code cite, I think, under ordinary APA


standards, any person who returned information on that


form would be - would suffer an adverse effect, because he


would have been deprived of -


QUESTION: Yeah, but that won't hurt you if - if,


in fact, to show liability here, you have to show that the


agency officials who made up that form knew - let's make


it really tough - knew that leaving it off was command -


putting it on was commanded by the act and they say, ha ha

ha, I know it's commanded by the act, but I'm not going to

MR. STEWART: I mean -


QUESTION: Now, that'll be pretty rare and the -


MR. STEWART: It would be rare.


QUESTION: So the -


MR. STEWART: Well, you could - you could imagine


a situation, and we wouldn't condone this - this conduct,


but you can imagine a situation in which an agency


official gets back the 100,000 forms from the printer and


says, oh my gosh, the U.S. Code cite was left off, but


then decides, I know we're supposed to do this, but I'm


not going to reprint 100,000 forms for something like


that, let's circulate them.  We don't condone that


behavior.  It would be a violation of law, but it's hard


to imagine that Congress would have intended that


everybody who fills out information on those forms would


then be entitled to $1,000.


QUESTION: Just to try to get this issue out of


the case, are you content to have us decide this case on -


on the assumption, just for the sake of argument but


without ruling, that - that the act requires willfulness


in the - in the most extreme sense that Justice Breyer


describes?  Are you willing to have us decide the case on


that assumption?

 MR. STEWART: Yes.


QUESTION: You're willing to have us decide what


was not - what it was over, that there is an adverse


effect?  In fact, the - the Government didn't dispute


that, didn't dispute adverse effect, did it?


MR. STEWART: Not - not as to Buck Doe.  The -


the magistrate judge held that each of the plaintiffs had


established an adverse effect simply by release of the


Social Security numbers, and the district court didn't


expressly endorse that view, but didn't reject it either.


QUESTION: Is it your - is it your argument - and


I'm glad we're back to the statute - that in order to


determine in this case, in this case, whether there was a


cause of action, you had to read beyond the adverse effect 

clause and go down to for - or before - and decide also


whether there was actual damages, before there was a cause


of action?


MR. STEWART: You - you wouldn't have to decide


whether there was proof of actual damages, but yes, I


think if it was apparent on the complaint that there was


an adverse effect but no possibility of proving actual


damages, then the suit shouldn't be - shouldn't go


forward, but -


QUESTION: That - that's an - that's an unusual


way to write the statute.  It's unusual to - to write the

statute in a way where I don't know if I have a cause of


action until I get down to where the damages are defined.


MR. STEWART: I - I agree, but I think it would


be -


QUESTION: Usually I would say that any person


injured is the way we would expect this statute to have


been written.


MR. STEWART: I agree, and it may be that to -


Congress anticipated that questions concerning damages


would be resolved at the end of the day, and there would


obviously be a lot of cases in which a plaintiff would


allege damages at the outset, and therefore, would have a


cause of action, but if he failed to prove damages in the


- the course of the trial, he wouldn't be entitled to the 

$1,000, even if he proved that he suffered an adverse


effect from a willful or intentional violation.


QUESTION: But Mr. Stewart, I - I take it that


even - even if there was no indication of actual damage,


the - by - by pleading the violation of the statute, he


would at least have pleaded enough to entitle him to - to


ask for a - to ask for equitable relief.


MR. STEWART: We would say that equitable relief


is not, in this context, is not specifically authorized by


the Privacy Act.  But we would say that equitable relief


would be available under the APA, and the allegation would

be that the -


QUESTION: Okay.


MR. STEWART: - agency's action was not in


accordance with law -


QUESTION: I - I see.


MR. STEWART: - because it violated the Privacy


Act.


QUESTION: May -


MR. STEWART: So - so - and indeed, this suit at


the outset included a request for injunctive relief


against further disclosures, and the Government settled


that part of the case with lightning speed.  There was -


the - the plaintiff did obtain a judicial order directing


the Government not to continue with its practice. 

QUESTION: So indeed there's - there - there's


nothing bizarre about letting him get into court just on


the basis of - of an adverse effect, because he can win in


court on the basis of an adverse effect, not by reason of


this act alone, but by reason of the obligations under


this Act plus the APA.


MR. STEWART: That's correct.


QUESTION: Right.


QUESTION: May I - may I go to another issue?  I


mean, one of things that's bothering us is several issues


that seem crucial, which we're just having to make

assumptions about here, and depending on the assumptions,


the scope of liability may - may be enormous.


Here's the one that is bothering me.  The - the


Government is not contesting here that in fact there -


there was some kind of actual damage, even though it was


not quantified.


MR. STEWART: No, I think we are contesting that.


QUESTION: Well, I - but - but you're not


contesting the fact - let me put it - I - I misspoke -


you're not contesting the fact that if he showed emotional


damage and emotional damage alone, no physical effects,


that that would be enough for recovery if - if a fact-


finder said, well, I think the emotional damage is worth


$250 -


MR. STEWART: No, no.  We - we are contesting


that and -


QUESTION: You are contesting that?


MR. STEWART: It hasn't really been -


QUESTION: Are - may - may I ask you just a


further question, then you can tell me which - whatever


you want.  Are you contesting as a matter of law the


sufficiency of this plaintiff's testimony to at least get


to the fact-finder on whether there was actual damage?  He


testified - I forget his exact words - but he testified,


you know, I was so upset when I heard that they had

released my Social Security number, I just didn't know


what to do or what to say, something like that.  Are you


contesting the sufficiency of that evidence to put an


issue of actual damage to the fact-finder?


MR. STEWART: Yes, and let me backtrack for a


second to say that the Fourth Circuit decided that Mr. Doe


had not proved actual damages, and the petitioner did not


seek this Court's review of that holding, so -


QUESTION: But they said he didn't prove actual


damages because there was no physical effect.


MR. STEWART: That - that's right.  There was -


QUESTION: They didn't say that, as a matter of


law, if you don't have the emotional physical effect rule,


he wouldn't have had enough to - to get to the fact-finder 

an actual damage.


MR. STEWART: That - that's correct.  My - my


only point was, the reason we haven't briefed the question


of whether there were in fact actual damages is that our


understanding is that, because petitioner didn't seek this


Court's review of that aspect of the - the court of


appeals' holding, as the case comes to the Court, we're


assuming that there were no actual damages.


QUESTION: And you didn't - you didn't cross?


MR. STEWART: But - but to answer your - your


question about what the Government's position on the law

is, our - our first argument is that in the context of


this specific statute, the phrase actual damages refers


only to pecuniary harm, and we've cited in a footnote a


conflict among the circuits with respect to that question,


and that - that isn't presented by this case.


QUESTION: Okay.


MR. STEWART:  But we would -


QUESTION: Mr. Stewart, may I ask you a question


with respect to that?  Suppose this Doe said, I'm very


concerned about the impact of this on my credit rating, so


I'm going to spend $10 to a credit - credit reporting


company to find out whether there's been any theft of my


identity, $10.  Would there then be a claim under this


statute for actual damages?


MR. STEWART: I mean, there - there would be a


question of whether that was - whether there was


causation, whether that was a reasonable response to the


threat, but in theory, an expense like that could qualify


as pecuniary harm and, thus, is actual damages.


QUESTION: But it made - it made me think that if


there's ambiguity in this statute, that wouldn't have made


much sense for Congress to write a statute like this


where, to meet the actual damage requirement, all you have


to do is make a $10 expense.


MR. STEWART: I mean, I agree that it's a

somewhat anomalous result that the availability of the


thousand can turn on a relatively small pecuniary loss. 


It's - it's somewhat analogous at least to the common law


rule that punitive damages are available only to a


plaintiff who's shown some level of compensatory damages,


and there also a plaintiff might be able to contrive a


small loss that is compensable, and thereby make himself


eligible for punitive damages that far exceed the amount


of -


QUESTION: But it's not just not contrived,


because now it's a formula for - for all the people who


have this kind of complaint, so I think if that's what -


what the line is, then Mr. Doe, is it, all the future Mr.


Does will ask to have their credit checked.


MR. STEWART: I mean, we would still want to - we


would still have to know whether that was in fact a


reasonable response to what the Government had did - done


- and what the - the threat that it posed to the - the


plaintiff.  And even if that kind of machination might be


possible in in one category of cases, it would still not


be possible in a lot of other categories of potential - of


Privacy Act violations.


To continue with my answer to Justice Souter's


question, the - the second thing we would say about the


emotional injury is that, even if some emotional harms

were compensable as actual damages under the statute, we


don't think that the particular emotional harm alleged


here would be, because a Social Security number, unlike,


for instance, intimate details about a person's family


life, is not inherently private or secret or confidential. 


It's not the sort of information that would cause a person


to say, I would be horrified to think that somebody else


knew that even if I could be sure that that person wasn't


going to misuse it against me.


The - the reason that people are worried about


release of Social Security numbers is that that release


may lead to some further, more tangible harm, identify


theft or -


QUESTION: So you're saying as a matter of law, 

this is just what he testified to is simply too de minimis


to be considered evidence -


MR. STEWART: That -


QUESTION: - sufficient evidence.


MR. STEWART: That's correct.  And we've cited


the Metro-North case in our brief, and I think that the


harm - the emotional harm that he's alleged is really -


really very similar to the fear of cancer as a result of


asbestos exposure that was held not to be compensable in


the absence of some current physical impairment.


So to - to - follow up on this and make our

position absolutely clear, we are saying that if the term


adverse effect is given its usual meaning, and every


plaintiff who establishes an adverse effect from a willful


or intentional violation is entitled to $1,000, that the


potential financial consequences would be enormous.  Now,


I would say in all candor that if we lose this case, it's


quite possible that the Government would argue in the


lower courts that to protect the public fisc, the - the


phrase adverse effect should be given a narrower


construction under this statute than under the APA.  But


our basic point is -


QUESTION: May I ask, with respect to the parade


of horribles that we're confronted with, is I - it's my


understanding that there are several other statutes under 

entirely different statutes, they have the similar


provision but they're clearly worded in a way that says,


if you get anything, you'll get the minimum, and - but


it's the position that your opponent contends is the


proper reading of that statute.  There are several such


statutes, am I -


MR. STEWART: There are a lot of statutes with


wording, for instance, to the effect of a plaintiff who


establishes a violation will receive actual damages or


$1,000, whichever is greater.  Most of those don't apply


to suits against the United States -

 QUESTION: And - and -


MR. STEWART: - but there are many such laws.


QUESTION: And most of those would not require


proof of actual damages?


MR. STEWART: That's correct.  Under the plain


terms of the statute, the plaintiff would get the 1,000 -


QUESTION: Why in your view did Congress come up


with a different formula in this case than it has in that


- in the pattern of statutes that those represent?


MR. STEWART: I'm - part of it may be that most


of those statutes are not dealing with suits against the


United States, and Congress may be more protective of the


public fisc, and part of it is the - the legislative


debates reveal that Congress considered a variety of 

potential damages provisions, some of which were more


generous than the one that was ultimately enacted, some of


them less generous.  For instance, the more generous


provisions -


QUESTION: But this statute is unique, is it not?


MR. STEWART: It's not quite unique.  I believe


there are a couple of other provisions that use the


phrase, person entitled to recovery, and that phrase has


not been authoritatively construed by this Court, so those


- interpretation of those statutes would raise the same


question this one does.

 QUESTION: But there's a number of them that


start out with actual damages. 


MR. STEWART: And - and sometimes, again, the


words are to the effect of actual damages or $1,000,


whichever is greater.  And because the availability of the


$1,000 is not limited to a, quote, person entitled to


recovery, unquote, the plain language of many of those


statutes compels the conclusion that $1,000 will be


awardable regardless of actual damages.


QUESTION: Now, there was an interpretation -


Congress told OMB to do interpretive guides, and it did,


and it - and it gave it the meaning that this plaintiff


gives it.  It's - it read the statute - didn't - wasn't


that what OMB said? 
 Wasn't that their contemporaneous -

MR. STEWART: I mean, I think the more - I think


you're right that the more natural reading - the OMB


guideline didn't address in terms the situation where a


plaintiff shows no actual damages but nevertheless claims


the thousand, but the OMB guideline did say, a person who


suffers an adverse effect from a willful or an intention


violation shall receive a 1,000 - actual damages or


$1,000, whichever is greater.


QUESTION: It said actual damages or 1,000.  As I


understood the - that original interpretation, it was the


reading that the plaintiff is putting forward here and

your response to it in your brief seemed to be that was a


wrong interpretation because it didn't take account of


sovereign immunity or saving the sovereign fisc and an


official at OMB said it was wrong and it's not - no longer


effective.


MR. STEWART: I mean, I think if - if plaintiffs


are using the OMB interpretation to establish the point


that intelligent people can read the statute the way that


they did, I - I think it's validly used for that purpose. 


But the OMB guideline is not entitled to deference, as the


Court held in Adams Fruit, a statutory provision that is


to administered solely by the courts is not one as to


which the Court will defer to administrative


interpretations.  The - the OMB -


QUESTION: But didn't - didn't Congress designate


OMB to - to these guides?


MR. STEWART: Congress designated OMB, but it's -


the particular provision that is at - specifically at


issue is reprinted at page 13a to the appendix to the


Government's brief.  And it says, the director of the


Office of Management and Budget shall develop and, after


notice and opportunity for public comment, prescribe


guidelines and regulations for the use of agencies in


implementing the provisions of this section.


So the only specific directive that OMB had was

to instruct or direct agencies as to their substantive


obligations under the act.  Now, in the course of doing


that, it was entirely appropriate for OMB to go further


and offer its view to the agencies as to what consequences


would follow if they breached their substantive


obligations, but that wasn't a task that was specifically


entrusted to OMB by statute, so I don't think there's any


basis for inferring that Congress -


QUESTION: I see.  You're - you're saying that -


that it - it was meant just to tell the agencies what you


have to do to comply with the act.


MR. STEWART: Exactly.


QUESTION: Yeah, that - that's probably the best


reading of it.


MR. STEWART: Exactly.


QUESTION: Yeah.


MR. STEWART: So the - the last - the last point


I wanted to make is, it might be possible, if - if we lost


this case, it might be possible to mitigate the financial


consequences to the Government by giving the term adverse


effect a narrow construction, but our - our view is, if


the consequence of adopting plaintiff's reading of the


phrase person entitled to recovery is that an established


term of art like adverse effect has to be construed in


other than its normal manner in order to make the statute

make sense, there's something wrong with plaintiff's


reading.


QUESTION: But why - why do you say that? 


Because, see, the adverse effect part governs people who


don't even want damages.  I mean, it - it's to get into


court, it's just to get into court, bring the suit, isn't


it?


MR. STEWART: Right.


QUESTION: So - so I would have thought that your


- your reaction - I just want you to clarify this - would


be, if they win this case, then the reaction would be to


go back and say, all right, if we're going to give $1,000


to people who really are just feeling bad about what


happened, we've got to give them all $1,000, well, it's 

only in circumstances where the agency really did


something quite wrong.  And so you'll read that


intentional or willful requirement toughly, not - not the


adverse effect part tough.  I mean, why - why wouldn't


that be the reaction?


MR. STEWART: I mean, I guess if - if this - if


this Court held that the phrase intentional or willful was


limited to situations -


QUESTION: I don't see - yeah?


MR. STEWART: If it - if it was limited to


situations in which the Government set out to violate an

individual's rights under the Privacy Act, that - that


would be another way at least of -


QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, and then you'd say, well,


we should assume that's what happened here, though.  It


certainly didn't -


MR. STEWART: I - I mean -


QUESTION:  - but we should assume that.  Now,


suppose I assume that, and then I decide that they're


right on the basis of that assumption, and then in the


next case it turns out my assumption happened to be quite


wrong because Congress had a broad intent there.  Now what


happens?


MR. STEWART: I mean, even under the narrowest


possible interpretation of what intentional or willful 

means, you could have hypotheticals like the one with the


form that left off the U.S.C. cite, and again, we - we


hope those things would happen very rarely, but it seems


highly unlikely that Congress would have wanted each of


the hundred thousand people who put on - information on


the form to get $1,000.  Thank you.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Stewart. 


Mr. Campbell, you have five minutes remaining.

 Justice Kennedy, I'd like to address my first


point to you, because I - I think you put your finger on


one of the number of - of absurd results, or difficult-


to-swallow results that flow from accepting the


Government's interpretation.  The Government's essential


contention here is that quantification of actual damages


is an essential element of a Privacy Act claim, but boy,


what a strange way to write the statute if that's what


Congress intended.


The - the relative language is reproduced at


pages 3 and 4 of petitioner's brief, and it says that


whenever an agency fails to comply with any other


provision of this section, and I'm going to ellipsis, in


such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual, 

the individual may bring a civil action against the


agency, and I'm putting another ellipsis there.  You then


go to subsection (g)(4), which states that if that adverse


effect was the result of an intentional or willful


violation, then the Government, the United States shall be


liable, in the sum - in an amount equal to the sum of. 


Liability is established once those three


prerequisites are met.  All that is left at that point is


an exercise of arithmetic.  It would be a very strange


statute that says the United States shall be liable in the


sum of the following amounts you are to add up, and that

amount would be zero.  And, in fact, that would never be


the case.  Costs are always available to a Privacy Act


plaintiff who establishes an adverse effect caused by an


intentional or willful violation of the act.


So there are certainly going to be at least some


recovery.  There's no qualification of the costs award


with reasonableness of precondition of actual damages.  So


some - there is going to be a recovery in those cases. 


Now, if that's the only recovery that's available, it's a


very - it's, one, a very strange statute, and number two,


a statute that arguably is unconstitutional.  But you


don't need to read it that way, because the natural


reading is, as was pointed out in the argument, that, yes,


Congress did anticipate precisely this issue, that privacy 

invasions very typically result in emotional harms that


inherently are not quantifiable, and Congress didn't


intend, I can't imagine, to - to make the line of recovery


turn on whether you can prove that you put 37 - a 37-cent


stamp on an - on an envelope to get your credit report or


pay the $10 fee.  That's a very arbitrary line.  Why would


Congress be solicitous of people who suffer the same harm


- be solicitous of the one who put a stamp on an envelope? 


That's a nonsensical.


Moreover, it reduces any efficiency savings that


are realized under the act as Congress intended by saying,

look, we're not going to get into those sorts of proof


issues.  If you have an emotional distress and it's


typical, it's caused by the intentional violation, we


don't go through that.  You get your damages of $1,000 and


let's not go through the proof.  That's a very natural


reading of the act. 


But the Government - the Government is asking


you to adopt a - an interpretation that has a number of


additional problems.  It renders the adverse effect


requirement superfluous.  Proof of actual damages will


necessarily in every case require proof of an actual harm


and causation.  So even the attempt by the Government to


place a - a meaning on the adverse effect requirement must


fail. 


Again, it turns the shall language into may, or at 

best, renders shall illusory, because the sum would be


zero in much cases.


QUESTION: As to your point about the - the


costs.  You don't get costs unless, it says the court may


assess reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation


costs reasonably incurred in any case in which the


complainant has substantially prevailed.  And I assume


that when later on they - they say the costs of the action


together with reasonable attorneys' fees as determined by


the court, they're referring back to the court has allowed


those - those costs and fees, because he has substantially

prevailed?


MR. STEWART: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.  I - are


you referring to the language that's in (g)(2) and (g)(3)


of the statute?


QUESTION: Yes, I am.


MR. STEWART: (g)(2) and (g)(3) are entirely


different causes of actions.  Those deal with requests for


injunctive relief, and this is the only type of injunctive


relief under the Privacy Act, injunctive relief for access


to files or correction of files.  Those are separate


causes of action.  In fact, I submit, Justice Scalia -


QUESTION: I see.  I see what you're saying.


MR. STEWART: - that the contrast in the language


between (g)(2) and (g)(3) -


QUESTION: I see what you're saying.


MR. STEWART: - and (g)(4) proves my point. 


Here, Congress anticipated that there is a substantial -


substantially prevailing party.  That party -


QUESTION: Well, what assumption would you like


us to make -


QUESTION: Right, right.


QUESTION: - in respect to the meaning of


intentional or willful?


MR. STEWART: I - I submit that a perfectly


proper interpretation of intentional or willful can

include conscious disregard of - of the - of the legal


obligations.  That's a well-established standard.


Thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.


Campbell.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:57 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
