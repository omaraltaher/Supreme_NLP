 Since 2009, when Maryland began to collect

13  and burglary, there have been 225 matches, 75 
14  prosecutions, and 42 convictions, including that of

4  it?  I thought that that wasn't the purpose set forth in

18  what we're being told.  It's from 11 to 17 days.

 In California's amicus brief, which was 

1
2  joined by the 49 other States and D.C. and Puerto Rico, 
3  they actually do cite two particular examples where --
4  where two people, Castillo and Shamblin, were arrested. 
One was arrested on a credit card charge and 
5
6  another on a drug charge.  Mr. Castillo was actually 
7  released on his -- on OR, and, when his sample was 
8  matched, it came back to a -- an unsolved rape and 
9  sodomy, and his OR was revoked. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14

16
17  procedure limits the collection to certain violent 
18  offenses, right? 
19
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

 MS. WINFREE:  It does, Mr. Chief Justice. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But your argument 
would not be so limited, would it?  Under your theory, 
there's no reason you couldn't undertake this procedure 
with respect to anybody pulled over for a traffic 
violation? 

MS. WINFREE:  Well, in Maryland, it's not 

In Mr. Shamblin's case, he was granted 
diversion because his drug charge was a relatively 
low-level offense and, when the match came back, it --
it tied him to a rape and murder.  His diversion was 
revoked, and he's currently pending charge -- pending 
trial on both of those charges. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your -- your

MS. WINFREE:  Well, what I would say to that 

 Now, with respect to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I understand. 

1  just the fact that we have those -- those violent crimes 
2  and burglaries.  Actually, we don't collect DNA unless 
3  someone is physically taken into custody. 
4
5
6  But there's no reason you couldn't, right?  I gather 
7  it's not that hard.  Police officers who give 
8  Breathalyzer tests, they can also take a Q-tip or 
9  whatever and get a DNA sample, right? 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, how long does 
17  it take to -- to undergo the procedure?  You know, you 
18  say, ah, and then -- you know. 
19
20
21  traffic stop, this Court might well decide that a 
22  motorist has a reasonable expectation of privacy not 
23  to --
24
25

is that, with respect to a traffic stop, this Court 
said, in Berkemer, that a motorist has an expectation 
that a traffic stop is going to be relatively brief and 
temporary, that he or she will be given a citation and 
sent on their way. 

 MS. WINFREE:  It doesn't take long, but what 

I was suggesting is that, because of the nature of a 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about a Terry stop? 

A Terry stop?

 But the Court further said that there could 

be a circumstance in a Terry stop, if the officer had 

 MS. WINFREE:  In a Terry -- well, this 
1
2  Court, I guess we would look at two -- one case in 
3  particular, this Court's case -- decision in Hayes 
4  v. Florida.  That involved a defendant who was taken 
into custody, so his -- he was not arrested, but taken 
5
6  into custody for -- to get his fingerprints, and this 
7  Court held that that was not -- that was not 
8  constitutional. 
9
10
11  reasonable suspicion to believe that -- that the 
12  individual was --
13
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But these -- these are 
14  all cases -- I mean, the dominant use is to solve what 
they call cold -- cold cases, and you gave one example. 
15
16  This case is another.  A rape committed 6 years before, 
17  right? 
18
19  was no -- nothing, right?  And the suspicion comes up 
only because the DNA sample comes back as a match.  So 
20
21  is it the -- this is a very reliable tool, but it's not 
22  based on any kind of suspicion of the individual who's 
23  being subjected to it, right? 
24
25

 MS. WINFREE:  That's correct, Your Honor. 
And, if I could go back to your question 

 And there was no reasonable suspicion, there

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I know. 
 (Laughter.) 
 MS. WINFREE:  Well, happily, we don't have 

1  about the Terry stop, the cornerstone of our -- and I do 
2  believe that this Court could -- could -- who knows how 
3  this Court would come out in that situation, but I 
4  think, in terms of our argument, the corner --
5
6
7
8  to decide that one today.  But what -- what I -- the 
9  cornerstone of our argument is that when an individual 
is taken into custody, an individual is arrested on a 
10
11 
probable cause -- a probable cause arrest, that person, 
by virtue of being in that class of individuals whose 
12 
13 
conduct has led the police to arrest him on -- based on 
probable cause, surrenders a substantial amount of 
14 
liberty and privacy. 
15
16
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Ms. Winfree, that can't 
17  be quite right, can it?  I mean, such a person -- assume 
18  you've been arrested for something, the State doesn't 
19  have the right to go search your house for evidence of 
20
21
22
23  go search your car for evidence of unrelated crimes. 
24
25

 MS. WINFREE:  That's correct. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Just because you've been 

unrelated crimes; isn't -- isn't that correct? 

 MS. WINFREE:  That's correct, Justice Kagan. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  It doesn't have the right to 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MS. WINFREE:  That's correct, but what we're 

seizing here is not evidence of crime.  What it is, is 

1  arrested doesn't mean that you lose the privacy 
2  expectations and things you have that aren't related to 
3  the offense that you've been arrested for. 
4
5
6  information related to that person's DNA profile.  Those 
7  26 numbers --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well -- and if there were a 
8
9  real identification purpose for this, then I understand 
that argument.  But, if it's just to solve cold cases, 
10
11 
which is the way you started, then it's just like 
searching your house, to see what's in your house that 
12 
13 
could help to solve a cold case. 
14
15
16  rummaging in your home to look for evidence that might 
17  relate to your personal papers and your thoughts.  It's 
18  a very real difference there than swabbing the inside of 
19  an arrestee's cheek to determine what that person's 
20
21
22  nothing more about that individual. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but, if that's what 
23
24  you're basing it on, then you're not basing it on an 
25

arrestee.  I mean, then the Chief Justice is right, it 

 MS. WINFREE:  Well, I would say there's a 

very real distinction between the police generally

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So, now, I 

which says you can't do a search without a warrant and 
probable cause, and Samson, and most of your brief 
argument was based on Samson. 

 As I read Samson, it was the special 

 Why don't we do this for everybody who comes 

1  could be any arrestee, no matter how minor the offense. 
2  It could be just any old person in the street. 
3
4  in for a driver's license because it's very effective? 
MS. WINFREE:  I think the difference there 
5
6  is these people are lawfully in custody, having been 
7  arrested based on probable cause, and that --
8
9  see two lines of cases, okay?  The Fourth Amendment, 
10
11 
12 
13
14  relationship between the parolee or the probationary 
person, that line of cases, and the assumption being 
15
16  that they're out in the world, I think, by the largesse 
17  of the State.  So the State has a right to search their 
18  home, just as it would their cell, essentially. 
19
20
21  permits you to intrude, search their home, search their 
22  car, search their person, to solve other cases? 
23
24
25

 MS. WINFREE:  Well --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because you're going to 
have to tell me why searching their person is different 

 Why is that true for an arrestee?  What 
about -- what creates this special relationship that 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

or police to search an arrestee's home or his person 

 Now, in terms of the -- the individual's 

1  than searching their home or car. 
2
 MS. WINFREE:  Well, if I could start at the 
3  back end of your question, Justice Sotomayor, we're not 
4  suggesting -- and this statute doesn't permit the State 
5
6  beyond -- beyond simply swabbing the cheek for the DNA. 
7
8  relationship to the State, an arrestee is not that 
9  dissimilar.  There is, obviously, a range of -- of 
relationships with the State.  Those of us who are out 
10
11 
on the street, ordinary citizens are at one end, people 
12 
who are imprisoned upon conviction are at the other end. 
13
 And -- but, in terms of when an arrestee is 
14  physically in custody, he has a reduced expectation of 
privacy, and that's what makes, in our view, it makes 
15
16  this case more similar.  To be sure, this is not Samson. 
17  It's -- there's no -- there's no one case in this 
18  Court's jurisprudence that's exactly like this. 
19
20
21  balancing. 
 MS. WINFREE:  Well --
22
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what I want to know 
23
24  is what's the legal theory now?  How far do we let the

State go each time it has some form of custody over you,

that -- that the police could swab a student for -- for 

1  in schools, in workplaces, wherever else the State has 
2  control over your person? 
 MS. WINFREE:  Well, those are different 
3
4  situations, Justice Sotomayor.  We're not suggesting 
5
6  a DNA sample.  We're talking about a special class of 
7  people who, by their conduct, have -- have been arrested 
8  based on probable cause. 
9
10
 MS. WINFREE:  Yes, Justice Breyer. 
11
12
 JUSTICE BREYER:  As I read this, this 
13  concerns people arrested for a felony, a crime of

 So am I wrong about that? 
 MR. DREEBEN:  You are not wrong, Justice 

 Fingerprints, you go in, you put in a

2  is used differently.

 This, you put in something, and Ms. Winfree 
7  said was 11 to 17 days, in this case, it's four months,

9  doesn't allow it to be used as the kind of routine

14  be rapid DNA analyzers that are devices that can analyze 
and produce the identification material in -- in the DNA 
15
16  within 90 minutes.  And the design of this program is to 
17  put them at the booking station, so that DNA can be 
18  taken, and, within 90 minutes, that information is 
19  known.

unrecognizable or unreadable.  It is very significant, I 
think, that fingerprints are used for crime solution, as 
well as --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, before you get on

taken, I believe, from people who are booked for 
offenses for many, many, many years; isn't that right?

 MR. DREEBEN:  No, I certainly do not think

19  that it would have been unconstitutional at any point 
because the State has a compelling interest in taking 
20
21  biometric identification information from the individual 
22  that is arrested and using it for a myriad of purposes, 
23  determining criminal history, attempting to solve 
24  crimes, funneling that information back --

had was this:  If the constitutionality of taking 
fingerprints is dependent on the speed with which a 
fingerprint comparison can be done now by a computerized 
system, would that mean that the taking of fingerprints 
was unconstitutional back in, let's say, the '50s, when 
that wasn't possible, and fingerprints could only be 
compared manually?

 MR. DREEBEN:  I do not know precisely 

 MR. DREEBEN:  That is the routine method 

1  understand how this works, exactly?  The swab is taken, 
2  and if I understand -- there is a database which is 
3  known offenders, and there is a database which is kind 
4  of crime scene DNA, is that correct? 
MR. DREEBEN:  That is correct. 
5
6
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, when the swab is taken 
7  and it's put into the system, you check that against the 
8  crime scene DNA database, is that correct? 
9
10
11
12  Maryland check it against the known offenders database? 
13
14  whether Maryland does that.  The Federal system does not 
routinely do that.  Upgrades to the software system will 
15
16  permit it to do that, and many States do it. 
17
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because that suggests that, 
18  right now, it's functioning as let's solve some crimes, 
19  which is a good thing -- you know, that we should solve 
some crimes, but not as an identification device because 
20
21  you're -- if it were an identification device, you would 
22  be comparing it to the known offender database, not to 
23  the cold case database.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I agree with that, and I think 
that, in California, the brief for the States indicates

 And, as I suggested, with the advent of 

1  that many States do that, and California itself uses it

3  comes back and it returns to multiple names, or the 
4  fingerprint is not good enough to permit an

7
8  rapid DNA, it's not that it is unconstitutional before 
9  rapid DNA, but rapid DNA will permit DNA identification 
to replace fingerprint identification because it's far 
10
11 
more accurate, and it has far more utility in the 
secondary purpose of fingerprints, which is to match 
12 
13 
them to latent prints and solve crimes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you are because what 

you are saying really is law enforcement need, alone, 

1  and I don't think that the Court's balancing test 
2  suggests that these two cases are equivalent.  My first 
3  submission is that because we are talking about --
4
5
6  without any suspicion whatsoever of another crime, 
7  permits you to take this information from the person and 
8  use it. 
 MR. DREEBEN:  I'm saying that because an 
9
arrestee is someone whose conduct has given rise to 
10
11  probable cause that he committed a crime, he's in a 
12  different position from ordinary citizens.  And this 
13  Court does, as it did in Samson and in Knights, balance 
14  the expectations of privacy against the governmental

24  acknowledge that there is no case on my side that 
25

decides the case this way.  And there's no case that --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  According to Samson 

and Knights, you're dealing with people who are still 

interests. 

 And, here, the expectation of privacy is 

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, they're differently

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the typical special 


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, we have a strong law 
enforcement interest with respect to people who are 
arrested based on probable cause.  They are no longer 
similarly situated to other people.  They can be 
deprived of their liberty.  Their property can be 
searched upon entry into the jail. 

1  on Respondent's side that decides the case for him.  The 
2  Court, I think, has treated the category of what he 
3  calls special needs cases -- what the Court has called 
4  special needs cases -- as dealing with suspicionless or 
5
6
7  needs case is one in which we say there's no law 

8  enforcement interest, that there's an interest other

balancing.  That's typically not the way we do it. 
20
21
22  we do it is you need a warrant, and if you -- there is

MR. DREEBEN:  We're not asking for a new

7  apply what it called "the key principle of the Fourth 
8  Amendment."  It said that in Bell v. Wolfish.  It said

And DNA does that in a far more powerful way 

than fingerprints has done --

1  incident to arrest cases have been bottomed on different 
2  justifications than the ones that we're advancing here. 
3
 I'm entirely happy if you, Justice Kennedy, 
4  view it as an incident to arrest in that sense because I 
think that it is appropriately viewed as something that 
5
6  the government has a compelling interest in doing once a 
7  person has been arrested, and that is, knowing who that 
8  person is, which includes knowing what the person has 
9  done. 
10
11 
12
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but our -- our search 
13  incident to arrest cases don't allow that.  That's sort 
14  of the point.  They -- they allow you to search for 
firearms, they allow you to search for material that

Justice Scalia.  A search incident to arrest allows a 
full search of the person for any destructible 
evidence because a person who has been arrested has a 
tremendous incentive to destroy evidence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, wait.  Evidence

 MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, on -- on the individual's 
3
4  person.  The crime of arrest limitation appears only in 
5
6  it's critical to note that Respondent has conceded that 
7  an individual can have their DNA taken once convicted. 
 Suppose we have the same individual who's 
8
9  picked up on grand theft auto, and that individual knows 
that, if he's convicted of grand theft auto, he is going 
10
11 
to have his DNA taken, but he also knows that he's 
committed a string of rapes.  And, if the government 
12 
13 
cannot take his DNA now, it will not connect him -- may 
I complete the sentence -- it will not connect him to 
14 
those rapes. 
15
16
17  The government has a tremendous need for this 
18  information at the time of arrest to solve crimes, 
19  exonerate the innocent, and give closure to victims.

8  distinguishable --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, as to -- as to the 
9
first, in our cases involving searches for -- where a 
10
11  urine sample is taken to determine drug use, the urine 
12  can be analyzed for all sorts of things besides the 
13  presence of drugs, and the Court has said, in those 
14  cases, we are only going to consider that -- we are 
15

17  taken drugs, not all the other information --

fingerprinting, we think that, notwithstanding the 
physical intrusion involved with taking an individual's 
fingers and putting them on the pad, that the better 
view is that fingerprinting is not a search, and, to the 
extent that this Court has addressed the question, it 
has suggested that fingerprinting is not a search 
because an individual has no expectation of privacy in 
their fingerprints because their fingers are constantly 
exposed --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I would like a complete 

answer to what Justice Alito and Justice Kagan both were 
asking, I think.  I mean, to summarize that, if I look, 
in terms of intrusion, I am not talking legally, I am 
talking practically.  It doesn't seem to me -- I can 
argue that it is certainly a much lesser intrusion than

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well -- well – 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Which is, there is 

relevant privacy interests and the relevant governmental 
interests and to explain why we think that the relevant 
privacy interests outweigh those governmental interests. 

1

3  something inherently dangerous about DNA collection that 
4  is not the same as fingerprinting. 
5
6  gets me back, finally, to the rest of Justice Breyer's 
7  question from a few minutes ago because Justice Breyer 
8  had kind of asked how the analysis should work, in the 
9  event that the Court were to proceed to balancing. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  concerns associated with the government's collection of 
17  an individual's DNA.  And, leaving aside the question of 
18  how much personal information is contained in the 13 
19  loci -- and we certainly think that there is significant 
personal information, even as to those loci -- I don't 
20
21  think there can be any dispute that, when you evaluate 
22  the entirety of an individual's DNA, there is a great 
23  deal of personal information contained there.  And, in 
24  our view, that has to be taken into account when 
25

 On the privacy side of the ledger, we 
certainly believe that there are profound privacy 

engaging in balancing. 

54

that it was of no moment that the heat-sensing device 
that was at issue in that case did not detect any 
information about the intimate details of activities 
within the home. 

 Now, the government's response to that is 
1
2  essentially the "just trust us" defense; namely, that 
3  the government is not looking at all that information, 
4  it is only looking at a certain subset of that 
information.  But that has never been how this Court has 
5
6  analyzed privacy interests, at least outside the special 
7  needs context. 
 Probably the closest analog is this Court's 
8
9  decision in Kyllo v. United States, where the Court said 
10

13 
14

16  drink of water and leave -- leave the glass behind. 
17
18  said at the outset, we believe that there might still 
19  be -- indeed, we think the better view under this 
20
21  Amendment search there. 
 The only difference would be that you don't 
22
23  have the intrusion into the body that makes the question 
24  of whether or not there is a search here an easy one. 
Now, I want to say just a word about the 
25

Court's cases is that there would still be a Fourth

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What if someone has a bloody 

in United States v. Davis, which I would encourage you 
to look at, if you are interested in this issue, because 
it holds that the extraction of the DNA from an item 
that was lawfully in the government's custody still 
constitutes a search.

4  trash can along the street, you are saying that the 
police can't analyze that without a search warrant? 
5
6
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  The argument would be that 
7  the subsequent analysis of the DNA, nevertheless, still 
8  constitutes a search.  And the most significant decision 
9  on this issue, to date, is the Fourth Circuit's decision 
10

Let me say just a word, though, about the 
governmental side of the balance here because I think 
this is important.  Ms. Winfree started with the 
statistics about the efficacy of DNA testing of 
arrestees, but our submission is, simply, that, when you 
look at the relevant subset of cases, namely individuals 
who have been arrested, but who are not subsequently 
convicted of the offense of arrest, the law enforcement 
value of DNA testing is relatively modest. 

 My understanding is that --
JUSTICE ALITO:  But your client was 

56

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  That is correct. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And it was a serious 


MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, my client --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't that correct?  And he 

under the Maryland statute, that crime was not a serious 
enough crime to qualify for DNA collection at that 
point. 

1  convicted of the offense of arrest. 

2
3
4  offense, punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment. 

5
6
7  was sentenced to 4 years. 
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  That is -- my client was 
8
9  convicted of the crime of arrest, to be sure.  But, 
10
11 
12 
13
14  purposes -- for Fourth Amendment purposes, do you think 
15
16  sample from someone who is convicted of an offense that 
17  would qualify as a felony under common law? 
 MR. SHANMUGAM:  We think that it would be 
18
19  permissible to collect DNA from any individual who has 
20
21  supervision of the State.  And that is simply because 
22  those individuals have a lessened expectation of 
23  privacy.

 But just to get on the table --

 MR. SHANMUGAM:  I would not say that that 
17  person has a reduced expectation of privacy.  What I 
18  would say is that there are certain intrusions on 
19  privacy, some of which are quite substantial, that are 
permissible because there are justifications unique to 
20
21  the arrest.

2  Justice Alito's question.  This is the fingerprinting of 
3  the 21st century, but it's better.  Typically, DNA 
4  evidence is used to identify rapes and murderers. 
Fingerprints typically do not solve those kinds of 
5

7
8  fingerprinting is just to identify, it also is used --
9  fingerprinting, now, is used -- the prints are compared 
against the latent database in IAFIS, and they are used 
10
11 
to solve crimes.  But they typically don't solve the 
kind of crimes that we are talking about here, and it

wouldn't have been solved in Mr. -- in Mr. King's case.

certainly, with respect to a bail determination, we will 
be able to make it more rapidly at the time that that 
rapid DNA comes into effect.  But --

that now.  Maybe you can in 2 years. 


MS. WINFREE:  It has a corollary purpose, 
Justice Scalia.  What we are suggesting and arguing is 
that solving crimes, to be sure, is the key component, 
but in solving crimes and connecting an arrestee to a 
crime that's unsolved informs a judge's determination 
about whether to release that individual. 

1  that the purpose of it has much to do with whether it's
