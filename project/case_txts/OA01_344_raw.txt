CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 01-344, Tommy G. Thompson v. The Western


States Medical Center.


Mr. Kneedler.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


It has long been a fundamental requirement of


the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that a new drug


may not be marketed unless it has first been found by the


Food and Drug Administration to be safe and effective for


its intended use.


Congress concluded that the protection of the


public health requires that safety and effectiveness be


rigorously established by scientifically valid studies


rather than the impressions of individual doctors, and


also that persons who promote and distribute new drugs


should be the ones to undertake the studies necessary to


establish their safety effectiveness.


In 1997, Congress carved out a narrow exception


to the new drug approval and certain other requirements of


the Food and Drug Act for certain compounding by

pharmacists.  The exemption is addressed to what is often


referred to as extemporaneous compounding.  That is,


compounding undertaken in response to a physician's


prescription based on the idiosyncratic needs of a


particular patient.  Such compounding is typically based


on an existing relationship among the pharmacist,


physician, and patient.


Congress provided in section 353(a), which it


enacted in 1997, that the exemptions from the new drug


approval and other requirements of the act would be


limited, and available only in circumstances that


conformed to extemporaneous compounding by pharmacists.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, a moment ago you say


this is based on an existing relationship between the


physician, the druggist, and the patient.  What is meant


by that term?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I -- it's based on the


relationship.


QUESTION:  Well, I could tell that.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Typically an existing


relationship in the sense that the need for compounding


often arises where there may be a commercially available


product that maybe the physician has prescribed, but it


might -- or would have otherwise prescribed, but it might


contain an ingredient to which the patient is allergic, or

it may come in a dosage that would be inappropriate for a


child or an older person, and therefore the physician and


the pharmacist would consult and say, the pharmacist would


be asked, could you modify this in some way, or develop


the same drug without the ingredient, so --


QUESTION:  The plaintiffs here seem to be


engaged in a Nation-wide business.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  They're not a corner --


MR. KNEEDLER:  No, it is -- and the record in


the case, the materials submitted in the district court,


confirm exactly what you say.  This is far different from


that sort of situation.  They're engaging in conduct that


is essentially indistinguishable from that of any


manufacturer or producer of drug products that is governed


by the manufacturing --


QUESTION:  Well, can't Congress limit the


compounding to the ordinary prescription service that we


expect pharmacists to be doing?


MR. KNEEDLER:  And that's exactly what Congress


has done.  If I --


QUESTION:  Well, but they added this ban on


advertising.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, if I could explain, the ban


on advertising is one of the conditions that confine the

exemption to traditional extemporaneous compounding.  The


others are, for example, that it has to be on the basis of


an unsolicited prescription, that the drug can't be


prepared in advance of the prescription except in --


QUESTION:  Well, don't all those things take


care of the Government's interest in problems?  What


justifies the additional ban on promotion and advertising?


MR. KNEEDLER:  That condition is essential to


protecting the integrity of the new drug approval process,


for this reason.  The general rule under this act is that


the introduction of any new drug in interstate commerce


must conform with the prior approval requirements of the


Food and Drug Act.  This is a narrow exception from that,


but what Congress had to do was draw the line between what


is extemporaneous compounding and what is not.


QUESTION:  Yes, but what I don't understand is,


if Congress can limit in all these other ways the use of


compounding of drugs, then why does it need this


additional ban?  The court below seemed to think that it


was not necessary, and I think I have the same problem.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I -- first of all, we think


that the court of appeals really misunderstood what the


governmental interest here -- the -- is here.  The


governmental interest, again, is maintaining the integrity


of the Government approval process and making sure that

those who hold themselves out as marketers and


distributors of new drugs comply with those requirements


in the same way that any other manufacturer must do.  The


mixing together of ingredients --


QUESTION:  Well, is there any allegation here


that the ads are false or fraudulent, misleading,


deceptive?  I mean, you could always attack that.


MR. KNEEDLER:  But that's not really the basic


point behind this.  Again, no one, whether he holds a


pharmacist's license, a physician's license, or not, may


manufacture and market drugs in this economy without going


through the prior approval requirement, and --


QUESTION:  And what does manufacture mean?  I


mean, that's a problem I have with this case, they


manufacture it.  The manufacturer does exactly the same


thing that the compounder does, puts together two or more


other ingredients into a new drug.


MR. KNEEDLER:  I think that's a very important


point.  There is nothing distinctive about a pharmacist


putting together ingredients to produce a new drug as


compared with a traditional manufacturer.


QUESTION:  Exactly.


MR. KNEEDLER:  But what distinguishes it is that


Congress carved out a narrow exception, is the existence


of this relationship between the pharmacist, among the

pharmacist, the physician, and the patient.


QUESTION:  But why does that -- why does


advert -- you see, I don't mind -- don't mind.  I mean,


surely Congress can constitutionally limit it to try to


prevent evasion of the normal approval process, but there


are other ways of limiting it, like saying, as you


observed, this particular druggist operates Nation-wide


and sells, you know, thousands and thousands of dollars. 


Fine, put a dollar limit on the amount that any single


druggist can do.  Wouldn't that achieve -- the problem is


that the Government has sought to achieve its limitation


by placing a limitation on speech.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --


QUESTION:  Why did it have to do that?  Why does


advertising equate with manufacturing?


MR. KNEEDLER:  It -- what it equates with is the


marketing of products in the economy, and this is not the


only situation under the Food and Drug Act where the


advertising that someone does is what triggers regulation.


This Court last term in the Buckman decision


addressed a very analogous situation, and if I could


explain why it's analogous, I think it would be


instructive here.  There, the Court pointed out that the


FDA is faced with competing considerations.  On the one


hand there is a rigorous premarket approval process for,

in that case, devices, which is very analogous to the


rigorous new drug approval process for drugs, but the


Court at the same time recognized that it is permissible


for physicians to prescribe for off-label uses,


physicians, but if a manufacturer of the drug advertises


the product for a use that is  not on the label, that is


prohibited.  What someone cannot do is market in the


economy a drug for an intended use that is not on the


label, because in that situation, as here, Congress was


trying to draw the line between marketing of drugs and


protection of profession --


QUESTION:  No, but it wasn't a distinction


between manufacturers.  I mean, the problem there is, if


you're saying it is good for this, that is one of the


intended uses, and you have to have gotten approval for


that intended use.  I mean, that's what did the trick


there.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, but --


QUESTION:  It wasn't an equation of advertising


with manufacturing.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, what it is, it's an


equation of advertising with what triggers the, in that


case the prior approval process and in this case the prior


approval process.  When someone holds himself out as


producing and distributing drugs, then it is fair to make

that person, like every other manufacturer that


distributes drugs in the national economy comply.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, would you explain


something to me?  Going back before the point where --


everybody seems to agree that compounding and


manufacturing is no different, but there once was a world


when there were mostly corner pharmacists, and there was


something called compounding which surely was discrete


from manufacturing, and it seems to me that what you


described as an exemption for the compounding was the


first time that compounding is put together with new


manufactured new drugs.


Before the 1997 alteration, how was compounding


dealt with by the FDA?


MR. KNEEDLER:  The FDA had taken the position


for quite a while before the 1997 amendments of at least


two decades that pharmacy compounding, at least if it


included such an indicia of manufacturing as advertising,


or large volumes, a number of things that take it out of


traditional pharmacy compounding, extemporaneous, and put


it into the basically predetermined or planned marketing


of a product, that's the line Congress is trying to draw.


QUESTION:  But I mean, there's two kinds of


compounding.  Let's just say, it's the physician who's


prescribing this medication for a child, so it needs to be

diluted, pharmacist-diluted, is that manufacturing?


MR. KNEEDLER:  It would be producing a new drug


within the meaning of the new drug provisions of the act,


it would have been prior to 1997.  The position that


FDA -- FDA formalized its enforcement policy in 1992 to


say that compounding that occurs in the normal course, the


ordinary course of the practice of pharmacy,


extemporaneous compounding that you've described to dilute


a commercially available product, or to extract an


ingredient from it, that would be all right, but when the


pharmacist stepped out of that role and behaved in ways


that a regular producer of drugs subject to the act


behaves, then the person is subject to the prior approval,


good manufacturing practices requirements of the act,


because again, in terms of function, putting together


different ingredients to produce a product, whether it's a


manufacturer, or whether it is someone with a pharmacy


license doing it, that doesn't matter, and the important


public health considerations --


QUESTION:  What you're doing -- tell me if I'm


incorrect.  You're equating the size of the market with


whether there's manufacturing or compounding, and it seems


to me that advertising is not necessarily a good proxy for


that.  Suppose you had a pharmacy that's near a home for


senior citizens, and they have particular success with one

doctor in compounding a particular drug.


I take it if they advertise to the other doctors


they take care of these people, now we can compound this


drug for you, that that's a violation of the law.  I don't


think that that's a proxy for being a manufacturer.  We


have the other paradigm of this huge, Nation-wide chain


that advertise and they look more like a manufacturer.  I


just don't know that that's an adequate proxy.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Several things in response to


that.  First of all, the new drug provisions of the act


are directed at single incidents of introducing a new drug


into interstate commerce, or a single incident of


receiving this branded drug in interstate commerce, so the


act applies irrespective of the volume.  Now, obviously


the magnitude of the public health problem expands as more


and more people are affected, but advertising, along with


the other conditions Congress put in the act, were a


pretty good indication of trying to draw a distinction


between traditional pharmacy and what the FDA


QUESTION:  No, but that's based on the size of


the market, I take it.


MR. KNEEDLER:  No, it's based on the undertaking


by the person who is producing, who is trying to put the


drug out on the market.  It's really a difference between


offering services and offering drugs.

 QUESTION:  I'll look at your brief again, but I


thought that your whole theory was that advertising is a


proxy for market, which is a proxy for manufacturing,


versus the compounding.  I thought that was the heart of


your case.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it would certainly lead to


those consequences.  My point is, though, that the line


Congress drew is not at a particular volume.  It looked at


the traditional operation of the act, which prohibits


individual instances of introducing drugs --


QUESTION:  Which is why advertising is such an


imprecise proxy.


MR. KNEEDLER:  No, I -- well, with all respect,


what the pharmacist can do is advertise his services, his


professional services, and what the act does -- this


exemption in the act does is, respect that professional


service and the relationship that grows out of that


professional service.


QUESTION:  Which can produce an enormous volume. 


Under the act, it's perfectly okay to advertise, you know,


XYZ pharmacy.  We compound whatever you want, best prices


in the country, guaranteed lowest prices for all


compounded drugs.  That advertising's perfectly okay, so


long as you don't name one particular compound that you're


offering, right?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And that's going to lead to certainly


very, very much increased volume.


MR. KNEEDLER:  But what that does is conform to


the line Congress was trying to draw.  It allows the


advertising of the services, but it does not allow the


advertising and therefore the attempt to develop a market


for a particular product, or drug.


Again, the Federal act is concerned with


promoting drugs, not services, so when you hold yourself


out as someone who says, I will sell drugs -- and if you


look at the record in this case, the plaintiffs have


advertising that lists a whole variety of drugs available


for infertility, for cancer, for things like that.  They


are behaving just like any manufacturer, any -- just like


exactly the sorts of persons that the new drug approval


and the good manufacturing practice provisions of the act


were designed to reach.


I want to go back to Justice Kennedy, because I


would like to extrapolate a little bit on your answer to


him.  I thought, is this the -- what the Congress is after


is, it's simply a matter of volume, and you said no, so I


said, well, what is it?


Now, in my own mind what I thought is, it's the


direction where the demand comes from.  There might be

children, and there are, who find it very difficult to


swallow pills and who are undergoing chemotherapy, and


therefore there must be a way of adjusting that pill.


Now, with some medicines, maybe there's one


child out of a million.  With others, maybe there's one


out of 10.  Both cases you want the demands for the


special drug to flow from the doctor, through the patient,


to the pharmacist, and what you don't want is it to flow


from the pharmacist to the patient to the doctor back to


the pharmacist.


MR. KNEEDLER:  That's exactly right.


QUESTION:  The one is promotion and soliciting. 


The other is the doctor determining there's a genuine need


for a special medicine.


MR. KNEEDLER:  That's exactly right, and that's


exactly what the FDA was referring to and others have


referred to as extemporaneous compounding.  It arises out


of the relationship, so Congress -- in carving out this


exemption, Congress was doing a number of things.  It was


looking at the --


QUESTION:  But you have prohibited, or the


Government prohibits the pharmacy from advertising to the


doctor the availability of this remedy.


MR. KNEEDLER:  The -- it doesn't prohibit the


availability of the advertising services, which can

include, we can prepare a product to remove something to


which a patient may be allergic.  We can compound a


product --


QUESTION:  No, no.  Suppose, in Justice Breyer's


example, that doctors didn't know that this could be done


with this pill, and -- but under the statute you're


defending, the pharmacy could not advertise to doctors


that it can prepare this drug in that way.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, but it -- what it can do,


though, is advertise in general terms that it can remove,


or it can produce a product that is like a commercial one,


but while removing ingredients to which the person may be


allergic, or dilute a dosage.  That is enough to get the


critical information --


QUESTION:  Well, how do we know that, because


undoubtedly I think what Justice Kennedy said must be


right.  One of the negative effects of the statute is, it


does prevent the pharmacist from, through advertising,


telling the doctor that we have this special way of making


drug X.  That is a negative impact.  On the other hand,


there are counterbalancing positive impacts in preventing


the general solicitation of the public, which will produce


a demand you don't want.


Now, is there anything that tells us how that


comparison breaks down?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, and I think the most


critical thing that tells us that is the new drug approval


provisions of the Food and Drug Act itself, which Congress


enacted in 1938 and strengthened in 1962 precisely to


reach the conduct of people developing new drugs and


advertising and promoting drugs that have not been shown


to be safe and effective to individuals or to the public


at large.  It is the act of --


QUESTION:  Yes, but when you have the basic


provision that compounding can only be conducted in


response to a prescription by a physician, it's hard to


understand why it has to be accompanied by a ban on


truthful speech about it.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --


QUESTION:  I mean, we've had a long history in


this very Court of giving voice to the notion that


truthful advertising is acceptable in this country.


MR. KNEEDLER:  But the new drug approval


provisions of the Food and Drug Act rest on the premise


that the judgment of the individual physician is not


sufficient.  That is the very purpose of requiring prior


approval and requiring the person who wants to --


QUESTION:  Yes, but presumably compounding


cannot be done without resorting to approve -- the use of


approved drugs.  It's diluting it, it's mixing it some way

if you look at the record in this case, there are products


that have been compounded that don't resemble that at all. 


What they are, are people holding themselves out as


pharmacists who really see themselves as developing new


cures, not just tinkering with an existing product, but


putting --


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, isn't it true that --


we haven't talked about the severability issue, but as I


understand it, the whole statute has been held


unconstitutional, because they disagreed with the district


court on the severability point.


MR. KNEEDLER:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  It seems to me that you still can


enforce -- I would have thought the parties to be arguing


the opposite sides of this case, to tell you the truth. 


It seemed to me the statute actually helps the


compounders, because it makes legal something that is


otherwise illegal, and if the statute's knocked out, you


have all your enforcement mechanisms to prevent them from


doing the mass marketing, don't you?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  Well, not -- it would


revert to the situation before, in which this would be

absolutely prohibited.


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. KNEEDLER:  And FDA would have the


discretion, and again it's not just mass marketing, it is


the situation, as Justice Breyer described, of where the


demand comes from, and -- but more fundamentally, the act


rests on the notion that it is fair to require people who


hold themselves out and who attempt to develop and exploit


a market to go through the new drug approval requirements.


QUESTION:  I understand that, but it seems to me


that the -- your opponents would be better off if the


statute were held to be constitutional than having it held


unconstitutional, because you now may prevent them from


doing what you're basically saying is the wrong -- is


marketing new drugs.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, you make an important


point, because Congress looked at this problem in 1997


and, as the committee reports we quote show, it consulted


broadly about this and arrived at a consensus about


exactly where this dividing line should be between


extemporaneous traditional compounding and the traditional


kind of promotion of new drugs that the act was directed


to.


QUESTION:  Well, maybe you can't do it that way. 


I mean, maybe the Government is just trying to ride two

horses at the same time, the one horse being that all


drugs must be approved by the FDA and the other one being,


well, we're going to let, you know, drugs that are


prescribed, special drugs prescribed by doctors are okay,


and we're going to ride both of these horses at the same


time by imposing a restriction on truthful advertising.  I


mean, just maybe you can't do that.  I mean --


MR. KNEEDLER:  This case --


QUESTION:  -- it seems to me that the ultimate


problem with the case is that the Government is trying to


have it both ways. --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --


QUESTION:  It's trying to say, it's not enough


to have the doctor approve this drug.  We don't trust


doctors.  We want FDA approval.  But then on the other


hand it's saying, well, on the other hand, if it's a


doctor and an individual druggist, it's okay.  I don't


understand why that makes any sense.


MR. KNEEDLER:  The Central Hudson doctrine that


this Court has developed for evaluating restrictions on


commercial speech, its virtue is that it allows the


recognition of these very real problems that regulatory


agencies face.


Again, it's exactly the sort of balance the


Court was addressing in Buckman last term between

respecting the integrity and creating incentives for


producers to go through the new drug approval process on


the one hand, but respecting professional services,


existing relationships on the other, and under the Central


Hudson analysis, as we explain in our brief, we think this


statute easily passes muster, maintaining the integrity of


the new drug approval process, and maintaining incentives


for manufacturers to go through it is clearly, in our


view, a substantial governmental interest.


QUESTION:  They're talking about Central Hudson


and the narrow tailoring notion, or whether it's


sufficiently tailored.  I forget the exact language.


I take it you'd have a much stronger case if the


prohibition was limited to prohibition of advertising


directed at consumers, as opposed to advertising directed


at doctors.


MR. KNEEDLER:  No, I -- again, the new drug


approval process of the act rests on the premises that


doctors themselves cannot make independent judgments about


the safety and effectiveness of products, and that is --


that was a very firm understanding of Congress when it


passed the new drug approval process.


QUESTION:  Unless they're druggists.  Unless


they're druggists who don't sell too much.  Unless they do


it with druggists who truthfully advertise.  Why does that

make any sense?


MR. KNEEDLER:  But the paradigm that the act was


directed to is where there is an approved new drug


product, or an approved product on the market, and what


the pharmacist is being asked to do is tinker with it a


little bit by diluting it, by something on that order, to


make it -- to adjust it but not be in the business of


developing new cures, or advertising new cures for


existing diseases.


QUESTION:  No, but I thought just as Justice


Scalia did, that you've really got two paradigms in it. 


One paradigm is, yes, you can't on a broad global scale


depend upon the prescriptions of doctors to guarantee that


the drugs the patients are going to get are safe.  That's


number 1.


Number 2 seems to be that so long as you can be


sure that the doctor is focusing on what you earlier


called sort of the idiosyncracies of a particular patient,


so long as we know the doctor is really paying attention


to detail, we can tolerate it up to a point, and the


problem that the Congress I thought was addressing is, how


do we draw the line so that we don't get a situation in


which the doctor seems to be addressing idiosyncracies,


i.e., he writes a prescription, but the volume gets so


great that you know that that is not going on, and the act

seems to have two different answers.  One answer is, don't


advertise, because we know what that may lead to, and the


other answer is, a restriction on volume that pharmacies


can write, or can produce.


The question, I guess, that's bothering all of


us is, why do you need the advertising in addition to the


volume restriction.  You can have it both ways, and you


can have it both ways by enforcing the volume restriction.


MR. KNEEDLER:  The volume restriction is on the


aggregate number of compounded drugs.


QUESTION:  Then have a narrower volume


restriction.


MR. KNEEDLER:  But a drug that --


QUESTION:  Why can't a narrow volume restriction


work?


MR. KNEEDLER:  A drug-by-drug volume restriction


would be extraordinarily difficult to administer, with


thousands and thousands of pharmacies across the country,


and having to keep track of particular patient's names --


QUESTION:  Then have a lower -- then why not


have a lower aggregate?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Again, Congress, we think, was


entitled to look at the conduct of the pharmacist and take


the pharmacist at his word.  If he stops being a


pharmacist --

 QUESTION:  No, but that begs the question,


because you know, the question is, under Central Hudson,


is the pharmacist entitled to have his word, and --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, under --


QUESTION:  And why can the object not be


accomplished by restrictions in volume rather than


restrictions on speech?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Because the restrictions on


volume is directed at the overall character of the


pharmacist.  The restriction on the solicitation and


advertising of a particular product is exactly what the


Food and Drug Act is directed at, which is the promotion


of a new drug, not just a volume, but a new drug, and


Congress was specifically concerned about that as well.


If I could reserve the balance of my time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Kneedler.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Thank you.


QUESTION:  Mr. Hoffman, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD M. HOFFMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. HOFFMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please


the Court:


I think in response to some of the Court's


questions I would like to give our position, the


respondents position and a couple of key points on which

there may yet be some confusion, and I start with the


proposition of why a compounding pharmacist is not a


manufacturer, which seems to be a key point before this


Court this morning, and I can understand why.


Let me address what it is the manufacturer does,


how he does it, and what a compounding pharmacist does,


and I will also say that there are in these respondents


specialty compounding entities so that when the court was


concerned about, they sell their compounds Nation-wide,


they dispense them Nation-wide, indeed, some of them do,


and that's because they happen to specialize in


compounding, and do that as a special service,


specializing in the interaction, as part of their triad,


where they work with patients, they work with the


specialist physician to, for example, treat cancers, treat


tumors --


QUESTION:  Mr. Hoffman, I take it all of this is


in the record somewhere.


MR. HOFFMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  It is -- in


fact, it's in the affidavits in the lower court and the


verified complaints.  They work as part of this triad,


they are specialists, and they work with infertility


specialists, for example, for the purpose of helping


childless couples be able to have children.


QUESTION:  May I ask -- you have large companies

as clients.  Is it lawful, or is it part of the practice


to compound a large volume, have an inventory available


that you then can advertise to the doctors, consumers that


if you prescribe it, we will sell it to you?


MR. HOFFMAN:  All that is lawful, and all --


QUESTION:  And is that part of the practice that


they follow?


MR. HOFFMAN:  That is not what they do, except


to this limited extent, and I don't want to mislead the


Court.  Yes, these compounding pharmacists do not compound


in advance before getting prescription orders vast


inventories.  If that was the Court's question, the answer


is yes, they do not.


However, do they not at all pre-compound some


inventory, and the answer is yes, they do, because under


State laws and under the practice of pharmacy as it is


developed, if they know that there is, for a certain


compound, a historical ordering pattern, a week --


QUESTION:  Under your view of the case, it would


be perfectly permissible for them, if they can anticipate


a large volume of sales of a particularly tailor-made


compound, they could store up a huge inventory and then


market it later?


MR. HOFFMAN:  No, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Why not?

 MR. HOFFMAN:  My concern is with the word, huge


inventory.  If the inventory is merely based upon a week,


or --


QUESTION:  It's based on a prediction of what


the doctors will prescribe.


MR. HOFFMAN:  Over the next week or two, yes.


QUESTION:  Why is it limited to the next week or


two?


MR. HOFFMAN:  Mostly shelf life, and we don't


know how long in advance this particular compound --


QUESTION:  The shelf life of some of these drugs


is only a week?


MR. HOFFMAN:  No, we don't know that, but we


don't want to go further than a week or 2 weeks for the


sake of erring on the side of safety.  We don't need to do


that, we don't want to do that, and that's not what we do. 


I don't want to leave the impression we stockpile huge


inventory amounts, because we don't.  We just do enough


where there's a series of patients that are now under that


treatment to once compound it for that 1 or 2-week period


if we know those kinds of refill orders are going to be


coming back in again.


QUESTION:  Let me ask you what's going to


happen -- the Government for some reason did not raise on


certiorari the issue of the severability of the

advertising provision, so if it is determined here that we


should affirm the judgment below, and the cause is not


severable, then do we go back to the old regime, which


would allow no leeway for compounding?


MR. HOFFMAN:  I'm sorry, it would allow what?


QUESTION:  No leeway for compounding.  Do we go


back to a more limited regime for your clients, I assume?


MR. HOFFMAN:  First, we will revert back to the


pre-FDAMA area, whatever that was.  The Government now


maintains that this compounding practice, under all


circumstances, as they say at page 18 of their opening


brief, was always illegal.  We strongly disagree with


that.  We also believe that it's not an issue before this


case because it wasn't preserved, but to the extent the


Court wants to know about it, there are innumerable


provisions in both title 21, which clearly indicate that


compounds are not new drugs.  The Government itself


acknowledges, even under FDAMA, it would not, and it is


not able to submit compounds for pre-market approval,


because of the extemporaneous numbers in which the need


for them arises.


I really want to go back, if I may, to


manufacturing versus compounding, and that we somehow


confuse the fact that once a volume reaches a certain


level, it's suddenly manufacturing and not compounding,

and that isn't the case at all, and let me explain why,


and by the way, these are distinctions that are both


covered in section 360(a)(1) -- at least one of them is --


in title 21 of the United States Code, and also in the


State statutes governing pharmacy, and regulating pharmacy


of each of the several States.


QUESTION:  Mr. Hoffman, in doing that, would you


take into account what Mr. Kneedler told us this morning,


because I put the question to him, what is the difference,


and he said, the Government's position is, compounding is


a form of making a new drug, that everything fits under


the new drug, and that this section is designed to allow a


limited kind of new drug-making.  In other words, you are


telling us that there are two categories, compounding and


manufacturing.  The Government is saying, there are new


drugs and, by the grace of Congress, we're allowing some


of those new drugs to escape the full process.


Now, you have told us in your brief that there's 


a bright line between compounding and manufacturing.  In


telling us what that bright line is, will you also say how


you respond to the Government that says, we define


everything as a new drug?


MR. HOFFMAN:  And to address that, Your Honor,


we turn to 21 United States Code, section 321(p)(1), which


defines a new drug, and the Government talks about --

MR. HOFFMAN:  Just the reference.  It's the


citation.  The text is not in the brief.


Mr. Kneedler has it.  Where is it from?  It's in


section 5(a) of the petition.  Thank you.


And Your Honor, on that, under that it says that


new drugs need to be submitted for testing to be generally


recognized for safety and efficacy.  The Government


acknowledges throughout, in all the pleadings in this


case, in all the --

MR. HOFFMAN:  It's on page 5 -- I'm sorry, 85a.

MR. HOFFMAN:  And in that section it talks about


submitting to the FDA for pre-market approval testing to


determine safety and efficacy.  Throughout, in the


Government's briefs, the Government's briefs acknowledge

that that is not possible for compounds.  Compounds are


incapable of being treated as new drugs, and that is


because they appear so infrequently that you can't get a


statistical data base to determine to the scientific


certainty --


QUESTION:  I have difficulty with saying it's so


infrequent, on the one hand, and you want to engage in


national advertising on the other hand.


MR. HOFFMAN:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  You say it's so infrequently used,


but then you say you want the right to advertise


nationally.


MR. HOFFMAN:  Let us also talk about the


national advertising that we allegedly do, and I don't --


I think I will come back to respond to the Court's


question.  I hope I do.


QUESTION:  You know, you say the national


advertising that you allegedly do, well, there's an


allegation in your complaint which I presume you don't


really want to abandon, that advertising and promotion


essential to do business in a market national in scope,


and to inform physicians and patients of availability and


benefits of the special class, specific classes and types


of drugs the plaintiff compounds.


MR. HOFFMAN:  But the Government keeps asserting

that what we are advertising is finished products, and


they try to impress upon the Court, which is absolutely


untrue, that the finished product sits on shelves waiting


to be shipped out in bulk to individuals or to middle


people.  That's just not what we do.


The advertising we do is to tell mostly the


scientific community, nurses, medical care providers,


mostly physicians, and at that special physicians --


QUESTION:  Well, you say in your complaint, you


add patients, too.


MR. HOFFMAN:  And to patients, yes, that there


are ingredients that are capable of being compounded, and


then in working with the physician, a mixture of


ingredients, together with the inactive ingredients, will


be compounded into a delivery format that's best suitable


for a patient, be it a suppository form, an injectable


form, an oral form, a pill, a patch form, et cetera.


QUESTION:  Mr. Hoffman, what you're telling us


is something any doctor would know.  Of course they know


that things can be compounded and put in various forms. 


Doesn't your advertising get down to something pretty


specific?


MR. HOFFMAN:  It is specific in the ingredients


that we list as being capable of being put into a compound


suitable for a particular patient.

 QUESTION:  And don't you key it to a particular


compound for a particular condition, or a particular kind


of patient?


MR. HOFFMAN:  It will lead to a particular


compound in a particular dosage, worked out together


between the pharmacist, the patient, and the physician --


QUESTION:  All right.  Isn't that, therefore,


where your argument is weakest?  You're arguing that


there -- that compounding cannot be manufacturing, because


compounding is essentially patient-specific.  It is


idiosyncratic in the sense that Mr. Kneedler used the term


and yet, for your advertising to be of any value and,


indeed, as you have just described the advertising, you're


getting beyond specific patients.  You're getting into


classes of patients, and when you get into classes of


patients, this neat distinction that you draw dissolves.


MR. HOFFMAN:  We're getting into classes of


drugs, and we're getting --


QUESTION:  All right, classes of drugs and


classes of drug-takers.  It's the same point.


MR. HOFFMAN:  And if there are classes of


patients that require those classes of drugs, physicians


do not know, always, what is available for their


particular patient, and they have to --


QUESTION:  That's -- I'm sure that's true --

 MR. HOFFMAN:  Correct.


QUESTION:  -- and that's a different point, but


I mean, this neat distinction between the, in effect, the


mass manufacturer and purely idiosyncratic compounding


just isn't a neat distinction.


MR. HOFFMAN:  And we do not mass manufacture,


and for some reason -- I apologize terribly that I'm not


making that point, because let me explain what we do do.


QUESTION:  Let me just say, my concern here is


that you're telling us what the general practice of your


particular client is.  I thought what we were hearing was


the legal question whether or not the Government may


forbid you from advertising that you compound a specific


drug, and it may be that that's not what you usually do.


MR. HOFFMAN:  Correct.


QUESTION:  But that's the question that we have


before us, and if we affirm the judgment in your favor,


you are going to be allowed to do advertising in a lot


more specific ways than you now describe, and that's the


legal issue we have to decide.


MR. HOFFMAN:  That's correct, and given what the


Government-asserted interests are, that is to protect


public safety, through theoretically ineffective and


unsafe drugs, then the ban on advertising doesn't do that


at all.  In fact, FDAMA had in it the laudable sections

which would have, in fact, been specifically addressed,


which until the Ninth Circuit were still a part of FDAMA,


only the advertising ban until then hadn't been held


unconstitutional.


QUESTION:  Well,  but the advertising ban is


surely devoted to keeping demand down, is it not?


MR. HOFFMAN:  Well, it seems to be, that is


correct, and that is a most inappropriate way to address


demand, by withholding truthful information from patients


and physicians who might benefit from that.


QUESTION:  Well, why doesn't it specifically


just -- what they say, I gather, it's one thing for a


doctor, together with his patient, to understand the


patient's allergy, or the hesitancy to swallow a pill, and


say to the druggist, will you adjust this.  They want to


permit that.


What they don't want to permit is the kind of


advertising which is a form of soliciting, which leads


lots of patients, as I might -- or you might.  Suppose


they found something good for baldness, and suppose you


could only do it through compounding, and I read that in


the newspaper, I go to my doctor and I say, you know, the


druggist over here, I saw it on the Internet, is there


anything -- he says, is it safe?  I guess so, I say,


that's what it said on the Internet.  He looks it up

there, and he prescribes that in reaction to what I want,


rather than his thinking of it because of my special need.


Now, once that happens, they say, you will see


widespread demand for certain drugs where there has been


no double-blind study, there has been no normal testing,


there's nothing here but the word of the pharmacist, and


that is not sufficient to protect the public health and


safety.


Now, you say that that advertising ban serves no


purpose, they say, that's the purpose, so what's wrong


with that argument?


MR. HOFFMAN:  There are many wrongs with that,


and let me explain.  First of all, it denigrates the role


of the pharmacist.  It assumes that there's not a dialogue


that commences, for example, with the pharmacist.


QUESTION:  There's a dialogue, but what they


haven't had is the double-blind test.


MR. HOFFMAN:  Correct.


QUESTION:  And Congress in this act says, we


don't want dialogue.  We want double-blind studies before


we let something go out into the marketplace, that's what


they say, and that isn't here.


MR. HOFFMAN:  And the Government won't even


change that, their intent of reducing volume theoretically


is to protect widespread --

 QUESTION:  Oh, it's not quite reducing volume. 


It might be that there are 10 million children who have a


hard time taking pills.  It's to make certain that the


demand initiates with the doctor and the patient, and the


doctor recognizes the need of the patient, rather than a


response to solicitation.  That's the purpose, and it's


not quite volume.


MR. HOFFMAN:  Right, and at the end of the day,


before any drug can be dispensed, the physician has to


write a prescription, he has to approve it, and it makes


no difference at which end of the spectrum it commences,


because it always ends up with the physician.


QUESTION:  It makes no difference.  If that's


true, why when I turn on the television set do I see


advertisement after advertisement asking me to ask my


doctor for -- and now, you fill in the blank -- if it


makes no difference?


MR. HOFFMAN:  What's the harm in the patient


going to the physician?


QUESTION:  The harm is that there are no double-


blind studies for this particular test, and therefore,


while we'll make an exception where the doctor initiates


this together with the patient, we don't want Breyer and


his friends seeing this on television and putting pressure


on their doctors.

 Now, that may sound a little vague, but what the


Congress says, and what the FDA says, is that's necessary


to protect the public health, and what they say is not


without plausibility.


MR. HOFFMAN:  There are innumerable


opportunities to preserve and protect the public safety


without resorting to First Amendment restriction.


QUESTION:  Of course, the advertising man


doesn't just apply that advertising to the general public. 


You cannot advertise to doctors, either.


MR. HOFFMAN:  I did not hear, I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  Does the advertising ban apply only


to advertising to the general public?  My understanding


is, it applies to all advertising.


MR. HOFFMAN:  And it's not just --


QUESTION:  My understanding also is that most of


your advertising does not go to the general public, but


goes to the doctors and medical professionals.


MR. HOFFMAN:  That is correct.  First of all --


QUESTION:  So it is not a matter of getting John


Q. Public to put pressure on his doctor.


MR. HOFFMAN:  And it is not just advertising. 


It is even the promotion and solicitation.  As the lower


court pointed out -- I think it was the Ninth Circuit, I


forget which, where it did not find or understand the

rationale for why the patient or the doctor would have to


ask the critical question, what's the best thing for this


patient, or what's the best thing for me, because they


would first have to ask the question.


And the whole concept of promotion and


solicitation -- forget about just advertising. 


Advertising conjures up a specific type of sales provoking


television ad, billboard ads, but pharmacists, as part of


the canon of their ethics, is required as a professional,


as part of the triad, who is not just a passive order-


taker, who doesn't just count out and push pills, but a


person who plays a scientific role in the context, he has


to be able to on his own speak out and say, consistent


with the canons of his professions, this is better for


you.  This is what the doctor brought in.


QUESTION:  Well, but --


MR. HOFFMAN:  I --


QUESTION:  -- it's a little less chummy than you


make it sound, I think, judging from your complaint.  You


have seven clients.  They dispense in interstate commerce


5 percent of their total sales, which amounts to 60 or 95


percent of their total sales in another capacity, and you


sell all over the country, do you not?


MR. HOFFMAN:  We do.


QUESTION:  Well, then, your portrait of the

intimate relationship between the pharmacist and the


doctor I think is a little, perhaps, overblown.


MR. HOFFMAN:  It is -- with all due respect,


Your Honor, it is not, and let me explain why.  We have


the same patient profiles in our records, notwithstanding


that there may be a half-a-country separating patient and


pharmacist.  We have 800 numbers that the patients call in


on, just as you would call to a local pharmacist.


The only thing that is different is, there's a


little bit more distance.  It may take an extra day or


half-day to get the prescription out there, but that


intimacy in the relationship via the patient profiles, via


the ability to consult, is the same with these pharmacists


as it is with the corner druggist, if you will.


QUESTION:  Mr. Hoffman, perhaps I've deflected


you before, but you were going to tell us something about


this bright line between what's a manufactured drug and


what's a compounded drug.


MR. HOFFMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  So how do we tell whether one is a


compound and whether it's a new drug?


MR. HOFFMAN:  Under Federal statute, for


example, manufacturing is defined as distribution to


someone other than the ultimate consumer, and that's found


in 21 United States Code, section 360(a)(1).  360(a)(1)

defines manufacturing as distribution to a middle man, or


a distributor, or a wholesale -- wholesaler, so right


away, the first distinction is the pharmacist only


dispenses directly to the patient in the context of the


triad.  He's available for consultation, he gives


directions on use, he has the patient profile on his


records.  He knows what drug interactions there may or may


not be with this particular drug and this particular


patient.


Second of all -- and, of course, the


manufacturer doesn't do that, having no relationship with


the physician, having no relationship with the patient.


In addition to that, they do, manufacturers do a


one-size-fits-all type of product.  They have determined


that there is this vast, multimillion person individual


need for a particular drug, and they fit that niche, and


they play to it, and they market to it, and they


manufacture for it, unlike --


QUESTION:  The definition in 360(a)(1) applies


equally to manufacturing and compounding.


QUESTION:  And compounding, yes.


MR. HOFFMAN:  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  The definition in 360(a)(1) is a


definition of the term, manufacturing, preparation,


propagation, compounding or processing.

MR. HOFFMAN:  I may have mis-cited.  Then it's


368, but it talks about manufacturing, and I apologize


that I don't have that number.


QUESTION:  Oh, this talks about manufacturing,


but it also -- what it says is, manufacturing as well as


compounding shall include repackaging or otherwise


changing the container in furtherance of the distribution.


MR. HOFFMAN:  Correct.


QUESTION:  It has nothing to do with what we're


talking about here.  What's the other section you


wanted --


MR. HOFFMAN:  And the other section will be


section 374(a)(2).


QUESTION:  374(a)(2).


MR. HOFFMAN:  374 -- actually, it's 374(2), or


360(g)(2).  They're identical.


QUESTION:  Where do we find these?

that that section makes clear that compounding --


QUESTION:  What page are you on?


QUESTION:  That's 85a of the Government's


petition.  You said that 321(p) makes clear that


compounding is not manufacture of a new drug?


MR. HOFFMAN:  No.  What I said was, it defines


new drugs, and under a new drug, it has to be capable of


being submitted to the FDA's new drug process.  The


Government --


QUESTION:  You said more than it just defines


new drug.  You said that that definition makes it clear


that compounding isn't included.


MR. HOFFMAN:  No, but by --


QUESTION:  And that that's why it's no problem


to you if we invalidate the whole statute and you go back


to the status quo ante, because you say compounding is not


a new drug anyway, right?


MR. HOFFMAN:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  That was the context in which it came


up.

that you think exempts compounding?


MR. HOFFMAN:  Because it talks about drugs that


are capable of being submitted, and the Government itself


acknowledges that we cannot submit compounds for new drug


approval --


QUESTION:  I don't see anything in the


definition that says -- I mean, we went through this in


the tobacco case.  I thought that a new drug was any drug,


except grass.


MR. HOFFMAN:  But how can it be a new drug that


cannot be tested?

saying --

there is some exception for some of these things --

QUESTION:  Will you read it verbatim, please,


instead of just trying to conjure it up?


MR. HOFFMAN:  It -- what I was referring to is,


any drug which is not generally recognized among experts,


qualified by science as safe and effective, the case law


under that determines that in order to determine safety


and efficacy, the drug has to be submitted to this


exhaustive FDA free market approval process.  The


Government acknowledges that that costs hundreds of


millions of dollars.  It also requires, as case law


identifies, a huge data base from which to be able to draw


and determine the safety and effect -- efficacy, none of


which can be done for --


QUESTION:  That's why they want the exception. 


Of course you're right about that.  They want the


exception, but the issue before us concerns one part of


the definition of the exception, and so I don't really see


what you're talking about now has to do with that.


I mean the real issue, it seemed to me, was what


we've been trying to get, which is the pros and cons of


defining this exception a particular way.

 MR. HOFFMAN:  Okay, because there would have


been ways to make compounds safe and effective, and these


ways would have been -- and they were in FDAMA until they


were held not severable by the Ninth Circuits, and this


was the use of ingredients that appear in the


pharmacopeia.  We took no quarrel with that.  That seemed


to be something that addressed the safety of the public.


It also required that the Secretary prepare some


lists.  One of them was, if there was an ingredient that


was necessary for compounding, the Secretary could be


petitioned -- I'm sorry, if there was an ingredient


necessary that didn't appear in the pharmacopeia, the


Secretary could be petitioned to put onto that list


something that the Secretary would determine was safe and


effective.


If there was something that was established that


was not safe and effective for compounding, FDAMA included


a list to be prepared by the Secretary to forbid these


kinds of products to be used as ingredients in


compounding.  Compounding would have to be done by


licensed physicians.  It would have to be done by licensed


pharmacists.  These were all the conduct-specific related


regulations that one would applaud, that Congress has a


right to do.


But to try to reduce the demand, and try to keep

truthful information by restrictions on First Amendment


is, this is what's offensive about that part of FDAMA.  We


didn't seek to have the conduct-related provisions


stricken, and in fact it was the Government that it,


itself put it in, then went to the Ninth Circuit and said,


well, we can't have the First Amendment restriction, we


don't want the others, either.


I also want to point out that when it comes to


manufacturing, manufacturing, going back to Justice


Ginsburg's question, we sell it retail, they sell it


wholesale.  We sell pursuant to a prescription.  They sell


just to a middle man distributor.  We provide


consultation.  There is no consultation when it comes to a


manufacturer.


There's also, on this issue of widespreadedness, 


the degree, or the volume concern.  First of all, we can


only dispense, and we routinely only prepare upon receipt


of a pharmacist's -- of a physician's prescription, but in


addition to that, if volume were such a concern, there was


unlimited intrastate transportation allowed, dispensing of


pharmaceuticals, so I seriously question, for example,


whether or not they even -- FDAMA even addressed


adequately the volumes, the volume restrictions it was


trying to impose.


Also, for example, positron emissions

compounding, and radiopharmaceutical compounding were


exempted from the operation of FDAMA, so that potentially


the most lethal, most dangerous of all the compounds could


be advertised, promoted, solicited, and no pharmacopeia


ingredients could have been used for them.


They also provided for industry transportation


in the event of a memorandum of understanding.  Up to 20


percent of the total pharmaceutical sales by that pharmacy


could be shipped intrastate, so that if, for example,


there were five compounding pharmacists in a State, they


could fill 100 percent of the outside -- of the out-of-


State demand, so at the end of the day, as in Greater New


Orleans, this case -- I'm sorry, this statute was so


riddled with exemptions -- with exceptions that undermined


the Government's own very purpose, that it would fail just


because it was simply irrational.


As the Court pointed out already, it is


irrational to suggest that only speech that's provoked by


the physician can be unregulated, whereas the same speech


in the context of a professional relationship as provoked


by the pharmacist, then somehow it becomes


unconstitutional.


In the lower court we pointed out the following. 


That means under this statute a pharmacist would have to


have a little sign on his counter.  On this little sign it

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.


Mr. Kneedler, you have 3 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, what Congress


was trying to do here was to make sure that the narrow


exemption that it intended did not swallow the critical


general rule that new drugs have to be submitted to prior


approval.


The question of volume limitations has been


raised.  The act contains an aggregate volume limitation


but, as I mentioned, individual drug-by-drug volume


limitations would be very difficult to administer, and


Congress was not required to go down that path, but an


additional point about that is that if you look -- if you


add up a couple of prescriptions by each pharmacy, Nation-


wide you will be talking about a pretty large volume of a


new drug, which is precisely the sort of thing that should


be submitted to the FDA for prior approval.

 The act does not just prohibit manufacturing new


drugs, it prohibits the introduction in interstate


commerce of new drugs.  It isn't just focused on large


volumes, it's focused on individual instances.  So are the


misbranding and adulteration provisions of the act.


The line Congress drew here that includes


solicitation and advertising among the conditions was not


invented in 1997.  In case law it goes all the way back to


1978 in the Cedars case we mentioned in the brief, where


the Court there was trying to define the scope of the


express exemption for pharmacy in registration and


inspections, and among the factors it says when someone


steps out of the traditional pharmacy role was, do they


engage in promotion of the product.


The definition also appears in the Model Rules


of Good Pharmacy Practice of the State of the National


Association of State Boards of Pharmacy, which says that


pharmacists should not solicit or advertise compounded


drugs.


All of this represents a general understanding


that compounding by pharmacists has to be contemporaneous


and responsive --


QUESTION:  How does the doctor find out -- how


does the doctor find out that -- he knows that Joe Smith


the pharmacist deals with compounding generally.  He

thinks that this patient might use the compounded drug. 


How does he know that this particular drug can be


compounded?


MR. KNEEDLER:  That's what he is supposed --


QUESTION:  How does he find that out?


MR. KNEEDLER:  The pharmacist holds himself out


as having pharmacy services and expertise, and that's


where the promotion of the consultation and the


professional relationship --


QUESTION:  No, no, but does he have to call the


pharmacy --


MR. KNEEDLER:  No.  The pharmacist can advertise


that he engages in the pharmacy services.


QUESTION:  Take my question.  My question is not


whether this pharmacist engages in compounding.  We know


it.  How does the doctor know that the pharmacist can


compound this drug?


MR. KNEEDLER:  He has to ask.


Under respondent's theory, a pharmacist, someone


holding a pharmacist license presumably could promote


Laetrile, or could promote Prozac and advertise it to the


market at large, and Congress certainly did not expect


that sort of thing.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Kneedler.  The case is submitted.
