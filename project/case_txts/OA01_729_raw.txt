CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 01-729, Delbert Smith and Bruce Botelho


versus John Doe.


Mr. Roberts. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


Alaska's Megan's Law makes available to members


of the public who seek it certain truthful information


about convicted sex offenders.  The State makes this


information available to help protect against the risk


that the convicted sex offender will offend again.  It


says that in the law.  Sex offenses are crimes of


opportunity, and the purpose of making the information


available is to allow the members of the public to take


steps to reduce those opportunities. 


QUESTION:  One -- one line that I -- I think


there is respondents seek to establish in this case is


that this information has to be generated by acts that


occur after the conviction.  You have to fill out the form


some -- four times a year, et cetera. 


I -- I've read in the brief -- I'm sure my

colleagues have too the -- the problem about going to the


police station.  Just assume hypothetically that you had


to go to the police station four times a year.  Would that


change the case? 


MR. ROBERTS:  No, it wouldn't, Your Honor. 


That's the case in -- in about 14 States that -- that a


quarterly verification has to be in person.  It is not the


case in Alaska.  And simply going to the police station


four times a year, which is reserved only for the most


serious sex offenses, the aggravated offenses -- in all


other cases it's just annually -- doesn't rise to the


level of a burden that is at all tantamount to what we


think of as punishment under the Ex Post Facto Clause.


QUESTION:  I have forms I have to fill out four


times a year for the Government. 


I'm always afraid I'm 

going to miss the deadline.  If I had to present myself to


a -- a policeman, which is itself I think demeaning, I --


I just don't know any analogue for -- is there any


analogue for that in -- in regulation of --


MR. ROBERTS:  In-person registration?


QUESTION:  -- the regulation of regulated


industries or things like that? 


MR. ROBERTS:  I'm not sure of one where you


actually have to show up in person, but the question is


whether that in-person requirement is rationally related

to a legitimate regulatory purpose.  That's the standard


under cases like Flemming. 


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Roberts, do they in Alaska


have to go personally or not? 


MR. ROBERTS:  They do not.  It clearly --


QUESTION:  Even for aggravated offenses? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Even for aggravated offenses.


QUESTION:  And it can be filed by mail or how?


MR. ROBERTS:  Expressly can be filed by mail. 


The instructions make that clear.


QUESTION:  Could -- could the administrative


authorities interpret the statute so that you would have


to go to the station without amending the statute?


MR. ROBERTS:  I don't think so, because the


statute says the initial registration has to be in person. 

Typically it's in -- in prison.  And then it says the


later verification has to be in writing.  So I think it


would be an unreasonable reading of the statute to say


that the later verification had to be in writing.


QUESTION:  Do we have an issue here because this


law was passed after a number of the people affected by it


had already been convicted, and so there are allegations


of retroactivity concerns? 


MR. ROBERTS:  The question is whether the


burdens that the law imposes constitute punishment.  If

it's not punishment, then it's perfectly valid to apply it


to people who were convicted prior to the effective date.


And this is not --


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, the only challenge in


this case is to the retroactivity.  Is that correct? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Only the ex post facto challenge


is before the Court in this case. 


QUESTION:  And that's because these people were


tried, convicted, served their time before the passage of


the act.


MR. ROBERTS:  That's correct, and --


QUESTION:  And their principal complaint, as I


understand it, is that this is punishment because we can't


get out.  There's no escape from it.  We can prove with


expert testimony that we are cured. 


Nothing will get us 

out from under this demeaning regime, that much more than


the burden of going to a police station, that that's what


it's about, that we're locked into this for life and it


has a devastating effect on our lives. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, for life, again only for


aggravated; for 15 years for other sex offenses.  And yes,


that is one of their arguments, that they can't get out of


it. 


But this Court's cases haven't drawn that line. 


The question is whether the burdens are pursuant to a

25

legitimate regulatory objective, or whether they're


punitive.  For example, in cases like Kansas against


Hendricks, couldn't get out of that, and yet that didn't


make it a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Flemming


against Nestor.  You couldn't avoid the sanction there,


and yet it did not rise to the level of punishment.


QUESTION:  But there was a -- there was a


determination, at least in Hendricks, that you fit --


currently fit into a certain category.


MR. ROBERTS:  A -- a particular subclass, yes. 


It was an individualized determination required because


the depravation there, actual confinement, was far more


severe than the depravation at issue here.  But neither an


individual determination, nor a chance to get out of it is


required to avoid the categorization as punishment.  Cases


like Hawker and De Veau make clear that a -- a reasonable


legislature can treat a category -- a category of sex


offenders.  They don't --


QUESTION:  But in Hawker, you didn't have to do


anything.  Here --


MR. ROBERTS:  Hawker was --


QUESTION:  -- I don't like to use the word


"affirmative action," because that has a connotation in


some other -- but you have to take an -- affirmative steps


for the rest of your life in -- in some cases.  And

this -- and this seems to me very, very burdensome and to


differentiate this class. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Not true, of course, in Hendricks


or Flemming or Salerno, no opportunity to avoid it there. 


You didn't have to do anything to get the sanction applied


to you.  Now --


QUESTION:  No, no, no.  I was -- I was saying


but the requirement of the statute is that for the rest of


your life you have to take affirmative steps to -- to


re-register --


MR. ROBERTS:  You have to register.


QUESTION:  -- and to list all your automobiles


and -- and to show that you've --


MR. ROBERTS:  You -- you have to fill out --


QUESTION: 


-- shaved your beard or something. 

MR. ROBERTS:  -- one -- one side of one page.


That's the form that's involved here.  That in itself


cannot be punishment.  We -- as Your Honor mentioned -- we


do that all the time in -- in today's society.  So it must


be something else that makes this punishment. 


Now, what the Ninth Circuit's -- Ninth Circuit


thought was that it was publishing it on the Internet,


that that made it punishment.  But that's simply the


most -- most efficient and most economical way of making


information available.

 It also is passive.  It's not displayed to


people who have no interest in the information, and in


that sense is far less invasive.


The publication on the Internet will -- yes, it


may cause adverse consequences when members of the


community learn this public fact about someone's past. 


But the State is certainly free to weigh the convicted sex


offender's interest in keeping that public fact from being


widely known against the interest of those in the position


of, say, Megan Kanka's parents. 


QUESTION:  Well, "waive" -- "waive" isn't quite


the word, Mr. Roberts.  I mean, "waive" is something a


person does --


MR. ROBERTS:  "Weigh."  I'm sorry.  "Weigh."


QUESTION: 


Oh, I thought you said "waive." 

MR. ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Weigh the convicted


sex offender's interest in keeping a public fact about his


past secret against Megan Kanka's parents' interest in


knowing that their new neighbor across the street had


twice been convicted of sexually abusing young girls. 


That's a determination for the legislature to make.


There are costs --


QUESTION:  But you could get that from the


record of conviction. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, and all the State is doing --

 QUESTION:  But under the statute we have here,


you have affirmative steps that have to be taken for the


rest of the person's life if he's a violent offender, to


report four times a year.  I just don't know any analogue


for that. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, there are countless


analogues in the regulatory regime where people have to


file quarterly reports.  If -- and -- and the question is


whether that requirement serves a valid regulatory


purpose.  It can't rise to the level of punishment just


because the legislature has determined that the triggering


event --


QUESTION:  Well, but I suppose that's because


you choose to be in a regulated industry, or you choose to


have this withholding regime. 


And it's -- it's not 

imposed on a class of citizens by reason of their criminal


past. 


MR. ROBERTS:  There are -- there are many


disabilities that are imposed as a result of a prior


conviction that the Court has found don't constitute


punishment. 


QUESTION:  None which require affirmative steps.


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, the affirmative steps --


it -- that has never been the test.  The test has been


whether it rises to the level of punishment.  Yes, the

affirmative step of filling out one side of one page with


the sort of information that you'd -- would put on your


application to join the Price Club requires.  There's


nothing burdensome about that.  It must be in their


argument the use that that information is put to.


QUESTION:  What is our test for whether it rises


to the level of punishment? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, when the --


QUESTION:  Didn't the Ninth Circuit found --


find there was no intent to make it punitive, but looked


to the effects? 


MR. ROBERTS:  That's right. 


QUESTION:  Is it an effects test and how do we


apply it --


MR. ROBERTS: 


Well, it's called the intent 

effects test.  You'd first see what the intent is, and


that is so critical, and nearly controlling because the


same sanction can be punitive or civil depending on the


purpose.  Even confinement can be civil if the purpose is


protective.  So that's why purpose is so controlling.


Now, once you determined that there's a


regulatory purpose, as every court has -- not just every


Federal court -- every court to look at these laws has


determined they have a valid civil regulatory purpose --


then the one challenging that determination carries the

heavy burden of establishing, by the clearest proof, with


unmistakable evidence, that the effect is so punitive that


the purported purpose must, in fact, be a charade.  And --


QUESTION:  But why isn't the evidence that this


is -- is a face plastered on the Internet, that in modern


times that is the equivalent of the town square where


you're shaming the bad actor?  And here, you have a


person's face, and you have only the bad information.  You


don't get the information that this person has


successfully completed a rehabilitation course.  You don't


get the information that this was on the scale of sexual


offenses on the lighter side.  The -- am I wrong about


that? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.  That information is


available. 


The circumstances, the crime for which the 

person is convicted, is available.  So --


QUESTION:  Is it -- that's on the page -- the


page with the photograph says what the crime was? 


MR. ROBERTS:  That's my understanding, Your


Honor, yes, that -- that -- I'm not sure what it is in


every State, but the -- the circumstances of conviction


is -- it's one of the things that has to be registered,


and is available to the public.  So if it -- you can find


out what the conviction was for. 


Now, I don't -- I'm sorry.

 QUESTION:  In addition, on that page, what the


viewer will see -- you don't see on the page with the face


any disclaimer, any statement that the State is not


branding this person as dangerous.  The State is simply


making a statement that there was a conviction in the


past.


MR. ROBERTS:  It conveys simply the truthful,


objective information that this individual was convicted


of this crime, and the public is free to take appropriate


action if they think that's -- that's appropriate under


the circumstances.  It is different from the historic


shaming penalties because of the purpose.  And again,


purpose is the nearly controlling factor.  The purpose of


the shaming penalties was not to inform.  Everybody in the


colonial village knew the circumstances of the offense. 

The purpose was to shame.  Here, the purpose is to inform.


QUESTION:  Mr. Roberts, on that point you said


this is truthful information, and it is.  My question is,


isn't -- it's not the whole truth because the successful


rehabilitation in one case is not known.  It's not known


in the other case that a judge determined this -- this


person had been cured to the extent that he could have the


custody of a -- a minor child.  That information is not


known.  So the -- the public is getting only the bad, and


not the good.  Its judgment is being skewed.  And that's

21

22

23

why it has a punitive flavor. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, it conveys the information


that the legislature thought was pertinent for people to


take action to protect themselves if they think it's


warranted.  Nothing prevents them from finding out more if


they want to -- if they think that's pertinent --


QUESTION:  But nothing would prevent anybody


from going to the court, or the police station and getting


a record of a particular person.  It's made easy for them


by the State -- access is made easy -- but only access to


the bad information. 


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, access to the information


that the legislature thought was pertinent and that people


wanted to learn.  There is no requirement --


QUESTION: 


Mr. Roberts, would it be possible for 

a defendant to include additional information on the form,


and if so, would it appear on the Internet? 


MR. ROBERTS:  There's no provision for that


under Alaska's laws.  I am aware of situations where --


where they have a more active notification, where the


offenders have taken steps to say, well, here's my side of


the story, but there's no provision for that on the


Internet.


QUESTION:  Suppose they had the same statute,


but instead of it -- applying it to people who were

convicted, they applied it to people who had been


arrested, or alternatively, they applied it to people whom


a policeman said he had gotten suspicious information


about that he believed was accurate, no arrest -- now,


suppose it's exactly the same, but they just do -- they


apply it not in that way.  What part of the Constitution,


if any, would that violate? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, it might violate the Due


Process Clause if there's not a rational connection


between --


QUESTION:  Well, it's rational in the sense that


a -- a reasonable person would think that these -- it's a


way of stopping these, you know, criminals.  They're


suspicious.  They're -- they're -- suspicious people


against whom there are suspicions are more likely to 

commit crimes than people who are not suspected.


MR. ROBERTS:  The legislature would have to show


a rational basis for its categorization.  That's the


standard --


QUESTION:  All right.  Your answer is it


violates substantive due process or nothing.


MR. ROBERTS:  Or -- it may or may not, depending


on what it shows. 


QUESTION:  All right.  I've got that.  I --


MR. ROBERTS:  Here the legislature had a solid

basis, a basis that this --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. ROBERTS:  -- Court has recognized, as


recently as last June in the McKune case, for the


conclusion that those convicted have a high rate of


recidivism.


QUESTION:  Well, are you assuming from Justice


Breyer's hypothesis, Mr. Roberts, that the policeman who


has spotted some suspicious -- that these people have


previously been convicted, or that this is just the -- the


beginning of the whole story is that a policeman spots


someone? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Well, I understood the question to


be it's just the beginning of the whole story, and in that


case, I'd question whether --


QUESTION:  Well, there's certainly no ex post


facto problem there, is there? 


MR. ROBERTS:  No, there wouldn't be --


QUESTION:  No, what I was driving at is suppose


that this statute too is -- I -- suppose I were to believe


it was excessive in light of its purpose in respect to


some -- some people, but not to others.  What part of the


Constitution would it violate, if any? 


MR. ROBERTS:  Certainly not the Ex Post Facto


Clause because in Seling against Young, the Court said you

look at the law on its face, not as applied.  Halper had


started looking at laws as applied to determine whether


they're punishment, and in Hudson and in Seling, the Court


said we're not going to do that. 


I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time,


Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Roberts. 


General Olson, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


MR. OLSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


Congress and the legislatures of 50 States have


agreed that citizens should have access to truthful 

information concerning the identity and location of


convicted sex offenders.


QUESTION:  Well, I suppose that the public in


theory has access to it anyway because convictions are a


matter of public record, and presumably any citizen who


wanted to dig deep enough could find out who had been


convicted of what. 


What this scheme involves is getting a big


megaphone, in effect, making it more readily available. 


Is that what we're talking about here?

 MR. OLSON:  I don't agree with the


characterization of this as a megaphone.  What I -- what I


would characterize it instead of saying it is the least


intrusive, most passive way to provide information that is


already available to citizens, and can be obtained by


citizens, but to make it more accessible to them because


the people have decided that they want this information. 


QUESTION:  But it isn't passive because you have


a lifetime obligation to update it. 


MR. OLSON:  Yes, but it's --


QUESTION:  It is not passive.


MR. OLSON:  But it's -- but it's minimally


passive and -- and minimally --


QUESTION:  Now we're up to minimally passive.


MR. OLSON: 


Well, Justice Kennedy, we have to 

register to vote.  We have to register to marry.  We have


to register to get a driver's license.  We have to


disclose our homes when we buy a car, when we get a


divorce, when we fill out a census form.


QUESTION:  And most -- most of those do not


involve -- involve shame or ridicule.  This does.


MR. OLSON:  Well, the -- that is a separate


question.  I'm -- what I'm saying is that the burden of


registration or of keeping information current is a


minimally intrusive burden.

 Now with respect to the question of shame, that


arises, to the extent that it exists at all, from the


conviction of violating a sex offense.  There is due


process in connection with that -- that -- to the extent


that process is due -- and we'll get to that I know in the


subsequent case, but --


QUESTION:  Well, but precisely, but that -- that


shows that there's an added burden here that was added by


the State after the conviction. 


MR. OLSON:  Yes, but that -- that is true of


many regulatory measures.  You can lose your right to


practice in the securities field -- and that's been


held -- because of a conviction or to practice banking or


the right to vote.  There are other consequences.  This


Court has repeatedly said --


QUESTION:  If a banker or securities dealer were


convicted of -- of -- of a crime, could the Government


after the fact -- prospective -- pardon me --


retroactively -- retroactively require that he or she file


their -- their earnings statements for the rest of their


life with some regulatory agency? 


MR. OLSON:  Well, I don't -- I -- I don't -- the


Court has never addressed that question, but the Court has


held that after the fact, it can -- the -- the legislature


can prevent those persons from practicing that profession,

including the practice of medicine, being a fund raiser


for a union, losing the right to vote.  The fact that


this -- what the -- this --


QUESTION:  But, General Olson, there's a -- a


difference in those -- those restrictions that affect one


part of one's life.  I can't practice a particular


profession, but I can go out and get a job.  I -- I'm not


affected in where I live.  My neighbors know that I've


committed a crime, but they don't -- the same reaction --


the notion that I am being labeled not a convicted


offender -- which I am -- but a sex offender, a current


status -- a current status with no opportunity to get out.


MR. OLSON:  Well, the -- well, the fact of


registration and disclosure relates to the conviction of a


sex offense. 


The public in 50 States and the legislature 

and Congress have determined in response to the requests


of the people -- as Mr. Roberts said, the test, according


to this Court's jurisprudence, is the intent.  The intent


here is not to punish.  The intent is to respond to


citizens who have --


QUESTION:  Well, I think it's -- it's easy for a


legislature to say that, and in part, it's right.  But in


part, it seems to me that there are many indicia of


punishment here as well.  That's why you just don't rest


when the legislature says it's regulatory.  You must go

beyond that. 


MR. OLSON:  Yes.  This Court has said that


only -- you would go beyond that only if the evidence was


the clearest proof, unmistakable evidence that the intent


or effect was punitive as opposed to regulatory.  In this


case, there is no affirmative restraint on motion.  There


is no confinement.  There is no restriction on travel or


employment or recreation, no obligation to submit to


searches, intrusive supervision or questioning. 


QUESTION:  Well, there's no formal restriction


on employment, but it -- in many of these cases, these


people have terrible times renting a place to live,


getting a job. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, the empirical evidence is not


great that that is indeed a significant statistical 

problem, but the problem, to the extent that it may exist,


results from the conviction of a -- of an -- of an


offense --


QUESTION:  No.  With -- with --


MR. OLSON:  -- about which an employer may want


to know. 


QUESTION:  With respect, Mr. Olson, I mean, I


think that's what's bothering us.  The -- the offense has


resulted in a conviction and a penalty.  Each is a


one-time event, as it were, or a one-time status and each

is over.  What this is doing is, in effect, imposing a


status of public shame for a period of 10 years, or


whatever it is, or a period of life in -- in the case of


certain offenses.  And that is not merely the consequence


of the conviction for the crime which was defined, is


over, and done with.  This is something new. 


MR. OLSON:  Well, to apply the seven -- to the


extent that the Court would apply the Kennedy Mendoza-


Martinez factors, there is no affirmative disability or


restraint.  Registration or publication has never been


considered historically as punishment.  The -- the --


there is a regulatory purpose.  The -- even the Ninth


Circuit --


QUESTION:  May I ask you a question about that?


I -- I understand that the -- the percentage of sex 

offenses in Alaska with children is extremely high, and


what is -- has been the effect of this scheme if it's been


employed?  Has it had some effect there --


MR. OLSON:  I --


QUESTION:  -- in reducing the number of sex


offenses? 


MR. OLSON:  I do not know the answer to that,


and perhaps Mr. Roberts does. 


But what this is -- and I think this is a proper


way to think of this statute -- in connection with a class

of offenses, where the -- where the rate of recidivism is


significantly higher -- as this Court has held very


recently -- than any other crime, people are asking their


government please allow us to know when we have someone in


our neighborhood.  When we -- when we're hiring a new --


QUESTION:  Could -- could the State require a


special mark on your license plate? 


MR. OLSON:  No, I -- well, I don't know, Justice


Kennedy, but I would say that would be considerably


different than what's here because that would --


QUESTION:  I don't think it's very different. 


MR. OLSON:  Pardon me? 


QUESTION:  I don't think it's very different. 


MR. OLSON:  I -- I respectfully submit that it's


a great deal different. 


That mark on your license plate, 

or mark on your forehead would go wherever you would go. 


It would require you to carry the government's message


rather than the government supplying the message.


QUESTION:  Well, this statute requires you to


make the government's message four times a year. 


MR. OLSON:  It only -- it doesn't require you to


make the government's message four times a year.  The


government's message, I respectfully submit, is made when


a citizen submits an inquiry to the State through the


Internet listing.  All -- it is required four times a year

is to advise the government of a current location or


current information so that the information on the


registry is accurate and -- and up-to-date. 


This is information that citizens have requested


from their government.  Their government has the


information of people who have committed certain types of


crimes, who society has perceived as particularly


dangerous.  It's a self-protective mechanism.  The -- not


only the --


QUESTION:  But they -- the Megan's Laws are not


all one size and shape.  I mean, some of them have the


disclaimer right on the page saying we're not labeling


this person dangerous and -- and have a chance for a


person to get off it.  Here, because there's no give, it


does have a punitive feel.


I mean, as far as the Federal legislation is


concerned, a State that tells the whole truth -- is


that -- that kind of law is totally acceptable within the


Federal requirement, isn't it?


MR. OLSON:  It -- it would seem to -- well, I


think the answer is that yes, it would because the Federal


statute simply prescribes a floor. 


It's going to be virtually impossible and quite


burdensome for the State to supply what you suggest would


be complete information about any individual.  What the

question goes to any of the seven Kennedy Mendoza-Martinez


factors, it's excessiveness is -- on -- on the scale.

record, readily accessible information is -- is minimal.

Mr. Thompson, we'll hear from you. 


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARRYL L. THOMPSON


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. THOMPSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


We believe that the Alaska Sex Offender


Registration Act imposes punishment because it possesses


three features which are classically considered to be


punishment, and not like any other civil or regulatory


measure this Court has seen before.

 First of all, the sanction attaches


automatically and inescapably solely on a basis of a prior


conviction, without any determination of present


dangerousness at all.


Secondly, the sanction is a pervasive regulation


of the person themselves.  There is no attempt to try to


regulate an activity or a profession here.  It's a


regulation of the person himself. 


QUESTION:  Well, to what extent do you -- do you


mean, Mr. Thompson?  You said to regulate the person


himself.  I mean, he is not circumscribed in his


activities, is he? 


MR. THOMPSON:  He has to report four times a


year.


QUESTION:  But not in Alaska --


MR. THOMPSON:  Just like they do on probation.


QUESTION:  In Alaska, not in person, I take it.


MR. THOMPSON:  Well, we respectfully disagree


with Mr. Roberts' characterization of the statute.  The


statute gives unfettered discretion to the Department of


Public Safety -- the police -- to administer it in a way


that it deems appropriate. 


QUESTION:  How -- how has it been administered? 


MR. THOMPSON:  Regulatorily they have done it by


mail.  But I can cite you instances, with affidavits in a

parallel case, of people that were mandated to report to


the police.  They can do it and --


QUESTION:  Well, but that's not part of -


MR. THOMPSON:  -- have the discretion to do it.


QUESTION:  That's not -- that's not part of the


record here, is it? 


MR. THOMPSON:  That is not part of the record


here.  But they have --


QUESTION:  At least -- at least --


MR. THOMPSON:  -- the unfettered discretion by


the pure statutory language. 


QUESTION:  When the -- they have to replace the


photographs periodically. 


MR. THOMPSON:  They do, and -- and they're


required to -- on their quarterly report to report any 

changes in their physical characteristics, they gain


weight, they grow gray hair, they get lasik surgery, don't


have glasses, grow a beard, get fat.  Whatever it is,


they've got to report that information.  And you know


that's going to be a triggering event.  I mean, if they


look different, the police are going to have them come


back in and get a new photograph --


QUESTION:  Well, but I mean, how is that


different?  Everybody -- you're sort of turning this on


whether you have to walk to the police station or not.

I mean, a lot of people have to go in and report different


things, send in forms, give their pictures, even give


their fingerprints. 


I would think that the problem is what happens


to that information later, that everybody in the


neighborhood knows it, that they're likely to shun the


people, that -- that it may be too broad.  I mean, is


that -- is it really the police -- having to walk


somewhere and write something as opposed to sending in a


report that makes all the difference? 


MR. THOMPSON:  No.  I mean, what I -- what I --


the third characteristic is -- is the stigmatizing


characteristic, which I want to -- want to talk about


here.  But it's not just --


QUESTION: 


Well, what about someone who is truly 

a dangerous sex offender, who poses a real risk to


children in that area?  Now, what about that?  Are -- is


this a -- a scheme that is applied to such a person that


poses constitutional problems, do you think, or does


public safety rise to the level where it can be responded


to in this fashion?


MR. THOMPSON:  Well, unlike the -- the Kansas


situation, Kansas v. Hendricks, there's no effort to weed


out those who are dangerous from those who are not.


QUESTION:  Yes.  That's not the question I asked

you.


MR. THOMPSON:  I apologize.


QUESTION:  I asked you whether, as applied to


someone who is exceedingly dangerous, in your view does


the scheme survive? 


MR. THOMPSON:  Well, no.  It's still an evasive


regulation of the individual just like probation and it's


still a stigmatizing system that labels them as dangerous.


QUESTION:  Maybe he deserves stigmatization


if -- with the high recidivist rate under the facts that


Justice O'Connor gave you.  The person is still dangerous.


MR. THOMPSON:  But not all of them are.  And


that's the problem with this statute.  It applies to those


people that are demonstrably not dangerous. 


QUESTION: 


If that's the problem --

QUESTION:  But your --


QUESTION:  -- how -- how -- this is -- what is


your response to Justice -- to the argument that was made


on the other side?  It said simply this, that you're --


you're raising an ex post facto claim.  Now, we don't want


to be nitpicking about this, but an ex post facto claim is


a question of whether this is punishment, and they're


saying it's not seen as punishment.  It wasn't their


intent to punish.  It was their intent to inform so that


the thing won't happen again.  That's not a punitive

intent. 


And therefore, your claims about how bad this is


may be right.  And suppose I accept them.  Suppose I think


they're right.  Should I not, nonetheless, wait until


somebody raises a substantive due process claim?  That way


you can decide if the problem with the statute is overly


broad, if the problem is that some people should have it


applied to them and others shouldn't.  All the things that


you mentioned would come into play.  But as far as


punitive intent is concerned, that's not the


legislature's --


MR. THOMPSON:  Well, we -- I'm sorry.  We


disagree --


QUESTION:  I mean, that's the argument.


MR. THOMPSON:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  And I'd like to -- but tell me what


about the relation of the substantive Due Process


Clause -- about why isn't that the better vehicle to make


your argument?  Now, that's what I'd just like to hear you


discuss. 


MR. THOMPSON:  I mean, it certainly is a


vehicle, you know, to talk about whether or not it's


narrowly tailored to -- to a specific regulatory goal. 


I think that is a proper challenge, and it was challenged


at the lower court level.

 But we're here today on an ex post facto


question before the Court, and the question is, is it


punishment, or is it not?  And we -- we respectfully


disagree that this is intended to be purely a regulatory


measure.  And we disagree because the State's sole


reliance is on the language found in the preamble of the


statute, that it's designed to protect the public.  That's


one of the penal goals under the constitution in the State


of Alaska for criminal justice system. 


QUESTION:  Of course, that's true, but in my


mind rings a case, in which I was in dissent, but the


majority has the law, and that's Hendricks.  If, after


all, it's not punishment to put a person in a cell -- and


I thought it was, but the majority thought it wasn't --


why is it punishment, following the law, to simply require 

the person to make reports four times a year? 


MR. THOMPSON:  Well, it is -- it is -- probation


requires the exact same thing, and that's our point. 


QUESTION:  And it -- it required less than


putting the person in what was, in effect, a jail cell. 


I'm -- I'm looking at the precedent on ex post facto.


MR. THOMPSON:  Certainly.  And -- and -- and you


know, Hendricks and Salerno present the types of cases


that are steeped in the pedigree of this Court looking to


the need to protect the public from those people that are

actively dangerous now, and that's why it was important in


Hendricks that there was, in fact, those protections


afforded to the individual.  I mean, it doesn't happen


automatically that Hendricks was going to be put in jail.


There had to have been a jury trial, or trial by a judge


with a preponderance beyond a reasonable doubt, and he's


allowed an annual review.  He can petition at any time. 


The secretary, at his own discretion, can remove that


restriction.  So the duration of that is solely limited


and -- and looks to the purpose to protect the people from


those -- the public from those people that are dangerous.


None of those protections are here.  In fact,


this is a wide-sweeping statute that takes everybody in.


And -- and we have to look --


QUESTION: 


I -- I guess that one of the problems 

I have with -- with your side of the case is that this is


public information insofar as a conviction is concerned. 


Insofar as addresses, credit card companies, and driver's


license bureaus have this stuff all the time.  It would


seem to me that if the Court were to strike down these


laws, some private business could have a web -- a web


page, just like credit card companies do.  There may be


some Privacy Act concerns, but still, this is truthful


information. 


MR. THOMPSON:  It's not truthful information,

and respectfully, I -- I agree with what Justice Ginsburg


was saying earlier.  I mean, it's -- it's false --


QUESTION:  It's -- it's truth as far as it goes. 


There's nothing false in the information reported. 


I questioned whether it was the whole truth because it has


the bad side, but none of the good. 


MR. THOMPSON:  It's sort of the sin of omission,


particularly when we look -- we look to --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I suppose a lot of


credit --


MR. THOMPSON:  Well, and -- and it goes further


than that.


QUESTION:  -- the credit reports are misleading


too.  Maybe the person is now very successful, and is


paying all their bills.  You don't know. 


MR. THOMPSON:  But the legislatures made it


clear that they are telling the public that these people


weren't just someone who once had a conviction.  They're


telling the public that these people are actively


dangerous now, presently dangerous to be actively avoided.


And how do they do that?  If you know someone is


on the registry -- and the idea being make my own informed


choice.  Now that I know this information, get some more


information.  And if you know they're on the registry and


you get the rest of that information, you know they're

cured, you know they've been great --


QUESTION:  Well, does -- does any entity in a


society, a -- a nursery school have an interest in -- in


knowing the background of their employees? 


MR. THOMPSON:  Readily available, and it has


always been available and it was available before the


statute.


QUESTION:  Well, they have an -- they have an


interest in knowing that.  That isn't -- that isn't


somehow punitive or -- or half the truth.  They make


the -- they make the inference that there's -- that


there's a hazard here, a risk they don't want to take.


MR. THOMPSON:  What I was getting at earlier


was -- is that the State of Alaska makes it a crime,


felony child endangerment, if you leave your kid alone 

with someone who's on the registry.  And it doesn't matter


that that person is safe.  It doesn't matter that that


person is not dangerous.  So the State is telling you that


they are to be avoided. 


QUESTION:  Well, but that -- that issue is


not -- not before the Court, and if that's so, this --


this just shows that it's a regulatory scheme which has


another valid purpose. 


MR. THOMPSON:  We disagree.  What we think that


demonstrates is that it's a clear proclamation because it

came at the same time as the amendments in '97, a clear


proclamation of a legislative intent to tell the public


that everyone on that registry is currently, presently


dangerous. 


QUESTION:  Well, you disagree with -- you


disagree with the court of appeals then when they said it


was not a punitive intent on the part of --


MR. THOMPSON:  Yes, we do disagree with that and


we -- we briefed that in our brief. 


QUESTION:  Well, you would -- you would concede


that it is least ambiguous because the legislature said


our purpose is regulatory.  So you're not going to say


that's -- that's incredible.


MR. THOMPSON:  Well, the legislature never said


it was a civil regulatory measure. 


What the legislators 

said and what their sole reliance on intent is, is in the


preamble where it says it serves to protect the public.


And -- and it's clear that protection of the public in --


in Salerno was -- was viewed as a proper regulatory goal,


but in -- in Brown it's also viewed as a proper criminal


goal.  And in Alaska, it's the goal -- one of the stated


goals under article I, section 12 of the penal


administration -- it is a criminal goal to protect the


public.  So I don't think that -- that's -- that's --


QUESTION:  But it's a civil goal too, I --

 MR. THOMPSON:  It is a civil goal too.


QUESTION:  You rely to some extent on the


placement in the criminal code both that the information


about this registry system has to be part of every


criminal judgment and part of every rule 11 colloquy.


MR. THOMPSON:  That's -- that's true.  The


legislature, you know, in our view considered it such an


important component and consequence of any criminal


conviction, that in fact, that's the only information that


a judge has to give to someone convicted of a sex offense


in writing.


QUESTION:  So I thought it might be fair for you


to say, well, it's -- it's mixed.  It's ambiguous.  In


some respects, it's -- looks regulatory.  In other


respects it looks punitive. 


I thought that's what would 

you say instead of -- so we have to look further.  But are


you saying right from the very reading of this law, it is


necessarily punitive? 


MR. THOMPSON:  We do believe that.  I mean, it


was intended, again, to protect the public, but when you


look to a law that's -- that's geared directly at


individuals or groups of individuals and not set out to


regulate any kind of activities, you know, that is an


intent in our view to -- to punish --


QUESTION:  Would it affect --

 MR. THOMPSON:  -- solely based upon a prior


conviction. 


QUESTION:  Your claim is an ex post facto claim,


a retroactivity claim.  Suppose this scheme, the Alaska


scheme, did allow people -- like the parties here -- to


say, I'm no longer dangerous.  Here's the documentation of


that.  Take me off the list.  Would you say, nonetheless,


it's still punitive?  Are you saying that even if someone


made no showing at all of lack of dangerousness,


this is -- it would be ex post facto and therefore must


fall? 


MR. THOMPSON:  If I -- Justice Ginsburg --


QUESTION:  You -- you are asserting that Doe I


and II are people who are no longer dangerous.


MR. THOMPSON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  But I'm asking you about the people


in this large category who are still dangerous, or at


least have made no showing that they're not dangerous. 


You would have the same ex post facto argument with


respect to those people?  Or does it depend, to some


extent, on the ability to show that you're not dangerous?


MR. THOMPSON:  First of all, I think we would --


we would take the position that in the absence of any


criteria of actual present dangerousness demonstrates


that -- that the legislature is aimed at the prior

conviction and tacking on certain responsibilities to the


prior conviction as opposed to really trying to fit the


goal here of protecting the public from dangerous people. 


QUESTION:  But if the legislature says we don't


want this to be punitive, therefore we will give everyone


who was a convicted sex offender an opportunity to show


that they're no longer dangerous, and then there will be a


determination made, yes, you are, no, you're not, would


you still be making the ex post facto argument for the


people who have not shown they're no longer dangerous?


MR. THOMPSON:  I think it would certainly be a


closer call, and --


QUESTION:  Why would it be a --


MR. THOMPSON:  -- and my clients would certainly


invite that hearing. 


QUESTION:  Why would it be a closer call?  Why


would it be a closer call?  Is everything that is bad


regulation punishment?  I mean, all that would show -- all


you're claiming is that some people who are not dangerous


are -- are wrongly covered by this regulatory measure. 


That still doesn't prove that the regulatory measure is


punitive.  It just shows that it's stupid. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  That doesn't make it violate the Ex


Post Facto Clause.  Every regulatory measure that goes too

far is -- is not criminal punishment. 


MR. THOMPSON:  It is if it looks just like


probation and has the same consequences as probation


because probation is historically --


QUESTION:  That's -- that's -- the question


Justice Ginsburg started with is every time -- you just


replied to Justice Scalia -- and what I hear are words


that seem to apply with equal force to a perfectly-


tailored statute that would catch only the most dangerous


sex offenders who everyone agrees are virtually


uncontrollable and might repeat their offense many, many


times. 


See, if it applies -- if the argument -- the


question people are asking you -- I'm simply repeating


it -- is, on your argument why isn't that just as much an 

ex post facto law?  What has it got to do with the matter


that it's overly broad, et cetera, which sounds to me like


a substantive due process argument, not an ex post facto


argument?  That's the same question.  But I would like you


to focus right on it. 


MR. THOMPSON:  Well, I apparently have not been


doing a very good job of it, but I'll try. 


When we look to whether or not the statute


imposes a punishment, I think it's important that we look


to whether or not it -- it's -- fits with the umbrella of


39

things which have historically considered to be


punishment.  And that's one of our starting points, and


that's why I keep going back to the concept of probation


and parole because historically there's no dispute that


probation is a depravation of liberty.  Not -- it's not


like going to jail, but it's a depravation of liberty. 


And -- and it's been considered as punishment, and that's


what this thing does to people. 


Now, if it was a perfectly-tailored -- such that


it could weed out the dangerous from the non-dangerous --


well, we would invite that because my clients wouldn't be


here today.  My client has been determined, you know, to


be not dangerous by a superior court family judge.


But would it still be punishment?  I think we'd


have to look at the -- a little bit closer at it.  But,


you know, if there's a closer nexus between the public


purpose and there -- there is a weeding out, maybe it


wouldn't be punishment because maybe it's -- it's


escapable, it -- it's --


QUESTION:  But then -- then you might --


MR. THOMPSON:  -- at that point, it's not


regulating him for life. 


QUESTION:  Well, at that point at least there


would be -- I -- I assume your -- your point would be that


there -- there is at least a -- a credible basis to say

that if it covers only those who are affirmatively shown


to be dangerous, the object is simply to apprise the


public to who is dangerous, and that doesn't sound very


punitive.  But if there is no attempt to weed out the


dangerous from the non-dangerous, then the claim that the


object is simply to apprise the public of who is dangerous


is not so credible.  I mean, isn't -- isn't --


MR. THOMPSON:  That is my point. 


QUESTION:  -- that one of your points?


QUESTION:  If that's your point, then how do you


respond to their argument which is that that's just too


tough to do?  We don't know enough about it.  It -- it


would invite endless hearings.  It would be impossible to


administer this statute.  I'm not making the argument. 


I'm repeating it --


MR. THOMPSON:  Right. 


QUESTION:  -- for you to respond to.


MR. THOMPSON:  I guess that would make the --


the due process hearing or the -- the hearing that is


established in -- in Hendricks, and the hearing that's


established in Salerno futile as well.  I mean, judges are


called upon every day to make determinations as to whether


or not people are presently dangerous.  They do it every


day in the context of evaluating the sentencing criteria


in the State of Alaska.  It's called the Chaney Criteria.

They have to look to whether or not someone poses a risk


to the community.  That's what they have to do in --


QUESTION:  How many Megan's Laws have that


regime?  I -- I understand that some of them do.  Some of


them are like Alaska.  They say this is based solely on


your past conviction.  Others say you have an opportunity


to show that you're no longer dangerous.  What -- in -- in


the range of Megan's Laws that all the States have, how


many treat this as something you can get out of by showing


you're not dangerous?


MR. THOMPSON:  You know, I don't have a -- a


number for you.  I can't tell you if it's 23 States or


not.  I don't -- I'm sorry.  I don't --


QUESTION:  What's wrong about --


MR. THOMPSON:  I don't know that. 


QUESTION:  What's wrong about warning the public


about who may be dangerous?  You -- you seem to say that


it's only -- it's only okay if the State warns the public


about who is dangerous.  What's wrong about warning the


public about who may be dangerous?  Let the public make --


you know, the later -- later determination. 


MR. THOMPSON:  I guess we get down to this who


determines who they're -- who may be dangerous or not. 


I mean, what -- what's the criteria for that?


QUESTION:  What is irrational or

unconstitutional about warning the public about a category


of people who may be dangerous as to whom -- as the entire


category of whom, there's more likely to be danger than --


than with respect to other people?  Where is it written


that you can only warn the public about those whom you


have -- are sure are dangerous? 


MR. THOMPSON:  Part of the problem with the


statute, it's not just a warning of the public.  I mean,


it -- it's -- there are really various components.  It's


not just a notification statute.  I mean, you know, the


public right now has access to -- through another statute


that we have -- to offender information.  All they've got


to do is request.  And this is an unnecessary statute


in -- in one sense.  Does it broadcast it on the Internet? 


No. 


But the same information is available, and it's 

information that's available not just going to a


courthouse, but you can actually request the State for


that information.  And -- and for some people, the


information may be limited.  There are some restrictions. 


QUESTION:  I'm -- I'm not sure if it helps you


or hurts you.  It -- it indicates that -- that the most


distressing and damaging fact that you have -- that you


have the conviction is available to the public anyway. 


And this is just a regulatory scheme to -- to make that


information more clear as to how many people are in the

community have suffered that conviction.


MR. THOMPSON:  What I was going to say is that


the information as to serious offenses that are beyond


10 years is limited.  There's some sense of limitation,


some sense of it's been a long time.  So that information


is limited to those people that have a need to know, like


for example, the day care providers and the teachers


and -- and schools who want to know --


QUESTION:  Well, but I take it under the


registration form we're talking about, that the date of


the conviction is there, and the -- the citizen can make


up his or her own mind as to whether the conviction was so


long ago that they're no longer worried about it.


MR. THOMPSON:  They really don't have the right


kind of information to make that decision. 


I mean, what 

they have is only the conviction --


QUESTION:  You want -- you want more information


on this form? 


MR. THOMPSON:  Absolutely not. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. THOMPSON:  The -- you know, I don't.  I


don't want more information. 


And the -- the tribunal that should be making


the determination of dangerousness really ought to be in a


thoughtful, rational process in front of a -- of a judge.

 QUESTION:  What -- what if the State simply


decided we're going to put on the Internet, the same way


that Alaska does here, the names of all the people who had


criminal convictions of any sort without any more


information in -- in the last 5 years?  Now, if they


applied that to people who were convicted after they


passed it, would that be ex post facto?


MR. THOMPSON:  I don't know that it would.  It


would probably have the same stigmatizing effect.  I mean,


I just -- I want to share with you the State has already


done that in the State of Alaska.  You can get information


as to anyone in the State of Alaska by a click of a mouse


by going on the Internet, if their convictions were in the


State of Alaska.  That information is already available. 


QUESTION: 


If it had the same stigmatizing 

effect, why would your answer be different?  Why -- why


would it not be ex post facto in that case, whereas it is


in this?  I'm not sure what line you're drawing. 


MR. THOMPSON:  Well, the stigmatizing effect


here is that these people are being currently labeled


as -- as sex offenders.


QUESTION:  No.  I -- I realize that, but you


said in answer to the Chief Justice's question that there


would be the same -- in your judgment, there would be the


same stigmatizing effect if they put every criminal

conviction on -- on the Internet.  And if -- if the


stigmatizing effect would be the same and the information


would be just as readily available, why would your answer


be different, that that would not be ex post facto whereas


this is?  That would not be punitive.  This is punitive.


MR. THOMPSON:  Well, perhaps it would, but you


know, our analysis of this ex post facto argument is


really a composite of a variety of components of the


statute and not simply the public notification provision. 


QUESTION:  Well, what --


MR. THOMPSON:  It's certainly an important part.


QUESTION:  You're tapping everything, the


register and --


MR. THOMPSON:  Yes.


QUESTION: 


So you would say even just the 

requirement that they register, even if it's just


circulated to law enforcement people, that's impermissibly


retroactive as well. 


So there can be -- is there any scheme for


keeping track of ex-offenders that would pass the ex post


facto test in your judgment, or is it just they've served


their time, they've done whatever, parole is given to


them, and that's it? 


MR. THOMPSON:  You know, if -- if the


requirements of the individual subject to the registration

requirements alone were not as onerous as here where they


have to report on every 90 days all kinds of personal


information, and if they don't, then they're going to


be -- go -- go to jail, it may be a closer call.  I mean,


there was the -- the history of the felony registrations,


but they've never really been approved by this Court as


somehow being a proper regulatory measure.


QUESTION:  On the other hand, I don't know of


any precedent -- perhaps you can tell us if there is --


from this Court saying that a measure with a declared


regulatory purpose is, nonetheless, impermissibly


retroactive.  I don't know of any case that so holds.


MR. THOMPSON:  Nothing is jumping out at me


either. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  Let me ask you to comment on -- on


one thing --


MR. THOMPSON:  But these are unique statutes. 


QUESTION:  I'm sorry.  One -- one thing that


makes it more difficult perhaps than it might be to see


your side of the argument -- go back to the Chief


Justice's question.  What if they put every criminal


conviction on the Internet? 


Well, there's one difference between the


situation that would obtain then and the situation that --

that you're objecting to here.  That is, that there is not


the same high recidivism rate for crimes generally that


there is, apparently undisputedly, for sex crimes in the


State of Alaska.  And therefore, when you earlier made the


argument that there is something very -- something less


than credible in the State's claim that it's merely trying


to inform the public when, in fact, it makes no


differentiation between current dangerousness and un­


current dangerousness, the answer is there is -- or an


answer is -- there is a very high recidivism rate, and


that high recidivism rate does support the claim that


there is something that -- that it is credible to say that


by publishing this information, we are simply trying to


inform people of a probability of dangerousness, leaving


them to do what they want. 


What is -- is there any -- do you have any


response to this claim that the high recidivism rate


itself supports the argument that, in fact, this is


nothing but a safety information kind of measure, whereas


broadcasting all criminal convictions would not be


justified as having a good fit between the object and what


the State was doing?  Do you have any response to that?


MR. THOMPSON:  I certainly don't profess to be


an expert on the statistical recidivist rates.  I think


that is --

 QUESTION:  You don't dispute the State's


recidivism figure, do you? 


MR. THOMPSON:  Well, actually vis-a-vis the


brief that was submitted by Massachusetts as an amici in


this, sets forth a very different pattern of recidivist


rates.  I mean, when we say recidivist rates, are we


talking about repeat sex offenses?  Are we talking about


repeated crimes?  I mean, there are all different ways in


which --


QUESTION:  They're making specific -- they're


making specific claims.  They -- they set out specific


percentages with respect to Alaska.  Are you disputing


those figures or not?


MR. THOMPSON:  We do. 


QUESTION:  You do.  All right.


MR. THOMPSON:  We do, but I don't think we did


it directly in our brief, but I think other -- other


briefs --


QUESTION:  That's -- that's the trouble.  Yes.


MR. THOMPSON:  -- do. 


You know, even if we accept --


QUESTION:  Do you take into account that the


degree of harm, if you make a mistake?  That is, suppose


somebody is a pickpocket and you have a list and say,


pickpockets have to register, the same thing as here.  So

if you make a mistake about a pickpocket, somebody is out


of some change.  If you make a mistake here about a


person's dangerousness, the consequences could be very


grave.


MR. THOMPSON:  And there's a solution to that,


and the solution is have -- is to look to the


individualized determination of the person's present


dangerousness.  And, you know, in the McKune case, the --


QUESTION:  Would it be all right to have the


person report every 90 days to have a determination of


present dangerousness? 


MR. THOMPSON:  It certainly wouldn't be


necessary for John Doe I.  He's already had a


determination that he's not dangerous by a court.  I don't


know why you'd have to continue to redo that.  I mean, the


idea is you get progressively --


QUESTION:  I'm interested in the Chief Justice's


hypothetical. 


MR. THOMPSON:  No, it wouldn't be all right.


QUESTION:  It wouldn't be all right?


MR. THOMPSON:  No, not every 90 days.  That's --


that's awfully burdensome to require someone not just to


come into the police station or fill out a written form,


but to require someone -- as a direct consequence of a


prior conviction, to require someone to come and -- and be

subject every 90 days to a judicial scrutiny as to whether


or not you're still dangerous, that seems to be a pretty


big disability. 


QUESTION:  It is a way out.


MR. THOMPSON:  It is a way out.


QUESTION:  And one of your complaints is this


system provides no way out. 


MR. THOMPSON:  That's absolutely correct.  It is


a way out.


The Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act really


is nothing other than tacking on -- for my clients -- a


lifetime of probation, a lifetime of community


supervision, having to report to the police -- my time is


up. 


QUESTION: 


Thank you, Mr. Thompson. 

Mr. Roberts, you have 4 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


I think it is very important to place the


various points that have been touched on this morning in


the proper legal framework. 


The question, Justice Kennedy, is not whether


it's burdensome to require someone to fill out a form and


verify it.  The question is, is that so punitive that you

don't believe the legislature when it says that we're


doing this to prevent future harm? 


The question, Justice Ginsburg, is not whether


it might be a better system if it included other


information, or whether that would be too burdensome for


the State.  The question is, does the failure to put on


ameliorative information convince you that the legislature


was simply not telling the truth when it said we're doing


this to prevent future harm? 


And the question is not whether you should have


an individualized determination or a group determination. 


It is, is the group determination so irrational that you


think the legislature was not really interested in


preventing future harm, it was just doing this to punish? 


In fact, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, this Court has 

never found a law with a civil regulatory purpose to


violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. 


QUESTION:  Is the effects test used to impeach


the finding that the legislature had a regulatory intent? 


MR. ROBERTS:  I think that is --


QUESTION:  I -- I thought that it was an


additional step that you had to take if you -- even if you


find the legislature had the -- the permitted intent.


MR. ROBERTS:  I think it only makes sense if you


view it as impeaching the intent because, as Chief Justice

Warren pointed out in Trop v. Dulles, the evident purpose


is controlling because the same sanction can be civil or


criminal.  $10,000 civil penalty is not criminal. 


A $10,000 fine is.  You don't look at the perspective of


the individual because --


QUESTION:  So long as the legislature has a pure


intent, it can have as burdensome a regulation as it wants


based on previous criminal convictions?


MR. ROBERTS:  I think if the regulation is so


burdensome that it causes you to doubt the intent, then


you do have a problem, but that is the purpose. 


QUESTION:  You're not saying -- you're saying if


it's -- it wouldn't violate the Ex Post Facto Clause in


your view.  It might violate some other clause like the


substantive due process. 


MR. ROBERTS:  But again, with respect to both


the Ex Post Facto Clause and the Due Process Clause, the


question is whether there's a rational connection between


the sanction and the legislative purpose. 


Now, if it is too extreme, it may cause you to


doubt that connection.  For example, it may be -- the


legislature may say we think safe crackers present a risk


of recidivism, so we're going to cut off their hands. 


There may be a rational connection there, but it's too


excessive given the purpose. 


53 

 There's no way in which this law can be regarded


as too excessive.  It simply makes available information


that is already a matter of public record, and publicly


available because criminal trials under our system have to


be public.


Thank you, Your Honor. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you,


Mr. Roberts. 


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
