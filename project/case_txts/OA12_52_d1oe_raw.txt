CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will have 

Page 3

argument next in Case 12-52, Dan's City Used 
Cars v. Pelkey. 

Mr. Bouffard? 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDRE D. BOUFFARD 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. BOUFFARD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The issue in this case is whether Section 

14501 of the United States Transportation Code expressly 
preempts the Respondent's State law consumer protection 
in tort claims for damages against a tow trucker who 
towed his vehicle lawfully and then, several months 
later, disposed of the vehicle after the fees for towing 
and storage had not been paid. 

Both of these claims are preempted because 
they are directed at the conduct -- the type of conduct 
that tow truck companies all over this country every day 
engage in, in dealing with a particular type of tow 
that's referred to in the business as nonconsensual 
tows. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Bouffard, this law, 

this New Hampshire law, it regulates storage.  Is this a

law that applies only to the towing companies who tow 
the automobile and then store it, or does the law apply, 
say, to a garage, say, someone brings a car to a garage 
for repairs, and does this storage law regulate garage 
operations as well as towing operations? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  Justice Ginsburg, this law 
regulates abandoned motor vehicles.  It's an abandoned 
motor vehicle law. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So -- so it would apply 

to a garage operator. 

MR. BOUFFARD:  Well, if a garage operator 

came into possession of an abandoned motor vehicle, then 
I suppose it would.  If -- if you look at the -- at the 
title to this subchapter of this New Hampshire statute, 
the title is abandoned vehicles, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but what made it 

abandoned was that they tried to locate the owner, 
couldn't and so -- this same thing could happen with a 
garage owner as happened to the towing truck.  So 
there's nothing peculiar about being in the towing 
business that makes this storage application -- storage 
statute apply. 

MR. BOUFFARD:  Well, let me be clear about 

this statute, Your Honor.  It's an abandoned vehicle 
statute, and what's really important to understand with

this case is that none of the Plaintiff's claims rely on 
this abandoned vehicle statute. 

The Plaintiff has pled in his complaint a 
couple of allegations of violations of this abandoned 
vehicle law, but the substantive rights that were sued 
upon by the Plaintiff in this case do not live in the 
abandoned motor vehicle law. 

The substantive rights that were sued upon 

by the Plaintiff live in the State's consumer protection 
law, which is a separate New Hampshire statute, 
unrelated to the abandoned vehicle law.  And secondly, 
the claim that the -- the common law negligence claim in 
this case arises out of the common law of New Hampshire. 
It doesn't arise out of the abandoned motor vehicle law. 

One of the sources of confusion, I would 

submit, in the New Hampshire Supreme Court's decision is 
that it did not adequately deal with the -- the role of 
the abandoned vehicle law in this case.  The abandoned 
vehicle law actually plays a relatively minor role as it 
relates to the causes of action that were pled in this 
case and the causes of action that the preemption 
defense is directed to in this case. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What's -- what's your 

point?  If it's not part of the towing law, then it's 
further removed.

 MR. BOUFFARD:  The reason -- the reason why 
these claims are preempted, Your Honor, is because they 
all stem from the towing of the vehicle, which was 
followed by the storage of the vehicle. 

Page 6

JUSTICE BREYER:  I guess, I mean, I guess 
you could have thousands of claims across the country, 
millions of claims where there are all kinds of towing 
laws.  And -- you know, it says in Cambridge, Massachusetts 
park your car here during a snow emergency, it will be 
towed.  Probably every northeastern country has laws 
like that.  I guess there could be millions of 
negligence claims when the thing is towed, the guy broke 
a headlight. 

MR. BOUFFARD:  Well, I think that's a 

different --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And are all those things 

preempted?  I would be amazed. 

MR. BOUFFARD:  I don't think so, Your Honor. 

We're not --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Then what's the difference 
between this and -- and what could arise any day of the 
week?  I mean, as I read your brief, I -- are you saying 
that all the northeast statutes that say your car will 
be towed if you park here during a snow emergency, what 
happens?  I mean, do they have to go to the Department

of Transportation?  Boston couldn't function.  I know 
that they do tow cars.  I don't know that firsthand, but 
I've seen it. 

Page 7 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER:  So how's it supposed to 

work? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  There's no -- there's no 

claim in this case, Your Honor, that the abandoned motor 
vehicle law is preempted, that New Hampshire's abandoned 
motor vehicle law --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, all right, there 

isn't in this case, but I'm curious to know how it works 
because it seemed to me from what you're arguing, all 
the abandoned motor vehicle laws and all the snow 
emergency towing and everything else that I see every 
day would be preempted a fortiori.  So you tell me how 
it all works. 

MR. BOUFFARD:  We are arguing that the 

causes of action that were pled in this case, which are 
a Consumer Protection Act claim for damages and 
attorneys' fees -- treble damages actually in the 
Consumer Protection Act claim.  That claim is predicated 
on the consumer protection law.  It's predicated on the 
State of New Hampshire's policy protecting consumers. 

Now, there's -- there's an allegation in the

complaint that there was also -- there happened to be a 
violation of this abandoned vehicle law.  But that is a 
completely meaningless allegation as it relates to the 
Consumer Protection Act because even if it were a 
violation of the abandoned vehicle law, that would not 
make it a violation of the consumer protection law. 
Consumer protection laws are intended to regulate 
fairness in business practices.  That's what that 
statute is about. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  My question is -- is the 

same as Justice Breyer's.  It seems to me you are 
running in the wrong direction.  To the extent you say 
the case doesn't involve New Hampshire's towing law but 
involves just its general consumer protection law, 
it's -- it's even further distant from being preempted. 
I --

MR. BOUFFARD:  Well, there's a difference, 
Your Honor, Justice Scalia, between whether the case is 
predicated on the New Hampshire towing law and whether 
or not these causes of action are related to the towing 
of the vehicle.  Our point, and our primary argument, is 
that all of these claims are related to, within the 
meaning of this statute, to the towing of the vehicle. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Suppose -- I understand. 

My goodness.  Suppose a vehicle -- I pay for somebody to

tow -- I agree that somebody will tow my vehicle and I 
will pay him $100.  And he tows the vehicle, puts it in 
my garage and says, give me the $100.  And I say, ha, 
ha, I'm not going to give you $100. 

Page 9 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, you think that that 
general obligation under State law to pay a debt that 
you've contracted to pay is eliminated? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  That's a very different set 

of circumstances, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is that different from 
normal consumer protection law?  I -- I don't see that 
it's so much different. 

MR. BOUFFARD:  Well, this -- this case 
involves a nonconsensual tow.  This case involves a 
situation where there was an opportunity, a fair 
opportunity, to pay for the towing and the storage 
charges that had been incurred, and --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What difference does that 

make?  Suppose there was a towing company that lawfully 
towed cars, but its practice was to hold the car for 
24 hours and if it wasn't picked up they would 
immediately sell it for parts. 

Your argument would be that's preempted by 

the Federal statute?

 MR. BOUFFARD:  No, we wouldn't --
JUSTICE ALITO:  The State can't regulate

that? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  I -- I think the State could 

regulate that, Your Honor.  What the State -- what 
the -- what a private plaintiff can't do in a case like 
this is assert claims like common law negligence 
claims --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Right.  A private 

plaintiff could not assert a common law negligence claim 
if that were done? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  A --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Lawfully towed, sold for 

parts within 24 hours because it wasn't picked up. 

MR. BOUFFARD:  I think -- I think a private 

plaintiff could -- could probably assert that, that 
negligence claim. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if that's -- if that 

is not related to payment for services, then why is this 
-- why is there such a relationship here? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  That situation doesn't 

involve a payment dispute, Your Honor.  This case -- the 
case we have before us today, involves a payment 
dispute.  This is really a payment dispute.  A person --

dispute to the same extent as this.  Towed, notice sent 
out immediately, wasn't picked up within 24 hours, sell 
it for parts. 

Page 11 

MR. BOUFFARD:  Well, that -- that's not a 

payment dispute.  The parties haven't -- haven't 
disputed whether or not there -- there is a payment 
obligation.  The part -- this -- this case is about a 
dispute over whether there is even an obligation to pay 
for the -- the towing and the storage services.  That's 
what this case is about.  This -- this plaintiff had an 
opportunity to pay for and to discharge his obligation 
under State law.  I -- I feel the need to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When?  When did that 

opportunity come up?  Because I thought that the notice 
didn't get to the -- to the plaintiff, and then when the 
lawyer said, I have a client, it's his car, then the 
towing company went ahead and put it up for auction. 
And then no bidders, so they sold it, pocketed the 
money, gave nothing to the car owner.  So I don't 
understand how it's a dispute about payment.  This is 
not a case where the car owner said I won't pay for the 
towing. 

MR. BOUFFARD:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, we 

don't agree with that.  It is -- it is exactly that kind 
of case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  At what point did Pelkey 

say, I won't pay for the towing? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  There -- there's a letter in 

the record of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, Your 
Honor, it's -- I believe it's at page 86 and 87 of the 
record in the New Hampshire Supreme Court, which is a 
letter from Mr. Shaughnessy, counsel for Mr. Pelkey, to 
my client.  And this letter was written something in the 
range of 3 months after the towing took place, and --
and before the vehicle had been disposed of. 

And the letter asserts that Mr. Pelkey 

doesn't believe he should have to pay for any storage 
fees.  He would -- he would pay the towing fees, but he 
doesn't believe he should have to pay for any of the 
storage fees.  And that's -- that's -- that's really 
reflective of what this case is really all about.  It's 
about a dispute over payment. 

And the reason why this case is so 

significant --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Not payment over towing, 

payment over storage. 

MR. BOUFFARD:  He -- he offered in this 

letter to pay the towing fees only.  There was never any 
tender of payment.  There was an offer to pay, provided 
that -- provided that my client would tow the vehicle

back to his place of residence because the vehicle 
wasn't operative at the time. 

Page 13 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If this was a consensual 

contract, he asked -- Justice Scalia's question.  They 
contracted for the tow.  What State laws would be 
preempted under the FAAAA with respect to that private 
contract?  Would there be any? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  The – the -- any breach of 

contract claim that might arise on behalf of the plaintiff 
would not be preempted.  That's what the Court decided in 
the Wolens decision. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about, do consumer 
fraud laws apply to that contract between the parties? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  The consumer fraud law 

might --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the basis of his 

claim here. 

MR. BOUFFARD:  It might apply as a matter of 

State law, but it would be preempted. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Ah, so you're arguing 

that those laws would be preempted. 

MR. BOUFFARD:  It would be preempted to the 
extent that it's a -- the case involves a dispute over 
payment for the services.  This is a -- this case is

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That gets back to 

Page 14

whether the services include storage, which is what the 
New Hampshire court said it doesn't. 

MR. BOUFFARD:  The New Hampshire --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That the movement of 

property or towing doesn't include services for storage. 
MR. BOUFFARD:  That's what the New Hampshire 
Supreme Court said, relying on the minority view that's 
come out of the Ninth Circuit in the Charas decision. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why don't you answer 

that question?  As I read the list of things that are 
preempted, they have to do with storage during 
transportation.  Why should we read it more broadly than 
that? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  I think -- Justice Sotomayor, 

I think you are referring to the argument that's been 
made by my friends with regard to the final phrase in 
the statute with respect to transportation --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly. 
MR. BOUFFARD:  And the short answer to that 
question is that the term "transportation" is a defined 
term in Title 49, and it's defined very broadly for --
for good reason because that term is used throughout 
Title 49.  In fact, the term is used to define the scope 
of jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation, and

the definition of transportation is quite broad, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It -- it includes storage, 

Page 15 

is the point you are coming to, right? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  That's correct. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The definition includes 

storage.  You think it means -- it means storage at the 
end of the transportation?  Suppose you're -- you're a 
company that moves goods, but we also store goods.  You 
can -- you know, rent -- rent space and we will store 
your furniture for years.  If that company picks up some 
goods, brings it to its warehouse and leaves it in its 
warehouse for 3 years, that storage is covered by 
this -- by this statute, you think? 

See, I thought the storage was -- was 

storage in the course of the transportation.  Sometimes 
when you're -- you know, changing the mode of 
transportation, going from trucks to ships or something, 
you have to store it temporarily during -- during the 
course of the transportation.  That's how I would read 
it.  But you're saying, even if you're a storage 
company, if you pick up goods and bring it to the place 
where you store it, that's covered by -- by this 
statute. 

MR. BOUFFARD:  No, that's not what I'm 

saying, Your Honor.  I'm saying that if you tow a motor

vehicle, you bring the motor vehicle into your 
possession via towing and, as is the case here, you also 
store the vehicle.  And in particular in a case like 
this, where the claimant was seeking to have the vehicle 
returned to his place of business -- to his place of 
residence, those are the facts of this case. 

This wasn't necessarily the end of the 

transportation.  The plaintiff here, the Respondent, was 
asking for further transportation services at the end of 
the day.  So on the facts of this case, the 
transportation hadn't ended.  But even if -- we do have 
a situation where there would have been no further 
transportation. 

The -- the reading that my friends have 

advocated inserts the word "incidental" to -- to 
transportation in the statute that doesn't appear in the 
statute. 

The definition of "transportation" doesn't 
include the word -- doesn't say "storage incidental to 
the movement of property." 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Let's say you park 
your tow trucks on somebody else's parking lot, and you 
don't pay the rent.  So they sell your tow truck.  Is 
your claim against your landlord preempted? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  I don't think so, Your Honor,

because I don't think that that scenario would fall 
within what Congress intended by the term "services" 
there.  That -- that claim -- that claim that -- that 
you've described, Mr. Chief Justice, is a claim that 
would really be a -- a breach of contract claim between 
the tow truck owners and his landlord.  That would be 
a -- a contract dispute.  It wouldn't -- wouldn't relate 
to the transportation services of the -- of the tow 
truck company in a way that is picked up by this 
preemption statute. 

It relates to it in a very tangential way, 

in a very remote way, I suppose, but not -- not in a way 
that's close enough -- not in a way that -- that relates 
to the business of a tow truck company in the way that 
payment disputes over -- over the services relate to the 
business of the tow truck company. 

There are any number of different types of 
disputes that motor carriers, like tow truck companies, 
could get involved in that wouldn't be preempted here. 
Motor carriers are involved in lots of different types 
of business activity that doesn't involve the delivery 
of their services.  They could be involved in a real 
estate transaction, for example. 

They may be buying a new -- a new depot, and 

there may be claims that arise out of disputes in

connection with that real estate transaction.  Those 
claims aren't preempted by this statute, even though in 
a very remote sense, they -- those -- those disputes 
might be related to the business of -- of the motor 
carrier.  It's very remote, unlike a situation where the 
claim arises out of the actual delivery of the 
transportation services. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How does -- so if 
your tow truck is involved in an accident, is that --
and a suit is filed for negligence.  Is that preempted? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  I don't think that's 

preempted, Your Honor.  I -- I -- and the reason I say 
that is because there's a whole line of Court of 
Appeals' decisions in the airline area that deal with 
negligence claims arising out of the negligent operation 
of the aircraft.  And your scenario is the negligent 
operation of a tow truck as opposed to an aircraft. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm just looking at 
the statutory language.  It says -- you know, "related 
to a service of a motor carrier with respect to the 
transportation of property," and you know, your motor --
your truck is involved in transporting property.  That's 
the claim against you, that you don't -- you don't 
render good service because you're negligent in a -- and 
it just seems to me to fit within the terms of the

statute, if you adopt as broad a reading as you adopt. 

Page 19 

MR. BOUFFARD:  Well, literally, I think 
you're -- you're right, Your Honor, that -- that the 
scenario you describe could fall within the literal 
language of the statute, but the Court has said that we 
can't go -- we can't necessarily go to the literal end 
of the earth in the reading of the statute, and we have 
to -- we have to limit this in some fashion.  And the 
limitation that the Court has fashioned --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, let me tell you how 

we -- it seems to me we've limited it in -- in the 
Columbus case, Columbus v. Harrah's Garage and Wrecker 
Services, Inc.  We said that, "The clause -- the 
clause's limitation to motor carrier services with 
respect to the transportation of property massively 
limits the scope of preemption to include only laws, 
regulations, and other provisions that single out for 
special treatment motor carriers of property." 

And here you've told us that this case 

doesn't involve any law that singles them out for -- for 
special treatment.  To the contrary, it's the general 
consumer protection law. 

MR. BOUFFARD:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you want us to eat those 
words, they were wrong, or -- or somehow you don't come

within them? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  Respectfully, Justice Scalia, 
I think those words came from your dissent in that case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ah. 
(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I forgot that. 
(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you say they were wrong, 

you say? 

(Laughter.) 
MR. BOUFFARD:  No, no.  No, I don't say that 
they were wrong, Justice Scalia.  What I -- what I would 
though -- do though is I would point the Court to the 
language of the statute, and not only the -- not only 
the specific statute involved here, the motor carrier 
statute, but there's a -- there's a twin statute that 
applies to air carriers.  And it also applies to hybrid 
air and -- and motor carriers. 

And I apologize, I haven't sent up a text of 

this statute in our appendix or anything, but it's --
it's Section 41713 of Title 49, and -- and it includes 
very similar, general -- broad, general, preemptive 
language.  And it does not -- neither of those -- those 
provisions in 41713 contains limiting language that --
that -- that would limit the scope of preemption in any

way. 

The -- the -- and we know from the -- the 
legislative intent with regard to the statute involved 
in this case directly that Congress intended that the 
scope of preemption for all of these different kinds of 
industries would be coextensive.  That's what Congress 
was trying to achieve with this statute, was to give 
motor carriers the same breadth of protection through 
preemption that air carriers enjoy and that hybrid air 
and motor carriers enjoy. 

And so if there are no -- if there are no 

limitations with regard to air carriers and -- and 
hybrid air motor carriers of -- of the type that are 
suggested by my friends for motor carriers, then -- then 
that language at the end of 14501 can't be interpreted 
in a -- in a strictly limiting fashion. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, there's a lot of 

language in the majority pretty much along the line that 
Justice Scalia said.  And not sure if that’s your point. 
I mean, Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority, and she said 
the reference to regulatory authority of a State, which 
is a different reference, I agree, should be read to 
preserve, not preempt traditional prerogative for the 
State. 

And Justice White said previously that you

have to start with the idea that this is -- historic 
police powers of the State are not going to be 
superseded by the Act, unless it's a clear manifest 
purpose of Congress. 

Page 22 

So I guess the problem is, with a lot of the 
other things, that you yourself are in an area that is a 
traditional matter of State regulation.  It is, in fact, 
regulated in a way that applies to everybody.  It is 
indirectly related to the transport itself, and that it 
takes place on -- about storage that took place after 
the event.  So you have all that working against you. 

Now, the Columbus case does offer some hope 

for the other side, I would think.  But what do you 
think? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  Well, Justice Breyer, let me 
just say, first of all, that -- that consumer protection 
is -- is -- I'm not sure I would concede that consumer 
protection is -- is an area of traditional State 
regulation.  In fact, the New Hampshire consumer 
protection law dates to 1970, and the Federal government 
has largely occupied the field of motor carrier 
transportation since 1935 with the enactment of the 
Motor Vehicle Act in that year.  So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's your problem, 

which is, what is it directed to?  And that's the real

issue in this case.  Yes, it's preempted with respect to 
any towing activity.  The issue is, is it -- is it 
preempted, as the New Hampshire court, said to storage 
and sale? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  That is what the 

New Hampshire Supreme Court said, Justice Sotomayor.  I 
would submit that -- that that's an artificial 
distinction that fails to take into account the broad 
definition of "transportation" in Federal law. 

If the Court has --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why should the tow 

operation be treated any different from the garage when 
they're doing the identical thing, that is, storing and 
then selling the vehicle? 

MR. BOUFFARD:  Well, if a -- if a person has 

brought their vehicle into a garage, Justice Ginsburg, 
there's been no transportation by a motor carrier.  The 
difference is that in this case this whole scenario 
started out with a transportation by a -- by a motor 
carrier which also, once it had possession of the 
vehicle, stored it. 

And so in a garage scenario, I suppose if a 

tower towed the vehicle to a garage and then left it, 
left it at a garage to be worked on, that -- that garage 
owner wouldn't be in a position to say that I can assert

Mr. Shaughnessy? 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN C. SHAUGHNESSY 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
Transferring title and disposing of 

Mr. Pelkey's car against his will and not compensating 
him for the loss of his personal property is not a 
service of a motor carrier with respect to 
transportation of property.  The regulation of 
State-created property interests is a field of 
traditional State regulation, and the broad sweep 
advocated by Dan's City Used Auto in this case would 
create a regulatory vacuum because there are no Federal 
laws that allow the sale of a motor vehicle. 

Now, let me address some of the things that 

my brother has argued that this case is about that we 
disagree about.  My brother has argued that this case is

about payment.  This case is not about payment.  Mr. 
Pelkey is not challenging that Dan's City Used Car had 
the ability to tow the vehicle.  We are not challenging 
how it was towed.  We are not challenging the price of 
the tow.  None of that is being challenged, and those 
are all the services of a motor carrier. 

Let me also --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about the price of the 

storage?  Are you challenging that? 

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  We are not challenging the 
price of the storage.  There was a reference to a letter 
that I had sent to the Dan's City people several 
months -- but there were two letters.  The first letter 
was actually quite close to, within several weeks of the 
auction, where we said, no, we are looking to pay for 
it. 

The other letter was, I think in June, was 

saying, you need to account for these proceeds.  You 
sold the vehicle at auction and there is equity in this 
property, you need to account for these proceeds. 

So we didn't challenge the storage, but that 

brings up the issue raised by Justice Sotomayor with 
respect to the storage.  And I would disagree with the 
characterization of my brother with respect to what RSA 
262 is.  RSA 262 talks about removed vehicles.  It

actually provides the authority to law enforcement to 
remove a vehicle that might be in a public way, but it 
also gives the authority to a private landowner to have 
a car removed that's on their private property.  It does 
not relate to the motor carrier services of a tow truck 
operator. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it seems to me 

that you can't ignore the fact that part of what tow 
trucks do is store things.  I mean, it's a necessary and 
integral part of the motor service, the transportation 
of property, that they do.  And regulation of the 
storage will affect the services that they provide. 
MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  Well, we would say --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's not just 
like -- it's not just like storing anything else. 
MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  Well, respectfully, 
Mr. Chief Justice, we would say that storage is a 
separate service altogether.  And the act of 
transportation -- and this is another place where I 
would disagree with the characterization by my brother 
with respect to the definition of "transportation."  I 
believe the definition of "transportation" specifically 
refers to a "motor carrier," meaning a person providing 
motor vehicle transportation for compensation, but also 
relates to the movement of the passengers and the

property, and the services related to that movement. 

Page 27 

So the very definition that applies to this 

case and to the transportation services relate to the 
movement of the property. 

Here the movement has stopped.  And the 

storage that we are dealing with in this case is 
precisely the storage that is in RSA 262, which is the 
storage charges, not for the movement of the property. 
So I would clarify, Mr. Chief Justice, that it is our 
position that the transportation, with respect to the 
transportation of property which Justice Scalia has 
aptly pointed out, severely limits the scope of this 
preemption statute. 

The services of the motor carrier terminated 

once the hook was off the tow truck.  That is when it 
stopped. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Suppose, Mr. Shaughnessy, 

that the New Hampshire laws were more onerous than they 
are.  Suppose they said to a towing company, once you've 
towed this car you have to hold on to it forever.  Or 
suppose they said to the towing company, you have to 
hire private investigators to go figure out who owns 
this car.  Would any of those be preempted? 

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  Yes.  I believe it's 

pointed out in the Rowe decision, in order for it to be

related to the motor carrier service you have to either 
directly regulate that service or it has an indirect 
connection with the service that significantly affects 
the service. 

Page 28 

In your example, it would be a direct 

regulation.  You're actually requiring a motor carrier 
to actually provide a service that the marketplace 
itself wouldn't provide or that the motor carrier would 
not otherwise provide.  So that is a direct regulation 
or an example of directly regulating that would be 
preempted under this statute.  But what we are dealing 
with here, is the storage afterward, is not that motor 
carrier service.  And I do believe the –- the language 
at the end with respect to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do we draw the line, 
that line that you just asked us to draw between direct 
and indirect?  How do we articulate that line? 

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  The direct --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because now you're --

now you're articulating a different line.  You are 
saying this -- the hypothetical that Justice Kagan 
posited is not storage-related, it is something 
else-related.  It's towing-related.  What's the 
difference? 

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  Correct.  The way I -- the

Page 29 

way I interpreted the hypothetical is the State is then 
saying in order as a precondition to or as part of the 
motor carrier service of transporting or towing that 
vehicle, you also must provide this other service over 
here, which is actually one of the problems with the 
Rowe case and under the Maine State statute.  Under 
Maine State law what they were requiring the motor 
carrier to do in Rowe was actually to provide the 
verification service.  And so that was a direct 
regulation I believe that this Court found under Rowe. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You've just told us 

anything that significantly affects the transportation 
service is covered.  And I think what your brother's 
argument is, is that this significantly affects the 
service, whether he can collect for the storage 
after -- you know, after the -- after towing it by -- by 
selling it, and by selling it on terms that are not so 
onerous as to impinge upon his -- his ability to run the 
business. 

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  Well, it may impinge upon 
his ability or impinge upon how much he can collect.  It 
may impinge upon those things, Your Honor.  But it 
doesn't affect the service of the motor carrier with 
respect to the transportation of the property because 
that's the movement of the property.

Page 30
 Certainly getting paid is an important part 

of the service that anybody provides, but that is 
getting too attenuated, that's getting too far out. 
That's getting towards --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it isn't 
too -- I mean, this is a provision of course in the 
Federal Aviation Administration Act.  Whatever rule we 
adopt is going to apply to air transportation as well. 

And is your position, for example, that 

things related to a hangar at an airport, that those are 
not covered by this at all?  It seems to me that there 
the connection between the transportation and the 
storage, the storage of the airplane, you can see a 
little bit more clearly how that would affect what the 
airplane -- you know, can do.  A lien -- you can't take 
the airplane out of the hangar because you didn't pay 
the rent or whatever. 

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  There is an effect there, 

and I do believe that this Court started drawing that 
line actually in the Travelers case.  And when the 
Travelers case looked at this "related to," that's 
what's causing the problem, "related to" and what does 
"related to" mean?  And as has been pointed out, if you 
actually use "related to" to its extreme, everything is 
related to everything else.  That has been said several

times in the case law. 

Page 31 

But "related to" in Travelers, I believe in 
that case the Court looked at -- there was attention to 
that type of broad sweep of "related to" and the 
presumption against preemption, which says we're not 
going to preempt, but "related to" seems we are 
preempting everything.  So there was a tension. 

So in Travelers we went to, well, we have to 
take a look at what the manifest intent of Congress was 
for the regulatory scheme.  You have to look at the 
intent of Congress, and certainly the best place to look 
for that intent is first in the words that are used. 
But once we are looking at the intent, we 

have to say does the actual thing that is being 
regulated by the State, and they are putting in their 
own policies by direct regulation by a positive 
enactment, does it affect or significantly affect the 
deregulatory purposes.  And I believe that's the line 
that was adopted in Rowe. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, don't lose 
that.  I will ask you this question to, which favors you 
in a sense but I want the answer really from the 
Solicitor General who may know.  But I'm going to ask it 
to you too because you've probably both thought about 
it.  He may have -- they may have some experience on it.

 If you start talking about significant 

Page 32

effect, without those last words, "deregulatory purpose" 
I suddenly worry about the following, that every city in 
the United States depends upon towing to regulate 
parking within the city.  We couldn't function without 
it, although none of us like it.  We know that it's 
necessary.  And certainly a law that provides for towing 
does directly regulate the service of the tow truck.  It 
says do it.  And then it tells you when not to do it. 
So what's the -- what happens?  Is every 

traffic law in the United States involving towing 
suddenly preempted?  I can't believe that.  How does 
this work?  So there is much more in significance in 
this case than the words we write, perhaps, than in the 
particular case. 

And now, do you want to, in light of what my 

concern is, add anything to what you say.  And you may 
not, the Solicitor General might, but I'd like to hear 
anything you have to say about that. 

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  Well, believe -- I believe 
with respect to RSA 262, which is the statute that is in 
this case, it doesn't require a tow truck company to do 
anything. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, you -- you can just 
rest on that, but I'm going to have -- or somebody's

going to have to write an opinion.  And we could just 
say that, but I -- I don't see I can -- my own problem 
is not being able to have an intelligent answer to that 
without having some answer to the bigger picture.  And 
the bigger picture seems to me horrendously important. 
And -- and I don't know what that answer is. 

You seem to be getting there with the words 
"deregulatory purpose."  And I -- and I was thinking how 
we might try to work with those, but go ahead. 

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  Well, I think it's -- it 

is an easier case in this case under the FAAAA --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, I think it's much 

harder than this case --

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  Well, I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- because the relationship 

is -- is in the -- in the more general case is more 
direct to the tow truck.  It says "go tow."  And 
that's -- that's why I need some kind of bigger picture. 

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  I'm getting lost in the 

"go tow" command, if you will. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  We have a statute which 

says, if you park your car here for more than 3 hours, 
you will be towed, okay?  And as part of that statute, 
though we don't see it, there is an arrangement for the 
service of the city with the tow truck company, which

says when the parking person calls you and says -- the 
meter says red, yellow, purple, green, you are to go 
there and tow, okay? 

Page 34 

Doesn't that sound as if it's regulating the 

service of tow trucks?  And I suspect across the 
country, there is some variation on that theme, but 
there are thousands of them.  And since the words -- I 
would be repeating it -- the words of this case may 
affect that situation, I want to know what you know, 
which may not be very much -- I don't blame you -- about 
that broader situation. 

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  Well, thank you for the 
out, Justice Breyer.  But again, I -- I -- the reason 
I'm getting lost is -- and I understand the -- the 
example having to do with the City of Cambridge having 
no -- no parking, and if you're there for 3 hours, that 
allows -- there is this -- statutes that allow the tow 
truck operator, the motor carrier, to go and collect 
that under a nonconsensual tow.  And a nonconsensual tow 
is a special animal, unfortunately, because there are no 
market forces in play there. 

But I don't believe that that's affecting 

the motor carrier service.  There is nothing that forces 
that tow truck carrier to go out and actually undertake 
that tow.  And if they do undertake the tow or do the

business or whatnot, then certainly, they would be under 
whatever obligations that the State has. 

And that's one of the problems I think we 

have --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think that 

Justice Breyer is -- I may be speaking for him -- he's 
thinking that that State contract or that State 
regulation that permits towing companies to do this is 
preempted in some way.  That would be his argument 
because it affects --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Or the opposite. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No? 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  He's worried that it'll be 

preempted. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Correct. 
MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  Right. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Correct. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And he didn't -- he didn't 

mention Cambridge, did he? 

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  No. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think so. 
MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  I think he did yesterday,

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And they're -- they're very 

attractive places except in the winter. 

But a -- a motor carrier vehicle -- a 

service, transportation includes related to the movement 
of passengers or property.  Related to the movement of 
passengers or property.  So we have these words "related 
to" again.  I -- well, you've given me a couple of 
ideas, but I -- maybe they'll turn out not to be 
relevant, but -- but -- which I hope. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think maybe -- maybe we 

have to make it up, what the limitation -- I mean, 
you're quite right, everything's related to everything 
else.  And we've had trouble with the same -- the very 
same words with ERISA, and -- and started off trying to 
give it its -- its apparent meaning, "related to," and 
we finally concluded you can't do that. 

So what do you want us to make up?  What 

kind of a limitation do you --

(Laughter.) 
MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  Well -- Justice Scalia, I 

don't think you have to make up too much in this 
particular case.  It gets easier to draw the line 
because of the with respect to transportation of 
property.  So with respect to the FAAAA and motor 
carriers, we're drawing the line as to only the services

of the movement of the property, and that is limiting. 

Page 37 

And I do -- I would agree with your dissent. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Related to -- related to --

related to the movement of the property.  That's the 
problem.  It's the "related to" words. 

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:  Correct.  And then we go 

back to the instructions in Rowe, which -- which 
provided the framework that when you're interpreting 
related to, you go:  One, is it direct -- directly 
regulating or directly affecting service; or, if it's an 
indirect effect, which obviously it can be, it has to 
have a significant impact on the services. 

And then there's the ultimate out of Morales 
that says if it's -- it could certainly connect, but if 
it's too far attenuated to the purposes of Congress, 
it's just not going to be done. 

I know that doesn't help with the line 

drawing in -- in connection of the gray area that we're 
dealing with in this case, but I do believe in this 
particular case, it is easier because we have that --
those words of limitation, "with respect to the 
transportation of property" are words of limitation, and 
they are not present in the ADA, and they were not 
present with the ERISA cases, which deals with a broad 
regulatory scheme with long history and other things

that apply. 

We don't have that in this case.  I believe 
the New Hampshire Supreme Court got it right when they 
were focusing on actually what is a service of a motor 
carrier, and I believe we do have words of limitation in 
this particular case. 

So what the Supreme Court of New Hampshire 

said is, "The manner in which a company in possession of 
a towed vehicle may" -- not must -- "may dispose of the 
vehicle to collect on a debt created by the operation of 
State law is far removed from Congress's aim of 
promoting free markets and equalizing the competitive 
playing -- playing field between motor carriers and air 
carriers, and help assure transportation rate services 
reflect maximum reliance on -- on forces." 

I also believe that the Petitioner has 

basically given up the case and conceded the case in 
several places in their brief and in here in oral 
argument today.  If you look at page 34 of the 
Petitioner's brief, it says that most -- that "The most 
that Dan's City really can say is that the services 
within the meaning of Section 14501(c)(1) includes 
activities that are incidental and distinct from the 
actual transportation services." 

So the Petitioner's brief is calling the

storage afterwards, after the transportation has 
stopped.  And -- and they call it incidental and 
distinct. 

Page 39 

In the reply brief at page 21, they say, 

"Moreover, criminal laws prohibiting theft are not the 
kind of burdensome State economic regulation Congress 
sought to prevent with the FAAAA, nor are abandoned 
vehicle laws such as New Hampshire Chapter 262 in its 
regulations which do not hamper the operations of tow 
truckers.  Instead they establish procedures for the 
efficient handling and disposition of abandoned 
vehicles." 

So they're conceding that RSA 262 in this 
case, the statute does not have a significant impact, 
so this is not a clear case. 

I see I have more time, but I think I've 
made all my points, if there are no more questions.

to eliminate undue interference with market forces and 
consumer choice.  But market forces and consumer choice 
cannot operate on the sale of nonconsensually towed 
cars, and there's little reason to think that Congress 
intended to preempt State laws that regulate that 
conduct. 

This Court in this case, as in many 

preemption cases involving the phrase "related to," must 
engage in a -- in a process of sensible line drawing. 

Everything is related to everything else in 
the literal sense.  And the Court in Travelers suggested 
that the Court should not -- courts should not use 
uncritical literalism in determining the scope of a 
preemption provision. 

I think that this Court does have some work 

to do in this case, but a lot of the groundwork has 
already been laid in the Rowe case.  In Rowe, this Court 
held that a State law is related to a motor carrier 
service if the State law either directly regulates the 
service or if it has an indirect connection with the 
service and a significant -- forbidden significant 
effect on Congress's deregulatory and preemptive 
objectives.  I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's -- I 

asked your friend on the other side the question.

Storage is part of what tow trucks do.  Maybe in a way 
that -- you know, cross-country trucks don't.  And it 
seems to me if you have a local jurisdiction who figures 
out, well, this is a great way to make a lot of money 
or -- you know, to give -- or the other way -- you know, 
you can charge -- charge a lot because we want to keep 
subsidized tow trucks.  I mean, why isn't that fairly 
directly related to the service they provide? 

MR. YELIN:  It's certainly a foreseeable 

service that could be provided.  The question is whether 
it has a sufficient locus to the transportation itself. 
I think there are indications in the statute 
itself and the statutory purposes which suggest that the 
Court should view service as a separate type of service, 
independent and distinct from transportation, at least 
in the towing context where the motor transportation has 
ceased. 

The reason for that, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand what you 

just said.  Say it again. 

MR. YELIN:  Yes, sir.  I think that there 

are reasons in the statutory text itself and in the 
statutory objectives for viewing service as 
independent -- excuse me, storage --

where? 

Storage --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Storage, ah.  I see. 
MR. YELIN:  -- as independent of 

transportation.  And the reasons for that are as 
follows:  First, let me start with the statutory text. 
The statute defines "transportation" as "services 
related to the transportation of property."  And for – 
and storage has been in the Interstate Commerce Act for 
over 100 years, the term "storage."  And for over 100 
years this Court has construed disputes concerning 
storage and considered whether or not Federal law 
governed or State law governed. 

When the storage was before delivery of a 
package, for example, the storage was considered to be 
storage in transit and it was part of the transportation 
itself.  But if the storage occurred after delivery, 
that was a separate service not connected with the 
transportation. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Yelin, I gave 

Mr. Shaughnessy a couple of hypotheticals about very 
onerous regulations involving storage after the towing 
that might very conceivably have an effect on the tower, 
drive up the tower's prices, conceivably even drive the

tower out of the market.  So how do we draw the line as 
between this and those kinds of things? 

Page 43 

MR. YELIN:  So I have two points that I 
would like to make with respect to that, Your Honor. 
The first is that I think the hypotheticals you gave are 
much more difficult cases and could very well cross the 
line if a State tried to indirectly influence towers. 
For example, let's assume, if I may elaborate on your 
hypothetical, that a State really disliked the practice 
of nonconsensual towing, and really wanted to try and 
reign it in and so imposed certain conditions on towers 
that would discourage them from engaging in this 
particular type of service. 

I think that would be an indirect type of 

regulation, but it would, as a matter of fact, it really 
would impair the ability or the interest of towers to 
provide this service to --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  How do we discover that? 

Do we look into the city council hearings or what? 

MR. YELIN:  I think in part, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I want to be able to 

look at the law and say the law is preempted or the law 
isn't preempted.  Don't tell me -- you know, the purpose 
of the law is this or that.  That's not something I am 
able to do.

 MR. YELIN:  Your Honor, I think some of 

Page 44

these preemption questions necessarily are factual in 
part in nature.  The Court, to consider whether or not a 
service of the motor carrier is affected by an indirect 
statute is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, that's factual.  But 
whether the intent of the city council was this or that 
is not factual. 

MR. YELIN:  Oh, no.  That's right, Your 

Honor.  And I didn't mean to suggest that that would be 
part of the inquiry. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought that is what you 

meant. 

MR. YELIN:  No, Your Honor.  The question is 
whether it would have that effect, that factual effect. 
And if I may, I think it's critical in this case to 
point out that Petitioner has conceded at page 21 of its 
reply brief that laws like Chapter 262 do not hamper 
towing industry practices.  And Respondent's amicus 
Towing and Recovery Association explains that laws like 
this provide a critical backbone for nonconsensual 
towing services.  In the absence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but I mean, 

maybe these, but you can easily imagine that these types 
of laws would be subject to abuse and would have an

adverse impact on the towing company and, therefore, on 
the transportation of property. 

Page 45 

MR. YELIN:  And if there were such abusive 

laws, Your Honor, and if they do impair the 
transportation of property and the services that a tower 
was willing to provide, I think that the Court would 
likely consider those cases and consider those --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, now we only --
now we not only have to decide whether this type of law 
is related to it, but once we say some of those laws 
might be and some won't be, depending upon the impact in 
a particular case. 

MR. YELIN:  Your Honor, I think every law 
has to be considered in its application, and I think 
that, for example, in Morales, the Court just didn't 
consider --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Every law doesn't 
have to be considered in its application.  If you say 
you can't speak out on the sidewalk, it doesn't matter 
what they apply it, you can consider that law 
absolutely. 

MR. YELIN:  Fair enough, Your Honor.  My 
comment was too broad.  What I would say is some laws 
will be obvious.  Those that directly regulate towing 
industries, for example, a State law that flatly

 prohibits nonconsensual towing would be the type of 
direct regulation which is proscribed by this preemption 
clause. 

Page 46

When you are talking about indirect 

regulation, however, that perhaps is where I think one 
needs to consider it on an as-applied basis because 
indirect regulation by definition is not going to have 
an obvious direct limit on towing services and the 
question the Court will have to consider is whether the 
indirect regulation is sufficiently onerous that it does 
impair the provision of towing services. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It seems to me that there -– 
we have two choices.  In Morales, since I can mock my own 
opinions, I wrote at the end, "it's not -- when it's too 
tenuous, remote or peripheral."  That's singularly unhelpful. 

(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER:  It seems to -- there --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought so at the time. 
(Laughter.) 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, you were right. 
There are two directions you could go.  But 
first I would like to know, it seems my guess is it is 
universally thought by cities that this Act does not 
preempt their normal parking regulations.  Am I right 
about that?

 MR. YELIN:  You are right about that, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Then we either have 
to take this tenuous, et cetera, this is too much, this 
isn't too much, da, da, da, or you've given -- there is 
another thought being thrown out and that is you relate 
it to the basic purposes of the deregulation act and you 
say that where the city is regulating something that 
never was, could not be, and is not part of a regulated 
or deregulated market, i.e. has nothing to do with the 
subject matter, then it is not preempted. 

Now, do you want us to take that approach? 

Should we punt and just use the words like "tenuous" 
or -- and if we take the implicit suggestion, what's the 
right way to do it? 

MR. YELIN:  Your Honor, I think the two 

alternatives you sketched are not mutually exclusive. 
In fact, I think they support each other.  I believe 
that when a State law does not have a significant effect 
on Congress's deregulatory and preemptive objectives, it 
is by definition going to be too tenuously connected to 
the motor carrier services. 

I would propose, Your Honor, that in this 
context, where the Department of Transportation would 
have no regulatory authority and where there is no 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

Page 48
 private market that could fill the vacuum that would be 
created by the removal of State laws creating the 
structure for the private choices that are undertaken 
here, this would be a prime example. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it would depend upon how 

severe the consumer protection law is, is that right? 
If it's a consumer protection law that really whacks the 
tow truck operator, that would be different from a 
moderate, benign consumer protection law?  We have to 
examine each consumer protection law on its own, is that 
it? 

MR. YELIN:  I think the answer has to be 

yes, Justice Scalia.  In Morales, for example, the Court 
considered the application of the consumer protection 
law where the States were trying to use specific 
guidelines. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why doesn't 

this one really whack them, though?  It's treble damages 
and all that. 

You can answer my question, yes. 
(Laughter.) 
MR. YELIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
Your Honor, the Consumer Protection Act 

claims that are asserted here are premised on Chapter 
262, which structures the background organization of the

 nonconsensual towing services altogether.  There will be 
no treble damages if the substantive provisions were 
satisfied.  If they are not, that would be a different 
question. 

And, Your Honor, there has been no evidence 

suggested here that in fact treble damages for a 
violation of the background laws which structure the 
standards that tow truck companies are supposed to 
undertake would have that harm.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW D. BOUFFARD 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. BOUFFARD:  Thank you. 
Let me take a couple of moments to try to 

address some of the questions that seem to be troubling 
some of the Justices. 

Justice Breyer, the simple answer to why 

local traffic safety laws wouldn't be preempted is that 
there's an exemption for the safety regulatory authority 
of States in the statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Thank you. 
MR. BOUFFARD:  And, Justice Kagan, the 

reason why this -- this case goes over the line and is 
preempted is because what the Plaintiff's damages claims

 in this case seek to do is they seek to enforce duties 
that go well beyond what even the New Hampshire 
abandoned vehicle law requires. 

They seek to impose duties of reasonable 

care to seek out the owner of the vehicle; they --
the -- the -- the negligence claim seeks to impose a 
duty to act -- a duty of reasonable care in disposing of 
the vehicle; and -- and a duty of reasonable care to 
return the vehicle to Mr. Pelkey. 

And those duties and what has been a breach 

of those duties will be determined by a jury.  And so 
when tow truckers are faced in the future with having to 
live up to those sets of duties, they will never know 
whether or not, in any given situation, their conduct 
will be second-guessed as having been not reasonable by 
a jury and they will be subjected to damages claims by 
plaintiffs.  Under the -- the abandoned vehicle law, the 
rule is very simple in New Hampshire and under -- and in 
many other jurisdictions -- pay, or your vehicle can be 
sold.  It's a very simple rule.  And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it also tells how the 

vehicle will be sold -- sold, and your client is 
invoking that statute in order to be able to sell the 
car, but wants to have enforced only the parts that are 
favorable to the tow operation.  And the -- the regime

 in New Hampshire is, yes, you can sell the vehicle, but 
this is how you do it.  And it seems to me that that's 
not how it was done here. 

MR. BOUFFARD:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, 

actually, the -- the tower here wasn't invoking the law, 
the tower was simply following what the law says in 
terms of the process.  This is a mandatory process. 
When -- when a person comes into possession of another's 
vehicle in New Hampshire and -- and there's no claim 
made for the vehicle, the law requires that the tow 
trucker report that fact to the Department of Motor 
Vehicles. 

And the Department of Motor Vehicles then 

looks at the information that's provided and then 
instructs the tower about the process of whether or not 
the vehicle can -- can be sold without notice, or if 
it -- if notice is required, what notice is required. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it's a process that 

allows you in certain circumstances to sell the car and 
to take the money.  And what Justice Ginsburg is 
suggesting is -- you know, you have to take the bitter 
with the sweet. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Please. 
MR. BOUFFARD:  Well, I -- I think 

that the -- the New Hampshire law is the New Hampshire

comply with the law.  And if -- if tow truckers that are 
making good faith attempts to comply with the law are 
faced with Consumer Protection Act claims and negligence 
claims and the kinds of remedies that come with Consumer 
Protection Act claims, that will have a significant
