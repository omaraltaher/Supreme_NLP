 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 09-804, Cigna 

Corporation v. Amara.

 Mr. Olson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Congress crafted a carefully balanced ERISA 

enforcement scheme that enables plan participants to 

recover plan benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B) and 

equitable remedies for ERISA violations under section 

502(a)(3).

 In this case, Respondents are seeking a 

remedy for misleading plan summaries that violated 

ERISA.  Their remedy, if they were harmed by defective 

plan summaries, is under 502(a)(3), equitable remedies, 

not for plan benefits under 502(a)(1)(B).  The section 

that governs the relief that is sought is a necessary 

antecedent to any of the other questions in this case, 

and ERISA carefully structures, and this Court has 

repeatedly said the Court is not interested and does 

not -- is not willing to alter the structure that

Congress carefully crafted and carefully developed over 

the years to provide remedies with respect to ERISA 

programs.

 And the scheme is such that, if there is a 

participant to the plan who is seeking benefits under 

that plan, section (a)(1)(B) of -- subsection (a)(1)(B) 

of section 502 provides for relief under the plan.  If 

there are other violations of ERISA, section 502(a)(3) 

provides for equitable relief.  That is the scheme 

carefully developed by Congress.

 Now, in this case what happened is that 

Cigna changed its pension program, its ERISA plan, from 

a defined benefit plan to a cash benefit plan, a cash 

value plan.  And it put out, as required by ERISA, 

summaries of the new plan that the district court found, 

and the court of appeals affirmed, were misleading in -­

in the sense that they did not provide all of the 

information necessary for plan participants to evaluate 

what was happening.

 Now, the changes to the plan were lawful. 

ERISA permitted and does permit these kind of changes to 

an ERISA plan.  There was nothing unlawful about the 

plan and the plan change.  And the beneficiaries, the 

participants to the plan, did not have any choice. 

Cigna had the right to change the plan.  It did change

the plan.

 It did have an obligation under ERISA to 

provide accurate summaries, and the district court and 

the court of appeals found that those summaries were not 

inaccurate.  In other words -- they were not accurate. 

In other words -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Olson, when you say 

the employees had no choice, but the district court 

found, didn't it, that the reason for this plan summary 

being misleading was that the employer, Cigna, feared 

that there might be a backlash on the part of the 

employees if they found out, if they were told the truth 

about this plan; that is, that it was less favorable, 

that they would not have the same benefits that they had 

under the prior plan?

 MR. OLSON:  That is correct, Justice 

Ginsburg.  They had no choice in the sense that Cigna 

could adopt a change in the plan, as it did.  That was 

permitted under ERISA, but it was required to give 

accurate summaries.

 The choice that you're suggesting and the 

district court was concerned about is that an individual 

could have left the employ of Cigna if he or she was 

unhappy with the change in the plan, or the district 

court said there could have been some sort of a protest.

What we're saying is that the remedy -­

what was -- what was the violation is the summary 

itself.  And we're not -- we're not challenging that 

here.  That's a finding below.  The summary was 

misleading, but that makes it a violation of ERISA.  The 

summary is not the plan.  And -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Olson, we have 

several times referred to the plan as having a range of 

documents associated with it, not as having just a 

single written instrument, but we referred to documents 

and instruments governing the plan.  We did that in 

Curtiss-Wright, which is the case that you pin so much 

on.  We did that in Kennedy.

 And the statute itself talks about that on 

numerous occasions, that there are documents and 

instruments, in the plural.  And one would think that 

the SPD is -- is one of those documents and instruments 

that govern the plan.

 MR. OLSON:  It's quite clear from the 

structure of the statute that is correct, as you 

suggest, that there may be multiple instruments or 

documents that are the -- create the plan itself.  But 

the summary plan document, the SPD, is not a part of the 

plan.  It is a separate document.  It is a summary.  It 

is a succinct statement of what might be in the plan,

and it must be accurate, and it must be written in 

comprehensible English.

 But I would refer the Court to section 1024 

(b)(2) and (4), which are on pages 3a, 4a, and 5a of the 

blue brief.  That describes the obligations that are 

required with respect to the summary plan document.  And 

it describes the instruments of both the summary plan 

document and the instruments that constitute the plan 

itself in the following sentence -- and this is a 

similar sentence in subsection (4), but I'm reading from 

subsection (2), which is on 4a of the blue brief.

 It says:  "Summary plan" -- it refers to "a 

summary plan description and the latest annual report 

and" -- or other -- "and the bargaining agreement, trust 

agreement, contract, or other instruments under which 

the plan was established."

 The construction of that sentence has to be 

that the summary plan description is a separate 

document.  It is not one of those latter category of 

documents under which the plan was established.  And the 

proof of that, if -- if English doesn't teach it to us, 

which I think it does, is the reference to the annual 

report.  No one would say and no one would contend that 

the annual report is a part of the instruments creating 

the plan.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I was struck by 

something else, Mr. Olson.  I was struck by the fact 

that the -- that the statute saying what is in the 

summary plan description is packed with information that 

needs to be in the summary plan description.  By 

contrast, the written instrument, which you equate to 

the plan, the written instrument says barely anything 

about what has to be in it.  It just says the name of 

the fiduciaries has to be in the written instrument.

 So it seems clear that this statute is set 

up so that everything that is important, everything that 

the employee needs to know and needs to rely upon, is 

supposed to be in the SPD, not necessarily in the 

written instrument.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, the written instruments, 

as these things turn out, are long, complex documents. 

They may be 90, 100 pages long.  The summary, as you 

suggest, Congress said, yes, there is a separate 

document that must state in intelligible English that 

plan participants can understand the following things, 

and they must be furnished to plan participants, but 

they are not the plan document.  The way that ERISA is 

structured, it -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Am -- are we missing 

something?  They -- they cannot be in the SPD unless

they are in the plan; isn't that right?

 MR. OLSON:  Well -- if the -- if the -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So -- so the one cannot be 

more detailed than the other, can it?

 MR. OLSON:  The plan can be more detailed 

than the SPD.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  But what -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But can't the SPD -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whatever is in the SPD must 

be in the plan; isn't that right?

 MR. OLSON:  Well, if the plan is -- if the 

SPD complies with ERISA, yes.  It has to be -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  That's what I'm 

talking about, of course.

 MR. OLSON:  Yes.  Yes, exactly.  But not 

everything that is in the plan, or the plan -- as the 

statute says, the documents that constitute the plan 

need not necessarily be in the summary.  The words 

"summary plan" -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Olson, what about 

the opposite?  Because the statute seems to be written 

so that things are in the SPD which don't need to be in 

the written instrument.  And together, they all somehow 

constitute the plan.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, I -- I submit that that is

not the way the statute is written, and subsections (2) 

and (4) of the provision that I was referring to make 

that clear if the word "summary" itself did not make 

that clear.  But the Curtiss-Wright case to which you 

referred to in your earlier question also proves that.

 Curtiss-Wright case talked about a summary 

plan description and said it can't modify the plan -­

using "plan," "summary plan description," in different 

terms -- it cannot modify the plan, which is what the 

district court here held, unless the plan specifically 

says that it may be modified in a certain way and that 

the summary is an appropriate amendment to the plan.  So 

the Court -- and this was a unanimous decision of this 

Court -- was referring to the summary as something that 

was separate, that might modify the plan if the plan 

itself allows for it to be modified in that fashion.

 Now, the Government says that the summary 

plan description is a part of the plan and so do 

Respondents.  And that's what the court below -- the 

court below didn't actually find that the SPD was a part 

of the plan.  The court found, on the latter pages of 

its opinion, that it was a modification, it was an 

amendment to the plan.  That's inconsistent with the 

Curtiss-Wright case because in this case the plan itself 

specifically says that it cannot -- does not say that it

can be amended by the SPD.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that what the 

district court said was that they would treat the plan 

as containing what the summary said, not that -- that it 

was part of the plan itself, not an amendment, 

amendment.  I thought that was what the district court 

said.

 MR. OLSON:  I think in the -- on page of 

the -- this is of -- this is the summary to the cert 

petition, page 218, which is the district court's -- the 

conclusions of the district court's decision.  Under 

Roman numeral VIII, the district court specifically said 

that the terms of Part B have been correspondingly 

modified by the SPDs.

 The court was saying -- I think you were 

referring, Justice Ginsburg, to the relief that the 

court ordered, but the court was ordering that relief on 

the theory that the SPDs modified the plan.  And the 

plan itself, under Curtiss-Wright, doesn't provide for 

it to be amended in that way.  And the SPDs -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It can't be part of the 

plan without modifying the plan, can it?

 MR. OLSON:  That's -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because it contradicts 

other provisions.

MR. OLSON:  That's correct.  And the SPDs, 

the two SPDs themselves, on page 922a and 938a of the 

Joint Appendix, specifically say that if there's any 

discrepancy between the SPD and the plan, the plan 

governs.  The language is at the bottom of, for example, 

at the bottom of 922a.  So -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the SPD can't negate the 

force of ERISA, and if ERISA says that the summary has 

to be consistent with the plan documents, nothing in the 

SPD can negate that requirement.

 MR. OLSON:  That's correct.  No one -- but 

Congress did consider prohibiting a provision like that 

in SPDs, that they could not disclaim, they could not 

say that if there's any inconsistency, the plan 

governed, and Congress did not adopt such a provision.

 This is a perfectly legal provision, to tell 

someone that if there's any discrepancy -- and there's 

bound to be discrepancies, the -- as I said, the plans 

themselves can be 90, 100 pages, very long and very 

complex.  That's why there is an SPD that can't contain 

everything in the plan.

 And one of the things that would be the 

outcome of what the Government and Respondents are 

urging here is that plan creators, these companies that 

create these plans, either will be discouraged from

doing it, or they will start preparing summaries that 

are 90 and 100 pages long so they -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But they can't do that 

because the statute requires the summary to be 

understandable and not prolix.

 MR. OLSON:  That's Catch 22, because if 

there's a -- if there's a discrepancy because they have 

to be short, summary, and intelligible, then we have -­

we're faced with the proposition that someone's going to 

say, well, I read the SPD and it didn't say what was in 

the plan.  If the SPD is as long and as detailed as the 

plan, then there's a violation of ERISA.

 My point I guess in this is that, yes, 

Justice Kagan, the statute requires the SPD to contain 

certain information.  We accept the fact of the 

conclusions of the court below in this case that they 

did not do so.  There are two SPDs.  They failed to live 

up to the -- to the requirements of ERISA.  There is a 

remedy for that.  It is a violation of ERISA, and it 

specifically says in 502(a)(3) that for violations of 

ERISA, equitable remedies are available.  And that is 

what Congress decided.  It is -- unless it's a part of 

the plan, you must go under (a)(3).

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the very question here 

is if there is an SPD that is inconsistent in some way

with the written instrument, what happens?  Is the 

written instrument modified or, instead, is the 

provision in the SPD given operative effect?  And that 

question is one about your benefits under the plan.

 MR. OLSON:  I would submit that it can't 

modify the plan unless the plan permits that.  That's 

Curtiss-Wright.  That's a unanimous decision of this 

Court.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I do think you're 

over-reading Curtiss-Wright.  Curtiss-Wright talked 

about whether a particular provision satisfied the 

requirement that a plan have an amendment provision.  It 

didn't say anything at all about whether there are 

provisions that can have operative effect regardless of 

whether they pass through a formal amendment procedure.

 MR. OLSON:  It seems to me -- I think we 

might disagree about that, respectfully.  I think that 

the sense of the opinion in Curtiss-Wright was that if 

you're going to say that this SPD modifies the plan, it 

can only do so if the plan permits the SPD to modify the 

plan.  Then the Court sent it back to a lower court to 

determine whether in fact the employees that were 

involved in creating the SPD there had the authority 

under the plan to modify the plan -- was it done -­

discussing, I take it, whether under (1) the other side 

is entitled to their benefits even if they weren't hurt, 

on a contract theory.

 MR. OLSON:  That -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  But I thought 

we took the case to decide a different issue.

 MR. OLSON:  Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And that is -- I'll assume 

you're right -- it should have come under (3).  But I 

don't know if that's harmful, whether it was (3) or (1). 

And the question I thought we were to decide was, if 

you're under (3), say, where equity is at issue, now 

equity is at issue and the district court says:  Here we 

have 27,000 people, and now here's how I'm going to go 

about this.  I'm going to look at this provision mistake 

here, and the mistake it seems to me was likely to cause 

them harm.  And once that's shown -- and they showed it, 

it's likely to cause it harm; we can't be sure, but it's 

likely -- then it's up to your client to refute case by 

case that these guys were not -- or women were not 

really harmed.  Okay?

 Now, that seems very sensible to me.  And -­

and if that's the issue we're going to decide, I'd like 

to hear you explain why that isn't sensible.  It's an 

equitable matter.  This is simply a way of going about

it.  What's wrong with that?

 MR. OLSON:  Well, in the first place, it is 

important which section that -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  I agree, but I don't 

understand -- I'm with you on this one so far.

 MR. OLSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Because it's a 

different defendant.  The plan is the defendant versus 

the plan administrator is the defendant.  So that's 

important.

 Secondly, (a)(3) provides only for remedies 

that are available in equity.  Then the point that you 

-- that you're making with respect to what provision of 

equity, what is the -- what is the action that's brought 

and what is the remedy sought, as this Court talked 

about in the Varity case, and so therefore those are 

those questions.

 Now, the Second Circuit said "likely 

harmed."  The fact is, as I pointed out at the very 

beginning, this was a lawful change in a plan and it's a 

plan where 27,000 people that were employees were 

participants in this plan and they would have had to do, 

as Justice Ginsburg suggested, either leave the company 

and suffer some harm or engage in some -­

you're saying there wasn't likely harm.  Okay.

MR. OLSON:  Except -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Are you conceding that the 

standard that they used, that the standard was -- the 

question that you raised at the beginning, whether -­

whether the showing of likely harm is sufficient in the 

absence of a rebuttal?

 MR. OLSON:  Absolutely we are not, and so -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  That's what I 

want to hear:  What's the argument against that 

standard?

 MR. OLSON:  Six circuit courts of appeals 

have held that -- that detrimental reliance is required. 

If -- if this is an action under (a)(3) under equity, 

neither the Government nor the Respondents dispute the 

fact that detrimental reliance would be required if 

you're proceeding in equity under (a)(3).

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  And does 

"likely harm" capture that idea?

 MR. OLSON:  "Likely harm" is not a 

demonstration of prejudicial reliance.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?  Why not?

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- by harm is they were 

hurt, brought about by reliance.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, in the first place, it 

comes out of the blue, "likely harm," as I suggested, 

since this was a legal, lawful change.  People were 

going to retain their employment.  They didn't have a 

right to opt for one or the other.  If they could prove 

that they were -- this is -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  You object to this decision 

saying the following:  Of course, the lower court said 

likely harm is necessary.  As we understand it, given 

the context of equity, what that means here is that 

there was reason to believe -- reason to believe -- it 

was probable that, or some words like that, that there 

would have been harm caused by reliance on the -- the 

misstatement.

 MR. OLSON:  I -- that would not be justified 

at all.  I mean, under equity, as this Court said in the 

Lyng v. Payne case, which is cited in the briefs, this 

is like an estoppel action.  An essential element of an 

estoppel action is detrimental reliance on the adverse 

party's misrepresentation.

 What the district court below did was, by 

coming up with this "likely harm" harm thing, is throw 

the burden over to the plan or the plan administrator

and saying:  Demonstrate that any one of your -- all of 

your 27,000 members of this purported class somehow were 

hurt by a change in a plan over which they had no 

control, over which they had no discretion, unless they 

were going to leave the -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But wasn't the -- wasn't 

the meaning of "likely harm" simply that they were 

promised one thing in the plan document, and so what 

likely harm is, is we have to do away with what they 

call, what is it, "the wear-away effect"?  So that's the 

harm, the wear-away effect, and we have to remedy that. 

And the way to remedy it is to treat this as, what is 

it, instead of (a) or (b), (a) plus (b)?

 MR. OLSON:  And that would be an action to 

seek benefits under the plan, which would be an 

(a)(1)(B) action against the plan itself.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.

 MR. OLSON:  Against the plan.  The record 

suggests in various parts -- I can't remember exactly 

which page to refer to -- that $70 million would be the 

consequence of this against the plan, on which some 

people, depending upon how long they were with the 

company, when they left the company, whether they were 

about to retire, whether they stayed longer and the 

interest rates fluctuated, there can be all --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Excuse me, Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Then you can't 

require, it seems to me, each individual to make a 

calculation about whether they have actually been 

harmed, whether there's detrimental reliance.  The whole 

point of these plans is to give people some comfort and 

assurance when they are age whatever, that:  Don't 

worry; retirement is taken care, or at least I can rely 

on that.

 And your formulation would sort of put that 

up in the air and say:  We don't know if you're going to 

be harmed or not; wait until you're 65 and we will see.

 MR. OLSON:  Well, Chief Justice --

Mr. Chief Justice, that is the statute.  The statute 

gives you relief with respect to a misleading plan 

summary under the laws of equity.  The laws of equity 

would require that the person say -- demonstrate in some 

way that they were harmed.  The petition -- the 

Respondents in this case, the named members of the 

class, claim that they were out 30-some thousand dollars 

each.  They would have an incentive to bring an action 

by themselves.

MR. OLSON:  Under the rules -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it couldn't be 

brought as a class action, and isn't that a large piece 

of this picture, that proceeding as they did they can 

proceed as a class?  Proceeding under detrimental 

reliance, it would be hard to get a class because it 

would be an individual case of detrimental reliance.

 MR. OLSON:  The Rules Enabling Act provides 

that a class mechanism cannot change the substantive 

provisions of law.  And so, it cannot be that, because 

this is brought as a class action, the rules of equity 

somehow change.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then the question is, 

under the -- under the section that the district court 

proceeded under, not the one that you say is proper, a 

class action would be appropriate.

 MR. OLSON:  A class action might be 

appropriate, but it would not change the detrimental 

reliance requirement.  Again, this -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, turning to (a)(3), I 

have two questions.  One is, as you -- and this is 

probably for your friends on the other side more than 

you.  But as you understand the "likely harm" standard 

that prevails in the Second Circuit, is it likely harm 

to a majority of the members of the class, all of the

members of the class?  Do you know?  Has the Second 

Circuit told us what that means?

 MR. OLSON:  Yes, well, the Second Circuit 

suggested, and the Government and Respondents, 

particularly the Respondents, say if there's a material 

difference, likely harm is presumed.  And the Government 

itself says -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Likely harm to whom?  I 

think that's the question -­

MR. OLSON:  That is the question.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that Justice Kennedy is 

asking, and I have the same question.  Does it mean 

likely -- is it likely that the class as a whole has 

been harmed, or that each -- is it likely that each 

individual member of the class has been harmed?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or -- or a significant 

number?

whatever?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My question had no import. 

I really wanted to know the answer to that.

 (Laughter.)

is what the district court ordered and the Government 

seeks and the Respondents seek, is they're all harmed by 

this, that there's any material disparity, then 

everybody -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe it wouldn't be too 

hard.  They're -- they're joined as members of the class 

in light of a certain set of characteristics, and the 

judge would find that, other things being equal, 

individuals who have that set of characteristics which 

in this circumstance make them members of the class 

would be harmed in all likelihood, okay?  Done.

 Now, it's up to -- it's up to the -- the 

defendant then to show that in a particular case this 

individual wasn't harmed.

 MR. OLSON:  It defies reality -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?

 MR. OLSON:  -- Justice Breyer, to suggest 

that the 27,000 people -- each one occupy a different 

position in terms of the length of their employment, 

when they might be retiring, what their benefits might 

be, whether they might take a lump sum or an annuity.

Congress's choice.  It's an equitable remedy that would 

be required.  Congress made that decision.  This Court

carefully did.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. BRUCE

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. BRUCE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Our position is that detrimental reliance is 

not found in section 102 of ERISA, which establishes the 

summary plan description requirement.  It's not found in 

section 404(a)(1)(D) of ERISA, which establishes the 

fiduciary duty that's in accordance with the plan 

documents and instruments, plural, insofar as consistent 

with the provisions of this title.

 It's also not consistent with any language 

in section 502(a), either in 502(a)(1)(B) or 502(a)(3). 

The reference to equitable relief is to appropriate

equitable relief to redress a violation of Title I or a 

violation of the terms of the plan.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that seems to me 

like just a roundabout, complex way of saying that you 

must recover under the plan, because if reliance is not 

required then there must be some basis on which you must 

recover, and that recovery must be under the plan.  So 

it's -- it's -­

MR. BRUCE:  Well, the -- the -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, if you say -- if 

you say injury is not required, then -- then I don't see 

how the SPD can give you recovery, unless the SPD is the 

plan, which brings us right back to the argument, which 

is your argument, under the first -- under the first 

section, under (a) -­

MR. BRUCE:  Under either (a) -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- (a)(1), (a)(1).

 MR. BRUCE:  Under -- our understanding is 

that under either (a)(1)(B) or (a)(3), that the court is 

effectively providing an injunction in a case like this, 

where -- where an action violates the statute.  And here 

a plan provision which had a very detrimental effect on 

people was not disclosed to them, and so the effect of 

the statute is to make that unfavorable provision 

ineffective.  And so --

JUSTICE ALITO:  If the -- if the SPD is part 

of the plan, then where does the "likely harm" standard 

come from?

 MR. BRUCE:  I think, as we've said in our 

brief, we think that the likely harm, possible 

prejudice, and the material conflict that -- that is 

used in the Third Circuit in Burstein, we think that all 

of those standards are very similar, that they are 

really looking at whether it -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  No, but why is there any 

requirement whatsoever, other than the fact that it's in 

the plan?  If the SPD is the plan and the SPD says you 

get certain benefits that you wouldn't get under the 

written document, then -- the previously executed 

written document, then you get the benefits under the 

SPD, period.  It doesn't matter whether there's likely 

harm or reliance or anything else, right?

 MR. BRUCE:  Well, I think, Justice Alito, we 

see this more as a nondisclosure issue, that the 

unfavorable provisions in the plan were not disclosed, 

and that the effect of the statute is to make those 

unfavorable plan provisions ineffective.  But because 

the statute refers to, for example, material 

modifications and being sufficiently comprehensive and 

reasonably apprising, that there are enough

qualifications in there where the court can look and 

see, is this really -- was this conflict, was it really 

about something that was significant to people that 

might have an impact on their decision making and 

whether the terms of their employment are satisfactory, 

whether they might want to seek another job, they might 

just go into the office and say:  We need more benefits.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me that 

it's a very tough argument to say -- to make a 

nondisclosure claim on the theory that the summary is 

part of the plan, because the whole point of a summary 

is not to disclose everything.  If it disclosed 

everything, it wouldn't be a summary.  And if you can 

claim something because it didn't disclose it, it seems 

to me that's in tension with the idea that it's not 

supposed to be just a repetition of the plan.

 MR. BRUCE:  Our position is that the SPD is 

one of the documents or instruments governing the plan. 

And by statute it's required to have certain -- to meet 

certain requirements, and therefore it becomes a 

document governing the plan.  It is -- in response to 

Mr. Olson, it is referred to as a document in section 

1024(a)(6) of the statute, and of course this Court has 

repeatedly referred to it as a plan document and to 

"plan documents" plural.  So, what --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there's -- I think 

the brief -- the Petitioners' brief pointed out, it 

governs the plan only when it's more favorable to the 

participants, because you wouldn't say, if the plan were 

more favorable and the summary would show fewer 

benefits, that the summary would then govern.

 MR. BRUCE:  I think the -- the 

favorable/unfavorable is that the way -- the way I see 

it is that an unfavorable plan term, when you look at 

Curtiss-Wright, an unfavorable plan term must be validly 

adopted and it must be disclosed in accordance with 

ERISA in order to be effective.

 And so, in the Frommert v. Conkright case, 

that was specifically what the Second Circuit held, was 

that the summary plan description did not disclose the 

phantom offset, and therefore the phantom offset was 

ineffective.  Here the summary plan description did not 

disclose the wear-away provisions.  People's normal 

expectation is that if they are under a pension plan and 

they are continuing to work, that they are continuing to 

earn pension benefits.  So that the SPD was not 

apprising them that there were unfavorable provisions in 

the plan, which were validly adopted, but which were 

secret as far as they were concerned.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So there's a -- there's a

presumption that everything in the plan is favorable?  I 

still don't see how you get it both ways.  If it -- if 

it understates the benefits, that doesn't count?

 MR. BRUCE:  The -- the Congress in ERISA is 

concerned with unfavorable effects on participants. 

It's about protecting employee rights.  So the focus is 

on losses of benefits, and there is a specific provision 

in the regulations and in the statute about disclosing 

all the circumstances that can result in a loss of 

benefits.  So there was a plan provision here which 

caused the loss of benefits that was never disclosed to 

people.  And it was -- there was no baseline where 

people knew, well, the plan document may have a 

wear-away provision, and the SPD doesn't mention it and 

therefore there is no wear-away.

 They didn't know what wear-away was.  They 

don't know what wear-away is today, because it has never 

been disclosed to them that there's a way to -- to rig 

up a pension plan where you can have a period of years, 

unbeknownst to you, where you're not earning any an 

additional benefits.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Are you finished 

with that?

 MR. BRUCE:  Yes.  Sorry.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If you're finished.  As I

understand what you have been saying and written, you 

don't mean that the SPD, the summary, is a contract? 

I 

mean, one thing would be to say it's a part of the plan 

and moreover it's a contract, so therefore we enforce it 

according to terms.  That's one view.

 But if you took that view, you get into 

problems such as were mentioned.  The employer would 

write 10,000 pages because he knows it's an enforceable 

contract.  Nobody would understand it.  You'd have to 

worry about the time when it was less favorable than the 

written document.  So call it a plan if you want, as 

long as you don't mean it's an enforceable contract.

 Now, there's a provision that deals with it, 

saying just what you said in response to Justice Alito. 

And what I don't understand is why wouldn't that 

provision govern?  I take it there's a provision, 

1054(g)(1), that says a plan cannot reduce the rate of 

accrual of future benefits unless there's written notice 

in a manner calculated to be understood by the average 

plan participant.

 So I would have thought, I read that, I get 

what you've said in your brief.  The summary was 

inadequate.  It wouldn't have been understood, and, 

therefore, according to this particular provision, those 

provisions in the plan that reduce benefits are void.

So now we enforce the plan with the -- in the absence of 

those particular void provisions, and you get what you 

want.  Now, I thought that makes a lot of sense to me, 

except I don't see that anywhere in this case.

 MR. BRUCE:  Now -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  So there's some reason it 

doesn't seem to appear in the opinions.  It doesn't 

appear in the briefs.  It doesn't appear anywhere until 

you just mentioned it in response to Justice Alito, or 

seemed to.

 MR. BRUCE:  No, it is in the opinion.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It is?

 MR. BRUCE:  The district court found a 

violation.  It's 1024(h) -- it's 204(h) of ERISA, that 

that provision -- the district court found a violation 

of that provision, which if the court had provided 

relief would have resulted in the class receiving much 

more relief than the court ultimately ordered; that it 

would have resulted in the class receiving four or five 

times as much relief, because they would have just been 

put back under the old pension formula.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is that provision?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  (h).  He's right, it's (h).

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does it appear anywhere in

the briefs?

 MR. BRUCE:  It appears in our petition for 

certiorari, because after the district court found a 

violation of it, the district court declined to provide 

relief because there had been an intermediate interim 

amendment that might have -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  I understand that.  So 

suppose we can't reach that, which would seem to be the 

logical thing to govern this, but we can't, okay?  Then 

we only have two choices.  The first choice is (1)(b), 

which seems to -- you want to use that by treating the 

summary as a contract, or we go to (3), in which case 

we're under equity.

 Now, between those two, the first one gets 

all the problems that we just were talking about.  The 

second one would seem to be you're free and clear as 

long as you show some kind of reliance and harm, and 

then we're back to what I thought we granted this for, 

which is why not say if harm is likely, then the burden 

shifts?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why not?

 MR. BRUCE:  That's -- that's -- that's one 

way that it would be -- that was the way it's approached 

under the Securities Act, where there is an express 

reliance requirement.

JUSTICE BREYER:  What happens in a trust law 

where, let's say, there are 10 or 50,000 beneficiaries 

in a trust, and -- and the trustee has indeed made an 

error.  And now they can recover money only if, only if 

there really has been harm.  Now, how do the -- how does 

trust law work that out?  This can't be the first time 

this ever arose in history.  We have a big class, and -­

MR. BRUCE:  Well, I -- we didn't go based on 

a trust law case involving a big class, but we based it 

on Bogert and on section 173 in the Restatement of 

Trusts, that when there is a breach of the duty to 

disclose all of the material information that the 

beneficiary needs to know in interacting with a third 

party, which in this case would be Cigna with respect to 

their employment, that then there is no requirement of 

proving reliance; that the trustee can prove -- as the 

Second Circuit set up, that the trustee can try and 

prove that the beneficiaries have all the information 

that they needed.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you say under standard 

trust law once you show there's a breach, the burden 

shifts to the trustee to show that there's no harm?

to be the Second Circuit rule, but I didn't understand 

that to be the rule generally in the law of trusts, and 

I quarrel with the Government's brief on that.  I think 

the Government's brief is quite wrong to suggest that 

this is part of the law of trusts.

 MR. BRUCE:  Now, I -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, it could be the law 

of ERISA under the Second Circuit, but that's something 

quite different.

 MR. BRUCE:  My understanding is -- I mean, 

that's the law that's been -- that this Court has 

adopted in securities cases where we have nondisclosures 

to broad classes, is that there's a presumption of 

reliance, which -- because it's unrealistic for 

thousands of people to prove reliance in -- in -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's not under 

trust -- trust law, or correct me if I'm wrong.

 MR. BRUCE:  Well, that's -- that's what I'm 

saying, that there's a commonality between the 

securities cases, trust law as stated in the -- in the 

comment to section 173 and in Bogert, and what the 

Second Circuit is doing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could I just stop -­

the securities cases, does that involve stock traded in 

a market, in which case the inference of harm would be

much more obvious and follow more logically than in the 

trust context?

 MR. BRUCE:  Well, one -- one of this Court's 

very first ERISA cases was Teamsters v. Daniel, in which 

the Securities and Exchange Commission had considered 

pension plans to be a security.  And -- and the case 

actually involved break-in-service rules, and this Court 

concluded that whatever protections the securities laws 

offered, potentially offered, to participants were now 

offered in more concrete form under ERISA.

 But the -- the point that I want to get back 

to on reliance is that my reading of this Court's 

decision in Bridge and in Lyng v. Payne is that this 

Court does not look for the closest analogy to a 

statutory provision.  The question is:  What did 

Congress do in enacting this statutory provision?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I ask you this:  If 

this were an individual action and it -- and it were 

under (a)(3), what would either the plaintiff or the 

defendant have to show, depending on what the burden -­

who has the burden, on the issue of likely harm?

 What would "likely harm" mean in that 

context?  The person was likely to have left the 

employment of the company, or what?  What else?

 MR. BRUCE:  "Likely harm" can include

that the -- that if the person knew about the provision, 

they might have asked for the provision to be changed. 

They might have asked for a different compensation 

package.  They might have asked -- they might have taken 

personal kind of self-help steps to protect themselves 

so that they might have -- have, you know, decided to 

have their wife work longer.  They might have decided to 

work longer themselves.  They could have saved and saved 

differently.

 There's both the -- the steps that you can 

take in relation to your employment and the steps that 

you can take on a personal basis.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Could they here have 

gone -- could they also have said to the company:  Look, 

why are you doing this?  If interest rates fall, we're 

going to lose money.  But interest rates might rise, and 

if interest rates rise, you'll lose money.  So we're 

risk-averse, so what we would like to do is just make 

sure we get the same pension that we would under Plan A, 

and then if there's more on Plan B, add it in, and we'll 

risk the fact that interest rates might have gone up.

 MR. BRUCE:  The district court -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  So they could -- they might 

have talked the company into it.

that there was a real prospect of employee backlash if 

the employees knew about these benefit reductions.  It's 

well-established in behavioral economics that people are 

very averse to losses.  So if a -- if the statute and 

the regulations are requiring the loss to be disclosed, 

it isn't going out on a limb to say that there's going 

to be a reaction to that.

 And here, Cigna knew that there was a 

reaction to that, and they had examples from the press 

of with Deloitte & Touche had had a similar situation 

where they had to roll back the cash balance changes 

because employees were so upset.

 I think, in response to Justice Alito's 

question, the -- I don't think that the individual has 

to -- that if the individual has to prove possible 

prejudice, then I think that, as -- as our district 

court ruled here, then I think the standard inevitably 

becomes very close to actual prejudice.  And so I think 

that the possible prejudice is really to the employee 

group.  It's to the -- the statute is in terms of the 

average plan participant.  It's all based on objective 

standards.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under your proposal, I 

assume, if you prevail, under your position, the -- the 

summaries will now become part of the plan.  So that

even if there's no intent to mislead, there can be a 

class action if the -- if the SPD is in anyhow at 

variance with the plan -­

MR. BRUCE:  Well, as we -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- and to the -- to the 

detriment of the employee.

 MR. BRUCE:  Well, as we said in the brief, 

there are already cases that -- that recognize 

exceptions to liability here, and one of them is for 

prompt correction of any problem.  So if you have the 

unintentional error in that unintentionally the 

wear-away provisions weren't disclosed, well, then the 

issue is:  Why wasn't that corrected at any point in 

time?  We're now 12 years out, and Cigna has never 

disclosed those wear-aways to anyone.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If an administrator -- if an 

administrator issues a summary plan description that is 

100 pages long and is basically the same thing as the 

written instrument, and that's a violation of the 

requirement in ERISA that it be a summary and that it be 

intelligible to ordinary readers, what remedy is 

available to a beneficiary?

 MR. BRUCE:  I think -- I think that that's 

-- obviously, injunctive relief in terms of an order to 

correct that would be available.  I think in terms of --

of affecting the benefit offers, of saying, well, is 

a -- if the SPD is identical to the plan document, is 

there any -- there are no undisclosed plan provisions, 

then.  So it becomes -- it becomes more difficult in 

terms of relief, but obviously there would be relief for 

the understandability requirement.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, doesn't that put 

the -- think of the incentives for the administrator in 

that situation or for the plan sponsor.  If you issue a 

succinct SPD, you risk misleading the recipients as to 

the contents of the plan, and you may have financial 

liability.

 If, on the other hand, you issue -- you err 

on the side of issuing an SPD that is comprehensive, 

well, the worst that can happen, according to what you 

just said, is you can be faced with an injunction to 

provide a more concise and comprehensible statement.

 MR. BRUCE:  Well, intentional errors should 

not be countenanced, and here Cigna was deliberately 

misleading employees.  If it's an unintentional error, 

then it should be promptly corrected.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

41

please the Court:

 The pension benefits an employee accrues 

while she works are a major component of her 

compensation for working, just as her wages are.  The 

employee is entitled to receive those benefits and to 

recover them if they are withheld without any 

particularized showing of detrimental reliance, just as 

she is entitled to recover the wages that were promised 

to her.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Kneedler, do you 

view this as essentially a contract case, as that just 

suggested, or instead a trust case?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  We view it as basically a 

contract case.  In Firestone, the Court referred to 

contractually -- contractually guaranteed benefits, 

those under the plan.  And the reason we think that 

here, in this case the district court found that the SPD 

basically promised, represented to employees, that after 

the conversion they would receive pension benefits in 

the form of A plus B, the old benefits plus the new 

benefits, accruing right away.

 ERISA -- the scheme of ERISA is that the SPD

is often -- typically the only document that the 

employee receives to inform him or her about the 

contents of the plan.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  If this is a contract case, 

then where does the "likely harm" standard come from? 

If I'm owed something under a contract, I'm entitled to 

get that under the contract.  I don't need to show that 

I was likely harmed by, that I relied in any -- in any 

way on anything.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.  We do not think 

detrimental reliance -- and I think it works out -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think likely harm is 

required?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  In this sense:  If the -- if 

the SPD contains these sorts of representations such 

that the employee could reasonably be expected to rely 

upon them in defining her benefits, then that controls. 

The likely harm is not being told, or being told 

something different from what the underlying plan says.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the likely harm -­

MR. KNEEDLER:  That could be rebutted -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not the likely harm. 

That's the breach.  That's the offense.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Unless the participant 

actually knew or couldn't reasonably depend upon it. 

Actually knew -- for example, this was the case in the 

Govoni case in the First Circuit, that -- whose 

formulation is the one that other courts typically 

follow.  That was the situation where the employee found 

out before she retired what the true facts were, and,

the SPD is the only thing that is the contract that -­

the -- by the person who is giving the money, the 

employer.  So now you're saying that it's a contract, 

even though it wasn't written by the employer and even 

though it could differ in dozens of ways from the actual 

-- from the actual plan document.  Sometimes they'd be 

favorable to the employee, sometimes they'd be 

unfavorable, sometimes they'd be different but neutral. 

So what's the judge supposed to do?  Forget about the 

basic document and just enforce this thing written by 

the fiduciary?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, but the underlying 

formal document is -- is what controls, unless the SP -­

unless there's a conflict.  This case -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I said that there can 

be conflicts, sometimes favorable to the employee, 

sometimes unfavorable, sometimes neutral.  So what we 

have is a document that's, by the way, supposed to be 

short, but I guess if we took your view it wouldn't be 

short anymore.  And -- and it -- it could differ in any 

one of three ways; and I could think of seven other 

ways.

 So -- and we'll find seven others.  So, what

say that this two-page document is the contract, is the 

contract, and there are all kinds of conflicts -- what's

and the -- and the formal plan document are not common,

administrator or the employer has an obligation to

question is:  One, why should a document written by a 

different person, the fiduciary, govern over the actual

person is beside the point of my question.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Okay.  And -- and so the -­

the second point is, I -- I think it would be useful for 

the Court to look to the experience of certificates of 

insurance under group insurance plans.  That is the most 

directly analogous circumstance in our view.  It is the 

prevailing position in the courts, and it has been for 

some time, that where an employee -- or employee under a 

group health plan or pension plan receives a certificate 

of insurance that sets forth certain elements, essential 

elements of the plan, and the -- an underlying insurance 

policy is in conflict with that, that the certificate of 

insurance governs, for the same reason that the SPD 

governs -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is this governed by ERISA 

or are these things governed by ERISA?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Some of them may be and some 

of them may not be.  I mean, it -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So where does the rule 

come from, then?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  The -- the rule is a common 

insurance rule that in -- in the group insurance 

situation, where you have an underlying policy that the 

individual insured is not going to see.

which says that it is the plan that governs.  I mean, 

that -- that's -- don't you think that's a crucial 

difference?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, but there's -- it's 

also a statute that, as this Court said in 

Curtiss-Wright, that the SPD is designed to -- to 

furnish the employee the essential information under the 

plan.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that true of the 

certificate of insurance?  Is a certificate of insurance 

a simple document that any consumer is able to 

understand or -- or is supposed to be?

it's supposed to be.  And importantly in that -­

it was an effort to judge whether the -- whether the 

particular statements in the SPD were of the sort 

that -- I think it really gets at materiality, whether 

the statement's material.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Kneedler, I -- I think 

it's a hard question here as to whether to think of this 

as more like a contract dispute or more like a -- a 

trust issue.

 If we were to look at it as a trust issue, 

what would be the result of that?  What kind of test 

would we use?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  I think it would be -- I 

think it would be the same thing where you -- where you 

have a -- either in this case an affirmative 

representation of what the -- of what benefits will be 

due, or you could have a situation where there was a -­

a failure to disclose.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if it's a contract 

case as you're submitting, then the burden-shifting 

rules, it seems to me, that apply in trusts don't apply.

MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, the burden-shifting 

rule would apply to the extent of enabling the 

administrator of the plan or the employer to demonstrate 

that the employee actually knew or that there were other 

documents that would have informed the employee so that 

he would not have been misled by the statements in the

that -­

MR. KNEEDLER:  You have brochures -­

there's no such requirement with respect to the plan?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  That's -- that is critical to 

our position.  And, again, the insurance/certificate of 

insurance analogy, it's all the same reasons that we say 

under ERISA, that that's the only document that is 

given, it's given for the obvious purpose of -- of 

telling the employee the essential aspects of the deal 

that he's going to get, and ERISA identifies, itemizes 

what they are and requires that the plan administrator 

not -- not minimize what they are.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it can't -- it can't 

amend the plan, contrary to what we've said.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  It's not -- it's not an 

amendment to the plan.

say it controls.  Does that make you feel better about

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, that -- that's the 

explanation -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Does it control when it's

 MR. KNEEDLER:  It does not.  The -­

it's more favorable, but not when it's less favorable.

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Because -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  What theory of contract law 

gets you to that conclusion?

 MR. KNEEDLER:  Because you have two 

different documents that may be part of the contract. 

It's an effort to find out what the deal is.  Under the 

insurance cases that I mentioned, what the courts 

says -- what the courts say is the certificate becomes 

part of the contract, but those cases also say when 

the -- when the plan is more favorable, that the plan 

governs because that -- under ERISA, that is the 

operative plan document that the administrator is 

supposed to operate under day to day.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Kneedler.

 Mr. Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. OLSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 I'd like refer first of all to what 

Respondents said in -- in response to a question from 

you, Justice Breyer, about section 204(g).  And you -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  (j).

 MR. OLSON:  Well, (g), I'm talking about. 

That's what they -- I refer you to page 212 of the cert 

petition appendix under Roman numeral VI, where the 

district court specifically said:  Plaintiffs also seek 

to assert their claim under ERISA's anti-cutback 

provision, 204(g).  That claim has been rejected in the 

liability decision.  That claim was raised; it was 

rejected in the liability decision.  It's not here 

anymore.

 Section -- the real section that the Court 

should refer to in 204, is 204(h) -- (h)(6)(A) of ERISA, 

and I can't point to the portion of the appendix, but 

that was an addition by Congress in 2001 to deal with 

egregiously inaccurate notices of change.  That -- and 

Congress amended ERISA in 2001, added that provision, 

and said, if there's an egregious violation of that 

provision, then you get all the benefits that you should 

have gotten.

That's what Congress can do if it wishes to 

do.  That's what's being sought in this case.  Congress 

can take care of this if it wishes, but Congress enacted 

a carefully reticulated scheme; you're either suing for 

benefits under the plan or you're suing for violations 

of ERISA.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why didn't that (h) apply 

here?  Was it not egregious enough?  Is that -- is that 

why it didn't apply?  Or they just forgot about it or 

what?

 MR. OLSON:  I -- I don't think that the -­

the notice that was involved was referring to the SPD. 

The SPD, to the extent that it violates ERISA, there is 

a remedy that still exists; Congress hasn't changed. 

It's in (a)(3).  It must be an equitable remedy.  You 

can seek an injunction.

 And to the extent the Court is concerned 

that that's an empty remedy, that that's not a 

sufficient remedy, that's what Congress decided; and we 

referred in footnote 3 of our reply brief of a number of 

cases that -- that circuit courts have handled 

demonstrating detrimental reliance and providing for 

remedies.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but I still have the 

same question Justice Scalia had, which is -- which is

why didn't this (h) thing apply here, because they 

didn't have -- their claim, the notice wasn't good, and 

if the notice wasn't good, then -- the plan didn't 

change, and if the plan didn't change, they should have 

gotten the money.  Why didn't it -- why?

 MR. OLSON:  That provision doesn't apply to 

the SPD, and they did not bring that case.  I don't 

know -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why doesn't it apply to the 

SPD?  Isn't that a notice?

 MR. OLSON:  I think it's a different type of 

notice that -- under that provision.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought it says -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there was a -- there 

was notice, wasn't there?

 MR. OLSON:  There was a notice.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And is the claim based on 

that, or is it based on the SPD?

 MR. OLSON:  The claim is based upon the SPD, 

and the district court decided that the SPD had amended 

the plan.  And that's inconsistent with what the statute 

provides.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Olson, on your view of 

showing detrimental reliance, I take it you would 

require each employee to come forward and say yes, I

read this SPD; is that correct?

 MR. OLSON:  Yes.  And trust law -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And doesn't that really 

misunderstand the realities of the workplace?  Very few 

people read their SPDs, but you only need one person to 

read the SPD to come in and say, by the way, folks, 

21,000 of us are not getting our retirement benefits for 

the next few years.  And within a day, every employee in 

the workplace is going to know about that.  So doesn't 

this give an incredible windfall to your client, Cigna, 

or to other companies that commit this kind of 

intentional misconduct if you hold them to this 

detrimental reliance standard?

 MR. OLSON:  The -- I refer to what 

Justice Kennedy was referring to.  To the extent that 

we're talking about trust law, we're talking about the 

requirement of a loss.  I would say that a person would 

not necessarily have to have read the SPD but have been 

aware of it and taken some steps in connection with it. 

And that's the evidence that would have to be 

established, and there's no -- and every court has said 

that under (a)(3) equity requires detrimental reliance.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Olson.

 The case is submitted.
