 This case concerns who counts and who does 
12  not count as a supervisor under Title VII.  The parties 
13  and the United States agree that the Seventh Circuit 
14  rule violates the holding of Faragher, the reasoning of 
15
16  precedents, including Burlington Northern and Staub, and 
17  the common-sense meaning of the word "supervisor." 
 The parties even agree as to the general 
18
19  legal standard, although they style it a little bit 
different -- differently, that those harassers whose 
20
21  employer-conferred authority over their victims enables 
22  or materially augments the harassment should count as 
23  supervisors. 
24

imposes automatic liability on employers.  Victims must 

Faragher and this Court's other central Title VII 

 This is not a standard, Your Honor, that

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Let's say you have a 

work room.  There are five people who work there.  And 

you don't like country music; if you don't date me, it's 

1  still prove actionable harassment, and employers can 
2  still take advantage of the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative 
3  defense. 
4
5
6  the employer has a rule that the senior employee gets to 
7  pick the music that's going to play all day long.  And 
8  the senior employee says to one of the other 
9  employees -- you know, if you don't date me -- I know 
10
11  going to be country music all day long. 
12
 Now, that affects the daily activities of 
13  that other employee.  I would have thought, under your 
14  theory, that means that that senior employee is a 
15
16
17  circumstance the adverse action would not amount to --
18  would not be severe.  Or, perhaps it would be 
19  pervasive --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Hard rock instead of --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It could be far more 
severe than simply saying, all right -- you know, you're 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that could 

be -- that could be far more severe than, for example --

 MR. ORTIZ:  No, Your Honor, because in that

 MR. ORTIZ:  Well, no, Your Honor, this is 

the -- the severity is an objective standard; it's not a 

1  going to -- as in this case -- you're going to be 
2  cutting the celery rather than -- you know, baking the 
3  bread, or whatever. 
4
5
6  subjective.  So in this case, someone's intense 
7  dislike -- maybe it's debilitating, subjective --
8  dislike of rock music, some forms of country music --
9  might impair the performance of some in the workplace; 
but, from an objective reasonable employee's standpoint, 
10
11  I don't believe that that would be the case.  Not all --
12
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but, I mean, 
13  there are places where the environment -- you know, an 
14  assembly line or something like that -- where the task 
15
16  environment in which you have to perform them may be far 
17  more significant than whether or not you're attaching 
18  the door handles or the front fenders. 
19
20
21
22  I would have thought the benefit of the Seventh 
23  Circuit's test was that you don't have to go through 
24  those case-by-case basis.  I think we can have a 
25

reasonable debate about whether the music you have to 

may not be that different, but how you -- the 

 MR. ORTIZ:  Oh, for sure, Your Honor, but 

that has to be judged on a case-by-case basis. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, exactly.  And 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. ORTIZ:  Well, Your Honor, the Respondent 

 But the Seventh Circuit test makes clear --

it doesn't give any kind of immunity; it just makes 

Seventh Circuit rule, and the indeterminativeness --
both indeterminativeness and unpredictability of the 
Second Circuit rule. 

1  listen to for eight hours is objectively a significant 
2  enough interference with the daily activities to qualify 
3  under your test. 
4
5
6  clear what type of analysis is going to be applied to 
7  the allegation. 
8
9  actually exaggerates the determinativeness of the 
10
11 
12 
13
 The Seventh Circuit itself has recognized --
14  the judges in the Seventh Circuit itself have recognized 
that the rule does not really well fit the realities of 
15
16  the workplace.  It also just moves uncertainty from one 
17  category to another. 
 The category of supervisor may be a little 
18
19  bit tidier; but, under the Seventh Circuit's approach, 
20
21
22  Doe v. Oberweis Dairy, recognized that once you move 
23  people who can take -- have this kind of power over 
24  their victims but can't actually take tangible employment 
25

actions against them into the category of co-workers, 

the category of co-worker is very unpredictable. 

 The Seventh Circuit itself, in 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 So for those categories -- this exact 
category of employee, Your Honor, the employee --

The Seventh Second -- Seventh Circuit rule, 
in the overall, is no more determinative than the Second 
Circuit rule. 

1  all of a sudden you have to apply a sliding scale of 
2  negligence.  Not only that, but the jury is the one who 
3  applies it. 
4
5
6  employer going forward has very little idea of 
7  whether -- what standard of care is that a particular 
8  jury would apply in that case and whether the jury would 
9  decide it is met or not. 
10
11 
12 
13
 Also, Respondent points to no cases in the 
14  Second Circuit or the other circuits that have adopted 
15
16  application.  And that --
17
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, could you explain 
18  what the materially augments rule means?  Could you 
19  provide a definition of that?  The authority to assign 
20
21
22  enable the harasser to instill either fear in the victim 
23  that the victim should not turn the harasser in, or that 
24  it may have to do with the harasser's ability to control 
25

daily tasks has to be sufficient to do what? 

 MR. ORTIZ:  It has to be sufficient to 

this rule where courts have identified problems with its 

the physical location of the victim.  That can augment

would apply in that situation. 

 But there are also a lot of situations, like 

1  harassment. 
2
 If an harasser can steer a victim to a 
3  location where the harasser has an opportunity to 
4  harass, and, indeed, may have an opportunity to harass 
without other employees or other people in the company 
5
6  seeing in, that would materially augment --
7
 JUSTICE ALITO:  There are situations where 
8  the -- the assignment of responsibilities is extremely 
9  unpleasant, and so it's easy to see how the testimony 
10
11
12  the Chief Justice's example, where it's really very 
13  unclear.  I don't know how courts are going to -- how 
14  courts can grapple with that. 
15
16
17  subjected to country music or hard rock or Wagner -- you 
18  know, every single day in the workplace would not be 
19  sufficient.  I don't know.  Some people might think that 
20
21
 MR. ORTIZ:  Justice Alito, this part of the 
22  standard, particularly the materiality requirement, is 
23  meant to track this Court's standard in Burlington 
24  Northern, where it said that only actions that are

15
16
17  tried to bring those things up before the Seventh 
18  Circuit, but the Seventh Circuit found it unnecessary to 
19  reach them because of its holding as to supervisory

22  Circuit's affirmance of summary judgment of the district 
23  court, the case would then be remanded to the Seventh

2  to the district court for another look. 
 The district court's reasoning, the Seventh 
3
4  Circuit noted, when it was talking about other incidents 
of harassment was very unusual.  What the district court 
5
6  did was it divided all of the incidents into two 
7  categories. 
 One category -- one category consisted of 
8

nature and the other category consisted of those events 
that were overtly racial in nature, where a racial 
epithet had been hurled at someone, for example, and 
said with respect to the first category, the things --
the events that on their face did not announce racial 
animosity, that there wasn't any racial nexus, so they 
didn't count, and swept all those events out and then 
looked at the remaining ones where the connection to 
racial animus was overt.  And it said, well, these, 
there may be some, but they just don't count. 

So the Seventh Circuit itself discredited 

the reasoning of the district court in those very 
holdings.

So as against that approach, what is your

1  exercising supervisory authority over Vance is there in 
2  this record? 
3
4  separate questions, Justice Ginsburg.  One is instances 
of it; others is whether she has the authority or not. 
5
6  Because this Court has held in Faragher itself that it 
7  is the authority that makes the difference, not the 
8  actual exercising of it in a particular case. 
9

11  all, because we were not aware that we would be opposing 
12  a summary judgment motion before this Court. 
13
 First, William Kimes, who is the director of 
14  the university banquet and catering division, the sort of 
15
16  testified that he told them that Davis was a supervisor. 
17  One of them was Vance; that could be found on page 198

15
16
 MR. ORTIZ:  No, Your Honor.  There is two 
17  separate provisions in the job description which cover 
18  the whole period of time here.  The harassment started 
19  around September 2005, went in through August -- went to 
August 2007 with one incident, March 1st, I believe it 
20
21  was, 2008.  On January 1st, 2007, Ms. Vance received a 
22  promotion from part-time to full-time. 
 Page 13 on the Joint Appendix has this item 
23
24  that you pointed to, Justice, which specifically lists 
among the duties and responsibilities of the catering

she is a full-time employee there isn't that.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What was the most unpleasant 

thing that Davis could have assigned the Petitioner to 

1  specialist leading and directing part-time employees. 
2  However, page 12 of the Joint Appendix lists under 
3  positions supervised by the catering specialist, exactly 
4  Vance's position.  So when she moved from full-time --
sorry, from part-time to full-time on -- in January 
5
6  2007, the supervisory nexus in the job description 
7  merely jumped from page 13 to page 12.  But it was

12
 MR. ORTIZ:  Certainly within the -- within 
13  the job duties that she traditionally did, the kind of 
14  things she had to work with, what she had to do, things 
like this, working with onions, chopping onions all day 
15
16  might be punishment.  Unfortunately again, though, the 
17  record wasn't developed under an understanding that all 
18  of this would be relevant. 
19
20
 MR. ORTIZ:  Yes, Your Honor.

7  have it says that the work assignments, what Vance was 
8  doing, came from the chef or from Kimes, and the most 
9  that Davis did was transmit the chef's orders of where

12
 MR. SRINIVASAN:  The Seventh Circuit would 
13  say that as far as we can tell.  They don't appear to 
14  have a proviso for circumstances in which the harasser 
has a role in determining tangible employment actions, 
15
16  because that is one thing that the EEOC guidance takes 
17  account of. 
 It's that -- not just that somebody counts 
18
19  as a supervisor when they themselves undertake tangible 
employment action, but if they have a substantial role 
20
21  in making recommendations that in turn trigger tangible 
22  employment actions, the EEOC would take the position 
23  that that qualifies.  Now, that's not an issue in this

the following sense:  That relaying instructions that 
are -- that are disseminated by one person wouldn't 
count for those purposes.  That's in the EEOC guidance. 
And -- and it's the functions of a job that actually

question, Justice Sotomayor, is whether the parties had 
a sufficient opportunity to develop the record.  Because 
if you take the record in the case as a given, we think 
that the record would support the grant of summary 
judgment for Ball State University, because there isn't 
a sufficient showing in the record if you take it as a 
given that the relevant supervisory -- the relevant 
putative supervisory employee, Davis, had control over 
day-to-day work activities. 

The question that remains is whether the 

record should be allowed to be expanded.

normal course what this Court does when it announces a

which authority is used to make it more difficult for a

22  bad.  But the statute doesn't say that.  It says apply

4  Section 219(2)(d) of the Restatement (Second) of Agency, 
the notion that if -- if there was -- if the employee 
5

MR. GARRE:  This is the balance I think that 
5
6  the Court struck in Ellerth, Your Honor, which was -- it 
7  took into account that the statute was passed against 
8  the backdrop of agency principles; but, yet, Congress 
9  also was cognizant that imposing vicarious liability on 
the employer for acts that the Court recognized were not 
10
11 
themselves authorized by the employer, that that was a 
punitive aspect of that, and the Court would establish 
12 
13 
limits. 
14
15
16  of vicarious liability, in order to give effect to 
17  Congress's intent; but, also recognizes, in the

2  And the best way to make clear that there are limits is 
3  to make clear that on the record in this case Ms. Davis 
4  did not qualify as a supervisor. 
Now, my friend said they didn't have the

7  the fact is, from the outset, they litigated this case

3  the Court would make clear that merely having some 
4  occasional or marginal authority to lead or direct by 
virtue of one's better paper title or seniority is not 
5
6  sufficient to trigger vicarious liability.  I think 
7  that's going to resolve the mine-run of the cases in

9  least to the courts of appeals.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why should that --

23  why should that matter?  I know you said that in your

25

If you look, for example, at the difference 
between something like the Mack case out of the Second 
Circuit and the Mikels case out of the Fourth Circuit, 
in Mikels, we had an example of two police officers, one 
had a higher paper rank, corporal versus private, and it 
was alleged that the corporal was a supervisor.  And the 
court said, no, no, no, he's not a supervisor, all there 
is, is some marginal occasional authority.  That's not 
sufficient. 

 It was clear that the victim in that case 
wasn't shy about telling the harasser where to go, to 

back. 

42
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

MR. GARRE:  Right.  And we -- we don't think 

but, she was very firm, and she talked back to him. 
 But, still, that's not what we said that 

 But in one of the very first cases that we 
1
2  had in this line, Harris v. Forklift, there was -- it 
3  was the boss, so there was no question about supervisor, 
4  and he was really making things hard for this employee; 
5
6
7  counted.  We said, is she being subjected to terms and 
8  conditions of employment that she would not be subjected 
9  to but for her sex. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 In essence, did the person treat the alleged 
17  harasser like a co-employee, or did the person treat the 
18  alleged harasser like a supervisor?  And in this case, 
19  the record is clear that she treated her like a 
co-employee, someone who -- they obviously had 
20
21  disagreements among them. 
22
23  of evidence to assist the Court on the question 
24  presented.  I think -- but we think what was sufficient 
25

that that's a dispositive criterion.  We recognize the 
point that the person gets to establish superior ability 
to stand up to despicable treatment.  But I think what 
our point is, is that it's part of the equation that you 
would look at. 

 And I think that's what we take this piece 

to resolve the question presented is the clear and

12  it's a close case, but my friend does, and his amici do. 
13  And I think the damaging signal that this Court would 
14  send by remanding on this record would be that, whatever 
it might say in its opinion, that would have virtually 
15
16  no force in terms of establishing a standard that made 
17  clear that this -- whatever else may be true about what 
18  would qualify, something like this does not qualify.

 So the mere fact that you've got some 
marginal evidence drawn from snippets, giving it a

2  Mr. Kimes who had the authority to make those 
3  assignments, not Ms. Davis. 
4
5
6  reasonable inference that she at times had some ability 
7  to lead or direct, as the job description says, "by 
8  coaching, demonstration or overseeing," is not 
9  sufficient as a matter of law to entitle her to summary 
judgment, nor do we think that this Court should take 
10
11  the unusual step of remanding so that she can dig into 
12  events six years old through new discovery. 
13
14
15
16  to suggest that she left anything on the table because 
17  of the nature of the Seventh Circuit standard. 
 So what's the best place in the record for 
18
19  us to look -- to decide that question as to whether she 
at all didn't present or didn't develop evidence because 
20
21  of the nature of the Seventh Circuit standard? 
 MR. GARRE:  Well, first, I would look at her 
22
23  summary judgment briefs, Your Honor, and in those briefs 
24  she argued that Davis was a supervisor because, one, 
25

under the job description she had the authority to lead

under the Seventh Circuit test. 

1  and direct, the same sorts of things that we are talking 
2  now and would be talking about under the EEOC and Second 
3  Circuit tests.  And, two, she points to the fact that 
4  they didn't clock in, again something that is irrelevant 
5
6
 So this wasn't a case where the litigant 
7  felt themselves bound by the legal standard and one 
8  could surmise that they would have pursued it 
9  differently.  I think I would look at that first.  And 
then I would look at her deposition transcript which is 
10
11 
in the Joint Appendix and the three affidavits that she 
put in, in this case, which are in the Joint Appendix. 
12 
13
 At some point you would expect her to come 
14  along and try to rebut the notion that Mr. Kimes and 
Ms. Fultz assigned the daily activities through the prep 
15
16  sheets.  In fact, it's just the contrary.  If anything, 
17  in her own affidavit she seems to accept that the prep 
18  sheets were done by Kimes and the chef.  That's at JA 
19  430.  You -- you would expect her to contest the notion 
that Mr. Kimes was the one who did the scheduling, who 
20
21  did her annual reviews, who disciplined her on occasion. 
22  After all, she was claiming that Davis was the 
23  supervisor, and she didn't feel bound by the Seventh 
24  Circuit tests. 
25

So you would expect to see some indication 

48
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Those allegations were made.  They were directed 

1  of how Ms. Davis actually assigned her something to do, 
2  changed her schedule, the like.  Instead what you find 
3  is all those sorts of allegations, she made them, but 
4  all those sorts of allegations were directed to Mr. 
Kimes.  That was the basis for her retaliation claim, 
5
6  which isn't before the Court.  But there are all the 
7  sorts of things that you might expect one to complain 
8  about against a supervisor in this sort of vein:  She 
9  made me cut vegetables instead of doing the baking like 
I like to do; she didn't assign me enough overtime so I 
10
11  could make more money; she changed my hours. 
12
13  at Mr. Kimes and that's perfectly consistent with the 
14  record evidence.  There was Kimes and the chef who had 
the authority to do her daily activities, and Kimes had 
15
16  the authority to do the schedule. 
17
18  I don't think, and just speculate that having an 
19  opportunity to go through greater discovery, which in 
essence would amount to a fishing expedition, the Court 
20
21  should take the unusual step of remanding to give her an 
22  opportunity for discovery.  This Court -- although we 
23  acknowledge oftentimes this Court does remand for the 
24  lower courts to undertake that inquiry, it certainly 
doesn't always do so.  So Global-Tech is one example;

 Although it's not before this Court, if one 

1  we've cited many more in our briefs. 
2
3  there is broad agreement on what the standard should be. 
4  Something like the EEOC or Second Circuit test is, we 
think, the best way to frame it.  But given the debate 
5
6  among the parties about what that test means and how it 
7  applies to Davis here, I think it's absolutely critical 
8  for the Court to apply the legal test to the record 
9  facts and hold that Ms. Davis is not a supervisor and to 
10
11
12  wants to go to the next step and think about the 
13  affirmative defenses and the like, this isn't a case 
14  where the Court would be putting to rest a valid Title 
15
16
17  below by Judge Barker in the district court, Judge Wood 
18  and her colleagues on the court of appeal, and they 
19  found an environment in which Ball State reacted

22  investigation warranted it, particularly with respect to

4  so-called elevator incident where Ms. Davis allegedly 
5

beyond doubt that all that authority was possessed by 
others, Ms. -- the chef and Mr. Kimes. 

1  Ms. Davis just lacked the authority that would have been 
2  sufficient to trigger vicarious liability.  And again we 
3  think the paradigm case where that authority is present 
4  is something like the lifeguard in Silverman where they

8
9  authority that was possessed, and the record makes clear 
10

12
13  clear, this is consistent with workplaces across America 
14  today, where jobs are less hierarchical, more 
collaborative, and so where you have got more senior

17  just a paper title, are in a broad sense team leaders of 
18  the like in the workplace.

 MR. ORTIZ:  Well, Justice Kennedy, that in 
7  fact is one thing the Seventh Circuit has tried to do, 
8  but it dispels any kind of certainty and predictability 
9  in the rule, because the duty of care of course would be 
10
11 
12
13  under the clear import of the job description here by 
14  saying directing and leading somehow don't count because 
that is accomplished through oversight.  Oversight, 
15
16  however, is a common synonym for supervision itself. 
17  It's merely a dog chasing its own tail. 
18
19  things that Ms. Vance referred to, the particular 
20
21  course, is that related to the retaliation part of her 
22  claim, which is not before this Court.

clear that was even something that Silverman had 

 It is not clear -- the allegation of the 
complainant was that he said that, not that Silverman 

1  didn't mention it.  This Court in its Faragher opinion 
2  mentioned only that it was an allegation in the 
3  complaint.

6  actually had that authority.  And it was clear from the 
7  case that he actually wasn't interested in even dating 
8  Faragher, it was just a way of humiliating her in the 
9  workplace.  So just as Faragher's expressed, it was not 
10
11  authority to do. 
12
 And finally, if this Court is worried about 
13  sending signals, think about what kind of signal it will 
14  be sending to litigants in the future if it were to 
affirm, simply affirm here.  In the future, whenever 
15
16  anyone is thinking that they may want to challenge a 
17  rule, no matter how well-settled it is in a particular 
18  circuit, they would have an incentive to, through 
19  discovery, to produce information that might be relevant
