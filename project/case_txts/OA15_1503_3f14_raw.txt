CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first this morning in Case 15-1503, Turner v. United 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States, and the consolidated case, 15-504, Overton v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United States. 

 

            

Mr. Williams. 

 

            

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN S. WILLIAMS 

 

 

 

 

 

      

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 15-1503 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WILLIAMS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and may it please the Court: 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In Brady v. Maryland, this Court established 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the now familiar principle that the prosecution must 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disclose to the defense all favorable and material 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information.  This case involves a clear violation of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that principle.  Here the prosecution suppressed 

  

 

 

 

 

information that a serial assaulter of women had been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

seen acting suspiciously at the crime scene before 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

police arrived.  The prosecution further suppressed that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

this man's girlfriend was in the alley at the time, yet 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he did not speak to her and she did not speak to him. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If this information had been available to Petitioners at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial, they would have presented an alternative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perpetrator's theory that centered on this incredibly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violent individual.

They would have told the jury that during 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

October 1984, in this neighborhood, this man committed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similar assaults against similar victims.  They would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have then posited to the jury that the same person who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had accosted a D.C. councilwoman in an alley and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

attacked her --

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counselor? 

  

 

MR. WILLIAMS:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  At the trial, the 

  

 

 

 

 

witness, Mr. Freeman, indicated that there were two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people acting suspiciously.  He raised an objection that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those names had not been disclosed.  The prosecutor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

explained his reasons for not disclosing the names, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense counsel chose to say, I'll get them on the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'll call the witness and get the names myself, and then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he dropped the ball. 

 

 

 

            

What also occurred was that these -- this --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this name was given to him as a -- was given to him and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all defense counsel as a possibility within the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

materials that were disclosed, that Mr. McMillan had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been on the scene and no follow-up was done. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

How can we say that it was undisclosed or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not made available in light of those record facts? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WILLIAMS:  Sure.  So let me begin with 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

what the prosecutor said during that colloquy, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

at page 63 of the Joint Appendix.  The prosecutor said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

that his view was that this was not Brady, so he made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the statement that this was not Brady information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that he had adhered to his Brady obligations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This Court made clear in Banks v. Dretke 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that a rule that the prosecutor may hide and the defense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

must seek is untenable under Brady.  That's essentially 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what happened here.  In so doing, Justice Sotomayor, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor went further and he made statements that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps not deliberately, in fact, still did mislead the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense counsel about the probative value of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information, because he said first that Mr. McMillan had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no association with the garage.  That's not true.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the all -- and the information suggests that it wasn't. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then further, he said that Mr. McMillan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was only at the scene approximately 90 minutes after the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime occurred.  And, of course, the prosecution was the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only entity in that colloquy that was aware of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information that this crime may have happened only 30 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minutes after the crime occurred.  The way we view this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence, Your Honor, is that really, the alternative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perpetrator theory depends on five pieces of suppressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information.  That's --

  

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But was the -- was the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

name disclosed during the trial?

MR. WILLIAMS:  It -- I don't think it was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

ever disclosed during the trial, Justice Ginsburg.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was only disclosed in the form of the statement of James 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Michael Campbell, whose trial was severed and then --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then he -- he pleaded guilty later. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

James Michael Campbell gave a statement that 

   

 

 

 

 

the prosecutor in this case has later described as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most farfetched.  I believe one of the detectives used a 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more colloquial phrase that I shouldn't repeat at the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court to describe the statement.  It involved people 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that nobody else put in the crime scene which, by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way, includes Mr. McMillan.  Nobody else, no witness, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

put him in the crime scene.  And people doing things 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with golf clubs.  Nobody else described a golf club. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Involving a gun.  Nobody else described a gun.  It was 

   

   

  

  

 

 

 

just fantastical. 

 

            

And so the -- defense counsel had no reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to believe -- and this goes back, Justice Sotomayor, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think your initial point.  Defense counsel had no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason to believe that McMillan had been there acting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alone, that he was there without any members of this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purported group attack, and that's critical. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But would all of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

defendants -- this -- this had what, something like 10 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense counsel? 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MR. WILLIAMS:  Yes. 

  

 

8 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would they all have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

agree to go this route if they had the information, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was turn -- turned over as Brady material?  Some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

might still say I'd rather go with, not me, maybe them, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead of the alternate perpetrator. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WILLIAMS:  Yes -- yes, Justice Ginsburg. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

First, let me say I don't think they would have all had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to do it.  It would be enough if a substantial number 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did it.  But let me further add, I think they all would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have done it.  And the best evidence for that is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Michelle Roberts, who was a leading criminal defense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer in the city at the time and was until very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recently, she also had one of the weakest cases against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her client, a case so weak that the government now says 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is perfectly logical that he was acquitted.  And she 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testified in our postconviction hearing that if she had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been aware of the McMillan information, she would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursued an alternative perpetrator defense. 

 

 

 

 

            

So we think the evidence in this case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests that all of the Petitioners would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

developed this theory and run with it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And if I may add, I think one of the reasons 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

why they would have done that is that it's not that much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a difference from the not-me-maybe-them defense.

Surely, in any criminal case, when you have an eye -- a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purported eyewitness who does not identify your client, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

in closing, any defense counsel will identify that to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, but I -- I --

   

   

  

 

 

 

my greatest difficulty with Mr. McMillan is that clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his '92 crime, which was decades after this crime, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests a similarity that would have been very potent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

at a trial.  But the disclosure of this Brady, of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. McMillan, wouldn't have led to the introduction of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that later-committed crime.  So what we're left with as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an alternative theory is robberies of two women, neither 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of which were in any way identical to this crime.  All 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the defendants had crimes of violence and robberies, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so their criminal activity was just as bad, if not worse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in some cases, than Mr. McMillan, why would he have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a likely source as an alternative perpetrator, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particularly as a sole perpetrator, when he was seen 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

with at least one other person?  He wasn't alone when he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was seen.  He was seen with another man.  There's no 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggestion that the other man was involved. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So how -- how does he become such a potent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative in light of those facts?  He's just like the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants.  He is with another person, so being a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

solo -- a solo perpetrator is not a natural conclusion. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

So how do we get him to be the other person? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, sure.  And to be clear, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

our -- our alternative perpetrator theory is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative one or two perpetrator theory.  We would not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fight the notion, and I don't think defense counsel at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial would have fought the notion that it was McMillan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably with the assistance of his confederate who was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seen in the alley with him. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But let me go back to the foundation of your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, Justice Sotomayor, which is, what 

 

 

 

 

 

differentiates McMillan from other people in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neighborhood and from the -- and from the defendants. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

McMillan's two other assaults of women were incredibly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violent.  Specifically his assault of a D.C. 

   

  

 

 

 

councilwoman which took place in an alley, was so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violent and so ferocious that the victim yelled murder, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that -- and that was why people came to her aid. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

She naturally thought -- and she told this to The 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Washington Post -- she naturally thought that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person wasn't just trying to take her purse, that he was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying to kill her, and that would have been powerful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence that Petitioners could have used at trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They could have put this D.C. councilwoman on the stand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and had her testify to her opinion about what was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happening to her.  Her lay opinion.  That would have

been powerful evidence. 

 

 

11 

            

I'd note, just in regards to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioners' criminal histories, Your Honor, the 

 

 

 

 

 

government never suggested that those criminal histories 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were admissible at trial.  They never suggested that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those crimes bore any resemblance to this crime.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remember, the government's theory was that this was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

group attack.  So individual crimes that individual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

people may have done don't really speak to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's theory. 

 

            

Here we have a very powerful theory based on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

McMillan's own prior crimes. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  The alternative perpetrator 

  

 

 

 

theory does seem completely inconsistent with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defenses that were put on at trial.  I -- I'm not sure 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how you can say that they could have used both. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But in order to convince the jury to accept 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the alternative perpetrator theory, wouldn't it have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been necessary to convince the jury that Alston and Bard 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pled guilty and were sentenced to substantial prison 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentences for crimes that they didn't participate in at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all, and that all of the other witnesses who described 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this group attack, including at least one who doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem to have the -- the 14-year-old boy, who doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seem to have impeachment evidence, were perjuring

themselves on the stand.  That -- that's a pretty 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

substantial burden to overcome, isn't it? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WILLIAMS:  We think that there is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

definitely a reasonable probability that the jury would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

have had reasonable doubt, and that's the -- that's the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standard, whether or not this jury would have had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable doubt and whether or not there was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable probability that it would have had it, even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in light of these purported eyewitnesses. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, we started with Alston and Bennett, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'd like to talk about Thomas.  Now, I'd like to go, if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I may, to the beginning of your question, Justice Alito, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because I think it speaks to the lack of incongruity 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between these two defenses.  I'll -- I'll get to that; I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

promise I will get to that. 

   

 

 

 

            

Let's start with Alston and Bennett.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

best reason that a jury would have to disbelieve Calvin 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alston is that Calvin Alston himself denied 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participating in this crime for months.  He wrote 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

letters to a judge, to a -- to a D.C. commissioner that 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

he had not been involved in this crime and that his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

initial statement was false.  He only pleaded guilty 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

after he, himself, was sexually assaulted in jail and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his motion to suppress was denied. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Harry Bennett received a similar deal.  He

did not go through similarly awful circumstances, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Harry Bennett was facing multiple other charges that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought with them significant jail time.  And he only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pleaded guilty to get rid -- well, to diminish those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other charges.  So a jury would think relatively little 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

about those witnesses.  What --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In a different --

   

  

 

 

different case, not in this case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WILLIAMS:  No.  I think in this case, 

    

  

 

 

 

 

the jury already did think relatively little of those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses.  The jury acquitted two defendants that these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses put in the case. 

 

 

 

 

            

Going to Mr. Thomas, I completely agree, 

   

 

 

 

 

Justice Alito, that Mr. Thomas, unlike the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purported eyewitnesses, does not have an immediately 

 

 

 

 

 

 

obvious reason to lie, no immediately obvious reason to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fabricate testimony.  But his testimony, A, differed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

from every other purported eyewitness; B, changed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dramatically over time; and C, is inconsistent with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

objective crime scene evidence. 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Thomas testifies to one of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petitioners striking Mrs. Fuller and then seven 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petitioners simultaneously attacking her.  If you look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

at the forensic evidence in this case, there's no reason 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to think that she was simultaneously attacked by seven

people.  I would direct you to A1191 in the hard copy 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appendix.  That is a diagram of the injuries to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mrs. Fuller.  Anybody looking at that diagram would not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that a group attack had occurred. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

Let me then return to the beginning of your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question, Justice Alito. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But even so, wouldn't it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

still be difficult to explain how Thomas came up with a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory that would be a complete fabrication.  It's not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

just a -- wouldn't be just a question that he was 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

mistaken about things, or he might have exaggerated or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something like that.  It would be a complete fabrication 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

with no obvious motive.  Wouldn't that be true? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, first, defendants at 

  

 

 

 

 

trial did try to point to a motive, that Mr. Thomas was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a relatively unpopular kid who got him picked on quite a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bit.  But I agree that there is no immediately obvious 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

motive for the fabrication. 

 

 

 

            

What I would add, Justice Alito, is two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

points:  First, Mr. Thomas came to the defendants' --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

came to detectives' attention and the prosecution's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attention very late in the day.  There was a huge amount 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of information available at this -- about this case by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that time.  All of the petitioners had already been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arrested.  So for him to stand up there and tell police, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

oh, it was these seven or eight people, that's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

rocket science.  That's saying what was already 

  

 

 

 

 

 

available in the community. 

 

 

 

            

            

recant? 

            

I'd like to --

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Did Mr. Thomas ever 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. WILLIAMS:  No.  Mr. Thomas has not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

recanted.  Mr. Thomas has not recanted. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

If I may, Justice Alito, I'd like to go back 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the very beginning of your question, because I would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like to explain how we don't think there is that much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference between what -- a lot of what the defense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel tried to do, and also using the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative-perpetrator theory. 

 

            

The one thing that defense counsel did in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their original trial -- which was devastating, by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way -- but that they would not have done in the -- in --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if they had access to the suppressed information, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they would not have actively bolstered the prosecution's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses.  They did that over and over again. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And the lead prosecutor took advantage of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that in his rebuttal closing.  He said -- and I believe 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is at Joint Appendix page 185 -- something to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect of:  Well, look at what these defense counsel 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

told you.  They told you the believable witnesses are

16 

was there. 

 

            

            

That's not a defense. 

   

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why wouldn't that have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

happened anyway?  I mean, even if you had this 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative-perpetrator theory, there's still a lot of 

   

 

 

 

 

defendants with a lot of lawyers with -- seems still a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strong incentive to point at the other folks and say it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was them, it wasn't me. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WILLIAMS:  Justice Kagan, it would not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have been a motive to go so far as to bolster the other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses.  The alternative-perpetrator theory centered 

  

 

 

 

on McMillan would be powerful evidence to say:  Look, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is the story that we think you should consider 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about what happened.  This is the driver of reasonable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt to you, the jury.  Here's an entirely different 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative account of this crime that differs from what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the prosecution is telling you. 

 

 

 

 

            

And they would use that to show, look, not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only is this a reason to disbelieve all of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution's witnesses, but this is also a reason to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

disbelieve the specific witnesses that have identified 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my client.

arguing in the alternative, but other people are not. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

And I -- it's really hard to see how the -- the defense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument could be:  This was -- this crime was committed 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by McMillan and another, and a confederate of his; but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you don't believe that, it was committed by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

group, but I wasn't part of the group. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

it? 

            

That's really hard to -- to do that; isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. WILLIAMS:  Right.  And if I gave the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

impression that that's what they would be arguing, I --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I apologize, because that's not the argument that I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think would be done here. 

 

 

 

 

            

The argument would be McMillan is the most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely alternative perpetrator.  He is the reason that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you should have doubt about this prosecution's case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These witnesses are flawed.  These witnesses had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

motivations to give testimony.  There are reasons to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt them, and McMillan is the obvious reason why they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are all lying. 

 

 

            

But it is still the government's burden to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  And if you look 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

at this government's case, if the government can only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point you to -- for example, the government can only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point you to Carrie Eleby, Harry Bennett, and Calvin 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alston, you should doubt their testimony for the same

reason that you would doubt that this crime committed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way they described it at all, because of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. McMillan's presence in the alley, Mr. McMillan's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suspicious behavior. 

 

18 

            

So that's the way we think that they would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all work together. 

 

 

              

I would also add that the Court should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consider "without evidence" cumulatively.  We not only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have the McMillan information.  We not only have the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statements from Luchie and Watts that indicate that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime may have occurred only 30 minutes before the body 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was found, but we further have information that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undermines the investigation.  And this would have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

further diminished the credibility of the prosecution 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the detectives.  It would have given the jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

further reason to believe that these witnesses were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flawed and they were the result of a flawed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation. 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You have so much to cover, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I don't want to interrupt, but why, if McMillan was the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perpetrator, would he have been hanging around the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scene?  That -- that -- that's really -- concerns me. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Why -- why -- if you commit a murder, you don't hang 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around for an hour. 

 

 

 

            

MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, we think that there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

would be two reasons.  And first, he didn't hang around 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

for an hour.  He was only at the crime scene for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

approximately five minutes according to --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it was -- it was -- it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was 30 to 60 minutes later. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WILLIAMS:  We would say it was most 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely 30 minutes later that he came back in.  We would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that there are two apparent reasons why he would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have come back in.  The first and most likely is, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remember, Mr. McMillan was hiding something under his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jacket.  And the object used to commit the sodomy was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never found.  Defense counsel would have argued to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury that what he was trying to do was come back to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alley and deposit the object used to commit the sodomy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back in the garage. 

 

 

 

            

The other reason he might have returned is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he mistakenly believed that he had left some identifying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information about himself inside that garage, and he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have wanted to remove it. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But the last point, Justice Kennedy -- and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think this is critically important -- if you ask any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal defense lawyer, especially one defending a case 

   

 

 

 

 

 

involving a violent crime, if he's happy with a defense 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

that depends on his client being clever, they will tell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you they are not.  Criminals are not clever.  And this

Court reasoned in Kyles v. Whitley that you should not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minimize the importance of alternative-perpetrator 

 

 

 

 

evidence merely because it would require you to believe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the alternative perpetrator was shrewd and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sophisticated. 

            

Mr. McMillan was not shrewd and 

 

 

 

 

 

sophisticated, and our defense does not depend on it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Instead, our view is that Mr. McMillan was the kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person who would commit this type of crime.  He was an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incredibly violent person.  His crimes at the time, even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 1984, depict incredible violence.  And that the jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have heard about that testimony, would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wondered what he was doing in the alley at that time; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why, if he had an innocent reason for being in the alley 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at that time, did he not speak to his own girlfriend who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was there?  That's peculiar. 

  

 

 

            

The jury would have instead really wondered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why was he there.  And the answer would have been it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't for an innocent purpose; it was for an illicit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose.  It was for a criminal purpose. 

   

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  Could I ask you a 

   

  

  

 

 

 

kind of a picky question that relates to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Watts/Luchie evidence.  Part of the argument there is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that only one or two people could fit in the garage, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I don't see -- why would that be so?  If it's big enough 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

for a car, it's big enough for more than one or two 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people. 

            

MR. WILLIAMS:  So, if it's okay with the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

court after I answer this question, I would like to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

21 

reserve the balance of my time. 

 

 

 

 

 

   

But to answer your 

 

 

 

question if you look at JA30 in that diagram of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime scene you'll see that there is a large amount of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

debris in that garage.  I think it's not impossible that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there could only be -- there could have been more than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one or two people, but the idea that there could be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple people in there committing a crime at that time 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

along with Mrs. Fuller being on the ground, that is what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is unlikely. 

 

            

And I point out that in the post conviction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing the lead prosecutor on the stand agreed with us 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it was highly unlikely that there was a large group 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the garage with the doors closed if the crime was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being committed at 5:30.  Thank you you.

Overton telling the court it would be impossible to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

reach a verdict and returning a conviction only after 

   

   

 

 

 

 

multiple assertions of impasse, and 40 to 50 additional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

votes. 

            

In this incredibly close case the government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not only wrongfully suppressed evidence of two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative perpetrators, but also withheld critical 

 

 

 

 

 

impeachment evidence concerning a key witness against 

   

 

 

 

 

Overton Carrie Eleby.  The case against Overton was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

especially weak and Eleby's testimony played an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

especially important role in that case.  I'd like to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

begin by briefly addressing the weaknesses in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's case here. 

 

 

            

At trial the government presented three key 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses against Overton who placed him in the alley 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during the attack.  The two corroborators, Alston 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Bennett and Carrie Eleby.  All of those witnesses had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

serious credibility problems and their stories diverged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in several significant respects, including among other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things about who was involved and what role they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supposedly played. 

 

            

At the same time, another purported eye 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witness who the government later emphasized as the key 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to its case, affirmatively denied seeing Overton in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alley during the attack even though Overton is

exceptionally tall and witness knew him personally. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Which one was that? 

  

 

 

 

 

MS. RICE:  That was Maurice Thomas.  That is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

not taken together a strong case, and the jury acquitted 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

a defendant, Alphonso Harris, who the two corroborators 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

squarely implicated in the crime confirming that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury had serious questions about their testimony even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without the suppressed evidence.  Indeed even the lead 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutor recognized that Harris's acquittal meant the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury simply was not willing to convict based on all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alston and Bennett alone. 

 

 

 

            

And that leaves Carrie Eleby as the only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additional witness who claimed to have seen Overton 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

participate in the attack as the center of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's case against Overton.  And the government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

wrongfully withheld evidence that Carrie Eleby had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

persuaded another witness to lie to investigators to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

implicate someone in the crime by falsely claiming to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have heard him confess. 

 

 

 

            

That suppressed impeachment evidence is 

 

 

 

 

distinct from any impeachment to which Eleby was subject 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at trial because of what it indicates about her motives. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lying to protect someone is understandable.  But lying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to implicate someone in a horrific crime is malicious. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And Eleby's willingness to encourage someone else to lie

strongly suggests she would have been willing to lie to

doing exactly that before the jury at trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Rice --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did the government give 

  

 

 

 

 

nothing at all to the defense about Eleby or did they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just give a truncated file or was there a separate file 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

they didn't give. 

 

 

            

MS. RICE:  And so the government did turn 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

over Eleby's grand jury testimony and the defense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross-examined her on some inconsistencies between that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony and her testimony at trial.  But the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government didn't turn over this piece of impeachment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence about her having persuaded another witness to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lie in the investigation. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That wasn't redacted, but 

  

 

 

 

 

it was on a separate notepad or something. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS. RICE:  It -- it was in the prosecutors 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notes, yes, and the -- and the prosecutor at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

post-conviction hearing acknowledged that he had this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information, that it's the kind of thing he normally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have brought out probably in the grand jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony, and that it just slipped off his radar.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that information was categorically distinct from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

type of impeachment to which Eleby was subject --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Rice --

  

 

 

 

MS. RICE:  -- at trial. 

  

 

 

 

25 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  The matter of Eleby that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were talking about, this is what the government says 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about that, and I just wondered whether, what your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reaction was to it.  The government responds Eleby was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not fabricating evidence, rather she was creating false 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corroboration for something that was true. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS. RICE:  Two points on that: 

  

 

 

 

 

First there's a substantial question at 

   

 

 

 

least as -- as it was before the jury about whether this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conversation she claimed to have had with Alston which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other witness falsely corroborated to investigators 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually happened.  She was asked about this in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross-examination case, frankly her testimony on this is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite confusing and self-contradictory.  The prosecution 

  

 

 

 

 

later said:  Well we had other confirmation that that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conversation happened, but none of that was before the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury.  That was what the prosecutor himself knew from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having spoken with the witnesses about it.  But what is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

absolutely clear on the record here is that the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witness, Kaye Porter, had absolutely no knowledge of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this supposed conversation.  She had no independent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

basis for knowing any of the facts that she claimed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have heard in that conversation.  It was completely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

false.  Both Kaye Porter and Carrie Eleby acknowledged 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as much to investigators, and the investigators were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

aware of that, and simply, didn't turn it over. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  You're kind Ms. Rice, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would have said creating false corroboration is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fabricating evidence. 

 

            

MS. RICE:  And -- and I would emphatically 

   

  

 

 

 

 

be -- not agree -- agree with that.

integrity of these verdicts.  The evidence of a group 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

attack was strong and was corroborated by multiple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sources who personally witnessed the planning, carrying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out, and culmination of the attack.  The evidence of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

third-party perpetrator that petitioners have now put 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before this Court is weak and speculative.  There is no

hands and put on this evidence that a jury would have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurred that no group attack happened at all.

evidence of the attack consists of six witnesses:  Two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27 

of them all, Alston and Bennett, are participants in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime.  They came before the jury.  They pleaded guilty 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to murder and attempt in manslaughter.  They described 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

their roles in the attack.  They described the roles of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Petitioners.  Their testimony was not one hundred 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

percent in accordance with each other.  I think the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court would be quite surprised if it was.  This was a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fast-moving-chaotic event with mostly teenagers and 

 

 

 

 

 

people in their young 20's, and the fact that memories 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diverge is a sign that they were telling the truth as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they recalled it, not that they were fabricating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence.  The group attack was further supported by the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony of two witnesses, who as -- was described in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

closing by Alphonso Harris's lawyer had no motive to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lie, no skin in the game. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can we go back to your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

first, to the -- the two who confessed and testified for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the prosecution.  They placed two people that the jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquitted in the gang, is that not right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. DREEBEN:  That is correct. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So the -- the jury, at 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

least to that extent, did not believe what these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses said. 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Well -- there -- there are two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

separate questions, Justice Ginsburg:  Whether the jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

believed everything that Alston and Bennett said, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the question of whether they believed it that a group 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 

attack occurred.  Petitioners can only raise any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question about the verdict if they have a viable theory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that no group attack occurred at all.  Their theory is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, it's the guy who was never seen with the victim, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never seen in the garage.  It's McMillan, not a group. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now the question of who was in the group is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a different matter all together and the defendant who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was acquitted Alphonso Harris -- among Harris had a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

variety of things going for him that the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants did not.  He presented five alibi witnesses 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the government was not as successful. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Justice Alito suggested 

  

 

 

 

earlier that a defense counsel might take the position, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's evidence that indicates McMillan was the one who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did it.  But at least my guy didn't, my guy was not part 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of any gang.  So it's not necessary to say this is it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm putting all my marbles on McMillan.  The defense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel could say, "McMillan is the most likely, but in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any event my client wasn't there". 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Sure Justice Ginsburg, the 

  

 

 

 

 

defense counsel can run alternative arguments, but to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the extent that they depend on saying no event happened

and any event if you believe the government's witnesses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

my guy wasn't one of them is weaker, but I don't even 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that's the issue for the Court to decide.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue for the Court to decide is whether the undisclosed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence about McMillan, if it had been disclosed, would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create a reasonable probability that the jury would have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

said no group attack at all, these defendants were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really -- you know, there's a reasonable doubt whether 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

any group attack occurred.  It really was this one guy 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing it. 

 

            

            

And I want to --

   

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Dreeben, it's a hard 

   

  

 

 

 

case about whether it was one or more perpetrators. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

More than likely more than one.  The question is which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ones.  We know they acquit two, the jury, and on two of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them they deliberate longer, and they, I believe, report 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

not being able to reach a verdict on Overton and Turner. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So something was holding them up with respect to those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two defendants. 

 

            

If that's the case, why would it take very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

little to say that at least with those two defendants, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of the cumulative effect of the withheld evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonably could have made a difference? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Sotomayor, let me 

  

 

 

 

 

start first with what actually happened in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

30 

deliberations because you can't understand what's going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on with Turner, Chris Turner and Overton, unless you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand that the jury deliberated carefully, 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted six defendants and acquitted two defendants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after going through an elaborate process of considering 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the evidence in a six-week trial, sending out a variety 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

of notes that all required consideration of evidence and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

culminating in a request to see Yarborough's videotaped 

   

 

 

 

 

 

statement, which he gave early on in the investigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in which he describes the group attack as a pincer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

movement with two groups of people moving out of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

park, surrounding the alley, 8th Street and 9th Street, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and commencing the attack.  So by the time that the jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had convicted after watching the Overton -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Yarborough video again, they had concluded that a group 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

attack occurred.  They had found evidence sufficient to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

convict beyond a reasonable doubt on six of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants.  Two of them, Lisa Ruffin, Monk Harris, they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said there's not enough evidence to tie them in.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think the evidence against Lisa Ruffin was particularly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attenuated, and the evidence against Alphonso Harris was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just different as we describe in our brief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So by the time the jury is deliberating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about Overton and Chris Turner, they've already decided 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beyond a reasonable doubt that a group attack exists.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Dreeben, of course 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's right because that was the only theory in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  And the question is, what would have happened if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the prosecutors had given over this evidence such that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an alternative theory of the case could have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposed? 

              

I mean, one of the things that you get when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you read these briefs and when you read the transcripts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, this was kind of guaranteed to be bad for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants in the sense that, without any alternative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory, it was -- it was a circular firing squad, and it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was, you know, you should believe the guy who doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incriminate me, but of course you should believe him as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to everybody else.  And all ten of these people saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this, it created the worst of all possible worlds for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defendants.  And I think what they are saying now is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as compared to that, of course we would have run with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this alternative theory and it would have been an -- a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely different trial. 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  So, Justice Kagan, it's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

actually accurate that they had no alternative theory. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rouse, who was the -- the defendant who committed the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

culminating act and has four separate people testifying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he did it, ran the most obvious alternative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perpetrator defense, the one that was readily available

to all of the Petitioners.  Alston and Bennett are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting up on the stand and saying, I participated in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

this attack, so did all these other people.  That's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

classic defense strategy is to say, they've admitted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their guilt.  Now they're trying to spread the blame in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order to diminish their culpability.  And Rouse's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

counsel got up at closing argument and said, the way the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime unfolded is that Harry Bennett, Calvin Alston, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gerald Merkerson did this on their own.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thrown my -- throwing my client in in order to mitigate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their own culpability.  So they had the most obvious 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative perpetrator defense. 

 

 

            

What they're now talking about is one that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would require the jury to disbelieve Melvin Montgomery 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about the way that the attack originated in the park; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maurice Thomas, a 14-year-old which they admit today had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

no reason to lie about what he saw.  One of the defense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel described him as walking by, looking in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alley and seeing the beginning of a murder in progress. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Counsel stated today that Maurice Thomas 

 

 

 

 

 

changed his testimony from the grand jury to trial about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where he stood.  That is not true.  If you look at the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record, he always described the group that was attacking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the victim who he did not know until he heard her call 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out, help, somebody help me, when the Petitioners

attacked her. 

 

33 

            

There was a group standing behind it in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

alley further back who he could not see, and this is one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the reasons why I think, to return to Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Sotomayor's question about Overton and Chris Turner, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chris Turner is not making any individualized argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here at all.  He -- for him, it's alternative 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perpetrator McMillan or nothing. 

 

 

 

            

Now, Overton is making a separate argument 

   

 

 

 

 

that I wouldn't have been convicted because Maurice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Thomas who knows me didn't see me in the alley, and I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6-6, and he surely would have seen me. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But what Maurice Thomas is describing as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7th grader walking by an alley and seeing seven people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

begin to beat on someone who's screaming for help, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, I looked at it, my attention was drawn.  His 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

credibility, I think, is enhanced by the fact that he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says I identified four of them positively.  Three of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

them, Chris Turner, Smith, Hollywood, and Derrick, Harry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bennett, I think that was them but I'm not sure.  He 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stuck to that testimony throughout.  He didn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

embellish.  He didn't enhance.  He described what he 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

saw.  And he was there for only a short period of time, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so naturally, he was not able to recognize everybody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that possibly was on the scene.

So I think, Justice Kagan, what you have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

34 

here is a case where yes, the defendants did point the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

finger at each other.  They really had no choice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Yarborough has a videotaped confession that's going to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

come in in which he tries to distance himself from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

events that occur in the alley, but he describes the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same unfolding of the attack that Alston and Bennett and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montgomery described. 

 

            

They're standing in the park.  They're 

  

 

 

 

 

singing the Chuck Brown song.  Catlett is singing it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Steve Webb is banging out the beat.  They're talking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about getting paid, which is a euphemism for robbery. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Someone points across the street.  Alston testifies it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

him.  Montgomery isn't able to say who it was.  Says 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's go get that one. 

 

 

 

 

            

Montgomery, who, by the way, is -- is kind 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of connected to Overton because Overton is the godparent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of his daughter.  Montgomery testifies, I saw Overton 

   

  

 

 

 

 

point across the street, and I looked in the direction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he was pointing and I saw a woman there.  He 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't say -- he doesn't exaggerate and say I know who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Overton was pointing at, but he describes what happens. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Then he described Overton and Catlett leaving towards 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the 9th Street side of the alley, while Rouse and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Charles Turner, Fella, leave towards the 8th Street side

of the alley.  That is entirely consistent with the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35 

testimony about the way that the crime unfolded of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alston and Bennett.  So I think for Overton to say that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's no other evidence besides Carrie Eleby, against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whom the incremental impeachment was not significant, is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong.  There's Melvin Montgomery describing how he's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there in the park. 

 

 

 

            

Now, Overton also offered an alibi that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely discredited at trial.  He testified that a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

woman named Maria Michaels was with him in the park at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around 2:30, that he got very drunk and he decided to go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

home with her and he went home.  And at home, his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grandmother and his sister saw him.  His grandmother's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

testimony at trial was basically eviscerated by the fact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that she admitted that her daughter had to tell her what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to say.  And Overton's sister did back up the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alibi, but she's a family member, and the testimony that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they offered is directly contradictory to the way that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Montgomery describes Overton's behavior in the park. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Overton also was put in a jail cell with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chris Turner, and the two of them are talking and a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

detective testified about what they are saying.  Chris 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Turner later took the stand and corroborated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, Mr. Dreeben, why did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it take the jury longer? 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think that this is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

36 

a -- this is a six-week trial with ten defendants as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor pointed out.  The evidence was extremely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

compelling against defendants like Rouse and Catlett and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Yarborough.  Even still, the jury did what you wanted a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jury to do.  They asked to see testimony.  They asked 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for clarification on instructions.  They deliberated 

  

 

 

 

 

carefully.  They returned an initial verdict acquitting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

two of them, convicting six of them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we don't know how the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

trial would have shaped up and how the jury would have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reacted if the defendants had put on this alternative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory.  You can say well, it probably would have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failed, but the test is only could a jury believe this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scenario.  Not would they, but could they. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  So the test, Justice Ginsburg, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is whether there is a reasonable probability of a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

different outcome defined as an outcome in which this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's confidence is undermined that the jury would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have convicted.  The Court has made clear in Agurs and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Strickler that it's not "might" have reached a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different verdict; it's not that low of a standard. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's also not a preponderance of the evidence; it's not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that high of a standard. 

   

 

 

            

But if you read Strickler very carefully, I

think this is the best case that really illustrates it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37 

Sure, various pieces of exculpatory evidence, had they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been offered by the defendants, I submit they never 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have offered the McMillan theory, and I'll explain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why.  But had they offered that, you can speculate that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perhaps some juror might have had a reasonable doubt, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

but that is not the same thing as having your confidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

undermined that the jury still would have concluded that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a group attack occurred. 

 

 

 

            

I've talked about four of the witnesses who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saw it.  The two cooperators who pleaded guilty 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

described their own acts.  I've talked about Maurice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Thomas, the seventh-grader who walks by, sees the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beginning of the crime unfolding in the alley.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Overton's counsel said to the jury at closing.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I've talked about Melvin Montgomery, who's in the park, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who describes how this pincer movement unfolded and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and began. 

 

            

The Carrie Eleby, Linda Jacobs, two girls 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who are looking for Smith Hollywood because Carrie Eleby 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is seeing Smith, go into the alley.  They see the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attack.  They describe --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Dreeben, can I ask about 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the facts of this?  And it's a -- it's a similar 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

question on the other side to the one Justice Alito

asked about the garage.  Just when I sort of think of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fact it -- it's 5 o'clock on a Monday, it's on H 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

Street, a busy thoroughfare.  There -- in -- in the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecution's view of this there are 15 or 20 people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

carrying out this pincer movement, as you describe it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There's an alleyway, but it's backed up by houses on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both sides. 

 

            

Why is it that in the end, the government's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses were two people who were charged and were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making a deal with the government and who had reasons to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make a deal with the government, a couple of really 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

drug-addled people and a 14-year-old boy?  I mean, you 

    

   

 

 

 

 

would think that in this community there would be so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many people who would see the kind of attack that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government suggests happened here, and why wasn't that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case? 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  So first of all, Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan, the government looked as hard as it could for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses.  Not all of the buildings that back up on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this alley are residential buildings.  There's a bank. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

It doesn't have windows.  There's brick walls. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

But I think that probably the best 

   

 

 

 

 

explanation of why nobody came forward or saw it or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heard it is community fear.  There was a gang that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

existed in the park at 8th and H Street.  It engaged in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

a fair amount of crime.  If you look at the Petitioners' 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

criminal histories, you'll see that for many of them, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this was not their only robbery in the area.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government worked as hard as it could to try to get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witnesses. 

            

The way that the government actually found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out that a group attack occurred was because a woman 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

anonymously approached a police officer on the night of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the crime and said she he saw Clifton Yarborough 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standing by the alley on 9th Street, turning his head 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back and forth like a lookout.  And the police picked up 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clifton Yarborough and they interviewed him, and you can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see, this is on October 4th. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This is the very first time that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government gets any inkling that this is a group attack 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with a large number of people.  The crime scene doesn't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell you that.  They learn it for the first time from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Clifton Yarborough, who's distancing himself, naturally, 

 

 

 

 

 

and saying I wasn't really part of it.  But he's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

describing the same thing:  We wanted to get paid. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Let's go get that one.  She's got big money. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And then later when he gives his videotaped 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confession, he says the same thing.  Now he's attempting 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to extricate himself, of course, saying he wasn't really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved in any of the violence, but he's describing the

same group attack. 

 

 

40 

            

So I think the community here was basically 

   

 

 

 

 

 

under siege.  This was a crisis.  And witnesses don't 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

come forward necessarily when they may have fear about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it or they just don't want to get involved.  Remember 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maurice Thomas.  He's the seventh-grader.  No motive to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

lie, no skin in the game, no deals with the government. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

His family doesn't really want him involved in this.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes home and he tells his aunt:  I just saw a beating 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the alley. 

 

 

            

She says:  Don't tell anybody else about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

what you saw. 

 

 

            

His family doesn't bring him forward when he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knows that the prosecution is evidence -- seeking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence about the crime. 

 

 

 

            

Eventually, the prosecution has heard that 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a kid named Maurice who knows something about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

this crime.  They're interviewing other members of a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

family and they discover one of the people who lives in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the house is Maurice.  They bring him down; he tells the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same story that he told at trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So it is regrettable, I think, that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

government doesn't have civilian witnesses, but in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal activity, it's frequently the case that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only people who can really tell you what happened are

those who participate.  And so they make deals, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those deals are exposed in cross-examination.  At trial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jury has the chance to develop impressions of their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41 

credibility.  Maybe, if all we had was Alston or Bennett 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alone, this would be a different case, but we have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alston, we have Bennett, we have Montgomery, we have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Maurice Thomas, and the two girls --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is -- was the judge -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

superior court judge who decided the post-trial motions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Brady motion, the same judge as the judge who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presided over --

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  It was not.  Judge Scott 

  

  

 

 

 

 

presided over the trial.  Judge Weisberg provided --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

presided over the postconviction motions.  Judge 

  

 

 

 

 

Weisberg listened to all the evidence.  He reviewed it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in detail, the recantations, the allegations of police 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse.  He heard from the detectives.  He heard from 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Yarborough.  He heard from Alston and Bennett, and he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concluded that Alston and Bennett's current recantations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are nothing short of preposterous. 

 

 

 

 

            

He examined carefully the way that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence that they are currently saying matched against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the evidence that they gave in the videotapes, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

videotapes are in the record. 

 

 

 

 

            

And I would urge the Court to look at the

videotape of Alston's statement to the police in late 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

November.  Look at the videotape of Bennett's statement 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the police in February.  Bennett, when he's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

describing this crime and he gets to the culminating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

act, breaks down.  He can't even talk about it.  Alston 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

similarly has an emotional reaction to it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

They do not think that they are implicating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves in the crime by describing the way that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unfolded and that it culminated in the alley, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are not admitting what they actually did.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eventually realize that, in the face of evidence that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be overwhelmingly likely to result in a conviction 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and a very long sentence, it was in their interest to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cooperate. 

            

Defendants are perfectly able to, and they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did, cross-examine at length to attempt to show that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these motives to lie resulted in false testimony.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what they had incredible difficulty in doing is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explaining why is it that all these people are telling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stories from their own perspective of a group attack if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it didn't happen, and that's what they would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confronted with if they tried to say it's this McMillan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guy.  He ran into the alley later. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

He has two snatch-and-grab purse snatchings. 

 

 

 

 

 

These crimes were nothing like the murder of Mrs. Fuller 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

that occurred in the garage.  Yes, he hit people, but 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

they are a light years' different from the crime that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually occurred.  They are so different, that if the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government had attempted to introduce those criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convictions as 404(b) evidence, we would have been shut 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

down. 

            

They would come in only as propensity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence under a very generous interpretation of 

   

 

 

 

 

third-party perpetrator defense in a case called 

   

 

 

 

 

Winfield by the D.C. Court of Appeals that lay a decade 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the future.  At the time of trial, there was no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason to think that those criminal convictions even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have come into evidence. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  What about the attack that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Williams described?  The McMillan's attack on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

council woman. 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  I mean, she certainly 

    

  

 

 

 

was terrified, as I would be too, if somebody came up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and hit me in the face and grabbed, you know, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefcase and ran off with it.  But they were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

snatch-and-grab purse snatchings.  They did involve 

  

 

 

 

 

violence, but they didn't involve somebody sticking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around to beat somebody the way that Mrs. Fuller was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beaten.  Mrs. Fuller ended up --

did not know this, but in the end McMillan commits a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44 

crime very much like this. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think the crime 

   

  

 

 

 

actually quite different.  Yes, there are some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

similarities.  It's the neighborhood.  He does drag 

  

  

 

 

 

 

somebody into the alley.  But that crime, unlike this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one which involved an act with a pole, that crime 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resulted in McMillan being convicted of murder and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sodomy, sodomy defined as a crime involving use of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual organ to commit the act, and he was seen running 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away from the victim pulling up his pants. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So I don't think that -- these are both 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

horrible crimes and horrific acts, but they are very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different in nature.  I mean, what -- what Levy Rouse 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was witnessed doing by four different people to Mrs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fuller is more accurately described as torture.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore, I don't think that the Court should reach the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclusion that because McMillan's crime was somehow a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

signature crime, he actually is the one, even if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence at the time wouldn't show that.  Even the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense expert at the postconviction hearing conceded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that these were not signature crimes. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So what you really have here is speculative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence that could have been deployed by a defendant. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

I doubt it would have been deployed by a defendant

because they had such an obvious small-group theory of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

the crime, Alston and Bennett; and only one of them 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argued it and that was Rouse. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And you can see why Rouse would do it.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had four eyewitnesses putting him right there in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scene committing the act.  What else is he supposed to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do?  He also got on the stand and testified to an alibi 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that directly contradicted Charles Turner's alibi. 

 

 

 

 

 

Rouse has him being with Turner at a time when Turner 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says he's not with Rouse. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why does Michelle Roberts, 

  

 

 

 

 

who has a client who the evidence is quite weak against, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say that she certainly would have run with this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence.  And she's -- you know, when you read some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aspects of this transcript again, you see that although 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ten lawyers had ten different sets of interests, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the extent that there is a lead lawyer in this case, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's Michelle Roberts who was the PDS lawyer, who was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

woman of incredible skill and experience, and says she 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly would have gone with this evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, her client was 

  

 

 

 

 

acquitted.  She's not before the Court as a petitioner, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

and I agree with you that Michelle Roberts is a superb 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawyer and perhaps she would have tried to deploy it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but it would have been a very difficult sell to the rest

of the defendants, and I think that the -- the defense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have had considerably less force than the even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

very diminished force I think it would have had any way. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If somebody like Yarborough is not going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

along with, how is Yarborough supposed to say to a jury, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"yes, I -- I said to the police in a videotaped 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

interview that there was a group of people in the park 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I was one of them and then many of the petitioners 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are among them and they left the park in order to follow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a woman saying, let's get paid that one she's got big 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

money".  How is she supposed to do that defense? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

And you -- also would be asking the jury to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say, it's basically this mystery guy.  No one has seen 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her with Mrs. Fuller.  No one has seen her -- seen him 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with any of her property, and to answer Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy's question:  What is he doing back there in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alley?  He lives on the alley on eighth street.  This is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a shortcut to his house.  He's running in from the alley 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on ninth street that what people have referred to as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"cut in the alley" is a North/South route so he takes 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the East/West alley.  He goes up the cut of the alley. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's where he lives.  What was he doing in the alley 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at the time?  I -- I think the prosecutor at trial said: 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All we will ever know.  We don't know.  No one will ever 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know why he was running back and forth there.  But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why was his name not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

given to the defense? 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  At the time Justice Ginsburg 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the policy of the Department of Justice was that we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

comply with our obligations under Brady.  We complied 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with our obligations understand the rules of discovery, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and if it is not required to disclose information we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will not provide it. 

 

 

 

              

I think that as Justice Sotomayor mentioned 

 

 

 

 

 

this was raised by Michelle Roberts with the court.  She 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said that she would pursue it later.  What she was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interested in determining was that the two guys that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were seen by Freeman in the alley, Freeman being the one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who discovered the body, were not her client.  And she 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

later argued that to the jury cause there was no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence they were her client. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now today, the Department of Justice has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted a different discovery policy that exceeds what's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

required under Brady and this Courts cases interpreting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  That was adopted in the United States Attorneys 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Manual in 2006, and the Department devotes considerable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resources to given guidance, training, and supervision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to prosecutors to go above and beyond Brady and disclose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information that a defendant might wish to use even if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's not.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but if you had --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

you had been asked you would have told the prosecutor at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the time that this is not Brady material, so far as, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

McMillan is concerned?  That's -- that's the advice you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would have given the prosecutor, don't turn it over. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DREEBEN:  Well -- I -- Justice Kennedy, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

I don't know that is the advice that I would have given 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him because, unless the government has a good 

   

 

 

 

 

 

countervailing reason, which it often does, such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

witness safety or concerns about obstruction of justice, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

providing that information to a defendant about the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

crime scene, about the general timeframe, in which it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurred, would be good practice and it's the practice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today. 

            

The question for this Court is whether there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a reasonable probability that the jury would have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reached a different verdict if it had had turned over 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the McMillan evidence and the defendants had presented 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that McMillan evidence to the court.  That is the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal question that occurs both ex ante and ex post.  Ex 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ante is harder for the government to know what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense will do with information and that's why a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generous policy of discovery is good for the finality of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal convictions as well as the fairness of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process.  This Court encouraged it in Kyles v.  Whitley

in 1995.  It specifically said, prosecutor anxious about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

tacking too close to the wind.  We'll turn things over 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in close cases that is the better advice.  That's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department of Justice's advice today, but at the time, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

the prosecutor looking at the tenuous connection of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

McMillan to the crime, the only evidence that we had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were some statements from witnesses which were not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough to prosecute that McMillan was actually involved 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the group attack.  Wasn't enough to prosecute him, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but there was certainly nothing that suggested that he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alone secreted in the garage was somehow engaging in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime that six different witnesses told the jury had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

occurred as a group attack.  And that was what he said 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the judge.  Michelle Roberts could have challenged 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that and asked for a ruling on it.  It wouldn't resolve 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Brady question because the Brady obligation is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecutors, it's not the responsibility of the judge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But the fact that the defendants didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

press forward on that shows that they had very little 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest, I think, in trying to identify a mystery man 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

as the person who had committed this crime alone rather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than taking the government's evidence as it seemed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be, which was a strong case of a group attack, and the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question was:  Which defendants were inculpated in it? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And if the Court has no further questions,

we submit that the Court should affirm.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN S. WILLIAMS 

 

 

 

 

 

                

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

                       

IN NO. 15-1503 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Williams could you 

  

 

 

 

 

list for me the legal errors the court made below? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WILLIAMS:  Absolutely.  There are three 

  

  

 

 

 

principle legal errors that the court made below: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First, it emphasized the reasons why a juror 

   

 

 

 

 

 

might disregard the evidence while ignoring reasons why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the juror might not disregard the suppressed evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think the best place to find that in the courts record 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is Petition Appendix, pages 49A to 45A.  Second, the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court below criticized the evidence here because it goes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the basic structure of how the crime occurred. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's in page 54A.  My --

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry go through 

  

 

 

 

 

that one again. 

 

 

            

MR. WILLIAMS:  Sure.  The court criticized 

  

  

 

 

 

the suppressed evidence because it goes to quote, "the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basic structure of how the crime occurred".  Our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

response is exactly.  And that makes it particularly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

probative.  It shows how this whole case would have been

cast in a different light if Petitioners had -- had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

access to that information.  It would have presented an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative theory.  And third, there is an assumption 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

running through the courts decision below that the jury 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

found the government's witnesses creditable.  Well, 

  

 

 

 

 

that's because the jury only heard half of the evidence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And even then, the jury deliberated for a week before 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

returned any verdict, and it was a split verdict. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Was that -- is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a legal error?  Sounds like a factual error. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, no I think it is a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

legal error, Your Honor, if you look at Parker v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gladden, which is a case from this Court in 1966.  It's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a per curiam opinion.  But this Court held in that case, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the length of jury deliberations suggests that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurors have doubts about the guilt of the accused.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes, we would submit that that is in fact a legal error. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But if you want to consider it an error of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

analysis so be it.  We think those are the three 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle errors in the decision below.  If I may, I'd 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

like to make four quick points before I step down. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First, in answer to your question Justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kagan, there was a civilian witness, it was William 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Freeman, and he was standing at the corner of eighth and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

H all day.  He said that there was no group attack -- he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

did not see any group cross the alley.  He did not hear 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any screams from the alley.  He had no reason to think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

that this group attack had occurred.  That was testimony 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the record from the only civilian witness the only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person who did not have reason to fabricate testimony, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a young inarticulate witness, who was -- who was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being pressured by police to inculcate himself or his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friends. 

            

Second, the government focused a great deal 

   

 

 

 

 

on Mr. Montgomery.  Mr. Montgomery is a perfect example 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of these types of witness.  Mr. Montgomery was a drug 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

dealer, who spoke to police only after being threatened 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with arrest, and then admitted on the stand that he only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

named people already been arrested.  That would weigh on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the mind after jury.  They would think that is -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of that testimony is the reason why he might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fabricate -- fabricate evidence. 

 

 

 

            

Third, the government focused on 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Yarborough's statement.  I would remind the Court 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that the jury was instructed to weigh that evidence with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

caution.  That's at page 859 of the hardcopy appendix, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A859.  And the fact, that after deliberating for seven 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

days the jury asks to look at that information, shows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the prosecution's theory here that there was clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence of guilt against some people isn't true because

they keep on pointing to Mr. Yarborough, but after seven 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53 

days of deliberation the jury wants to look at evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regarding Mr. Yarborough. 

 

 

   

And last thing they do 

 

 

 

 

before they return any verdict. 

 

 

 

 

            

Last, overall, the one thing you did not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hear Mr. Dreeben mention very much was the objective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime scene evidence.  The objective crime scene 

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidence, in addition to the alternative perpetrator 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory would have presented an overwhelmingly powerful 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case of innocence.  It certainly would have been enough 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be a reasonable probability of the jury finding 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable doubt and that's all the information needs to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

establish. 

            

As we pointed out in our brief, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purported eye witnesses got the injuries to the victim 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong.  If you look at page A1191 as I asked you to look 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at before it makes that clear.  They got the location of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the sodomy in the garage, wrong.  The government's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory at trial on that was wrong.  The government has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never sought -- thank you -- let me just finish the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can finish your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer, sure. 

 

            

MR. WILLIAMS:  Yes. The government has never 

  

 

 

 

 

 

sought to explain how it has -- it can correctly explain
