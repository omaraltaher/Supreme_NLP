CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

The Court in this case is presented with an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historic choice.  That choice is between upholding or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

destroying venue protections that Congress provided in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28 U.S.C. 1400(b), and that this Court interpreting that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute declared to exist in its Fourco Glass decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the correct choice, we submit, is to adhere to this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's existing, long-established interpretation of 

 

 

 

 

Section 1400(b) and to reject the new call for a new 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revisionist interpretation that would render Section 

 

 

 

 

 

1400(b) nugatory in this case and in all but the most 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unusual cases. 

 

            

I'd like to open first with some undeniable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points.  In Fourco Glass, this Court made two holdings 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about 1400(b) that control this case.  The first is this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court interpreted Section 1400(b) as a standalone.  It's

the sole and exclusive provision governing venue in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

patent cases and is not to be supplemented with Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1391. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How can that be when in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Brunette we said that 1391 governed aliens, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition of aliens?  So that broad statement we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't have meant. 

 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  What the Court held in Brunette 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was that venue legislation had, since the beginning of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Republic, been extended only to United States 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domestic persons and that the then-existing 1391(d) of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Title 28 was not a venue rule at all, but rather was a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

codification of a principle that dated back to 1789 that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aliens were simply outside the scope of all venued laws. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do we do with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unincorporated associations? 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  What we do 

  

 

 

 

with unincorporated --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Those are -- those are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not defined by 1400. 

 

 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  Well, 1400(b) in Fourco was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

held to apply to all defendants.  That was one ground on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which this Court held in Fourco that 1400(b) was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

standalone, precisely because its predecessor had 

 

 

 

 

 

applied to any person, corporation, or partnership.  And

there was never any practical issue interpreting 1400(b) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as in litigation involving limited partnerships and even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

unincorporated nonperson associations, because the 

 

 

 

 

linchpin of 1400(b) and its predecessor was domicile. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

When you have a venue rule that keys to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

domicile and specifically distinguishes between a 

 

 

 

 

 

domiciliary and a non-domiciliary, then the problems 

   

 

 

 

 

that the Denver and Rio Grande case addressed and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent brings up as hypothetical problems simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't exist. 

 

            

It's noteworthy that in -- in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's brief, they don't cite a single real world 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

example where there was any problem interpreting and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applying Section 1400(b) ever since the Sperry v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

American --

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there --

  

 

 

 

MR. DABNEY:  -- Railroad case. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there any other 

  

 

 

 

 

provision, venue provision in which a venue for a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporation is only the place of incorporation? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  Where venue for a corporation 

   

  

 

 

 

is only the place of incorporation.  I cannot stand 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, Your Honor, and identify -- it could very well be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there is one, and that's a very good reason why 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when Congress amended 1391 in 2011, they put that broad 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

exception language in. 

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, don't you 

  

 

 

 

suppose -- even for diversity purposes, a corporation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

is -- is diverse based on not simply its place of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporation, but its principal place of business. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Principal place of business counts.  It doesn't count 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

under 1400. 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  Well, since 1948, that has been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the general rule that 1391(c) has provided.  1391(c) has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said for 60-odd years that a corporation, regardless of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

its domicile, will be deemed to be resident in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district, that district, that district.  And that has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

been a feature of general venue law since 1948.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

whole point here is that -- that rule was urged upon 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court.  In the Fourco Glass case, the Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered statutory language that was not materially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different in this respect from current 1391 and held 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that 1400(b) when it says the judicial district where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the defendant resides, that means domicile.  That means 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

where --

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Again, whatever it said 

  

 

 

 

 

in Fourco, it was not based on any statute.  It was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on the common law:  Where is the corporation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domiciled? 

            

MR. DABNEY:  Well, I would respectfully

disagree with that.  The word "resides" in the statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a statutory term, and it had a very well-established 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

meaning at the time of the statute's enactment.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court held one of the specific issues in this case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is, did the word "resides" in -- in 1400(b) signal a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change from the word "whereof he is an inhabitant" in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 48 of the 1911 judicial code.  And this Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held those words were synonymous.  It meant domicile, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and there can only be one of those.  There's only --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What do --

  

 

 

 

MR. DABNEY:  -- one domicile. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  What do you think Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

would have to do to reverse our decision in Fourco? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  Well, there are many ways that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it could be done.  And -- and in 2001, the American Law 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Institute proposed that Section 1400(b) be repealed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is there any way Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

could do it without repealing 1400? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is there any change that Congress could make 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to 1391 that would have that effect. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  I could imagine that if instead 

    

 

 

 

 

 

of saying "except as otherwise provided by law," the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute said "notwithstanding any other provision of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law, this would govern."  That would be a way to do 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  But --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  That -- that would do it? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

In other words, your argument in the end rests on that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"except" provision? 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  It rests importantly on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

"except" provision.  The "except" provision makes this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case an easier case than Fourco Glass was because at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time of Fourco Glass, all you had was the general venue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute and the very specific tailored, historic venue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute that had been dating back to 1897.  And so in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that case, the Court used the standard tools of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory construction and said, you know, the specific 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute is not going to be swallowed up and rendered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nugatory by the more general, and it applied the kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasoning that the Radzanower case did.  Radzanower v. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Touche Ross is a very, very analogous case to this. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But now that Congress has specifically 

 

 

 

 

 

provided not that 1391 overrides 1400(b), but that 1391 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yields, is subordinate to other statutes and common law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that provide otherwise for venue, that makes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case just easy to apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But -- but Congress also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said in 1391(c) that it was defining residency for all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue places -- all venue purposes. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  And the prior statute said for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue purposes.  So, yes, the word "all" was added. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

Respondent has not identified any venue purpose that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not covered by the original version of 1391(c) that now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

is covered by 1391(c). 

 

 

 

            

What we never had before 2011 was a statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that subordinated 1391(c) to other venue provisions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And we encourage the Court to read pages 31 and 32 of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's brief, because you don't get up until -- it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't until you get to page 31 that Respondent can even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring itself to address the exception clause, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so clearly fatal to their position.  They talk about all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means all means all means all for the first 30 pages. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And then finally we get to page 30 and 31, and what do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they say?  Well, they say, well, the "except" language. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The "except" language has nothing to do -- this is on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 32 -- the "except" language in Section 1391(a) has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing to do with the definition in 1391(c); quote, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Those definitions do not govern venue," unquote. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Well, that directly contradicts what they 

 

 

 

 

 

say on page 8 of their brief, which states, quote, "The 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new -- Section 1391(c) now governs for all venue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes." 

            

So the plain meaning of "govern" applies to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1391(c) by their own characterization.  They're the ones 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

who are saying that 1391(c) governs venue in this case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is what they say on page 8, and then they try to

do this acrobatic maneuver to escape the exceptions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

clause by saying it doesn't govern.  Well, as we say in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our reply brief, the plain meaning of "govern" means 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that 1391(c) is part of the sections that in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

structure of 1391 is subordinated to the exception 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language. 

            

So the -- the Court doesn't need to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything here except say that Fourco's interpretation of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1400(b), which under Kimble v. Marvel and statutory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedence of this Court, it is as much a part of that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute as the words originally were, that that is part 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the law that everyone agrees provides for a venue 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise than what the Respondent is arguing for. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The Respondent is arguing that 1400(b) 

 

 

 

 

 

should now be given an artificial meaning imported from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1391(c).  That is the exact argument that the Respondent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made in the Fourco case.  The -- the Petitioner in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourco was a -- a West Virginia corporation who was 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

alleged to reside in the Southern District of New York 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it didn't actually reside, because the argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was, it's deemed fictitiously to reside in New York 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under 1391.  And the Court said, in the context of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1400(b), which distinguishes between resident and 

 

 

 

 

 

nonresident defendants, you can't import that synthetic, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fictitious definition of "resides" without destroying

both the text of the statute and completely defeating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its purpose. 

 

11 

            

1400(b) was enacted to restrict where patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases could be filed, and what we've seen in the Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

search that's experiment since 1990 is a very good 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstration of why patent cases need a venue statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

like 1400.  If you don't have a venue statute like 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 1400, you get the kind of litigation experiences 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are set out in the amici briefs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The -- the law professor's brief noted that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a single judge in the United States that has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one-quarter of all patent cases in the United States on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his docket.  This is a situation that cries out for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing more than upholding the venue protection that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress provided and that this Court announced in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourco, and that Congress took a very careful look at in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2011, and decided to --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Dabney, I mean, one 

   

  

 

 

 

 

oddity of this case is -- is usually, when we say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something, when we issue a decision, we can be pretty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

confident that Congress is acting against the backdrop 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of that -- that decision.  But I think that that would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be an odd thing to say in this case, given that for 30 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years the Federal Circuit has been ignoring our decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the law has effectively been otherwise.  And then

the question is, well, what is the backdrop against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which Congress is legislating. 

 

 

 

12 

            

It seems actually that if -- if I were a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

congressman, I'd think that the practical backdrop 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against which I'm legislating is not Fourco; it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead the Federal Circuit's decision in VE Holding, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is the decision that the practice has conformed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to. 

            

MR. DABNEY:  Well, I -- I can tell the Court 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

from someone who does practice that not everyone ever 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acceded to VE Holding.  And I think, if you look at what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually happened in the 2011 act, it seems to me that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 2011, Congress took steps that indicated that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't get the memo, that this Court's decision in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourco Glass was a nullity and that -- and that its 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disregard by lower courts had somehow become the law of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the land. 

 

            

First, VE Holding, the 1990 decision of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal Circuit, had seized upon a prepositional phrase 

   

 

 

 

 

 

in a 1988 version under this chapter.  So if Congress 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was thinking, oh, what I want to do is lock in a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

situation in which an enormous, extreme controversial 

 

 

 

 

 

 

imbalance in Federal patent litigation that goes to a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very small number of victics, it was an odd thing for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress to have repealed the very grab-hold that --

that the Federal Circuit had seized on to justify its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

results. 

            

So I would argue that the legislation that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Congress passed, far from ratifying that holding, very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intentionally abrogated it.  Not only that, in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

September, three months before the 2011 act was passed, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress amended the America Invents Act to provide for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a new restriction on what could be deemed a regular and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established place of business under 1400(b).  Section 

  

 

 

 

 

 

18(c) of the AIA says that an automated teller machine, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an ATM, shall not be deemed a regular and established 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

place of business.  Now, I suppose the Respondent would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

say that that -- that provision was not inserted at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

behest of New York money center banks; that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision was put in at the behest of individuals who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't even form an LLC or a corporation so that they 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would enjoy the protection alone. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, wasn't that statute 

  

 

 

 

 

before the 1400 was enacted? 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. DABNEY:  It was --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean that -- that case. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

MR. DABNEY:  That -- that amendment was done 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in September of 2011 by the same Congress, three months 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before Congress declined to accept the American law --

things; one, you can comment on it or not, but these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amici briefs, and -- they're filled with this thing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about a Texas district which they think has too many 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  What's this got to do with this?  As far as I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

can see, if we're supposed to decide what's good or bad, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maybe you'd lose.  But I -- I don't know whether that's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

good, bad, or indifferent.  Okay?  But is there some 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevance to it? 

 

 

            

And the second thing that I'd like to know 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is you are not a corporation.  So since you are not a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporation, why do we have this case here deciding? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And what are we supposed to do about that?  We don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

normally decide cases because Mr. Smith would like us to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide a case involving a corporation.  He's not a 

   

   

  

 

 

 

corporation, nor are you.  So what do we do? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  Well, let me respond in -- in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two ways.  First of all, from -- from the Petitioner's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point of view, the relevance of litigation behaviors in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States is important evidence of why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 1400(b) was a wise statute that Congress passed 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that it should be upheld.  Not -- not --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, why, when you --

  

 

 

 

 

 

you're complaining about a -- a forum that's friendly to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

infringers.  If you've -- many corporations are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

incorporated in Delaware.  That's also said to be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

friendly forum. 

 

15 

            

MR. DABNEY:  There -- there has never been, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in any other field of law, such a disparity between 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent infringement case filings and other case filings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in other areas of law.  And -- and that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You can go into that if you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want.  As far as that -- might be other people are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interested in that.  But I really feel I need an answer 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to my second question. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. DABNEY:  Can you remind me what that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That is, you're asking us 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to decide where venue is proper for a corporation, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you are not a corporation.  Therefore, on what basis are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we supposed to decide that? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  That -- that's not a correct 

   

  

 

 

 

 

statement of our position.  1400(b) is not restricted to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporate or individual or other defendants --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there a holding that it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

includes you? 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  There's a holding in Fourco 

   

  

 

 

 

that it applies to all defendants, all -- italicized 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all.  Justice Whitaker said all in italics. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Including a person. 

   

  

 

MR. DABNEY:  Including a person.  Including 

   

  

  

 

a partnership, including an unincorporated said

partnership.  The -- the predecessor statute to -- to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1400(b) specifically said partnership. 

 

 

 

            

So this was never a problem for patent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  It was always that all defendants, all types of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

defendants were covered by the statute.  So that has not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been a question that's ever been raised throughout this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, and -- and the beauty of this is Judge Learned 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hand's opinion in the -- in the Sperry case, in 132 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

F.2d., it dealt with the hardest case of all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

TC Heartland is a chartered entity.  It has 

   

  

 

 

 

 

a charter, and you can tell where its principal place of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business is by just looking it up in a public record. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Learned Hand dealt with the hardest of all situations of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what do we do with an unincorporated association that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't an entity.  The Association of American Railroads 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that had no entity status at all, and Judge Learned Hand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that case held -- which had been a rule applied 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

across the board in patent cases without problem -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a nonperson, an association that was a nonperson, we 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

look to the -- the -- we -- we treat the inhabitants as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

being where the principal place of business is located. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But to -- to reiterate, the statute has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

always applied to unincorporated entities, the patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue statute has, and the Respondent has not pointed to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, where does this 

  

 

 

 

 

17 

unincorporated entity reside? 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR. DABNEY:  In Indianapolis, Indiana. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No other place? 

  

 

 

 

MR. DABNEY:  No other place. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what do we look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to, to confirm that?  What -- what --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  The corporate charter of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

company, it so happens to --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no.  What -- what law 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

do we look at to see where an LLC resides? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  Under this Court's precedence, 

  

 

 

 

 

the Court has looked to State law to determine where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residence of a juristic person created by a State is 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

located, and so --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose the State would 

  

 

 

 

 

say we count the principal place of business as well. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  It -- well, some states might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

do that, but the States always require that the domicile 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be in the State. 

 

 

 

 

            

So in this case -- in this case it's a very 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

straightforward case because the -- the -- the public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office, that is, its legal domicile under Indiana law, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is in Indianapolis.  But -- but it is an Indiana -- it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is an Indiana domicile question under any -- under --

under anybody's interpretation. 

 

 

            

So unless there is some fictitious meaning 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given to 1400(b) imported from another place, this is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

easy case.  There's -- there's -- the -- the Petitioner 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has no offices in Delaware, it has no regular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established place of business in Delaware, and there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really not much more to say about that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There's -- there's one other point that I'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like to bring up, and that is that 1400(b) was enacted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

together with a Federal service of process statute found 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

today in 28 U.S. 6 -- U.S.C. 1694.  And it authorizes 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

services of process in patent cases that are commenced 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a district where the defendant is not a resident, but 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

has a regular and established place of business.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

there is another demonstration that, in this context, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"resident" means domicile, and Federal law specifically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides for nationwide service of process on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonresident defendants. 

 

            

So the key point I'd just like to leave you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with is, for more than 100 years, a patent venue has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been a function of the domicile of a defendant, and it

years the practice has been the other way.  I mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

I'm -- I'm -- I was thinking as I was reading the 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

briefs, sometimes we have accidental theme days at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Supreme Court.  So today's accidental theme is:  When 30 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

years of practice goes against you, what happens? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. DABNEY:  I -- I -- I heard Justice 

    

   

   

 

 

Souter say something like that in the KSR case, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, the teaching-suggestion-motivation test has been 

 

 

 

 

 

around so long that, at some point, the mistake becomes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the law.  And -- and this Court has again and again and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again stood up for its authority to declare what the law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is. 

            

On -- on issues of patent law, there's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually a precedent, Andrews v. Hovey that says no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue of patent law is settled until we have settled it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In Dickenson v. Zurko, there's a tremendous 

   

 

 

 

 

administrative law -- body of law that this Court said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal Circuit was wrong in the way it --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, maybe the Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

Circuit was wrong in not following Fourco, but the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is now before us, and you are asking us to say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that venue in a patent infringement case is only where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the entity is incorporated or comparable to that, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have acknowledged that there is no other venue

provision for any other kind of claim that is so limited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

to just the place of incorporation. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  Well, I -- I would -- I would 

   

   

   

  

 

 

respectfully disagree because what 1400(b) does is it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides a different way to define venue for nonresident 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants.  1400(b) isn't restricted just to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

district where the defendant is domiciled.  1400(b) 

  

 

 

 

 

 

provides not the expansive regime that 1391(c) does, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, anyplace where, you know, someone could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutionally summon you into court.  1400(b) says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you have to have a regular and established place of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business and commit an act of infringement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, that's the choice that Congress made. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That is a different venue prescription than what 1391(c) 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides.  And there is very good reasons.  I could sit 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, and -- and as -- as someone who tries patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, I could tell you, there's a reason why patent 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

litigation is -- has characteristics that make it much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more susceptible to the kind of forum shopping that some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the amici have done because the injuries at issue in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent litigations don't grow out of some tangible --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you know, a train wreck or some tangible loss where --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where it tends to bring the litigation to the place of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the injury.

royalty that allegedly is due, and -- and that can be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

marketed and sold and transmitted into a forum.  There's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

all kinds of reasons why 1400(b) is an important law to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforce and uphold. 

 

 

            

If there are no further questions, I'd like 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to reserve the rest of my time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I do, actually. 

   

  

 

 

MR. DABNEY:  Okay. 

  

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Not so fast. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, as long as you have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minute, maybe you could indulge me and trace me through 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this.  With a corporation, I think 1400 says resides, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

where the defendant resides. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. DABNEY:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But then that incorporated 

  

 

 

 

 

Section 48.  And Section 48 said where the defendant is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an inhabitant. 

 

            

            

MR. DABNEY:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And now "inhabitant," how 

  

 

 

 

 

do we know that means where the incorporation is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incorporated or something?  What does that mean in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case of -- how do we know that that -- that that word

"inhabitant" means what you think it means? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

What do you think it means? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. DABNEY:  Because Fourco said that. 

  

 

 

 

 

22 

Fourco said --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And Fourco is going really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

into whether 1391(c) or -- whether they made an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exception, whether they included that, and it says no. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's a very short opinion. 

   

 

 

            

Fourco --

 

            

            

            

            

MR. DABNEY:  1400(b) is the relevant part of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah. 

  

 

MR. DABNEY:  -- is on page 226 --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah. 

  

 

MR. DABNEY:  -- where the Court says, by an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eight-to-one vote, characterizing the change from 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 48, in the middle of the page, quoting the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revisor's notes, words in subsection (b), "where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant resides" were substituted for "of which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant is an inhabitant" because the words 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"inhabitant" and "resident" as respects venue, are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

synonymous. 

            

And then there's this parenthetical, "We 

 

 

 

 

 

pause here to observe that this treatment, and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

express reason for it, seems to negative any intention 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to make corporations suable in patent infringement cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

where they are merely doing business because" --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  It says in respect 

  

  

 

 

 

 

of corporations, it means the state of incorporation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only. 

            

            

MR. DABNEY:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But you are not an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

incorporation, so I'm back to my first question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  The -- the treatment of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

domiciles of -- of chartered entities has, under this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's precedence and under universal practice --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

what case? 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  And so I should look at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

MR. DABNEY:  We cite the Troutwine case as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a -- as an Indiana case --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Okay. 

  

  

 

MR. DABNEY:  -- in our brief as an -- as an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example of that. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I thought you said it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

depended on what -- that the State can define residence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a different way. 

   

 

            

            

            

MR. DABNEY:  Well, States will tell --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  With respect to LLCs. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. DABNEY:  When a State creates a legal 

   

   

  

 

 

person, a juristic, jural entity, the State will 

   

 

 

 

 

 

prescribe where its -- its legal domicile is.  And --

and that is a -- that is a matter of public record.  So 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

it's an easy thing to find out. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Jay. 

 

             

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

If I may, I'd like to offer a different 

   

   

 

 

 

 

theme for today, and that would be definitions rather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than the 30-year point that Justice Kagan posited. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Congress has written a definition of 

   

 

 

 

"residence" that applies for all venue purposes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but I mean --

   

  

 

 

 

 

yes, there's a difference between for venue purposes, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

and for all venue purposes, and for venue under this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chapter, but this is something fairly significant in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

area of patent law.  And I would have thought that if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress were trying to make a significant change, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

there'd be a lot more evidence of it other than just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changing the particular nuances of -- of the words. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  Well, of course, Mr. Chief 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice, it isn't here a change from "for venue 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

purposes" just to "for all venue purposes."  There are, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think, four changes in between the Fourco text and the

text today.  And in between, you had the statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

construed in VE Holdings which said "for purposes of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue under this chapter." 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But there's no real 

  

 

 

 

 

 

evidence of any -- including in the nuances you talk 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about -- of such a significant change. 

   

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, the -- we can't get -- we can't get 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rid of this issue.  I mean, we tried in -- in Stonite 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then in Fourco.  It just sort of keeps coming up. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And -- and I would have thought, when you have -- well, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, is our Fourco decision law? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  Fourco -- the principles by which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fourco interpret the statutes are still good law --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. JAY:  -- but the definition that Fourco 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied is no longer the controlling definition of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"residence." 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  Well, the 

  

  

 

 

 

current statute says "except as otherwise provided by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law."  And I would have thought that excluded 

   

  

 

 

 

 

overturning the Fourco decision. 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  So, I don't think so, Your Honor. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

And I think that the function that "except as otherwise 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided by law," I'd like to illustrate what work that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is doing in the statute, and then I would like to

explain why nothing, in fact, "otherwise provides by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law" in 1400(b). 

 

 

26 

            

So if you look at the appendix to the red 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, pages 3A to 4A, and then again 5A to 6A, these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are the old statutes.  So this is the '88 version and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then it would actually be the '52 version.  And, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, from the '48 recodification. 

 

 

 

 

            

"Except as otherwise provided by law" has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been in the statute since the '48 recodification.  Where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was it?  It was in the general venue provision, and it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was in the diversity venue provision, (a) and (b) of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1391.  So that's right in the carryover on --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that the end, and then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

later it's going to be -- it's going to be moved to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beginning. 

            

MR. JAY:  That's right.  So now that there 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

is -- there aren't separate statutes anymore for general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue, diversity venue, and local action venue, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was 1392, all of that's now in 1391(b).  And this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"except as otherwise provided by law" language, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has always been there, has now been put in 1391(a).  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you look at why the American Law Institute drafted it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just that way, because it's just the way that the ALI 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drafted it that Congress adopted, you will see that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both from the ALI report and also from page 18 of the

intended to overrule VE Holding, but I suspect it wasn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended to overrule Fourco at all either.  And Fourco 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is a decision of this Court. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  It certainly is, Your Honor.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

I do think that Fourco is based on two things, and I --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those things are no longer the case in the statute.  Let 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me walk through that. 

 

 

 

            

So Fourco is based on two things.  Number 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one, the fact that 1400 was recodified in the 1948 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revision of the Judicial Code.  And if there isn't a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change specified in the revisor's notes, the Court said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it will not read that change in, even though, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinarily, when Congress makes a change in language, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

this Court's presumption is the opposite.  The Court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption is that Congress means to do something by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its change, not in the recodification context.  Now we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have the recodification context anymore. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The other thing is the specific and the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general canon.  This Court said that 1391(c), as it then 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

existed, was clearly a general corporation venue 

   

 

 

 

 

28 

statute, and so it was.  It provided where a corporation 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be sued.  It doesn't do that anymore.  1391(c) is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now a purely definitional provision, and it was adopted 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically to clear up a number of the nagging 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems that the members of the Court have been asking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my friend about, including where do you sue an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

artificial entity that is not a corporation?  Where does 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

it reside. 

 

            

Justice Breyer, the answer to your question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is in this -- this Court's decision in Denver and Rio 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Grande from 1967.  Now, my friend says, well, that's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general venue case.  But I think the salient point is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the Court said in that case, there is -- there was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no settled construction of the law on where an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unincorporated association resides in 1948, and there is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

none yet. 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Did you raise the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

significance of the fact that it was an unincorporated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

association in your brief in opposition? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  No, Your Honor, because we don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that it matters because the definition now applies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to all business entities; corporations, and LLCs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems odd to me

you didn't raise it in your brief in opposition, and yet 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

it takes up several pages in -- in your brief on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits. 

            

MR. JAY:  Because it's relevant to our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statutory interpretation, that our interpretation, but 

 

 

 

 

 

not the other side's, would clear up this issue and save 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court from having to confront in another case where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does an LLC reside. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why another case? 

  

 

 

 

MR. JAY:  -- in another case --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, look -- look. 

    

 

 

 

 

You -- if you -- if you're right, you win.  That's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end of the case.  If you're wrong, then you have another 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point, and that is that Fourco doesn't apply really to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unincorporated associations.  So why isn't the right 

  

 

 

 

 

 

thing to do for us to decide the issue, if you win, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's the end of it; and if you lose, you send it back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and we say to the lower court, if you haven't forfeited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the point, maybe you could raise it and argue it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Is that the correct way to handle this? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. JAY:  I think that that's fine, Your 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  I do think that --

    

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's fine.  That's the 

  

  

 

 

 

correct way to handle it? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  Yes, simply because -- because we

think, of course, that we win.  And one reason that we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

win --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Obviously, you think you 

  

 

 

 

 

win.  And -- and. 

  

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and --

  

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Look.  I -- I'm -- I'm not 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

worried about it if you win.  What I'm worried about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what to do is if you lose. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  Right.  And so I agree with what 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

Your Honor just said.  But I -- but the -- the question 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about what to do with LLCs and what to do with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants who don't reside in the United States -- this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes to Justice Sotomayor's question -- is a big part of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why -- why the ALI working with the Judicial Conferences 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Committee on Federal-State Jurisdiction proposed a 

 

 

 

 

 

statute that would resolve these ambiguities in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

naked word "resides" or "resident" --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I thought the ALI -- and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you -- you rely upon it in your briefs a lot and you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rely on it here.  I mean, the ALI wanted to get rid of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1400, and Congress didn't do that. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  That's right.  But its -- its 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

proposal to clear up the ambiguities in the word

"resident" or "resides" for all venue purposes, the ALI 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

explained in its report at page 188 and 189, and then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress then, in the House Report at page 20, echoed it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost exactly.  The reason to -- the work that is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the work that the words "for all venue purposes" do is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to provide that these definitions shall apply not just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the general venue statute, but to all venue statutes, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general or special.  And the House Report says the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing on page 20, even though, of course, as you said, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the House didn't repeal 1400.  And we're not saying that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 --

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER: 

 

   

In -- special or there are 

 

 

 

 

 

lots of different ones.  But did it say, if you pass 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this, don't worry about getting rid of 1400, because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this gets rid of it?  I mean, did they say anything like 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that at all? 

 

 

            

function. 

            

of Fourco. 

 

            

MR. JAY:  No.  Because 1400 still serves a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I mean, getting rid 

   

  

 

 

 

MR. JAY:  Oh.  Well, that's a different --

   

  

  

 

 

 

that's a different --

   

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Did it say anything --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. JAY:  Well, but -- but -- but

maybe this was years ago.  This said, don't worry about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

repealing 1400.  If you pass this, you will be rid of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Supreme Court's interpretation in Fourco.  Or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

anything like that. 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  What it said, Your Honor, is that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Federal Circuit's decision in VE Holding was it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

called it a partial palliative.  It said that the work 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

needed to be finished, because VE Holding addressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corporations based on the statute as it -- corporate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants, based on the statute as it then was, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the work needed to be carried forward in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition for, number one, corporate plaintiffs, where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do they reside; and, number two, unincorporated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants, where do they reside?  And that's what this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross-cutting, all-purpose definition was intended to 

 

 

 

 

 

do. 

            

But for the -- I think it's important to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

note that under our view, 1400(b) does do work.  It is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the venue statute.  So you have to show either that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant reside -- all defendants reside there, or all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants are subject to suit there under the other --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the second half.  That's different from what the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general venue statute provides, which, for example, can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

base venue on the residence of only one defendant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There is significance; there is work left to be done for

1400(b).  But it doesn't define --

  

 

 

 

 

33 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And -- and -- because I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thought that the only thing that left was to govern a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit against an individual. 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  Well, a suit against an individual 

   

  

 

 

 

 

would still -- would be more likely to trigger the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second half of the statute.  But in deciding what is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proper venue, the first thing you do is you look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is the right venue statute?  In this case, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not the general venue statute 1391(b); it is the special 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue statute for patent cases, 1400(b).  Now, that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't define "resides."  "Resides" is defined to "all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue purposes" somewhere else.  It's in 1391(c).  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

so for "all venue purposes," that's the definition you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply.  Now, when the defendant is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, Mr. Jay. 

  

 

 

 

 

(B) gets really subsumed by (a) -- 1400(b), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the second part of it, gets subsumed by 1391.  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no -- you keep saying there's work for this, but I --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where? 

            

MR. JAY:  So the second half, I agree, does 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

not have much work left to do, except in cases where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's an individual.  So I think that that -- that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

by itself means that the second half is not surplusage.

MR. JAY:  But let me answer that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

34 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you would have 

  

 

 

 

 

specific jurisdiction if the person committed an act of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement and has regular established place of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business.  Presumably, they're doing business in that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

State by doing the act of infringement. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  But the -- for an individual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant, Justice Sotomayor, the definition isn't based 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on personal jurisdiction.  It's based on their domicile. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Tell me what patent case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we've ever had an individual sued that wasn't an agent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of a company. 

   

            

            

            

MR. JAY:  I can't cite one right now.  I --

    

    

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I couldn't find one. 

    

 

 

 

MR. JAY:  Well, but I can tell you, for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

example, that, you know, my friend Mr. Dabney says that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- the problems we've raised are hypothetical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problems.  This Court has six patent cases this term. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Four of them have LLC defendants in them.  And we think 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that understanding where an LLC resides is actually a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very important point.  LLCs were basically a business 

   

  

 

 

 

 

entity that came into existence in about 1979 and really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have only taken off in the last 20 years.  Applying the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1897 definition of "inhabitant" carried forward into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1400(b) without this definition doesn't give you that

answer.  And we know that because --

  

 

 

 

 

 

35 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought -- I 

    

 

 

 

 

thought you responded to Justice Breyer by saying that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is an issue that could be dealt with on remand --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. JAY:  No, Your Honor.  What --

  

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- the difficulty of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

determining where an LLC is located. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  No, Your Honor.  What I said both 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

to Your Honor and to Justice Breyer is that it informs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our statutory answer.  In other words, this difficulty 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the reason why you should adopt our reading of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute and not the other side's.  As for if you adopt 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other side's --

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's a difficulty --

   

  

 

 

 

again, it's a difficulty you didn't point out to us at 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the jurisdictional stage. 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  I think there are -- the reasons 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

to adopt our statutory interpretation are many:  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

text, the legislative history, and the structural 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considerations.  And I think that they are all fair game 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

here on the merits.  We're not -- we're not urging you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to dismiss the case as improvidently granted, but I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that the practical difficulties with the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side's statutory interpretation, we're not required to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

raise all of those in a brief in opposition in order for

you to consider why you should adopt our reading on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 

merits. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Jay, can I just ask 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

you -- and this is a clarification question, and maybe I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should know this.  But you have the original 1391, which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was the subject of Fourco. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. JAY:  Uh-huh. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Then you have the 1988 

  

 

 

 

 

 

amendment.  Then you have the 2011 amendment? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. JAY:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is it the 2011 amendment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that you think changed things, or is it also the 1988 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amendment?  And if it's the 2011 amendment, exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which words do you think changed the thing? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  So it's both, Your Honor.  I don't 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

think you need to agree with me about the '88 amendment, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but we do think that for corporate defendants, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changed in 1988.  It did not change for noncorporate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants in 1988, because those weren't the words that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress used. 

 

            

In 2011, we think that there are four 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things -- and I think these are the four differences 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that I wanted to talk about with respect to Fourco.  We 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think that "for all venue purposes" does the work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because that's what the ALI and the House Report told

you in addition to their plain and unambiguous meaning. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We think that the definition --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So why is "for all purposes" 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different from "for venue purposes" or "for purposes of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue" under this chapter?  Why isn't it all the same? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  Well, "for all venue purposes" is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

broader consciously than "for purposes of venue" under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this chapter because there are more than 200 venue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes that are outside Chapter 87.  And Congress and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ALI wanted to --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, but 1400 was within the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

chapter --

 

            

MR. JAY:  That's right. 

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- so the effect was exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the same, wasn't it? 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  It wasn't because now it's no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

longer just corporate defendants.  The 2011 amendment 

  

 

 

 

 

 

adds to the definition.  It provides for a domicile for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual defendants.  It expands the (c)(2) definition 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to cover other business entities besides corporations, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which wasn't done in the '88 amendment, and it provides 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a rule that slightly tweaks what this Court said in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Brunette.  It provides what the rule should be for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendants who do not reside in the United States.

essentially, aliens can be sued in any district.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38 

that's what the prior statute said.  But that's not what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress wanted the law to be anymore.  Congress wanted 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the law to be that a defendant that does not reside in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States may be sued in any district. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

How do you decide if a defendant resides in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the United States?  You apply (c)(1) and (c)(2).  All 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those definitions tie together.  And I think that if --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if Congress had wanted to dispense with -- dispense with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Brunette for patent cases and creates, you know, an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entirely different rule just for patent cases, I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, it would have said so.  But instead, it wanted to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopt a cross-cutting definition. 

   

 

            

Third point:  The definition of venue in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

1390.  We -- if there's any doubt about what a venue 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose is, you can look at the definition of the word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"venue."  And some statutes that might be considered 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue statutes are excluded from that definition. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They're the ones that regulate the subject matter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction of a court and say that, this court and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only this court -- you know, let's say the district 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court for D.C. -- shall have jurisdiction to decide . 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's carved out of venue, but the patent venue statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly is not carved out of venue.

question -- answer this.  I -- I'm not an expert in this 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

area, comparatively speaking, so you need -- I need 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

enlightenment here. 

 

            

Think of A-1.  This section shall govern the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue of all civil actions brought in district courts. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Okay.  So what's an example of one that it doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

govern, where the law provides otherwise? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  A special venue statute that 

    

 

 

 

 

provides that, instead of the -- so if you -- if you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turn the page to 2A, the -- here is the general venue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, venue in general.  So a special venue statute 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that provides that the basis for venue should be, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, the plaintiff's residence instead of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant's residence, that is an example of a special 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue statute --

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So in other words --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. JAY:  -- by law. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  B doesn't apply because of 

    

 

 

 

 

the words in A, except as otherwise provided by law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

into --

 

            

            

MR. JAY:  That is exactly --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. JAY:  Why Congress put those words 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  A. 

  

 

MR. JAY:  -- general venue statutes in 1948

today. 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah. 

  

 

40 

MR. JAY:  -- and why they are still there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So why, if it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

governs B, does it not govern C?  The words except as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise provided by law you've just said, and I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you are absolutely right as far as I understand it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That those words govern B. They govern A and they govern 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B, then why don't they govern C? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  So their function is to prevent B 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from swamping a special venue --

   

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  That might be--

  

 

 

 

MR. JAY:  But so --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So -- so -- I know, but B 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is in a separate section. 

   

 

 

            

            

MR. JAY:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And now C is the next 

   

  

 

 

 

 

section, so why doesn't it govern that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  So, two reasons.  Number 1 -- I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

think the reason that uses the word section is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

previously there were two general venue sections.  Some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

were in 1391 and there were more for local actions in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1392. 

            

One of the things that Congress did in 2011

41 

was get rid of 1392, so that's why I think it wrote in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this section shall govern the venue.  Now, what does it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean to govern venue?  What it means to govern venue is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to provide, on which, bases venue shall lie. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plaintiff's residence, defendant's residence, 

 

 

 

personal -- principal place of business?  There are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue statutes that do each of those things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

1400(b) it is a special venue statute, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

it says defendant's residence or the conjunctive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition in the second half.  So, this is what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides -- this is what says look to 1400(b) and not to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the general venue statute in a patent infringement case. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Of course, in a -- in another patent case, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

where it's the alleged infringer bringing a declaratory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

judgment action, saying that I want a declaration I 

   

   

 

 

 

 

don't infringe, that does go under the general venue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision and there are lots of declaratory judgment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions brought right now by the prospective defendants 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that get to use the general venue provision.  They get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to sue patent owners anywhere the patent owner is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject to personal jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

            

And one virtue of our rule is that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

creates greater harmony between the sort of declaratory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment actions which are kind of -- where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant races into the courthouse to sue first, and an

infringement action brought by the patent owner under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1400(b). 

            

So I -- I hope that I've -- that I've 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

answered your question about why this doesn't govern --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42 

why this doesn't do the work.  But another part of that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer, which I had promised to get back to the Chief 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice on, is -- is about why nothing provides 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise by law in this case, even if you don't agree 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with anything that I've said to this point, and that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because Fourco interpreted the word residence in 1400(b) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that's absolutely true.  14 -- it gave it the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning that it had in all the venue statutes in 1897. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Diversity venue, general venue, patent venue.  It just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant inhabitant, and inhabitant had -- it did have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaning to corporations.  It did have a meaning for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

individuals.  It didn't have a settled meaning to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

unincorporated associations, but we can -- we can come 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back to that. 

 

 

            

The point is that Congress has now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted -- and one thing that my friend said that I --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that I entirely agree with.  It is an artificial 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

definition.  It is an artifical definition of residence, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

but it did so because it wanted to eliminate nice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinctions about where in -- particular kinds of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business entities reside using the term as it was used

in 1897, and it wanted to simplify the inquiry. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

You are going to have to answer the personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction question in all of these cases anyway.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43 

for corporate defendants, giving an additional venue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry about whether they -- where they are doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business or where they have a regular and established 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

place of business are additional complications layered 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on top of that personal jurisdiction inquiry that you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are going to have to do anyway. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

That's why Congress, in 1988, for general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue, decided to make personal jurisdiction the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

touchstone for venue as well for corporate defendants, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and why the ALI, working with the judicial conferences 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committee, and then Congress, decided to expand that to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unincorporated associations for all venue purposes in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2011.  It's simpler, it's crosscutting, it's not sort of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a patent specific rule, but it is the best rule and it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the rule that Congress adopted.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So a lot of amici 

   

  

 

 

 

discussions as to their reasons for why so many suits 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are centered in this court in Texas, what is your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason, why do you think that is true? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  So I think that -- if I understand 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

your question is, why do people sue -- what are people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suing in this court in Texas or why are so many

MR. JAY:  Well, it's only 1391 in the sense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it -- it's a permissible choice, but I don't think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that is an answer to the question of why they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choose that over all other permissible choices. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I think if there are complaints about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the way things are handled in East Texas, and my client, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kraft, has been a defendant in East Texas in patent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement cases as well.  If there are complaints 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they tend to be complaints that aren't venue style 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaints.  In other words, it's an inconvenient forum 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

compared to where I am located.  They tend to be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaints about how the cases are managed, how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discovery takes place, how motions practice is handled, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and so on.  And those complaints, if they are valid, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be valid even when venue is indisputably proper 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over a Texas defendant.  They are problems that should 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

be dealt with on their own terms rather than by letting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody not from Texas out of that district and leaving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everyone else still in the district with -- where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practice is unchanged. 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- I didn't 

    

   

 

 

understand that answer.  You are saying the problems

would be there for Texas corporations that actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45 

reside in that district anyway.  So we shouldn't worry 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that 25 percent of the nationwide cases are there? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  I'm saying two things, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Number one, I think the complaints about East Texas 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

aren't really about overcrowding -- and I would like to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer that as my second point.  But that -- rather they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are about the way that the cases are handled, you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether there be, you know, one case or a thousand 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases. 

            

            

Or -- and we talk about the overcrowding --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the complaint is that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

allows a kind of forum shopping, right?  That it --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you -- let's go down to Texas where we can get the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit of a certain set of rules. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  I mean, I think that the same 

    

   

 

 

 

 

criticism can be made of the rule that Congress adopted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the general venue statute in 1988, or for that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter, the fairly liberal rule that Congress adopted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for corporation in 1948, and patent cases, number one, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have the varying circuit law.  They have a single 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal court, appeals court; and number two, they don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have choice of law problems, you know, so that you can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly have forum shopping problems under the general 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue provision quite easily as well.  I do think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The general -- generous 

  

 

 

 

 

jury verdicts enter into this or is that something we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't think about? 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  So I -- I think that the empirics 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

-- you know, there is a battle in the amicus briefs 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about that.  I mean, I think that at least one scholar 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

has said that the outcomes are not significantly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different in cases that go to trial.  We don't have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

position on that.  We haven't crunched -- crunched the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

numbers ourselves.  But ultimately we think that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But certainly that might 

  

 

 

 

 

be a perception by the -- by the -- by the bar who 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brings -- by the -- those in the bar who bring these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suits. 

            

MR. JAY:  It -- it might well be and I --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it -- certainly that is -- that is the argument that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is being made to Congress, and I think that when 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress is -- you know, takes up this issue as it has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already been asked to do and it's already been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considering at the committee level.  Congress can do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that this Court doesn't have the ability to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in this case, and that is to modulate venue in the -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a way that is not binary.  I mean, in this case you --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you only have two choices. 

 

 

 

 

            

My friends on the other side say, reside for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

a corporate defendant just means the state of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47 

incorporation, that is it.  What Congress can do is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create a definition that doesn't turn on the word 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

resides at all, I -- or that adds more choices that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could add principal place of business.  It can add where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the plaintiff has done research on the invention that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patented.  Those are, in fact, what the proposals look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like.  None of the legislative proposals about patent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

venue in the last 10 years that I've seen look anything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like what the -- what my friend on the other side are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposing. 

            

Nobody likes the one place of residence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule.  They all at least offer principal place of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

business and some plaintiff-centered venue, and that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why the empirics say that if you adopt the rule that my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friends on the other side are proposing, you will shift 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

more than half of all cases from the district where they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now are into other districts.  Whereas, if Congress 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

adopted its current -- the current version of its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reform, nonpracticing entity cases would largely move, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but operating company cases largely would not.  Whereas, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you adopted Heartland's rule, operating company cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would wind up shifting, and this gets back to my point, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Chief Justice, they would have to shift to places 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like Delaware where lots of defendants are incorporated,

and if everybody were incorporated in Delaware maybe 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48 

that would be okay, but because lots are incorporated in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Delaware and some are not, you have kind of a dual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

problem. 

            

You're going to have overcrowding in 

 

 

 

 

 

Delaware and you're -- you're -- the cases that really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out to be in the same place, you won't be able to bring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the same place. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Were any -- were any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of these policy considerations addressed by Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when it made the change you suggest it made in 2011? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  The policy considerations about 

  

 

 

 

 

patent -- about where patent venue ought to be? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah. 

  

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  No, because it -- Congress decided 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it was going to -- for purposes of residence it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to adopt a single definition across the board. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

But -- but --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I laugh slightly because 

    

 

 

 

if -- if that is so clear what is this case doing here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and it -- that's why -- that's why I can't cut 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one way or the other with that -- that particular 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument.  I mean, you would think the patent holders 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

are a tremendously powerful group of people, businesses 

   

 

 

 

 

 

all over the country, and if they had been -- why

weren't they in Congress?  See, that -- that's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49 

Congressional problem.  Why weren't they there saying we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a problem here, why don't you clarify it?  You -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't think you can answer that question --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. JAY:  I -- I can --

    

   

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- until I get -- you can? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR. JAY:  Well, sure.  Because I think --

   

  

  

 

 

 

because I think that the issue is not the definition of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

residence.  The issue is how do we come up with a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different patent venue statute altogether?  And that is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

something that Congress has been working on, trying to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come up with something more calibrated, so that, for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, a research university would be able to bring 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit in its home district, because that's where it did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the invention; it's where the inventor's lab is and so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forth, you know, where they would want to be able to sue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a defendant in its own principal place of business, even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if it doesn't commit the relevant act of infringement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there. 

            

And in particular, because, you know, the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the second half of the patent venue statute was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreted in a way that requires everything to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

conjunctive; in other words, all defendants have to have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed acts of infringement and have regular and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

established places of business there.  You have parent 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

50 

subsidiary problems.  You have problems when you sue on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

multiple patents, patents which are infringed at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different times, like the process of making something, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then the good that is made.  Each of those could be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different acts of infringement. 

 

 

 

            

And you also have problems in pharmaceutical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases.  I think one aspect of patent litigation that is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

working pretty well is these pharmaceutical cases where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a brand company sues all the generic companies that want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to make a product that's a -- you know, a facsimile of 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

the brand product. 

 

 

            

Congress, in Section 299 of the Patent Act, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized that those are an example of cases that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really all ought to proceed in the same district.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are an exception from the No Consolidation Rule that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress wrote in the America Invents Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So what's going to happen to those cases? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Number one, there is no act of infringement yet because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- or act of infringement that kicks off the lawsuit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is an artificial one.  And number two, you won't be able 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to sue all those generics in the same district at all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Right now, a dozen, or even two dozen, cases can all be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brought in the same district.  It has to be litigated to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a judgment in 30 months, which is the time -- time

period that Congress put in the statute.  And yet, if --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you were going to have to be bringing a dozen suits 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a dozen districts, that's going to be significantly 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

more difficult. 

 

            

Ultimately, we don't think that these 

 

 

 

 

 

practical problems are dispositive, because we think the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

text and the legislative history, and the reasons why 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ALI wanted to solve the problems that had come up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with the previous versions of the undefined term 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"residents" are so clear.  Congress wanted a single 

   

  

 

 

 

 

definition that would have cut -- cut across all these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes. 

            

That might have been --

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then why did -- why did 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress reject the ALI proposal to just get rid of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1400(b)? 

            

MR. JAY:  Well, I can't cite you a page of 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

legislative history, for example, but I think it may 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

well have wanted to continue having a rule that, for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, requires all defendants to reside in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

district of venue, which is what 1400(b) now -- now 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides.  Whereas the general venue provision has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

transactional venue, it allows for venue where nobody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resides, and it also allows for venue sometimes where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only one defendant resides.

But we think that Congress could have gone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

through and snipped out all of the venue provisions, or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

portions of venue provisions that were left somewhat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

superfluous by its adoption of this broad definition of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"resides."  The ALI recognizes that would be a mammoth 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

task, but nevertheless, Congress decided to do it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anyway, and to do it this relatively easy way.  And I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think, you know, the Fila venue --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me your answer 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is quite proper as to 1400(a), but how does your answer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply to 1400(b)? 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  How does it apply in terms of work 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

left to be done by the rest of the statute? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yeah.  You -- you -- your 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

explanation was that they -- they wanted to get rid of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all of these distinctions, but that doesn't -- and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes sense so far as (a) is concerned, but I don't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand how it applies to (b). 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. JAY:  Well, it -- it wanted to get rid 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the idea of different conceptions of residents under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different statutes, and different conceptions of 

 

 

 

 

 

residents that applied to different types of defendants. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It wanted to have all of that standardized. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, that might sometimes result in the word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"resides" in a venue statute swallowing the rest to some

degree.  I think, you know, this Court, next month, is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to consider the Fila venue provision, 45 U.S.C. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46, I believe.  And that venue provision -- it's in the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53 

list, in, I think, footnote 8 of the House report --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that footnote incorporates of venue provisions that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be encompassed.  And it says, "resides or shall be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing business." 

 

            

Now plainly, that is subsumed by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redefinition of "resides," but that is a result that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress was comfortable with.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

Getting to the point that Justice Breyer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made, the domicile of unincorporated associations, 

 

 

 

 

 

limited liability companies has not been a problem in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the law for decades.  It has been settled. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There's a reason they didn't bring it up in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

their brief in opposition.  It was never an issue in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  And the place in the Joint Appendix I would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

direct the Court's attention to is page 20A, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the proof of service that they served in this case in

which the defendant's counsel, in Delaware, filed proofs

the principal place of business of the defendant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The idea that you don't know where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

domicile is of a chartered entity is something for which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is absolutely no evidence in the record.  It is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it is a complete non-problem --

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do we do with your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

adversary's last point about the -- all of the cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like the pharmaceutical cases that will be upended and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made completely impractical by ignoring 1391? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. DABNEY:  I don't believe that -- I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

believe that that provision -- that that argument is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

overstated, for various reasons. 

 

 

 

            

First of all, to the extent that venue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies across the board.  Of course it will apply to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

putative makers of generic drugs as well.  The judicial 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

panel on multidistrict litigation exists to provide for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pre-trial consolidation of proceedings, if that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate.  Many generic companies have waived any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

objection to venue by -- potentially by registering to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do business in the places where the brand companies want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to sue.  That was the holding in the Corda case in which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court denied cert on January 9.

55 

            

So it is completely speculative to suggest 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that simply upholding what Congress has seen fit to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provide by way of across-the-board venue protection for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent litigation is necessarily going to prevent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation over putative generic drug manufacturers. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Secondly, the -- the Fourco case was one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whose critical holding was not based on the then content 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of 1391(c), which, as Justice Kagan correctly pointed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out, whose breadth was no narrower then than it is now. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"For venue purposes," "for all venue purposes," it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exact; there is no difference there. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What Fourco was so important is that it held 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that 1400(b) is freestanding.  It is not supplemented by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1391(c).  So if we're looking at what 1400(b) means, you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a -- a word that has been construed by this Court. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That construction has never been overruled or changed by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress. 

            

And in the Pure Oil v. Suarez case in 1966, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Harlan wrote for a unanimous Court that 1391(c) 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied to all venue statutes, except where there was a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restriction, and cited Fourco and the patent venue 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute as a specific exception.  Why?  Because the 

   

  

  

 

 

 

structure of 1400(b) that specifically distinguishes 

 

 

 

 

 

between resident and nonresident defendants makes no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense, unless the statute is given its original meaning.

You can sue a defendant in the judicial district where 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56 

his domicile is, or if you want to sue somewhere else, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have to sue somewhere where there is both an act of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement and a regular established place of 

   

 

 

 

 

business.  That is what Congress provided. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

And -- and it's very revealing that -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my opponent cites as one argument for overruling Fourco 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that adoption of -- of the respondent's rule would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make more even-handed patent infringement cases and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actions for declaratory judgment.  Well, that is simply 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a funnel of salt on 1400(b) itself, because when it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talks about actions for patent infringement, it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about the civil action remedy provided by 35 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

U.S.C. section 281. 

 

 

            

So those are the only kind of actions that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1400(b) applies to.  So if there is a -- a problem with 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way Congress wrote the law, that's just too bad. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's not for a court to come in and -- and overrule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent in order to achieve a goal like that. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And I also heard conceded here that, 

   

 

 

 

 

whatever might be the motivations for filing a patent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit in a particular jurisdiction, it -- it is conceded 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here that it is the interpretation of 1391, and -- and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the disregard of this Court's Fourco decision that has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made all this possible.
