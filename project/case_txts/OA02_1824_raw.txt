 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument first


this morning in No. 02-1824, Doug Dretke v. Michael Wayne


Haley.


 Mr. Cruz.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the


Court:


 This case concerns the continuing vitality of the


procedural default rule, an important bulwark to federalism,


comity, and finality of judgments.  This Court has


consistently maintained that cause and prejudice can address


problems with procedural default, and that the actual


innocence exception should be applicable only in exceedingly


rare cases.


 QUESTION: Can -- can you tell me -- I don't want


to derail the argument -- you've conceded that this sentence


is unlawful?


 MR. CRUZ: Yes, Justice Kennedy.


 QUESTION: Well, then why are you here?  Don't -­

is there some rule that you can't confess error in your


state or?


 MR. CRUZ: No, Justice Kennedy, but the state is

here, because the state is concerned about the impact on the


procedural default rule, in particular the Fifth Circuit's


decision.


 QUESTION: Well, so a man does 15 years so you can


vindicate your legal point in some other case?  I -- I just


don't understand why you don't dismiss this case and move to


lower the sentence.


 MR. CRUZ: Implicit in the procedural default -­

QUESTION: And I'd say the same for the Government


of the United States.


 MR. CRUZ: Implicit in the procedural default rule


is the premise that petitioner has a valid claim.  In -- in


some ways this case, as the Fifth Circuit remarked, as the


judges dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc, in some


ways this case presents an usually pristine form, I mean,


it's almost a law school hypothetical, because the error is


so clean.  There's a 3-day disparity -­

QUESTION: At -- at the prisoner's expense.


 MR. CRUZ: But that is inherent in any claim with


procedural default.


 QUESTION: No, but it's not a -- it's not a -- as


if there's some new trial and -- and it's in doubt.  It's


very clear he should not be in jail for, like what, 12, 14,


15 more years.


 MR. CRUZ: It is very clear that there was an

error, and that if Mr. Haley had raised the error at trial,


that the trail judge would have and should have sustained -­

QUESTION: But is it -­

QUESTION: Well -­

QUESTION: -- not also very clear that he's going


to spend over 10 year in jail when he shouldn't spend 10


years in jail?


 MR. CRUZ: It is clear that he will spend 10 years


in jail when he had an objection he could have raised that


he did not.


 QUESTION: Well, I understand that, but -- but if


the law were followed and everything went perfectly, he


would spend less than 2 or -- what is it, 2 or 3 years?


 MR. CRUZ: Two years would be the max.


 QUESTION: And he's going to spend 16 years in


jail, is that right?


 MR. CRUZ: Yes, Justice Stevens.


 QUESTION: Now, is that just, do you think?


 MR. CRUZ: Maintaining the procedural default rule


is --


QUESTION: I understand that you want to preserve


the procedures, but do you think justice is being done?


 MR. CRUZ: I think justice is being done because he


had a full and fair trial and an opportunity to raise his


errors, and there's no greater -­

 QUESTION: Well, let me ask you this.  Why -- why


isn't there still an inadequate assistance of counsel claim


out there, and why shouldn't the court address that before


it gets into the question that it dealt with?


 MR. CRUZ: Justice O'Connor, I think there is a


very strong argument that there was inadequate assistance of


counsel.


 QUESTION: Well, why don't we vacate and remand and


let them deal with that?


 MR. CRUZ: Justice O'Connor, I think that is


something that is open to the Court to do and I think that


is one of the fundamental problems with what the district


court did.


 QUESTION: You don't think that that claim was


waived here?  You don't urge us to make that finding, do


you?


 MR. CRUZ: There is an argument that it was waived,


but I think the Fifth Circuit -­

QUESTION: Well, except the court below didn't


decide that question.


 MR. CRUZ: And I think the Fifth Circuit could


certainly deem the petitioner's pleading sufficient to


preserve that claim.


 QUESTION: Yeah, I would think so too.  I can't -­

argue a waiver if it's sent back?


 MR. CRUZ: If it's sent back, we would be prepared


to address the ineffective assistance claim on its merits.


 QUESTION: And not raise any procedural impediment


to -­

MR. CRUZ: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct.


 QUESTION: The -- the -- another feature of this


case, what makes it so disturbing, is that the initial error


was the prosecutors, in -- when the prosecutor indicted him,


that indictment was incorrect, and then the rest followed,


relying on that original mistake of the prosecutor.  So it


seems a -- really an ideal case for the prosecution to say,


we missed it, and then as a result of we -- what we, the


prosecutor missed, the court missed it, defense counsel


missed it, but it was our error and we should correct it.


 MR. CRUZ: And, Justice Ginsburg, this case may


well, if the Court finds ineffective assistance, that would


suffice to correct this, because ineffective assistance


counts as cause, and in many ways this case illustrates why


cause and prejudice is ample to address error in sentencing


in non-capital sentencing and why there's not a need to open


the door to a new category of exceptions to procedural


default.


 QUESTION: Well, this defendant certainly raised -­

he raised the point in his pro se petition in the state

court and he raised it in the Federal court, the ineffective


assistance, but nobody paid any attention to him.


 MR. CRUZ: The -- the claim was denied in state


habeas and the Federal habeas court did not address it


because it had already granted relief based upon his claim


that he was actually innocent of the sentence.


 QUESTION: Did the prosecutor suggest that maybe


the court should have dealt with it, because neither court


gave any reason for rejecting that claim?


 MR. CRUZ: I -- the -- the district court jumped


ahead in the process.  Rather than address cause and


prejudice, the district court said that it didn't need to


address cause and prejudice because it found actual


innocence, and that's one of the -- the significant


problems, much like statutory interpretation, where a court


should -­

QUESTION: Mr. Cruz, let me -- let me make -- get


clear what -- what -- what your position is.  You're --


you'd be totally content if we don't resolve this question


that's before us about whether whenever there's a procedural


default that has clearly resulted and -- and with no


ineffective assistance of counsel, that has clearly resulted


in an injustice, you know, we -- we throw away all the


procedural rules.  You -- you don't want us to address that


and just send it back and say, well, before you get to that

question, you have to resolve the cause and prejudice and


then leave -- leave dangling in the air the question, the


significant question, it seems to me, on which we granted


cert?


 MR. CRUZ: Justice Scalia, the first preference of


the State of Texas is for the Court to address the circuit


split and to clarify that there is no actual innocence


exception to non-capital sentencing.  If the Court is not


inclined to do so, the State of Texas, our second preferred


outcome is to vacate the decision of the Fifth Circuit so we


don't operate under that precedent.


 QUESTION: Why should we -- why should we not be


inclined to do so?  Is it a constitutional question that we


shouldn't reach?  I mean, do we have to do a sort of


jurisprudential striptease and decide this one case, leaving


open this question?  I don't understand why we wouldn't


decide it.


 MR. CRUZ: And Texas is not urging the Court not to


decide it.  It is simply saying that is an avenue should the


Court decide to decide -- to rule on this case in a more


narrow ground, that is an avenue that would provide some


relief to Texas because it would vacate the Fifth Circuit


decision and it would allow ultimately for some relief for


Mr. Haley as well.


 QUESTION: So you come back and fight another day?

 MR. CRUZ: Well, or perhaps someone else would


fight in a different circuit.


 QUESTION: But if the court views this as a


preliminary question, a question that the Fifth Circuit and


any other Federal court should have reached logically before


it reached the question on which it decided the case -­

MR. CRUZ: Yes, Justice -­

QUESTION: -- then we should put the court back in


the position that it should have been in if it handled the


case correctly.


 MR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, we certainly agree


that as a matter of thinking through procedural default,


that courts should begin with cause and prejudice, that the


actual innocence exception as a potential trump card should


not be jumped to first.


 QUESTION: Well, that just means it made two


mistakes.  Number one, if this theory that you're opposing


did exist, it shouldn't have reached it first, okay?  It


should have reached it second.  Mistake one.  And number


two, according to you, is this theory doesn't exist anyway.


 MR. CRUZ: And -­

QUESTION: I don't see why it's more intelligent


for us to reach the first question than the second if -- if


there isn't any such thing as number one and number two.  If


the only one that exists is number one, it seems to me we

should say so.


 MR. CRUZ: And, Justice Scalia, I agree entirely


with your characterization of the errors made by the court


below.


 QUESTION: May I ask this question?  I always


thought there was a manifest injustice exception to the


procedural default rule, and as I understand it, the


Government concedes there was injustice at the end of their


brief.  They say it's less significant, it's a less -­

qualitatively less significance than if you put an innocent


man to death.  But is it not manifest that there was


injustice in this case?


 MR. CRUZ: Justice Stevens, I -- I do not believe


it is.  It -- it is manifest that there was error -­

QUESTION: Well, can you give me an example of when


manifest injustice would exist other than a death case?


 MR. CRUZ: There are a host of instances in which


this Court has held that actual constitutional errors should


nonetheless not be addressed because the defendant has


procedurally defaulted that.


 QUESTION: Well, I understand that, but is there


any -- any content to the manifest injustice exception in


your view?


 MR. CRUZ: Absolutely there is.  The paradigmatic


case -­

 QUESTION: Well, he's innocent of the crime he's in

 MR. CRUZ: He is innocent only in the most


technical of legal sense.  In the ordinary sense of the


word, he committed the theft, he committed the predicate


felonies -­

QUESTION: No, but if the law were followed, he


would have been released a long time ago, would he not?


 MR. CRUZ: If he had raised his objection.


 QUESTION: What -- what actually -- what was he


charged with, Mr. Cruz?  What was the substantive offense


and what were the recidivist offenses?


 MR. CRUZ: He was charged with theft, and that was


enhanced to a state jail felony because he had committed two


prior thefts.  And then upon sentencing, his sentence was


aggravated because he was a habitual offender and had two


prior felony convictions.  Now, the indictment alleged that


they were sequential and it turned out that allegation was


incorrect.


 QUESTION: Well -­

QUESTION: They -- they were sequential.  I mean,


one followed another.  Isn't what it comes down to is that

he should have been -- he should have been given this longer


sentence for the second theft instead of for the third


theft?


 MR. CRUZ: No, actually, Justice Scalia, the way


the statute reads -­

QUESTION: As I understand it, the -- the -- the


theft that -- that was used for recidivism occurred 3 days


after, right, the --


MR. CRUZ: It's a 3 -- it's a 3-day disparity.  The


first crime was delivery of amphetamines.


 QUESTION: Yeah.


 MR. CRUZ: And he committed that in 1988, but that


conviction did not become final until October 18th, 1991. 


Three days before October 18th, 1991, he committed attempted


robbery, and the way the Texas statute reads, he has to


commit the second felony after the first felony conviction


becomes final.


 QUESTION: But why did the first felony take so


long to become final?  It took -- you say it took 3 years?


 MR. CRUZ: It -- it did.  I don't know the extent


to which that was discovery in the trial, but that -- that's


ultimately what the record reveal in terms of when that


conviction -­

prosecutor would have, if he had noted this error, have the

duty to call the attention of the trial judge before the


trial judge imposed sentence?


 MR. CRUZ: Absolutely, absolutely.  And -- and -­

QUESTION: But the trial obligation -- the trial


lawyer's obligation to do justice is -- is somehow missing


in your office?


 MR. CRUZ: The state has an obligation to be candid


with the court, so at any point in which the state became


aware of this error, the state would be obliged to inform


the court, but that's a very different thing to say that


when there is a procedural default, when the defendant has


not preserved his error, that the state should not act to


vindicate that procedural default.  There is an important


value in protecting the procedural rules in the State of


Texas, and that value is not served.  I mean, ultimately,


this Court has said that the very narrow exception of actual


innocence should apply in very narrow circumstances.  So


this Court has ultimately engaged in a balancing, a


balancing that derives from prior language in the -- in the


Federal habeas -­

QUESTION: Well, narrow circumstances, when the


record makes it perfectly clear that an error has been


committed and an innocent person is in jail, that's -- what


more do you need?

 QUESTION: There aren't many cases like this.


 MR. CRUZ: It is true that there are not many cases


where the state concedes error, but the difficulty with


pivoting the test on that is the basic operating premise of


every habeas petition.  Where procedural default is raised


is that the petitioner has valid claim and this Court has


not hesitated to allow far more significant claims not to be


addressed because of procedural default.


 QUESTION: Yes, but usually the valid claim is some


procedural error in the trial, something of that character. 


It's not that he's totally innocent and everybody agrees


he's totally innocent.


 MR. CRUZ: This -- this Court has addressed


procedural default in the context of forced confessions, in


the context of statements without Miranda rights, in the


context of psychiatry -­

QUESTION: But that -- but -- but -- no, what you


need to satisfy Justice Stevens is -- is a case where the


mistake unquestionably caused the outcome of the -­

unquestionably caused the outcome of the trial to be wrong. 


All of the ones you just mentioned, it may have caused it to


be wrong, may not have, you don't -- the jury might have


convicted him without the confession, et cetera, et cetera. 


Do you have any cases where -- where, as here, there is no


doubt that the procedural default produced a different

outcome in the trial?


 MR. CRUZ: We do not have any cases like that, but


that aspect simply goes to prejudice, and this Court has


repeatedly cautioned that the actual innocence exception


should not be used to transform cause and prejudice just to


prejudice.  There's no doubt that this error caused


prejudice.  The only question is if there was cause for not


raising it, and in terms of asking -- I mean, Justice


Stevens asked me about, is this a manifest injustice.  There


seems nothing on the face of it that is plain to me that


allowing an individual to be convicted and to remain


convicted and serve in jail or even be executed based on a


forced confession is somehow a lesser injustice than


allowing Mr. Haley to serve a sentence -­

QUESTION: I think it's a lesser injustice if he's


really guilty of the crime.


 MR. CRUZ: But in this case, Mr. Haley is guilty of


the theft, he's guilty of the predicate offense -­

QUESTION: He is not guilty of what he's in prison


for.


 MR. CRUZ: Only in the sense -­

QUESTION: And I don't think the 3 days is an


argument that has any merit.  You'd make the same argument


if it was 10 years.  You'd make the same argument.


 MR. CRUZ: It is -- it is true that 3 days or 5

days or whatever does not matter.  What matters, and what we


are urging, is that Mr. Haley had multiple avenues to


challenge this.  He could have challenged this at trial.  He


could have challenged this on direct appeal.


 QUESTION: If he could deliberately refuse to do it


in order to trap the state into some kind of mistake, is


this a case of, you know, in our original case that we talk


about gamesmanship and so on, do you think this is


gamesmanship on his part?


 MR. CRUZ: You know, we don't have reason to


suggest that Mr. Haley in this instance was engaged in


gamesmanship with respect to this error, but the record is


susceptible to an interpretation that his counsel was


engaged in gamesmanship with respect to whether or not Mr.


Haley pleaded to the enhancements.  Because what happened at


trial is Mr. Haley's attorney urged the trial court, my


client doesn't want to plead, please go ahead, he's not


going to plead.  The trial court did what the counsel asked


and he immediately, on direct appeal that was his principal


challenge, and that is one possible interpretation of the


record is the counsel was attempting to sandbag.  There was


a line of state court cases saying it was mandatory error


not to plead.


 QUESTION: Well, if the counsel sandbagged for the


purpose of getting a 16-year sentence instead of a 3-year

sentence, doesn't that demonstrate that he was incompetent?


 (Laughter.)


 MR. CRUZ: It may well, and I certainly wouldn't


urge that counsel engaged in good strategic decisions, but


it may have been a strategic decision with respect to urging


the court to commit an error under state law that caused the


counsel not to notice the disparities in the enhancements. 


QUESTION: In one of the proceedings, Texas did


take the position that there -- this was not ineffective


assistance of counsel.  The reply brief I think makes it


clear that you're not disputing that the -- that the


ineffective assistance of counsel claim is alive and well. 


But there was a time you took a different view.


 MR. CRUZ: That -- that is correct, and we agree at


this point there is a very significant argument of


ineffective assistance of counsel, and I would note that the


court of criminal appeals in Texas has found ineffective


assistance of counsel in almost precisely the same


circumstance where a counsel failed to notice the non­

sequential nature of felonies used to enhance a habitual


offender in the decision of Ex parte Scott, which is found


at 581 S.W.2d 181.


 If there are no further questions, I'd like to


reserve the balance of my time.


 QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Cruz.

 Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS 


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE


 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


 MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


 The actual innocence exception applies in the


extraordinary case where a prisoner has been convicted of a


crime that he did not commit.  The Court shouldn't extend


that narrow exception to the very different situation where


the prisoner is guilty of the crime of which he was


convicted.


 QUESTION: Well, what should we do in this case


with someone who -- who is serving an unjust sentence under


the law?


 MR. ROBERTS: Well -- well, Your Honor, even if


this Court holds that the actual innocence exception doesn't


apply to non-capital sentencing, respondent may well be


entitled to relief here.


 QUESTION: On the inadequate assistance claim?


 MR. ROBERTS: On the ineffective assistance claim,


and I -­

QUESTION: Do you urge that that's waived, or can


the court below address it?

Your Honor.


 QUESTION: Thank you.


 QUESTION: Why not go to that first and tell them


to do that, because this is just very difficult, that that


would be the reason?  The reason it would be difficult is


because actual innocence is simply a way at getting at


manifest injustice, I think, and a reason that this fits in


the manifest injustice is we feel differently about


substantive laws that govern how long a person is going to


be in prison than we do about procedural laws, and


sentencing is an aspect of that. 


But if you take that and say, look, this is an


absolute obvious case where there was just wrong sentencing,


it's not actual innocence, it's wrong sentencing, but it's


so obvious, it's so clear that this is just unjust.  Once


we're down that path, I mean, how do we draw a line between


that and every sentencing error?  Now, I'm just -­

to deal with it when it's clear?


 MR. ROBERTS: Well, the -- the Court certainly


could do that.  There is a danger I think in -- in


addressing the actual innocence exception in a case where


there's cause and prejudice and so you don't need to address


it, and in a case where the error is -- is clear when what


the real concern is when it's not that clear about whether


somebody's actually innocent.


 QUESTION: So you're saying it would be wise to


send it back, is that right?


 MR. ROBERTS: It -- it -- yes, except that, you


know, certainly our -- our primary interest in the question


here is in the question that's divided the circuits and in


making clear that there isn't a broad actual innocence


exception as applied to -- to non-capital sentencing.


 QUESTION: Perhaps when it's clear it will always


be the case that there's been ineffective assistance of


counsel.  How -- how could it be, you know, clear as day and


ineffective assistance of counsel not -- not have


intervened?


 MR. ROBERTS: That -- that's -- that's right, Your


Honor.  It may well frequently be the case, which is why you


wouldn't need the actual innocence exception for that -- for


that circumstance.  But -- but our concern is that a rule


that applies to the exception where the prisoner is guilty

of the crime and is claiming only that he's suffering an


excessive prison term, if taken to its logical conclusion,


that would open up final judgments where a criminal


defendant is belatedly claiming that a sentencing guideline


was incorrectly applied to him and that he's therefore


innocent of the sentence.


 QUESTION: Well, suppose -- suppose this were the


Federal system.  Would the Department of Justice take the


position that it would not ask sua sponte that this sentence


be reduced?


 MR. ROBERTS: We -- we well might not have appealed


from the district court judgment in this case.  If the


Government takes an appeal, the Solicitor General office has


to -- has to approve those appeals and we would certainly -­

QUESTION: That's one tremendous advantage the


Government has over individual criminal defendants' lawyers,


isn't it?  They choose the facts they want to bring here.


 (Laughter.)


 QUESTION: Well, they do, don't they?

take into account the entire situation in -- in making a


determination on that, Your Honor.

 MR. ROBERTS: We -- I -- I -- we think that it's a


question to be decided by the -- the court of appeals on -­

on remand, Your Honor, and the state had made arguments


about whether it was preserved or not.  Justice O'Connor


asked me my opinion as to whether the -- whether the claim


was preserved, and in -- in our view it was, but that would


be a question for the lower court to -- to decide, and


apparently the state is no longer arguing that -- that it


wasn't preserved.


 As I said, our -- our -- the -- the issue that


we're primarily concerned about here is a broad extension of

QUESTION: Would it involve all those costs if we


can find the exception to cases in which the state

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, that would certainly be a far


less problematic exception.

that way?


 MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor, except to the extent


that it -- it extended -- extends actual innocence beyond an

that the actual innocence exception and the procedural


default rules are court-made limitations on the jurisdiction


-- on the exercise of discretion by the Federal habeas


court, and so the court's exercising its -- its supervisory


authority over the courts.


 QUESTION: No, but the Federal habeas court has to


be relying upon some law to -- to undo the state conviction,


right?


 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor.  There has to be an


underlying claim.

with that, Your Honor.  That -- the elements of the crime


have all been proved.  They're not -- they're not disputed. 


What's disputed is -- is a factor leading to enhancement in


the sentence.  If this was an element of the crime, we would


agree with you that the actual innocence exception applies


here.


 QUESTION: If Apprendi had come out the other way,


or if we extended Apprendi to recidivism?


 MR. ROBERTS: If you overruled Almendarez-Torres,


we would agree that the actual innocence exception applies


in this particular case.


 QUESTION: Doesn't scare me.


 MR. ROBERTS: But again, our concern is with broad


application of the actual innocence exception to sentencing


and to the many findings that are involved there, and the


fact is that the Court hasn't overruled Almendarez-Torres. 


We're talking about even in this case just an erroneous


sentence.  We're not talking about an innocence of an


offense with the special constitutional status that that


entails and the special stigma that's attached to innocent,


to an offense.


 QUESTION: But Mr. Roberts, aren't we talking about


justice?  You -- at the end of your brief you say, this is


qualitatively less significant than it -- than killing

costs to -- to extending it to these many -- there are many


factors that are involved in sentencing, and the fact is the


prisoner's still guilty of the offense of conviction here,

 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Roberts.


 Mr. Albritton.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC M. ALBRITTON


 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


 MR. ALBRITTON: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please


the Court:


 This Court has repeatedly recognized that the -­

the systemic concerns that underpin the procedural default


doctrine must yield to the imperative of correcting a


fundamentally unjust incarceration, an incarceration that is


beyond the statutory maximum sentence, whether it be a


capital sentence or a non-capital sentence, is fundamentally


unjust.  The Court has never limited this exception to a


capital sentence context and it should not do so today.


 QUESTION: Well, it has never extended it beyond


the capital sentence context either, has it?


 MR. ALBRITTON: That is correct, Your Honor. 


However -­

QUESTION: And there is some suggestion in our


cases that other claims ought to be addressed before


resorting to that, such as inadequate assistance of counsel.


 MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I agree that this


Court's precedents suggest that ineffective assistance of


counsel, cause and prejudice, should be addressed first.

However, this Court has never expressly held that.  Your


Honor, in relation to the question that I've been asked


about, should this Court just remand for consideration of


the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, I would


respectfully suggest that that is not appropriate. 


In this case, Your Honor, the petitioner -­

QUESTION: Why not?  You think that counsel's


performance was adequate here?


 MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I think it was grossly


inadequate.  However, the question presented by the


petitioner in this case, Your Honor, is only whether the


actual innocence exception to the procedural default rule


concerning Federal habeas corpus claims should apply to non-


capital sentence here.


 QUESTION: Yes, but if it's our view that the court


below addressed that out of order too soon when it had an


alternative, certainly we could vacate and remand.


 MR. ALBRITTON: You could, Your Honor.


 QUESTION: Yes.


 MR. ALBRITTON: Again, I would respectfully suggest


that's inappropriate.  The State of Texas could have argued


and presented the court with that particular question, that


is, whether or not the court should have reached cause and


prejudice first.  However, the State of Texas did not ask


the court to consider that claim.

 QUESTION: But we -- we haven't in -- in at least


two or three cases when we have a question of certiorari,


we've said that there's a logically preceding question that


has to be decided before we can get to that.  So it seems to


me this might be that kind of a case.


 MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I am familiar with that


precedent, and I understand that the Court could -­

QUESTION: Well, I guess you'd like your client out


of jail?


 MR. ALBRITTON: That's absolutely correct, Your


Honor, and the state didn't -­

QUESTION: Doesn't sound like it.


 (Laughter.)


 QUESTION: Well, you -- you'd rather do it sooner


rather than later, right?  You'd rather have us say let him


free rather than send it back down and try it all over


again?


 MR. ALBRITTON: Absolutely, Your Honor.


 QUESTION: That seems reasonable.


 MR. ALBRITTON: If it's remanded, he's going to be


incarcerated while it goes back through the court of appeals


and through the district court, and if this Court decides


that, this issue, that it cannot reach the issue presented,


the Court can certainly dismiss this case as improvidently


granted and Mr. Haley will no longer have to suffer under

the danger of this clearly -­

QUESTION: Mr. Albritton, let me -- let me ask you


this. In this case there is a statute that would not have


allowed the additional sentence to be imposed unless these


things were sequential.  Suppose that wasn't the situation. 


Suppose what you are -- we're dealing with was a real


sentencing factor of the sort that a judge can take into


account under a law which says the judge may sentence from


10 to 30 years, all right?


 MR. ALBRITTON: Yes, Your Honor.


 QUESTION: It's up to the judge.  And in sentencing


him to the maximum, the judge makes a mistake of fact.  It


is later found that when the judge said I'm giving him 30


years because, you know, he's been a really bad person in


light of this background, and it turns out that background


didn't exist, all right?  Would you be making the same


argument here?


 MR. ALBRITTON: I absolutely would not, Your Honor. 


As we've argued in our brief -­

QUESTION: That does make it sound like what this


is is Almendarez-Torres, that -- that -- the -- the


difference between the hypothetical I just posed to you and


this case is simply that the law would not allow the


additional time to be imposed unless the fact was found,


whereas in the discretionary case, the law would have

allowed it.


 MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, we do not believe that


the Court need reach Almendarez-Torres.  However, the rule


we propose is certainly consistent with this Court's Sixth


Amendment rule in Apprendi.  It's also consistent with -­

QUESTION: Well, how -- how do you limit it to that


kind of a situation then?  How -- how do you -- how do you


give me the answer that you've just given me, that even


though you -- you -- you show that the judge who imposed a


discretionary sentence was absolutely wrong for the basis on


which he imposed that discretionary sense, you wouldn't


allow that to be reviewed.  Why -- what's the basis for


that?


 MR. ALBRITTON: Several reasons, Your Honor.  First


of all, this Court's decision in Sawyer v. Whitley


specifically adopted an eligibility test, and that


eligibility test draws the line at where that person is


statutorily eligible.  This Court specifically rejected the


notion that it should consider discretionary factors in the


capital context mitigating evidence. 


Thus, Your Honor, our rule about statutory


eligibility is tethered specifically to the Court's ruling


in Sawyer.  Additionally, Your Honor, that rule that we


propose is well-rooted in this Court's habeas doctrine


dating back to Townsend v. Burke, Your Honor.  This Court

has recognized that a sentence that falls -- the severity of


a sentence that falls within a statutory range is not


amenable to habeas review.  Additionally, the recent case,


Your Honor, of Harris v. the United States, where the issue


was whether Apprendi applied to mandatory minimums.  This


Court held -- actually, part of the opinion is a plurality


opinion, but the holding is that the -- it does not matter


if the sentence is more based on some false fact.  The issue


is, is it within range of punishment authorized by the


legislature, Your Honor.


 QUESTION: I understand that.  I just don't


understand why it makes any sense if you've shown and can


know for sure that the only reason the judge imposed the 30


years was that he believed a certain fact was true which in


fact was not true, and that is demonstrated, and he said,


I'm opposing 30 years because of this, otherwise, you know,


this would be a 10-year sentence.  And I -- there's just as


much injustice there, it seems to me.


 MR. ALBRITTON: Well, Your Honor, the difference is


in an error in what constitutes a fundamental miscarriage of


justice, and we would respectfully suggest that when a


sentence is imposed outside of any range authorized by the


legislature, that is fundamentally unjust.


 QUESTION: But the other could be, couldn't it? 


I 

mean, that's -- what I don't understand about this area, and

you've read the cases and so you may able to be clearer than


I am and can correct me, I've thought that the real key


concept is not actual innocence.  It's very hard to apply


that to a sentence.  You're guilty of the crime, you're not


innocent of the sentence.  That doesn't make sense, but


rather manifest injustice, and the key word is manifest. 


And so one could have manifest injustice in


millions of possible situations.  You don't need absolute


clarity as to it applies to in between the guideline but not


beyond the guideline, but the key word is manifest, and it


has to be unjust and injustice first and foremost has to do


with being behind bars when the law says you shouldn't be,


directly and simply, not through some procedural device.


 So thinking about it in that way, I would like you


to tell me what cases of this Court stand as obstacles to


the way I'm thinking about it?


 MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I believe that Sawyer, 


we believe that Sawyer v. Whitley stands as an obstacle to


that approach, because in Sawyer, Your Honor, the Court


specifically rejected the notion that factors that affect


the sentence within the discretion of the sentencing body


are not to be considered in the determination of whether or


not somebody -- or a petitioner is actually innocent of that


sentence.


 QUESTION: You see what I -- what I'm basically

interested in is, is the -- the concept actual innocence


simply a subdivision of the broader concept manifest


injustice?  And so that actual innocence of the crime


itself, where manifest, is a basis for doing whatever


happens in habeas law.  And if I know whether that's a


subdivision, I then would have a better handle on the case.


 MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I -- it is our position


that innocence has been adopted as a touchstone for the


determination of whether or not there is a manifest


injustice.  The Court has determined that that properly


takes into consideration, that focus on innocence takes into


proper consideration the systemic interest in federalism,


comity, and finality. 


Your Honor, although the -- the concept of


innocence of punishment is awkward and recognized, Mr. Haley


is actually innocent of the fact alleged that caused for the


sentence that is more than eight times the statutory -­

QUESTION: Everybody's going to say they're


actually innocent.  All -- I mean, you know, not everybody,


but, you know, a very high percentage of prisoners in prison


say, I was actually innocent, and the prosecution says, no,


you're not actually innocent.  So if that's really an


excuse, actual innocence, and if in fact that's really an


excuse in respect to a sentence, then why wouldn't every


case be open to the Federal habeas judge relitigating the

lawfulness of the conviction in terms of the evidence and


relitigating the sentence in terms of what was reasonable?


 MR. ALBRITTON: Those concerns, Your Honor,


underpin the reason for the high standard of proof in the


first instance, that is, clear and convincing evidence. 


Those concerns also, Your Honor, inform the reason for the


rule we proposed, and that is there is only a fundamental


miscarriage of justice when a sentence is imposed that under


the true facts no sentencing body, judge or jury, could have


ever done.


 QUESTION: All right.  In your view, under the true


facts, a prisoner says the true facts are X, the state says


the true facts are not X, and what's supposed to happen?


 MR. ALBRITTON: The court has to decide if the


petitioner has shown by clear and convincing evidence that


he or she, but for a constitutional violation, would not


have been eligible for that sentence.


 QUESTION: So -- so in your -- in your view, every


crime in a state court and every sentence in a state court,


at least a big subset, are open to relitigation in the


Federal court on the standard of whether there is clear and


convincing evidence that adds the factual matters, it was


that the -- the state court was wrong?


 MR. ALBRITTON: No, Your Honor, not a large subset,


only the subset of cases where the petitioner receives a

sentence for which he or she is statutorily ineligible.


 QUESTION: In -- in your -- in your view, Mr.


Albritton, there's no requirement that this evidence be


newly discovered, I take it?


 MR. ALBRITTON: That is correct, Your Honor.


 QUESTION: Mr. Albritton, it's a small subset of


the state court cases, but it's a -- it's a -- it's a total


-- it's not a subset at all of the Federal cases, right? 


Because we have a guideline system where, by statute, you


are not allowed to impose any more than what the guidelines


permit, right?


 MR. ALBRITTON: That's not actually entirely


accurate, Your Honor.


 QUESTION: Well, unless you -- sure, you -- you can


make a finding that -- where that finding hasn't been made


that this is somehow extraordinary, you cannot, by law,


impose more than a certain amount of sentence.


 MR. ALBRITTON: In the -- in the Federal context,


Your Honor, there are two things that are operating.  One


are the guidelines, but the second is the statutory range of


punishment.  The legislature has determined that within the


application of the guidelines, that a sentence, up until and


including the statutory maximum under some circumstances is


appropriate.


 QUESTION: Oh no.

 QUESTION: Yeah, but this guideline says the


statute says, Judge, you must apply the guideline range


unless.  Now, there are many situations where it isn't even


arguably unless, okay?


 MR. ALBRITTON: Yes, sir.


 QUESTION: So that means there is a statutory


requirement that the judge impose the guideline sentence,


four extra units or points if you had a gun, say.  The


prisoner says, I didn't have a gun.  The state says, I did


have a gun.  And now you want to relitigate whether he had a


gun or didn't have a gun, whether the victim was seriously


hurt or only gravely hurt, whether there was a threat or a


brandishment or an actual use of the gun, all of which add


points, and what you're saying is all of those things would


be relitigated in a habeas court, as long as the prisoner


colorably can say, I have evidence that will show clearly


and convincingly the judge was wrong.


 MR. ALBRITTON: That is not correct, Your Honor. 


Under the rule we propose, the Federal court would only have


to engage in this exercise if the petitioner could establish


by the requisite proof that he or she received a sentence


above the statutory maximum.  While it may be error in the


application of the guidelines and there can be factual


inaccuracies -­

knew you were saying that, but I think Justice Scalia's


question was that he can't find, nor can I find, a logical


basis for making that distinction.  That's the problem. 


QUESTION:  The sentence is unlawful if it goes


above the guidelines, which is why it can be set aside by


the appellate court.  It is unlawful.


 MR. ALBRITTON: Your -- Your Honor, the difference


between unlawful and a fundamentally unjust is an important


distinction.  As this Court has historically held from the


early notions of habeas when, even when habeas review in the


first right, regardless of default, was much more


circumspect, the Court could always reach and always issue


the writ where a petitioner received a sentence that is


outside the statutory range.  So it's a difference in the -­

a situation where there may be an error and there may be


some injustice, and a situation where the -- the injustice


is fundamental, Your Honor. That's the distinction.


 QUESTION: Mr. Albritton, there's -- there's one


misfit here.  You -- you're trying to transpose to the


sentencing area the actual innocence of the crime, precedent


from the death penalty area.  But this Court has said in


Herrera that the actual innocence, first it has to be new


evidence, and second, that it's only a gateway.  And you


say, well, sure, it's only a gateway here, the gateway is


Jackson, sufficiency of the evidence.  But the very same

thing that proves the actual innocence of the sentence is


what establishes that you win on the constitutional point. 


And in the -- in the death cases, there isn't that -- this


is not overlap, this is total coincidence.


 MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, in this Court's opinion


last week in Banks v. Dretke, the Court recognized, as it


had previously in Stickler v. Greene -- Strickler v. Greene,


that it is not unusual for the same facts to be used and an


overlap between those facts for the inquiry as to whether or


not the merits of the claim can be reached and the merits of


the claim.  As the Court held in Banks last week, Your


Honor, the -- the same evidence was used to establish both


cause and prejudice, as well as the underlying merits of the


-- of the Brady violation.


 It's not surprising that the same evidence would


be involved in this situation, Your Honor, because, after


all, the inquiry is extremely similar, and that is the


innocence of the petitioner and whether or not the state


proved as a due process matter the allegations that it was


required to.


 Your Honor, this -- this rule is a narrow rule for


the reasons we discussed.  It does not reach the sentencing


guideline issues.  This holding under Apprendi -- under -­

this Court's holding in Apprendi, Your Honor, requires all


elements other than arguably some or some recidivist

allegations under Almendarez-Torres are required to be


alleged and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt so


that if a person is charged with a drug offense and the


difference in 50 grams and 51 grams affects the statutory


maximum, his or her actual innocence of that quantity is


already covered subject to -- subject -- is already subject


to the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception


irrespective of what the court holds in the application of


Sawyer to non-capital sentences.


 QUESTION: What -- and what -- what's your


authority for that?  Where -- where have we said that?  Is


that part of your submission or are you saying that that's


existing authority?


 MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, that's -- first of all,


I believe, Your Honor, the Government just conceded that. 


Secondly, Your Honor -­

QUESTION: But do you know on what basis?


 MR. ALBRITTON: Yes, sir.  This Court has held in


Schlup -­

QUESTION: Okay.


 MR. ALBRITTON: -- that if you're actually innocent


of the elements of the offense, then -- and you're able to


establish that -- then the fundamental miscarriage of


justice exception applies.  If the quantity of cocaine is an


element of the offense for Apprendi purposes -­

QUESTION: And that goes back to the Almendarez-


Torres discussion you had with Justice Scalia?


 MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, it -- no, sir, it does


not, because Almendarez-Torres only concerns certain


recidivist allegations.  Apprendi applies to every other


factors that raises -­

QUESTION: I -- I -­

MR. ALBRITTON: -- the statutory maximum.  Your


Honor, this rule can -- the exception that we're talking


about can be administered with relative ease.  As the Court


discussed in Sawyer, that's an important consideration in


determining whether or not the exception should be applied. 


The issue presented to a Federal district judge of actual


innocence of a non-capital sentence is easier to determine


and it's more objective than, for instance, the


determination Federal district judges are called upon to


determine whether or not a petitioner is statutorily


eligible for the death penalty. 


For instance, in the State of Texas, the state


must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner


constitutes a future danger.  In the State of Louisiana, for


instance, the state has to -- one of the statutory

aggravating factors are that the crime was committed in a


heinous manner.  Those inquiries are more subjective and


less objective than the inquiry required under the


application the -- of the exception that we propose.


 Additionally, Your Honors, the equities weigh


strongly in favor of applying the rule in non-capital


sentences.  Justice Scalia asked a question as to why this


rule may be necessary because there would always be


ineffective assistance of counsel, and frankly there's an


answer to that.  And that answer is, there will not always


be a meritorious -- under a meritorious claim and there will


not necessarily be ineffective assistance of counsel for one


reason at least, and that is, under Carrier, this Court held


that to rely on the ineffective assistance of counsel as


cause in Federal court, that claim had to have been raised


below in the state court. 


So there could be a scenario, this scenario, if


Mr. Haley had not properly raised ineffective assistance of


counsel below in state habeas or on state appeal as required


by state law, he would not be entitled to rely on that


ineffective assistance of counsel for cause in Federal


court, and so the court would be presented again with this


fundamentally unjust situation.


 QUESTION: Well, and there are also cases under


Feretta where the defendant decides to represent himself.

 MR. ALBRITTON: That is correct, Your Honor.  Your


Honor, what is unusual about this case additionally, as


pointed out by the Court, the prosecutors -- we're -- we


don't suggest purposefully -- but the prosecutors


nevertheless caused the injustice in this case.  The State


of Texas prop -- improperly alleged that Mr. Haley's second


conviction or second prior offense was committed before -­

or after the first became final.


 QUESTION: Well, are -- would you say, taking it


from there to the future dangerous, that the -- the


prosecutor was in error in the sense you refer to if he


alleged that the petitioner is going to be a future danger? 


Are all these allegations just going to be turned out that


way?


 MR. ALBRITTON: Not necessarily, Your Honor,


because a prosecutor in good faith could certainly believe


that the evidence would be sufficient to prove future


dangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt.


 QUESTION: Well, are -- are you suggesting the


prosecutor in this case deliberately, when he alleged the


thing, knew that it was not -- wouldn't stand up?


 MR. ALBRITTON: I'm not suggesting that, Your


Honor.  However -­

QUESTION: But then -- but then it really isn't a


basis for distinguishing the two examples I gave you for

just you to say, well, in the first case the prosecutor


acted in good faith.


 MR. ALBRITTON: Even if the prosecutor did not do


this intentionally, Your Honor, the error and the injustice


originated with the prosecutor.  Not only did the prosecutor


--

QUESTION: Well, but you could say that about an


allegation of future dangerous too.  You have the -- that's


alleged in the complaint, isn't it?


 MR. ALBRITTON: If future dangerousness is alleged,


in reviewing the evidence there's a good faith belief to


believe that there -- that person constitutes a future


danger, that would be different than in this situation where


all the prosecutor had to do was look at its state's exhibit


number 6, Your Honor, and read the dates.  The prosecutor


could have discerned -­

QUESTION: Well, or the defendant's attorney could


have done that too, I suppose.


 MR. ALBRITTON: Absolutely, and he should have,


Your Honor.  Additionally, Your Honor, one of the -- the


reasons for the narrow fundamental miscarriage of justice


exception is this notion of gamesmanship, and as pointed out


in the briefs, it is our position that there would never be


any rational incentive for a petitioner to engage in


gamesmanship when there was conclusive evidence that

established he or she was not statutorily eligible for the


sentence.


 Mr. Haley's case is a perfect example.  Even


though Mr. Haley was diligent and filed his state writ very


shortly after the court of criminal appeals in Texas denied


discretionary review, he's ended up spending 4 years more in


prison than he was even authorized for under the statute. 


Additionally, Your Honor, in discussing the


state's interest in this case, it is the Federal habeas


court that in actuality is vindicating the Texas substantive


law.  Now that does not mean, of course, that there is no


interest of the state in its procedural laws.  However, that


recognition indicates that, in effect, there's a wash of the


interest here, which would not undermine the application of


the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception in this


context.


 QUESTION: And it's -- it's a little, I suppose,


patronizing in -- in some sense for us to say that the


district courts, Federal courts are vindicating Texas'


interest in its own laws, although it's pretty obvious Texas


doesn't care about it in this case.


 MR. ALBRITTON: Certainly the -- the state doesn't


seem to care about that interest with its position here. 


However, I don't think it's -- we do not think it's


patronizing, Your Honor, because the Court is always

required to balance the equities of the situation and


determine whether the exception to the procedural default


rule should apply.  And in this case, we think that it is


quite relevant that you're discussing -- and it would be so


in all cases such as this that, under the rule we propose,


because the sentence would always be outside the range


authorized by the legislature for this particular conduct.


 Your Honors, in relation, briefly here at the end


to Almendarez-Torres, we agree with the Solicitor General


that if Almendarez-Torres does not control, then this case


is -- is very easy and there need not be any application of


Sawyer, and that is because, as I said earlier, he would be


actually innocent of the enhanced offense of theft by


habitual offender.  As pointed out in our brief, Almendarez-


Torres is not controlling because in this case there is an


additional -- there is something else that must be proven in


addition to the fact of the prior convictions, and that is


the date of the commission of the second prior felony


offense.  For that reason -­

QUESTION: Well, isn't that pretty much the tail


wagging the -- the tail wagging the dog, I mean, if -- if


you say that the date of the offense is -- is a separate


element?


 MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, the State of Texas in


its judgment specifically required not only the -- in this

circumstance, not only the existence of two prior felony


convictions, but that the second was committed after, excuse


me, the conviction of the first.


 QUESTION: Yes, but you're -- you're telling us


that the -- that the existence of the prior offense is not


an element, right, but -- but that the date of the prior


offense is -- is -­

MR. ALBRITTON: That -- that is incorrect, Your


Honor.  What we allege is that it is not the focus on the


sequence of the convictions.  When sequence is used, it is


shorthand to describe the -- when the second offense was


committed, and the date of commission of that offense is


something separate and apart from the fact of those prior -­

of that prior conviction.  So, Your Honor, we would


respectfully suggest that takes this outside of Almendarez-


Torres, and therefore the Court can -- can determine that


Mr. Haley is actually innocent of the enhanced offense of


theft by habitual offender.


 Finally, Your Honor, in conclusion, I would


respectfully request the Court not to remand to the State of


Texas -- excuse me, to the courts below, unless it reaches


the question presented and decides it contrary to the Fifth


Circuit.  If the Court decides that the ineffective


assistance of counsel claim should have -- or cause and


prejudice should have been reached first, since it was not

presented in the question presented, the Court should not


reach any issue in this case.  Mr. Haley should be able to


go about his life and not be subject to a day more in prison


that the state concedes is unlawful, and as the court


advised -- as the state advised the district court, if this


Court were to reverse, it intends to put Mr. Haley back in


prison for an additional 10 years that it specifically


admits is unlawful and not authorized by the legislature,


and a remand presumably would result in the same sort of


injustice visited upon Mr. Haley by the state. 


For those reasons, Your Honor, I respectfully


suggest that the Court affirm the judgment of the Fifth


Circuit and hold that Mr. Haley has sufficiently established


that he is actually innocent, reach the merits of the claim,


and -- and that's the only issue the Court needs to resolve. 


Thank you very much.


 QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Albritton.


 Mr. Cruz, you have three minutes remaining.


 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 MR. CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  I'd like


to quickly revisit an exchange Justice Scalia had with Mr.


Albritton concerning Almendarez-Torres, and make the point


that even if this Court were at some future date to decide


to overrule Almendarez-Torres, which I don't believe is

presented in this case, that would not necessarily mean that


the actual innocence exception would extend to non-capital


sentencing.  The inquiries are altogether different.  The


former, what was at -- the case at common law at the time of


the founding.  The latter is, as the exchange illuminated, a


question of what 28 U.S.C. Section 2254 provides. 


And I would note 2255, with respect to Federal


habeas, explicitly includes in its statutory text as one of


the grounds for granting habeas that a sentence is, quote,


in excess of the maximum authorized by law.  That's in 2255. 


It is not in 2254.  The only ground for granting habeas in


2254 with respect to a state conviction is if someone is


held in custody of violation of the laws or Constitution of


the United States.


 And so it is altogether possible that this Court


could decide at some future date to -- to overrule


Almendarez-Torres and then yet nonetheless decide that in


looking to the ends of justice that now repeal language from


the habeas statute, that there is not an obligation to


excuse procedural default for every single conceivable


sentencing error.


 QUESTION: But can I -- I just -- this is a case in


which you yourself concede he shouldn't be in jail under the


substantive law of Texas, and it is a case where you


yourself agree there is a very big claim that the lawyer was

incompetent.  If we send this back, is Texas going to move


to revoke his bail?


 MR. CRUZ: The -- the state is willing to allow the


ineffective assistance case to be litigated before


proceeding to reincarcerate Mr. Haley, so we will wait until


that -- that claim is resolved before -- before -­

QUESTION: He's out while it's being litigated?


 MR. CRUZ: He -- he is out right now and the state


will leave him out until his claim is resolved with respect


to that.  With respect to the balance, which is -- which is


ultimately how this Court has analyzed the actual innocence


exception, on the one side I would submit there is very


limited need for extending the actual innocence exception to


non-capital sentencing.  Cause and prejudice can address


situations where relief is merited, such as perhaps Mr.


Haley's.


 On the other side, there is the risk of expanding


that.  Non-capital sentencing, unlike actual innocence, I


didn't do it, of the crime, unlike actual innocence of


death, non-capital sentencing is virtually ubiquitous. 


Interestingly, Mr. Haley's amici law professors in footnote


13 of their brief acknowledge the ability of the slippery


slope to extend beyond just increasing the statutory maximum


to sentences within a range and to a whole host of factors


that the states used for sentencing factors, facts -­

52 

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc. 





factors such as the amount of drugs, such as the value of


stolen goods, such as the status of a victim, whether the


victim is elderly, whether the victim is a police officer.


 QUESTION: What has been the -- the experience in


the circuits that have adopted this rule applying the actual


innocence to sentencing?  There are two circuits, aren't


there?


 MR. CRUZ: There have been relatively few cases


that have come up since those decisions, but I would note


first of all we don't know what unpublished decisions are


out there, and secondly, there's a significant difference


between a circuit decision allowing an exception and a


decision of this Court.


 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Cruz.  The


case is submitted.


 (Whereupon, at 11:11 p.m., the case in the above-


entitled matter was submitted.)
