CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We’ll hear argument 

next this morning in Case Number 08-810, Conkright v. 

(11:16 a.m.) 

Frommert. 

Mr. Long. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR. 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. LONG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

In this ERISA case, the court of appeals 

applied a deferential standard of review to the 

district court's interpretation of the Xerox plan, but 

not to the plan administrator's interpretation.  We 

think the court of appeals got it backwards. 

Under either a deferential standard of 

review or a de novo standard, the plan administrator's 

interpretation should prevail.  That interpretation, 

unlike the district court's interpretation, is 

grounded in the language of the plan.  It recognizes 

the fundamental actuarial principle of the time value 

of money, and it avoids conferring windfalls. 

In Firestone and Glenn, this Court looked to 

the language of the plan, which reflects the intent of 

the plan's sponsor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  But -- but when the 

administrator has interpreted the plan incorrectly and 

the court finds -- the court of appeals finds that he 

has interpreted it incorrectly, it doesn't have to 

send it back and say, you know:  Give me another bid; 

try something else.  It says:  You did it incorrectly, 

and we find that what you should have done is this. 

Isn't that what normally happens? 

MR. LONG:  Well, we think under trust law, 

which the Court has looked to in Glenn and Firestone, 

where the plan of the settlor of the trust has 

assigned the responsibility for making the 

discretionary determinations to the plan administrator 

or to the trustee, unless there's been a showing of 

bad faith or some other reason to think that the 

discretion will not be exercised honestly and fairly, 

it -- it is really up to the plan administrator to 

make that discretionary determination. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So all a court can do in 

those trust cases is to say:  You've got it wrong, 

Sam; go back and do it again.  Right? 

MR. LONG:  Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And he gets it wrong again, 

and he goes back to court; the court says:  Sam, it's 

still wrong; go back and do it again.

MR. LONG:  Well, we --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I can't believe that that's 

what the law is. 

MR. LONG:  We think these situations of 

the -- of the multiple bites at the apple will be 

rare.  Trust law has had this rule for decades, and 

that has not been a problem --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, the SG says that 

isn't trust law.  The SG says that trust law -- when 

you make a mistake and you send it back, that the 

district judge has a choice here, which would make 

sense.  The district judge, if he thinks he’s going to 

get something out of the trust -- the administrator, 

listens to him. 

I mean, it sounds like common sense would 

be:  Listen to the administrator, but you don't have 

to do it. 

MR. LONG:  Well, I --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because it's very 

complicated.  He may understand it. 

MR. LONG:  I'd -- I'd have a two-part 

answer, Justice Breyer --

be -- it would be quite unusual to say the standard of 

review is up to the court, that it can be either --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's not -- it's not a 

standard of review.  It's -- he's trying to figure out 

what the word "duplicative" means, okay?  And the --

and the administrator did his best.  He says it means 

what it meant before, which is, like, 14 pages of 

who-could-understand-it.  Okay. 

MR. LONG:  Well -- well, but --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And then it turns out that 

that isn't what it means, and the district judge says: 

That's affirmed.  So now he says:  Give me another 

shot. 

If it were me, I’d listen, but if I thought 

this isn't really that great, I would try to figure 

out something else.  And then if I were a court of 

appeals judge, I’d say it's up to the district court. 

MR. LONG:  But --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, luckily, the SG says 

that is the law. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. LONG:  Well, but Professor Scott, who 

was the reporter for both the second and the first

JUSTICE BREYER:  Says it isn't the law. 

MR. LONG:  The section numbers correlate 

exactly with the sections of the Restatement for which 

he was reporter.  If you look in section 187 of his 

treatise, which correlates with section 187 of the 

Restatement Second, the principle is that unless 

there's been bad faith or some other reason to expect 

that the trustee will not exercise the discretion 

fairly and honestly -- I mean, there -- and there are 

examples, illustrations 11 and 12.  If -- if the 

amount is unreasonably low --

JUSTICE BREYER:  What about just that?  He 

came back, the administrator, I think, the second 

time, with something that very closely resembled the 

first time. 

MR. LONG:  Well, I think it’s --

JUSTICE BREYER:  And what about that for a 

reason thinking he’s not in that good of faith? 

Go ahead. 

MR. LONG:  I think it’s quite different, 

with -- with respect, Justice Breyer.  The -- the 

reconstructed account methodology really looked to the 

performance of a hypothetical account, but the -- what

we call the plan administrator's interpretation, the 

interpretation that came up for the first time after 

the Second Circuit, overruling the district court, 

said, you know, this plan provision that clearly tells 

you how to do it is actually invalid --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if there’s no --

MR. LONG:  -- because it wasn't properly 

disclosed. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  If there's no bad faith, 

then how many shots does the plan administrator -- who 

I don't think is named Sam -- gets to --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- to try to answer this 

question? 

MR. LONG:  Well, we think the standard 

is that if -- as long as there is discretion to be 

exercised within the limits that would be set by the 

court's opinion, absent a showing of bad faith or 

other reason to think the discretion won't be 

exercised honestly and fairly, it ought to be left to 

the plan administrator, because that's what the plan 

provides. 

Now, I think --

MR. LONG:  Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- referring to Scott, but 

-- that this case -- what I took away from the Second 

Circuit's opinion was the flaw here was not that the 

method was no good if you had adequate notice; the 

flaw was the people affected were not told in what is 

the language of ERISA, in plain, simple language, what 

their entitlement was.  And that's -- that's the 

problem, not that this method wasn't perfectly 

satisfactory if you gave everybody notice.  But the 

Second Circuit said, you didn't give them notice. 

Either it said nothing or it was totally ambiguous. 

MR. LONG:  Yes, and that's right at the 

heart of the case, and you are quite correct.  The 

Second Circuit did say there was not adequate notice 

of the reconstructed account methodology, but it's an 

important part of our submission that the plan 

administrator's interpretation on remand is 

significantly different. 

This is the way these offsets are typically 

done.  There’s nothing hypothetical about it.  You 

take the lump sum that was actually paid to these plan 

participants.  You look to the annuity that could have 

been purchased with that lump sum, using the annuity 

rates that are put out by the Federal government, by

This is the typical way this offset is 

performed.  This is -- falls within the safe harbor, 

the chief actuaries have filed an amicus brief saying 

this is quite typical, so this --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if -- if there were 

information, but the -- the ERISA provision says that 

you are supposed to give the summary description of 

the plan “in a manner calculated to be understood by 

the average plan participant.” 

MR. LONG:  Yes, yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And all that the 1989 

statement said was the amount the employees received 

may be reduced, if they previously left the company 

and received a distribution at that time. 

MR. LONG:  Yes.  And the -- and the Second 

Circuit did not decide this question of whether the 

notice of the plan administrator's interpretation was 

sufficient, and -- but we think there are very strong 

arguments that it -- that it was. 

I mean, first of all, it did describe the 

circumstances in which there could be an offset, which 

is what the statute and the regulation requires. 

And, second, it is the law in the Second 

Circuit, as elsewhere, that in a summary plan

description -- which is just that, a summary -- you 

need not describe in detail every offset and every 

actuarial adjustment.  There are many such adjustments 

in ERISA plans.  They frequently apply to relatively 

small numbers of participants. 

If it were a requirement of the statute that 

each of these be described in detail in a summary plan 

description, you would risk defeating the purpose of 

the summary plan description and invalidating many 

ERISA plans across the country. 

So we would urge the Court, strongly, not to 

accept this argument that, oh, well, you know, if 

the -- if the notice of the reconstructed account 

methodology is inadequate, then it must also be the 

case that the notice of this different -- I would say 

“plain vanilla” kind of offset -- typical offset, must 

also be inadequate.  We don't think that is true --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why -- this is 

important to me, whether the plan administrator was 

interpreting the same language when this case was 

remanded back down.  Originally, he was simply 

applying the methodology that had been specified in 

1990, right? 

MR. LONG:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.

no good because you didn't give these people notice of 

it.  But that -- he had been applying that test not 

since 1990, but since 1980.  In other words, he had 

taken that to be a reasonable interpretation of the 

very summary language in -- in the plan itself, right? 

MR. LONG:  That is absolutely correct, and 

at the time that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So when it went back, why 

didn't he stick with that and say:  Yes, they didn't 

have adequate notice of that, but that is still a 

reasonable interpretation of the original plan, even 

before we specified that. 

MR. LONG:  When it went back on remand from 

the Second Circuit the first time, the plan 

administrator adopted a -- a new interpretation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes. 

MR. LONG:  That is what I'm calling the 

“plain vanilla” --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand that.  Why did 

he do that?  Inasmuch as the first interpretation was 

not adopted in 1990, but it was adopted under the same 

language that he is now interpreting in 1980, right? 

He was applying it between 1980 and 1990.  That's what 

he thought he -- that's what he thought the plan meant 

in all those years.

MR. LONG:  Well -- and there was a provision 

in the plan that specifically told him to do the 

offset in this way, and the Second Circuit --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  After 1990. 

MR. LONG:  Well, no.  It was also in the 

plan before 1990.  It --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, I didn't understand.  I 

didn't understand it. 

MR. LONG:  Yes.  A lot of this case started 

because it got dropped out of the 1989 restatement, by 

accident, for a period of 3 months, and all of these 

dire consequences are really flowing from that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, your -- your brief 

says:  "The Plan Administrator has consistently 

applied the reconstructed account methodology since 

the early '80s." 

MR. LONG:  Yes, that's correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  "Effective April '90" 

-- "1990, the Plan language requiring this methodology 

provided as follows."  So I took that to mean there 

was no such language before that? 

MR. LONG:  There -- there was.  Yes.

requiring it before 1990.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay. 

MR. LONG:  Yes, and that's another important 

point in this complicated case.  I mean, the only 

period in which this -- what we call the reconstructed 

account methodology that gave specific instructions 

about how to do it, so we say it was not at all 

unreasonable for the plan administrator to follow 

those specific instructions. 

It dropped out in this 1989 restatement for 

a very short period and then got put back in.  And 

that's -- the Second Circuit said, well, then you get 

into problems with anti-cutback and different types of 

things, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But where is it --

what -- what was in the summary plan description on 

this point between 1980 and 1990, where is that? 

MR. LONG:  There were a variety of summary 

plan descriptions, obviously, and I think, in general, 

Justice Ginsburg, they simply had the statement that 

your benefit may be reduced, if you have received a 

prior distribution. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Right.  So there was no 

description of this in the summary plan description? 

MR. LONG:  That's -- that is correct, during 

that period, although, again --

period?  Between 1980 and 1990 or the 3-month period ­

-

MR. LONG:  It was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- you’re talking about? 

MR. LONG:  I think it was really in about 

1995.  The descriptions got gradually more detailed, 

as we go into the 1990s, but through the '80s and up 

into the -- I think until about 1995 or so, there 

would have been simply a statement that your benefit 

may be reduced --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  That's -- that's 

what I thought, and I thought you said no when I asked 

that question, that this detailed description of the 

RAM didn't come in until 1990. 

MR. LONG:  Oh -- well, I'm sorry if I 

misunderstood you, Justice Scalia.  I was talking 

about the language of the plan, and we are, after all, 

talking about benefits due under the terms of the 

plan.  And the plan did include this specific 

reconstructed account methodology, except for the 

3-month period. 

Now, the summary plan description had a --

Official 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I got you. 

MR. LONG:  An additional point on this, 

Justice Scalia, is -- I mean, this is a claim for 

benefits due under the terms of the plan, and, you 

know, there -- there’s actually a circuit split on 

this.  But if the claim is something like, well, a 

summary plan description wasn't good enough; it didn't 

contradict the plan, and it told me the circumstances 

in which the benefits might be reduced, but it didn't 

tell me how -- and, that's just not good enough. 

Often, you have to make some sort of showing 

of reliance and prejudice, so it's really --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you seem to be 

rearguing the -- I thought that the -- I thought that 

you had surrendered on -- what is it called?  Frommert 

I.  That -- that the Second Circuit said:  What you 

had was no good, because it violated the notice 

provision and it violated the anti-cutback provision. 

So that's what they call a phantom --

MR. LONG:  Right. 


JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- account.  It's out. 


MR. LONG:  They call it phantom accounting.

to now be telling us that was really a wrong decision 

on the Second Circuit's part, that there was -- that 

it was perfectly good, that it was described in the 

plan itself, although not in the summary plan 

description. 

MR. LONG:  Well -- well, no, and I -- I 

mean, what happened is for the plaintiffs in this 

case, they were hired after the -- rehired after the 

1989 restatement went into effect, and so that's when 

this -- when this provision that specifically 

described the reconstructed account methodology was 

dropped out, and that's when all the trouble started. 

The only reason I was mentioning the 

reconstructed account methodology was trying to 

address Justice Scalia's question, although I may have 

confused it further to say that the plan, the terms of 

the plan, did include this specific provision, so it 

was not crazy for the plan administrator to be 

following that. 

Now, it was struck down by the Second 

Circuit, invalidated, and the plan administrator is 

not seeking to challenge that on remand; obviously, 

they can't.  But coming up with a  --

is not the same text that they invalidated --

MR. LONG:  Absolutely.  It's the remaining 

-- 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- but rather it's the plan 

without this text. 

MR. LONG:  Absolutely.  It's the remaining 

plan terms; there is a new interpretive question here, 

which is:  How do we make sense of the remaining plan 

terms, now that the Second Circuit -- unlike the plan 

administrator, unlike the district court -- has held 

that this provision that specifically addresses this 

is invalid and can't be used.  And that is really a 

new interpretive question that came up in litigation. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's -- it struck me if --

it's hard.  I don't necessarily follow it at all, but 

the -- you had this original plan where, basically, 

you were trying to figure out how much money they took 

away, and you compared it with what it would have made 

if you had invested it in certain funds.  So now we 

have a new word, which is called "duplicative"; you 

can't be duplicative, something like that. 

And then the Second Circuit says that new 

word called “duplicative” for new plans doesn't really 

pick up this old phantom system; at least, it doesn't 

give notice.

Now he sends it back, and the poor district 

judge, since he thought that was perfectly sensible to 

say it did pick that up, says:  Well, they told me it 

didn't, so I’ll ask the administrator what do you 

think we do now?  The administrator says:  I have a 

great idea; the plain vanilla system.  The plain 

vanilla system happens to be very much like the old 

system, except in following your own funds, you’re not 

doing it; you’re following the -- the insurance 

industry's funds. 

MR. LONG:  Well, --

what they’ll pay for an annuity.

they’ll earn. 

MR. LONG:  Well, I mean, just a couple of 

points in response, Justice --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right. 

MR. LONG:  I mean, first of all, it's not 

just the word "duplication" or "non-duplication." 

Section 9.6, which is on page 32a of the Joint 

Appendix, says that if there has been a prior 

distribution, the accrued benefit based on all the

years of participation --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Right. 

MR. LONG:  -- shall be offset by the accrued 

benefit attributable to such distribution. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  Correct, and the 

question is:  What is attributable to?  And they 

struck down your phantom system for doing it, and then 

the administrator comes back with a new system, which 

new system is going to take the judgment of the 

insurance companies about what was accrued. 

MR. LONG:  Well, no, Your Honor, the 

judgment of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation 

was what -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right, fine. 

And then what he's thinking is that's 

awfully similar.  We just substituted different people 

here --

MR. LONG:  Well, but -- but, I mean, it's 

similar in a sense that I think is clearly favorable 

to the plan --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's similar in a sense, 

and it's different in a sense. 

MR. LONG:  I mean, if I could -- this is a 

floor-offset plan, and the basic concept of the floor­

offset plan is to give a kind of an insurance policy,

that if the defined contribution plan performs poorly, 

the defined benefit component of the plan will 

guarantee that you get a certain minimum benefit.  And 

so the way the thing works, if the defined 

contribution balance is above the defined benefit, 

then your defined contribution is your benefit.  And 

that's good.  That means you have exceeded the floor. 

And what happened here is -- this whole 

thing -- we are calculating the defined benefit, the 

floor.  That's what we are doing, and we are trying to 

figure out what sort of offset do you take into 

account because these people got lump sums; in some 

cases quite, quite large.  Mr. Frommert got almost 

$145,000 10 or 20 years ago. 

So if -- the notion is, if Mr. Frommert had 

continued working for Xerox throughout his career, 

this money would have continued to grow; it would have 

increased his defined contribution benefit; and he 

would have not needed to use his insurance policy. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But the -- the more you 

hypothetically grow it, the less chance they’ll get 

the floor. 

MR. LONG:  But -- and the key point --

MR. LONG:  But the key point, if I -- yes. 

But the key point is he had the use of this money for 

all these years. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true. 

MR. LONG:  And -- and it is a fundamental 

principle of pensions, of ERISA, that there is a time 

value of money.  And if you accept this interpretation 

that the district court adopted, and then the court of 

appeals said:  Well, we will just give it deferential 

review; we won't even give it de novo review, it's --

it's, you know, one reasonable interpretation among 

many --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are you saying it's -- and 

these categories don't often help us.  Is this a 

question of law?  A mixed question of law and fact? 

MR. LONG:  Well, I think, in terms of 

whether this is a reasonable interpretation of the 

terms of the plan, it is a question of law.  And I 

think it is unreasonable -- I mean, certainly, looking 

at the plan language, there is plan language that does 

speak to this, and then also, I mean, this --

MR. LONG:  But it's a claim for benefits due 

under the terms of the plan. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, yes. 

MR. LONG:  You know, I read you the 

language.  “Accrued benefit” is a defined term in the 

plan. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's the statutory 

term?  "Benefits due under the terms of the plan" is a 

statutory term? 

MR. LONG:  Yes.  Yes.  So, that -- that's 

what we’re talking about.  The Solicitor General 

agrees with us that if you’re talking about the terms 

of the plan, even if you’re trying to fashion a remedy 

for a violation of ERISA, that is still a de novo 

review question, and there would be terrible problems 

with uniformity of plan interpretation if you said, 

oh, well, you know, it's just a discretionary kind of 

review; let's let every district court interpret this 

plan in its own fashion. 

But -- but the notion of having --

rate, which is -- I mean, the chief actuary's brief 

says they have never in their entire careers, none of 

them, have ever seen an ERISA plan that does that. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Up until this time? 

MR. LONG:  Well, until the district court 

said it was a reasonable interpretation of this plan. 

And, in fact --

JUSTICE ALITO:  If this is not a 

discretionary decision for the district court -- let's 

assume it's not a discretionary decision for the --

for the administrator.  But if it's -- and if it's 

also not a discretionary decision for the district 

court, if what the district court is required to do is 

to say what the plan means, what would you suggest 

that the district court should have looked to, when 

the -- the provision, the -- the plan language that 

the district court has to look at is very bare bones? 

MR. LONG:  Well, but you -- absolutely you 

start with the language, and we don't think it is 

quite that bare bones.  The section 9.6, which says 

the offset is the accrued benefit attributable to the 

prior distribution, and then section 1.1, which is the 

definition of "accrued benefit," and that basically 

says it is the normal retirement benefit payable at 

normal retirement date at age 65 in an amount computed

And then 4.3 says the monthly benefit which 

could be purchased with the member's transitional 

retirement account -- that's the defined contribution 

account -- as calculated using -- using annuity rates 

established by the PBGC. 

So it's not quite that bare-bones.  But then 

we would also say -- you would look to this notion 

that the time value of money is an absolutely central 

concept to pensions, and the notion of people would 

have use of money for 10 years or 20 years at a 

zero interest rate -- and indeed, it's -- it's even 

worse than that because, I mean, ultimately this has 

to be expressed in the form of an annuity. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Respondents say that 

this was a -- sure, it's a -- a benefit to them to 

be -- to have this offset only by the amount that they 

received and not take into account the time value of 

money, but this was an incentive that lured them into 

accepting employment again with Xerox. 

MR. LONG:  Well, with -- with respect, 

Justice Alito, that is absolutely ridiculous.  I mean, 

no employer would do that to their current employees. 

That would treat the current employees like suckers.

evidence that that happened.  I don't know of any case 

in which that has ever happened. 

I mean, you can give people a bonus --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How does it -- how does 

it hurt the current employees? 

MR. LONG:  Well, if you --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You say they -- they 

don't get this --

MR. LONG:  If you said to the current 

employees -- I mean, basically, Mr. Frommert, to take 

him as an example, he's -- I mean, if someone who is 

otherwise similarly situated to him had just kept 

working for Xerox, they would not have needed the 

insurance policy, either.  Their defined contribution 

account would have been above the floor, and so they 

would get their defined contribution account. 

Mr. Frommert had the use of all this money 

for all these years.  We don't know what he invested 

it in, but presumably it grew in the investments.  But 

under the district court's interpretation, he --

nothing -- no deduction from the current workforce. 

They’re getting what the plan said all along is the 

right calculation of benefits. 

MR. LONG:  Yes.  And -- and that's what the 

plan administrator's interpretation is trying to 

achieve as closely as possible for the rehires.  It's 

trying to treat them the same. 

If there are no further questions, I’d like 

to reserve --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  One -- well, I thought you 

said what this affects is just the floor; it doesn't 

affect the level of the -- of the defined 

contribution. 

MR. LONG:  Absolutely, Justice Scalia, the 

defined contribution.  Now, in this case, for Mr. 

Frommert, for example, was this large lump sum that he 

got. 

I mean, another fact I’ll mention is that 

Xerox stopped making additional contributions to this 

defined contribution account in 1990, just when 

Mr. Frommert returned.  That's -- that's where this $5 

thing comes from.  His benefit, his defined 

contribution benefit, was that large lump sum given 

many years before a normal retirement date.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. STRIS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

After hearing Mr. Long, I’d like to address 

my remarks to two broad areas. 

First, I’d like to talk about why the lower 

courts in this case were not required to defer the 

legal principle.  And then in light of some of the 

factual claims he has made, which are belied by the 

record and directly contradict the findings of the 

lower court in this case, I’d like to explain why they 

didn't defer. 

Because sitting here, the irony to me is the 

core focus of his position is that courts have 

episodic involvement with these very complicated 

plans, and yet, as I’ll get to in my second point, 

most of his position is predicated on things that are 

directly contrary to the court in this case that was 

on the ground that looked at these issues. 

He wants this Court, which has even less of 

an -- a typical and constant involvement with the

plan, to second-guess the lower court, but --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But even if the -- even if 

no deference was owed to the administrator, could you 

explain why the task for the district court was not 

then simply to interpret what the plan means? 

What puzzles me about -- something that 

puzzles me about the -- the two decisions by the 

Second Circuit are (a) why this is remedial; why isn't 

it just a reinterpretation of the plan; (b) where 

their -- what do equitable principles have to do with 

this; and why should it be a discretionary decision 

for the district court?  What does the plan mean? 

That would be the issue.  Isn't that the question, if 

there’s no deference due to the administrator? 

MR. STRIS:  Yes.  To me, that's the most 

difficult question in this case.  I'm -- I'm glad we 

are going straight to it.  But then I'm going to go 

back to deference just to make sure we don't lose on 

that point, where I think we are squarely right. 

Now to your question.  Here's what happened: 

Xerox made two arguments in the first round of 

litigation.  This is very important.  Their first 

argument was that a later plan applied retroactively. 

They didn't want to apply the '89 plan. 

Their second argument -- and this is -- here

are the best places where you can find it:  Page 42a 

of the petition appendix -- that's the Second Circuit; 

page 75a and 85a of the petition appendix -- this is 

where the district court said it.  Their second 

argument was that section 9.6 of the 1989 plan 

permitted an appreciated offset, something more than 

just a nominal offset.  This was rejected as arbitrary 

and capricious. 

Now, the phantom account was rejected, but 

so was the broad principle that there could be an 

appreciated offset. 

Now, here’s the answer to your question, 

Justice Alito:  It would have been totally appropriate 

at that point in time for the Second Circuit to say 

there’s going to be a nominal offset.  We would have 

been done.  We wouldn't be here anymore. 

But Xerox essentially made a fairness 

argument.  They said:  Well, this is a scrivener's 

error; we only left this out for 3 months -- which 

isn't true, by the way.  They left it out for 5 years. 

But the court said:  Well, if that’s true 

and if this is going to be windfall, maybe Xerox has 

an equitable defense.  This is an (a)(1)(B) claim 

for -- under the terms of the plan, but they remanded 

this to the lower court out of consideration for

Xerox, so that the lower court could look at equitable 

principles and say:  Well, since the plan doesn't 

foreclose an appreciation, maybe under equity we 

should have some appreciation. 

And then what happened -- and this is the 

irony -- is Xerox went back -- and this right out of 

page 143a of the joint appendix -- they proposed an 

offset that effectively is an undisclosed $16 million 

appreciation.  Here's why this is important:  Their 

phantom account in the first round, it was an 

undisclosed $17 million appreciation. 

They didn't come in and say -- they made 

equitable arguments.  If you look at their briefs, 

they said:  We're -- we're not saying that this is 

what the plan means, but the plan has been 

invalidated; we’re going to make equitable arguments 

of things that might be consistent with the plan. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, if I could 

switch to the deference point.  Let's say you have an 

administrator who says I interpret this particular 

provision to mean A; and he says but, if that's 

rejected, there are these other provisions that should 

be read to mean B.  That goes up; the court -- the 

rejects A.

reading of the other provisions B? 

MR. STRIS:  The position I -- I would take: 

I think if they did them at the same time -- it's a 

difficult question -- I think they would, because I 

think if you give them at the same time and you admit 

that there is an ambiguity, you’re giving the court 

options.  You are saying:  Defer to my judgment; I 

think this is right, but here's the alternative. 

What Xerox did here, and this is very 

important:  They made the strategic choice in round 

one of this litigation to say we think there is one 

option, it's terrible for -- for Petitioners --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but I think it's 

kind of odd to say to the administrator:  Look, if you 

want discretion, you should make as many rulings as 

you can possibly think of because then you’ll get 

discretion as to each of them.  But if you only do 

what’s efficient and say here's how I read it, then 

you don't get any discretion at all on the other 

provisions. 

MR. STRIS:  No, I -- I don't -- well, I 

guess I would give two answers to that.  The first is, 

in the first instance, if you seriatim said here are 

12 different interpretations of the plan in ranked 

order, I don't think you would get deference.  I think

for efficiency's sake, like you say, we want 

administrators to say:  This is what we think the 

interpretation of the plan is.  I agree with you. 

But in a rare case like this one -- where 

Xerox's main point is:  We screwed up; we left out the 

provision -- I think the appropriate thing for Xerox 

to do would have said:  We think we can rely on it and 

take this interpretation, even though we left out the 

provision; but if not, then this is how we interpret 

the plan.  I'm not saying you would -- they would 

definitely get deference, but at least there would be 

an argument that there’s a presumption of competence, 

that there’s efficiency. 

Here, the standard trust law rule, which I’m 

going to get to in a second, says:  You staked your 

ground, Xerox.  You said that this is what you thought 

the plan meant.  We held that you were arbitrary and 

capricious, not an -- not an honest -- not a small 

procedural mistake.  You -- you picked something that 

was unreasonable, and now you want a second bite at 

the apple. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you’re saying 

it's not just that they abused their discretion; 

they're discretion abusers?  You can't trust them on 

the next provision?

MR. STRIS:  No.  Yes, I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We do that with the 

district court.  We get a district court, and we use 

all of these pejorative terms -- “abuse of 

discretion,” “arbitrary and capricious,” “clear error” 

-- and we send it back for them to do the same -- you 

know, they make -­

MR. STRIS:  Right. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They're the 

fact finder.  Here, the plan administrator is the 

primary interpreter. 

MR. STRIS:  And -- and this is the core 

answer to your question:  That is why the law, under 

the common law of trusts, said that once there was a 

finding by a court of abuse of discretion, it could 

decide to defer. 

I agree with Xerox.  Ordinarily, the courts 

would defer.  Under ERISA, ordinarily, if there’s 

factual issues, they send it back. 

Here, the court said, under these specific 

facts, under this abuse of discretion, for a host of 

reasons, not the least of which, Your Honor, is that 

they are trying to take a fallback position on the 

exact same issue, which the court expressly found in 

this case.

They exercised their discretion not to 

defer.  The rule -- in order for Xerox to get reversal 

on the first question, they have to convince this 

Court that what the rule should be is that, not 

that -- not -- we don't have to convince you that 

there should be -- there shouldn't be deference in all 

of these cases.  They have to convince you that a 

lower court never has the option, unless there’s a 

finding of bad faith, to say, yeah, I'm not going 

to defer.  And that's not the law. 

This very Court, in 1888, in the Colton 

case, which the government cites in their brief, and 

we -- and we cite, there -- the trustee said:  We're 

not giving a benefit.  The Court said:  That's 

arbitrary and capricious.  This Court ordered the 

lower courts to set the benefit.  They never made a 

finding of bad faith. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if this is a 

discretionary decision for the court that finds the 

initial abuse of discretion by the administrator, what 

are the factors -- what are the relevant factors in 

determining whether the administrator should get a 

second shot and which ones are present in this case? 

MR. STRIS:  Okay.  I'm -- I'm going to tell 

you the factors that existed at trust law and in ERISA

and that I think they are right.  One very important 

factor is:  Is it the exact same question?  And here 

it was.  It was the same question.  I disagree with 

Mr. Long's characterization. 

They took a position as an alternative on 

the meaning of section 9.6 under this plan.  Now, they 

want to say, well, now, we're going to rely on 

different provisions, in addition to the one we did 

before, but, I mean -- Justice Scalia, to your 

question earlier -- that would be like saying: Here's 

a contract; I think that we -- I interpret this 

provision looking at pages 1 and 2.  You hold that I 

acted in an arbitrary fashion.  And I say, okay, I 

want to interpret it again; I'm going to look at 1 and 

2, but this time, I'm going to look at pages 7, 8, 9; 

it's a new issue because I didn't consider those --

those points before.  It's still the same question, so 

that's one factor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's not the same question. 

When the court has held that 1 and 2 was, in effect, 

not in the contract because you didn't give enough 

notice of it.  So now you have a contract without 1 

and 2 in it. 

MR. STRIS:  Oh, I -- I --

question.  What does this contract mean without 1 and 

2?  Now, you may have a different point, if -- if you 

say that what -- and it seems to me you did say this, 

that the court of appeal -- the court of appeals, not 

only decided that there was no notice and, therefore, 

this provision wasn't any good, but you claim that the 

court of appeals also said that you cannot account for 

the time value of money. 

MR. STRIS:  Yes, I -- I wouldn’t exactly say 

that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That -- now, that would be 

a totally different case. 

MR. STRIS:  Yes.  What the court of 

appeal --

way. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But I didn't read it that 

MR. STRIS:  No.  What the court of appeals 

said -- now, actually, there’s three things I’d like 

to respond to, and I want to get back to the factors. 

The court of appeals said the SPDs did not disclose an 

appreciation. 

The -- the court of appeals said that the 

relevant provision in this plan, the only one that 

would have applied time value of money was missing, 

but I argue that the consequence of these things is

that you can’t have a time value of money.  So I am 

going to get to that in a second. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a little different. 

MR. STRIS:  Now, to the last point you made 

about it's a different issue.  I think we’re saying 

the same thing.  This is semantic.  Yes, Xerox is 

right, that the task was slightly different.  The 

first time, they interpreted what the offset should be 

under the '89 plan, looking at a few things, and this 

time, they said, oh, we were arbitrary, so, now, we 

would like to resolve the same legal question, looking 

at a few more things. 

So, in one sense --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why -- why -- as I 

understand it -- which big if -- you and I are both 

working at Xerox, and in year 1 -- and we each have 

500,000 in our contribution account, and you leave, 

and you take the 500,000.  I stay, and I don't.  Okay? 

Now, my 500,000 over the next 10 years is 

going to grow somewhat -- as long as it wasn't 2007. 

But it --

(Laughter.) 

MR. STRIS:  Or -- or you may spend it. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I might spend it, 

but if I leave it there, it would grow, okay.  But

some -- some people leave it there, they grow. 

MR. STRIS:  During my time, it --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So, when figuring the 

floor, what Xerox does is look to see how much it 

grew.  They look at the whole thing, now, 10 years 

later, and they say, you’re up above the floor, 

good-bye, we will give you this, not the floor, okay. 

Now, you are in the same position, and you 

happen to come back to Xerox, and all they want to do 

is say, you know, we’d like to assume yours grew, too, 

I mean, not -- a little, anyway, and the first thing 

they wanted to do is to say it should have grown the 

same way we treat our own guys, as it having grown. 

And the court of appeals says that's wrong 

because you left the words out, but send it back to 

see it's fair.  So then the expert comes in, and the 

expert says, well, they didn't want to give us that 

way to grow it; here is how -- we will assume it grew 

like an insurance company, the most incredibly 

conservative people in the world, how -- how they 

would have treated it as growing, if you bought an 

annuity right then, and that just gives us even a 

lower number. 

And -- and they want to say, why didn't you 

at least listen to that, instead of coming to the fact

which is very, very unusual, it didn't grow at all, in 

which case, you are eligible for the floor. 

MR. STRIS:  Okay. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So I think that's why they 

think it's either an abuse of discretion or you should 

have listened more to the -- to the expert -- should 

have done something else. 

MR. STRIS:  I -- I understand that entirely. 

I’d like to say a few things.  All of these points 

would be very important if we were designing a plan in 

the first place.  I'm not suggesting that the result 

in this case is what parties would bargain to in the 

first instance, if they had all the information.  I'm 

not going to defend that. 

The question here is Xerox left a provision 

out of the plan, and now we have a problem.  What are 

we going to do?  That's how we get to equity. 

In fact, I think it would have been 

appropriate -- if I were litigating the case at that 

point, I would have argued you can't have an equitable 

defense, you need to enforce the nominal offset, but 

that ship has sailed. 

So we go back on remand, and to -- to 

Mr. Long's point about how it's standard to have an 

actuarial offset -- take isclosure away for a

minute.  It's not standard to apply the -- the time 

value of money to the entire defined contribution 

balance.  I will not accept that characterization. 

Under the principle of duplication, we 

presented an alternative that used the time value of 

money offset, but it applied it to the relevant 

principle.  Xerox didn't like that, so they -- they 

advocated something else.  Here's why it's relevant to 

your question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  What's 

the relevant principle?  Isn't it what the lump sum 

was that he took out? 

MR. STRIS:  I don't think so.  This is a 

defined benefits plan, and -- you know, from a 

regulatory standpoint, as this case comes to this 

Court, it is a defined benefits plan.  Section 9.6 of 

the plan talks about non-duplication. 

With no other information, if -- if you 

force me to say, well, let's make an argument, what 

are we going to think about non-duplication, we’re 

trying to say that we’re not going to give you money 

under this floor -- as you put it, Justice Breyer --

of the defined benefits plan, if it duplicates your 

prior defined benefit payment.

separate plan, and it was a defined contribution plan. 

They're integrated --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, they chose to 

take it out of that plan, right? 

MR. STRIS:  I actually think that’s not 

true.  It's not clear from the record, but my 

understanding is that most of my clients didn't --

didn't have that option. 

Now, I’d like to get back, just for a 

second, Justice Alito, to your question, because it 

goes to the core of deference.  Another very important 

factor is, are there fact questions? 

And this is important because you’re 

thinking about broad principle.  This comes up in 

ERISA all the time.  I see this all the time.  Even 

after an abuse of discretion, courts regularly say, we 

are going to send this back, because they’re not going 

to be in the business of holding evidentiary hearings 

and looking at complicated fact questions. 

So that's a factor that -- where you might 

say, you know what?  They abused their discretion, but 

I'm sending it back.  Not only was that not an issue 

here, the lower courts explicitly held that they 

waived this, they didn't want it sent back. 

Another important factor is whether or not

Official 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  Are you talking 

about the court of appeals sending it back to the 

district court, or are you talking about the district 

court sending it back to the administrator? 

MR. STRIS:  I'm saying that, when the court 

of appeals sent it back to the district court, the 

district court never even considered sending it to the 

administrator because there would be no reason to do 

that. They didn't ask for it.  This isn't one of those 

cases, where there’s -- it's a medical case, where you 

need new evidentiary hearings on whether someone's 

sick.  This goes to Justice Alito's question of in 

which cases, after an abuse of discretion, are courts 

likely to defer?  That's a factor where they are. 

Let me give you another one.  If you have a 

minor procedural infraction -- and this case is 

anything but -- the disclosures were wrong for 5 

years, and contrary to Mr. Long's claim, this wasn't 

missing from the plan for 3 months.  This was missing 

from the plan for --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, since that’s a 

fairly stark disagreement among counsel on a factual 

matter, where in the record do you see 5 years?

the petition appendix.  You have to read it very 

carefully, and I know this stuff is boring, and I 

apologize, but this is the first time that the offset 

was reinserted. 

It was in 1993, in section 1.45(f), that 

Xerox finally put the offset back.  Here's the 

confusion.  They keep referring to this 1990 

amendment.  The 1990 amendment, which is invalid, it 

didn't put an offset back.  It just put in the words 

"phantom account."  It was -- it -- it created a 

phantom entitlement. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It put in the words 

"phantom account"? 

MR. STRIS:  It put in the words "phantom 

account," but the words "phantom account" were already 

in the '89 restatement.  If you look in -- at section 

1.35, and it's in the joint appendix.  It's page 19a 

of the joint appendix. 

This is the definition of “retirement 

account.”  This is the account that actually applies 

to my clients.  There’s a phantom account here.  There 

has always been the phantom account in the plan.  They 

removed the offset.  So this -- the relevant thing is 

the offset, and it's been gone for 5 years. 

Now, to get back to this deference question

which I -- I think is important because these factors 

matter. Let's take the Second Circuit.  The Second 

Circuit regularly defers after an abuse of discretion. 

The U.S. points this out -- where do they point it 

out -- page 23 of their brief.  The Miller v. United 

Welfare Fund case out of the Second Circuit does 

precisely what Xerox says the Second Circuit 

overruled.  So, unquestionably, the Second Circuit 

realized that it could defer, but it chose not to 

here. 

This wasn't a small procedural infraction. 

This wasn't you have to decide in 30 days, and Xerox 

took 33 days to decide.  This was Xerox sending 

personal benefit statements to people for 5 years that 

said you’re going to get $2,000, you are going to get 

$3,000.  The -- the summary plan description in this 

case, it's on page 47a.  It says the amount you 

receive may also be reduced if you have previously 

left the company and received a distribution at that 

time. 

Mr. Long gets up here -- and I understand 

what he's saying -- he says, we have to disclose 

everything in a summary plan description?  How's it 

going to be a summary?  No, we suggest that you have 

to say there is going to be some appreciation.  You

have to do something to suggest to average plan 

participants that there’s going to be a 20 percent 

interest rate, an 8.5 percent interest rate, that it’s 

going to apply to your entire distribution. 

And that's what the lower court decided 

here.  They were there; they saw the facts; they found 

that there was an abuse of discretion.  And -- and 

they said:  You know what -- in this rare case -- and 

it is rare in the Second Circuit -- they said in this 

rare case, because of this particular abuse of 

discretion that involves the same issue, that involves 

statutory disclosure violations, that involved Xerox 

trying to pay people $5.31 a month when they told them 

they were paying them $2,300 a month, we’re not going 

to defer.  And they went the extra mile. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  We can handle those 

facts --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  They have not had --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  We can handle those facts 

just as easily as the district court. 

MR. STRIS:  Of course.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, just because a 

decision has some factual basis -- every decision has 

some factual basis.  That doesn't mean that -- that an 

appellate court, including this one, can't decide the 

questions. 

MR. STRIS:  I agree with you.  It wouldn't 

-- I wasn't suggesting the contrary. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why do you keep stressing 

that -- you know, the district court was there and saw 

these facts?  That's fine --

MR. STRIS:  Oh -- ohh -- here's why I 

think it's -- I was unclear.  Here's why I think that 

is important.  The law at trust law was that there is 

a bright-line rule.  The bright-line rule was, once 

there is an abuse of discretion, the court gets to 

decide will you continue to defer.  Xerox isn't coming 

before you and saying that the court of appeals here 

abused its discretion in choosing not to defer. 

They’re advocating a bright-line rule that says a 

court must defer unless there is a finding of bad 

faith.  And so my point --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But defer doesn't 

mean uphold in every circumstance, does it? 

MR. STRIS:  No.  Defer means if it was --

don't think it's proper to say they can choose not to 

defer.  They can defer and -- and choose to find it's 

still an abuse of discretion. 

MR. STRIS:  Oh, that's true, Your Honor, but 

that's flatly not happened at trust law.  If you look 

at the cases that the government cites on -- in their 

brief, it's pages 17 and 18.  They cite a host of 

cases. 

If you look at the Colton case, if you look 

at the quote directly from the leading Bogert 

treatise, there are many cases like this one where the 

court said:  We’re not going to give you a second 

chance.  We're -- not just that we are going to listen 

to you and not -- and not give you deference -- we’re 

going to listen to you and disagree; we are not going 

to listen to you. 

And that's the rule that we and the 

government are advocating.  It was the law at trust 

law and out of Fidelity to Glenn and Firestone. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just so I 

understand, there are two different views.  One is we 

are going to listen to you, and we may not agree with 

you.  And the other is we’re not even going to listen 

to you.  And you are arguing for the second rule.  You

MR. STRIS:  May I answer that? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, sure. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. STRIS:  Okay.  I didn't want to be 

presumptuous. 

I would characterize it slightly 

differently.  I would say that under the first rule, 

you listen and if you think it's reasonable, you maybe 

consider as a factor where the line of reasonableness 

is, but you reject it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 

MR. STRIS:  I’m saying that was not the law, 

that has never been the law.  The law is, once there 

has been an abuse of discretion, the court has the 

right to say we’re going to decide for ourselves, we 

are going to decide what’s reasonable, and if you 

characterize that as not listening to you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They don't even need 

to accept a brief from the plan administrator --

MR. STRIS:  I don't think it would ever 

happen, but that's how it worked at trust law.  They 

wouldn't have to.  But I think courts are more 

reasonable than that.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS, 

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS 

MR. ROBERTS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

When a plan administrator has abused its 

discretion in construing plan terms, courts are not 

required to defer to the plan administrator's fallback 

interpretation of the same terms.  That rule follows 

from trust law, and a contrary rule would undermine 

ERISA's protections for plan participants.  It would 

reduce incentives for administrators to interpret 

plans reasonably; it would discourage participants 

from challenging unreasonable benefit denials; and it 

would make employers less likely to draft clear plans. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if I don't think it's 

the same terms? 

MR. ROBERTS:  If you don't think it's the 

same terms, that would present a -- a different 

question about whether deference was required.  But 

still deference would have been inappropriate here, 

because the fallback interpretation by the plan 

administrator presented the same notice problems that

the original phantom account interpretation had 

provided, because the summary plan description didn't 

provide notice that there would be an appreciated 

offset. 

But the rule that the court of appeals 

adopted was that deference was not required when it 

was the same terms, and the court of appeals found 

that.  I don't think this Court needs to -- in 

resolving that, to decide whether it was the same 

terms here.  We think it -- it was, because the -- the 

Petitioners made two argument in defending their 

initial benefits determination.  One was we can apply 

the post-1998 terms, and the other one was, even 

applying the 1989 plan, that authorizes use of the 

phantom account, because of the non-duplication of 

benefits provision.  And now they have come back on 

remand and they’re saying well, no, we’re now reading 

the non-duplication of benefits provision differently. 

And that's the -- that’s the same plan terms. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about the 

hypothetical I asked your friend?  You know, this is 

how we read the provision, reading A, and we 

recognize there’s some ambiguity there, and if a 

court disagrees with it, our -- our second reading is 

-- is B.

MR. ROBERTS:  No.  We --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No deference on B? 

MR. ROBERTS:  We think there would be no 

difference on B if it was just a second reading of the 

same -- of the same term.  Under that logic --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does that make 

sense?  I mean, don't you want the administrators to 

give you their best -- best understanding? 

MR. ROBERTS:  You want the administrators to 

give their most reasonable interpretation, but under 

the logic of letting them be able to put the first 

interpretation there, they could just put a list of 10 

interpretations --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, they can --

MR. ROBERTS:  -- starting with the one 

that’s most favorable.

take it to the extreme.  But if it looks like a good

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You’re being careful not to 

not to say "bad faith."  There was no bad faith here? 

MR. ROBERTS:  No, they wouldn't have to find 

bad faith. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm looking for -- I'm 

still not sure of the standard. 

MR. ROBERTS:  The standard would be --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm the district judge, 

and I want to defer in -- in case A and not in case B. 

What -- what's the difference? 

MR. ROBERTS:  Ordinarily, if we are talking 

about they have put forward an interpretation, now 

they want to put forward a fallback interpretation, 

generally, if -- generally, if they have -- haven't 

put that forward before, we think that deference 

wouldn't be appropriate, because they had the 

opportunity to address the issue, and the 

unreasonableness of the initial interpretation 

suggests that they may not act reasonably on remand. 

And --

assuming, it seems to me -- it makes sense if there’s 

bad faith. 

MR. ROBERTS:  According --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, you make 

fallback arguments.  You’re here and say this is how 

we read this, but if you don't agree with it, this is 

how we read it. 

MR. ROBERTS:  That's right, and -- but there 

are -- there are concerns here about undermining 

ERISA's protections for plan participants that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Roberts, I thought 

you said in this -- in this case -- and we're only 

dealing with this case -- there was the same basic 

problem, the same flaw in the second interpretation. 

And you said in both cases, they wouldn't satisfy 

ERISA's notice requirement. 

MR. ROBERTS:  That's right.  Because ERISA 

requires the summary plan description to identify any 

circumstances that will result in an offset, to 

describe the offset in a manner calculated to be 

understood by the average plan participant, and not to 

minimize the significance of the offset. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Then I don't understand what 

the purpose of the remand from the Second Circuit to 

the district court, after the Second Circuit's first

In other words, you’re saying that they --

they found that anything other than an offset for the 

amount of money that was actually received by the 

beneficiary upon leaving Xerox would be -- would 

violate the notice requirements. 

MR. ROBERTS:  Well, I don't --

JUSTICE ALITO:  So that interprets the plan. 

There’s nothing left to do, then. 

MR. ROBERTS:  I don't know that the -- that 

the court of appeals actually found that the first 

time around.  Our point is that that was the 

consequence of the lack of notice that was in -- in 

the summary plan description. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  I understand you to be 

saying that the concept of any appreciation of that 

amount based on the time value of money is invalid, 

because there wasn't proper notice for that.  So 

there’s nothing left to do on remand, it seems to me. 

I don't understand what the purpose of the 

remand was. 

MR. ROBERTS:  Well, I -- we -- we think in 

most cases, it would have been an abuse of discretion 

for the district court in light of the lack of notice 

in the summary plan description to apply an

appreciated offset.  But the district court also did 

consider the reasonable expectations of the plan --

plan participants, and there might have been other 

countervailing considerations that could have been 

advanced by the -- the plan administrator, perhaps, 

about the financial solvency of the plan or some other 

matters, but -- but those weren't presented here. 

The point is that, once the court -- when 

the court remanded, the first task for the district 

court on remand was to look at the plan terms because 

this was a benefit action, determine whether those 

plan terms addressed how to calculate the offset, but 

here, the court couldn't rely on the plan terms, 

really, for two reasons. 

First, as the district court said, the plan 

said virtually nothing about how to do it; and, 

second, the point that I was making before, ERISA 

prohibited the court from adopting an interpretation 

that provided for more than the -- an offset greater 

than the face value. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, in principle, if -- if 

we accept your argument, if other retirees who are 

later rehired bring a lawsuit in another court, you 

might have a different result because it would be up 

to the -- up to that court to decide what was -- what

MR. ROBERTS:  In the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's the consequence of 

not deferring to the plan administrator.  You have --

MR. ROBERTS:  If the plan -- if the plan 

terms -- in an ordinary case, if there was an abuse of 

discretion in interpreting the plan terms, the plan 

terms would still address the issue.  There wouldn't 

be an additional violation of ERISA's notice 

requirement. 

This is a unique case, in the sense that, 

here, you’ve got not just an arbitrary -- an 

unreasonable interpretation of the plan terms, but 

you've also got the problem of the lack of notice in 

the summary plan description, and you've also got the 

problem that the plan terms are really silent on this 

issue. 

They just don't say anything about how to 

calculate the offset. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  It's a pretty big windfall 

for people.  You’re working at Xerox, and your plan is 

about approaching the minimum level -- let's quit and 

then go invest it, and then come back 3 days before 

you’re bound to retire, and then you’re going get 

whatever the plan grew, and you’ll also get your

MR. ROBERTS:  I don't think it's a windfall, 

Your Honor, because it depends on what the employees 

were promised when they were deciding whether to come 

back. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why would anyone 

promise them that kind of a deal? 

MR. ROBERTS:  Well -- first of all, when 

you’ve got a defined benefit plan and defined 

contribution plan, there’s no requirement in ERISA, 

and employers frequently -- or at least, sometimes, 

would not offset the defined contribution benefits 

from the defined benefit plan, and even in a floor­

offset arrangement, where they would, an employer 

could provide less than the full amount --

JUSTICE BREYER:  What about -- a bit more 

serious question -- I mean, that is a serious 

question, but the more general question, what about 

something that is analogous to Skidmore deference? 

MR. ROBERTS:  Oh, God. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  So you say --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER:  You say -- you take the --

the district judge here can take -- takes the 

administrator's opinion for what it's worth.

Mr. Stris.  Do you think the district court should 

listen to what the plan administrator has to say? 

MR. ROBERTS:  Well, I think that, in trust 

law, that -- under the principles of trust law, that 

Mr. Stris is correct, that the district court has 

the -- the -- the court would have discretion to 

formulate the remedy and could direct the trustee --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is it -- is it --

Mr. Roberts, is it a remedy?  So that’s -- one thing 

is you can view this as the district court as 

substitute interpreter of the plan, or another way you 

can look at it is to say, the -- the benefit 

determination was wrong, we reject it, the court 

rejects it.  So, now, there is a remedy for that 

wrongful determination.  So is this, what’s going on 

in the district court, an interpretation of the plan 

or a remedy for a wrongful determination? 

MR. ROBERTS:  In a benefits action, the 

first question is to interpret the plan, but what you 

have here is a plan that is silent and a plan that --

where interpreting the plan to provide for a certain 

kind of offset, there is inadequate notice in the 

summary plan description, so there’s a violation of 

ERISA.

whenever there’s a misinterpretation of the plan, but 

in the circumstances here, it is a remedial decision 

because the court has to fill the gap in the plan 

that’s the result of the silence of the plan. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, we interpret gaps in 

-- in documents all the time.  That's part of 

interpreting a document, figuring out what it provides 

for in a lot of situations that it does not explicitly 

cover.  I don't know why that isn't interpreting the 

plan. 

MR. ROBERTS:  When -- the analogy here is 

to the trust law situation, where trusts -- where --

where courts modify the terms of a trust because the 

terms are illegal or there’s a change of 

circumstances, like the cy pres doctrine. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

Thank you. 

Mr. Long, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR. 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. LONG:  The remaining plan terms are not 

silent.  Section 9.6 says that the offset should be 

the accrued benefit attributable to the prior lump-sum 

distribution, and that's an annuity payable at age 65. 

So there is plan language.

It's -- it is not completely unambiguous, 

but the plan is certainly not silent, and the 

Solicitor General, in its brief on the merits to this 

Court did -- retracted that suggestion that the plan 

was silent. 

On this question of the 1990 amendment and 

when the -- the reconstructed account methodology that 

the Second Circuit said was invalid got put back in, 

pages 66a and 67a of the appendix to the petition 

shows that that got put back in, in 1990, and not 

later. 

On trust law and what trust law shows, 

obviously, the Court will have to sort it out, but we 

stand with Professor Scott, with his treatise, which 

is key, to the Restatement Second, which was in effect 

when ERISA was adopted.  Section 187 of his treatise, 

which correlates with section 187 of the Restatement 

Second, we think supports our approach that, unless 

there is bad faith or the trustee is acting outside 

the bounds of discretion -- and the court will get the 

trustee within the bounds of discretion, but unless 

there is some reason to think the trustee can't fairly 

and honestly exercise the discretion, the terms of the 

trust assign that responsibility to the trustee, and, 

therefore, the trustee should exercise that

And then, finally, on this question of 

notice and whether there was adequate notice, not of 

the reconstructed account methodology, but of the 

plain vanilla annuity, the ordinary way this is done, 

we would urge the Court not to accept these 

representations that, oh, it's just the same question; 

if the notice for one is inadequate, the notice for 

the other must also be inadequate. 

I mean, there’s actually Second Circuit law, 

the McCarthy against Dun & Bradstreet case, that holds 

that a summary plan description does not have to 

completely explain how you do every offset and 

actuarial adjustment.  There are so many of them. 

Many of them apply just to relatively small groups of 

people, including this one that we’re talking about. 

There are 14,000 --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the court of appeals 

held that this one was inadequate because it did not 

say that you were going to take into account the time 

value of money.  If that's the reason it held that 

this one was bad, the same reason would apply to the 

plain vanilla. 

MR. LONG:  Well, if the court had actually 

held that -- I mean, I would urge you not to read the

court's opinion that way.  I mean, I think, if it held 

that, I think that would be a mistake because there --

there are -- you know, it's just so typical that you 

have actuarial adjustments in pensions and in -- and 

in general. 

I mean, people don't expect to take out a 

mortgage on a house for 20 years and pay no interest 

or buy a bond from the Treasury for 20 years and 

receive no interest.  So I think, if it's going to be 

the ordinary, plain vanilla way this is done, the PBGC 

way, the safe harbor way, it may be sufficient -- may 

very well be sufficient to simply --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Long, would you --

would you explain your position on the picture we were 

given of these people who were rehired and -- and they 

get, periodically, a statement that says, you are 

going to get 2,000-some-odd dollars; and then, 5 years 

later, they get a statement that says, no, it's only 

$5.18, or something like that. 

MR. LONG:  Right, and -- and those 

statements, which are non-plan documents, said 

there -- there may be an adjustment or there will be 

an adjustment for prior distributions.  And in a case 

like Mr. Frommert’s, that's the $5 case, the reason 

it's $5 is because his entire defined contribution

benefit virtually came from that large lump sum. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And not even about why --

why it was $5.  It's why did he get notices that gave 

him the perception he was going to get over 2,000 when 

it was so much less? 

MR. LONG:  Well, because those -- those 

particular forms, which again are not plan documents 

and he really should show individual reliance and 

prejudice, didn't do the calculation.  He got another 

document that did do the calculation, and that's when 

this started.
