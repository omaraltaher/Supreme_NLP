 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 07-1090, Republic of 
Iraq v. Beaty, and the consolidated case.

 Mr. Franklin.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FRANKLIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Acting with express statutory authority and 
in furtherance of important foreign policies following 
the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime, the President 
made inapplicable with respect to Iraq all provisions of 
law that had applied to countries that sponsored 
terrorism.

 Under the plain language of the statute, 
those provisions included former section 1605(a)(7), 
which was a provision of law that applied only to such 
countries.  Because section 1605(a)(7) was made 
inapplicable as to Iraq effective on the President's 
determination, it cannot now serve as the applicable 
statutory basis for abrogation of Iraq's foreign 
sovereign immunity and therefore subject matter 
jurisdiction in this case.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Franklin, even if you 

are right about that, the legislation was an emergency 
measure with a sunset.  It was revived for 1 year, but 
then no more.  So, didn't this suspension of Iraq's lack 
of immunity -- didn't the immunity come back?  Didn't 
the bar to immunity come back again once the emergency 
law sunsetted?

 MR. FRANKLIN:  No, Your Honor.  The language 

of the sunset provision to which you are referring 
states only that the authorities contained in the 
section would expire.  That means the authorities to the 
President given to him to act.  Congress did not say 
that the effect of what the President had done would be 
nullified once his authority to act had expired.

 And it's important to recognize that the 

President not only made inapplicable provisions of law 
addressed to state nations that had sponsored terrorism, 
but he also suspended the Iraq Sanctions Act under the 
same authority.  The Iraq Sanctions Act has never been 
repealed.

 So, if it were correct that the -- that the 

-- everything that the President had done became 
nullified upon the expiration of his authority to act, 
then the Iraq Sanctions Act would not only currently be 
in effect today, but would have been in effect since

September 30th, 2005.  And if there's -- that is not 
what Congress intended.  The Iraq Sanctions Act has a 
huge panoply of sanctions, both dependent on and 
independent of the legislative determination of Iraq as 
a state sponsor of terrorism.

 But if there's any question about this, when 
Congress acted again, the same Congress acted in 2003 to 
extend the expiration date, Congress -- the -- when that 
Congress acted, the legislative history said quite 
expressly that the extension was not necessary to extend 
what the President had already done, because that had 
already happened and that was permanent.  But it was 
necessary according to Congress for other reasons.

 So both because of the plain language of the 

sunset provision and because of what Congress 
subsequently did in 2003 to extend it, as well as the 
interpretation of the United States on this point, the 
President's actions didn't sunset.  It was emergency 
legislation to be sure, but the emergency was to give 
the President the authorities.  We were at war at that 
time and our foreign policy was changing 180 degrees 
almost overnight away from penalizing the government of 
Saddam Hussein as a state sponsor of terrorism, as an 
outlaw regime, and immediately towards helping the 
people of Iraq.

And Congress gave the President the broad 

catch-all authority to, if he deemed it appropriate, to 
relieve the people of Iraq from all, not just some, of 
the very onerous restrictions and disabilities that had 
applied to them as a result of the prior regime's 
support for terrorism.

 The President did this in exercise of his 

foreign policy judgment in order that the people of Iraq 
could better rebuild their country and establish a new 
democratic government that would in fact prove to become 
one of the United States' most trusted allies in a 
region that has not always had very many of them.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what do you make of 

the fact that in -- in 2008 Congress said that that was 
never its intention, it was never its intention for the 
President to have the authority to -- to do this?

 MR. FRANKLIN:  Two things, Justice Alito: 

The -- the first point is that this was not the Congress 
that acted in 2003.  This was a subsequent Congress. 
And that statement occurred almost 5 years after the 
legislation had been enacted and almost 3 years after 
the President's authority to act had expired.  As such, 
that statement is nothing more than subsequent 
legislative history that cannot be determinative in 
deciding whether the President acted validly in 2003.

That determination should be judged according to the 
statute that was in front of the President when he 
acted.

 But if there's any question at all in the 
Court's mind about the application of that provision, 
the President waived it.  He waived its application as 
to Iraq.  It is important to remember that the President 
would not sign the version of the NDAA that just had 
that provision in it.  He vetoed the bill.  He vetoed it 
only because of its effect that it might have on Iraq, 
and he would not sign a replacement until he was given 
the authority to waive any and all of the provisions of 
section 1083 to the extent they may affect Iraq.  So if 
that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Including -- including 
the provision that repealed 1605(a)(7).  So that would 
be revived?

 MR. FRANKLIN:  Well, we don't agree with 

that, Your Honor, because we think that the scope of the 
waiver would have been to make inapplicable or to waive 
application of extant provisions of law to the extent 
they might affect Iraq.  The President wasn't given the 
additional power to reenact statutes, to put a repealed 
statute back on the book.  The waiver was just like the 
EWSAA waiver, where the President was authorized to

waiver with respect to Iraq existing privileges --
existing provisions of law.  But again, to the extent 
there is any question about that, Title 1, U.S.C. 
section 108 answers that conclusively.  That section 
provides that even if Congress itself had repealed 
section 1083 in its entirety, that would not bring 
section 1605(a)(7), which had been repealed by that 
section.  And that is the plain language of 1 U.S.C. 
108.  Obviously the President by exercising a blanket 
waiver authority can't have a better or more effective 
ability to bring back into existence expired statutes 
than Congress itself could have done.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Because technically it's 
just suspension, it's not -- it's not reenactment.  I 
suppose you could say a suspension is a partial revival, 
but the provision doesn't exactly fit, does it?

 MR. FRANKLIN:  Well, we are talking here 

about a waiver applied to a repeal.  I think the 
temporal point here is that the repeal happened 
effective upon the President's signature of the NDAA, on 
January 20, 2008.  That was already done.  The repeal 
happened.  At that point, section 1605(a)(7) no longer 
existed.  It was not in the U.S. Code.

 The President was authorized then 

subsequently to waive existing provisions of law.  And

here I think that this -- to allow the President to 
re-enact statutes according to a waiver authority is 
contrary I think to 1 U.S.C. section 108, but also 
common sense as well.  He was -- he was allowed to --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I agree.
 MR. FRANKLIN:  Okay.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we have any other 

instance in which a jurisdictional provision is 
withdrawn applicable to pending cases without Congress 
having mentioned the jurisdictional provision at all?
 MR. FRANKLIN:  Well, I think the closest 

analogy that I can give you, Your Honor, is in fact the 
precise circumstances we have here, and that is the 
doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity.  Prior to the 
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, determinations 
upon foreign sovereign immunity were made by the 
executive, and they had the effect, as the Court stated 
in the Republic of Mexico case and the Ex parte Peru, of 
requiring the courts to, quote, "surrender their 
jurisdiction," even if it had previously attached.

 So here we have the precise situation that 
had always happened.  It had always been this way prior 
to the FSIA.  The President had always been able to make 
determinations on foreign sovereign immunity that would 
have the immediate effect of divesting the courts of

their ability to hear cases.  Now, there were of course 
jurisdictional provisions at the time that conferred 
jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns, and the Court had 
no trouble -- and this was 150 years of practice, dating 
from Chief Justice Marshall's first recognition of 
sovereign immunity up until the Foreign Sovereign 
Immunities Act.

 So this is actually not any different really 

than what had occurred before.  We have also cited 
numerous or several examples of jurisdictional statute 
that do depend on executive determination.  So there's 
really nothing particularly unusual about that as well.

 I would like to turn at this point, if I 

might, just briefly to our alternative argument in case 
the Court might find it relevant.  This is an 
alternative argument.  It's not one that the Court needs 
to reach, but it is certainly another basis for reaching 
the same result in this case.  And that is the simple 
fact in 2008 section 1605(a)(7), regardless of what the 
President had done previously to it, was repealed.  And 
it was not just repealed, but it was repealed with a 
simultaneous bestowal of a replacement jurisdictional 
provision that encompassed every single pending claim 
that was then pending at the time.

 So this is the classic example of a

jurisdictional repeal that applies to all cases. 
Congress didn't just repeal a statute, but it gave 
another provision that encompassed every pending claim 
and allowed every single pending plaintiff to be able to 
refile their cases.

 Now, to be sure, the plaintiffs against Iraq 

were not able to exercise their ability under the new 
statute -- that is 28 U.S.C. section 1605(A) -- but the 
only reason they were not allowed to do that was the 
President's waiver, and the President's waiver was 
expressly made applicable both to pending cases and to 
preexisting claims.

 So, for both of those reasons the 

alternative ground is also one that warrants reversal.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Were there judgments, 

outstanding judgments that had become final -- judgments 
outstanding against Iraq, that were not challenged on 
appeal?

 MR. FRANKLIN:  There is at least two that I 
am aware of, two default judgments.  They are cited in 
our brief.  And the effective ability of those default 
judgment creditors, as it were, to execute on those 
judgments would depend on the application of the new 
statutes that Congress enacted about judgment execution. 
Those are not at issue in this case.  But the answer to

your question is yes, there were at least two judgments 
that I am aware of that were default judgments where 
Iraq had not appeared and did not contest the case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you're not claiming 

that those could be reopened?

 MR. FRANKLIN:  We are not claiming in this 

-- in this proceeding they could be reopened.  We're 
actually not claiming -- we haven't claimed in any 
proceeding that they can be reopened.  But there is a 
serious question as to whether or not the plaintiffs 
would be able to execute in the United States on those 
judgments.  Also, they are default judgments and so they 
are subject to all of the usual rules to the extent 
about reopening default judgments, not on the grounds of 
this sovereign immunity issue, but on the normal grounds 
of reopening of default judgments.  So, to the extent 
there are such bases, I don't want to give up on those.
 But we are not -- we are not making -- this 

argument's immunity argument today applies to these 
pending cases and the ability of courts to enter 
judgments, not to existing default judgments, but the 
execution on those judgments may well be affected by the 
arguments we are making today.

 In the final analysis, I think this -- this 

is a case that turns ultimately on the President's

exercise of his foreign affairs powers as delegated to 
him by Congress.  The Court has traditionally given the 
executive a fair amount of leeway and deference in this 
field.  In this case I think that's particularly 
appropriate, given that these foreign policies are among 
the most significant facing the United States today.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I take it your 

argument would be no different if this involved some 
other area.  It doesn't depend upon the deference under 
the foreign affairs --

MR. FRANKLIN:  No, it doesn't depend on it, 

but I do think it's important to recognize that the 
President was acting in that -- in that field when he 
made these determinations, and to also recognize that 
these determinations -- the foreign policy of the United 
States has not changed.  It is still towards supporting 
the people of Iraq and it's supporting the ability of 
the people to rebuild their country and also their new 
democratic government, and all of those policies would 
be thwarted or seriously disrupted if the Court were to 
hold that Iraq's sovereign immunity has been abrogated 
in these cases.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I also gather that the 

ability of the President or the United States to seek 
some compensation from Iraq through diplomatic channels

on behalf of these plaintiffs is not affected at all by 
this outcome, right?

 MR. FRANKLIN:  Absolutely not, Your Honor. 
That is the way that these kinds of claims have always 
been addressed in the past and these are the way that 
these kinds of claims, particularly between friendly 
allies, ought to be addressed.  And I would think that 
in this instance the Court in its Republic of Peru case 
probably said it best and I'm just going to quote from 
the last page of our brief.  The Court said:  "Our 
national interest will be better served in such cases if 
the wrongs to suitors involving our relations with a 
friendly foreign power are righted through diplomatic 
negotiations rather than the compulsions of judicial 
proceedings."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That is before the 

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, right?

 MR. FRANKLIN:  That is true, but this case 

involve the doctrine of foreign immunity and it embodies 
the same concerns of reciprocity that were at issue 
then.

 If I might, I would like to reserve the 

remainder of my time for rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 EWSAA section 1503 authorized the President 
to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq any provision 
of law that applies to countries that have sponsored 
terrorism.  The terrorism exception to the Foreign 
Sovereign Immunities Act falls squarely within the plain 
language of that authority.  But if there were any 
question about that, certainly the President's exercise 
of his authority under that statute would be entitled to 
deference.

 Even if one were to add the atextual 

additional limitation that the Acree court majority 
tried to, that it only encompassed statutes that would 
stand as an obstacle to the funding of the Iraqi regime 
in the aftermath of removing the Hussein government, 
still the President's memorandum to Congress makes clear 
his determination that the threat of billions of dollars 
of judgments against Iraq and the seizure or freezing of 
their assets by attachment constituted an immediate 
threat to the foreign policy interests of the United

States and our critical foreign policy goals in Iraq.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought we were just 

told that because there -- of the limitations on 
enforcement, the -- there would be no realistic threat 
to the Iraqi assets in the United States because the 
judgment creditor wouldn't have access to them.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That is because of 
the authorities that the President exercised under the 
second proviso of 1503.  There are exceptions to the 
immunity of foreign states with respect to attachment. 
There is one that specifically applies to countries that 
have been designated as having sponsored terrorism, and 
that exception as well was rendered inapplicable to Iraq 
pursuant to this same authority.

 And so, again, it is essential to the 

government's foreign policy interests in Iraq that these 
judgments, the ability to attach Iraqi assets -- in 
fact, at the time, in the summer of 2003, there were 
plaintiffs that were running around trying to attach the 
very assets, the very bundles of cash, that the United 
States Government was attempting to shift to Iraq in 
order to pay immediate needs in -- in Iraq in the 
immediate aftermath of having removed the Hussein 
regime.  These critical foreign policy goals would have 
been frustrated had the President not been able to make

our Foreign Sovereign Immunity Law conform to our 
foreign policy.

 And, of course, the Court in Altmann 
recognized that foreign sovereign immunity is an 
expression of our present foreign policy interests. 
That has always been the case.  And although Congress 
can establish the general rule, and did in the FSIA, 
section 1503 recognizes that there had perhaps never 
been as dramatic a transformation in our foreign policy 
with respect to a country as happened in the spring of 
2003, whereas there had been a whole panoply of 
sanctions and other provisions of law that had applied 
to Iraq because of the Hussein regime's sponsorship of 
terrorism.  On a -- on a dime, our policy shifted 
180 degrees, and we became intensely concerned in the 
success of the new Iraqi regime.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is -- is all of this -- I 
won't say academic, but it ultimately doesn't matter if 
the D.C. Circuit was right in the Acree case in saying, 
well, 1605(a)(7) allowed suit against Iraq, but there's 
no cause of action.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  No, Your Honor. 

The judgment in the Acree case dismissing the claims for 
failure to state a claim was because counsel in that 
particular suit was unable to identify a source of law

for their claim.  The D.C. Circuit has correctly held 
that Federal law did not at that time provide a cause of 
action under 1605(a)(7), and counsel was unable when 
pressed at oral argument to identify the source of law.
 But numerous district court judgments exist 

where the courts have upheld the availability of 
transitory tort under the law of the forum State, under 
the law of the residence of the plaintiff, or under the 
law of the -- of the place where the wrong occurred to 
provide a cause of action.  So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where the wrong occurred 

would have been Iraq.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That's right.  And 
-- and, of course, the courts have to apply a choice of 
law analysis.  As I said, a number of these judgments 
apply the law of the forum State where the plaintiff 
resided.  The United States has expressed its view that 
there are constitutional limitations on the ability of a 
State to project its substantive law to a tort that 
occurs abroad, but -- but those issues have not yet I 
don't think have been resolved by the D.C. Circuit, at 
least.

 So plaintiffs have successfully obtained 

judgments in suits brought under 1605(a)(7).  And there 
were billions of dollars in claims that were asserted

against Iraq.  And -- and, as I said, plaintiffs were 
actively going and trying to seek the actual money that 
the United States was trying to transfer over to Iraq to 
pay immediate costs of the reconstruction.

 But this does not mean -- and I think 

Justice Scalia's question was critical here.  It does 
not mean that the plaintiffs are left without any 
remedy, rather that these plaintiffs have been put on 
the same footing as any other claimant against a foreign 
state that is not on the very small list of designated 
state sponsors of terrorism.  Their claims are subject 
to state-to-state diplomatic resolution.  And, in fact, 
there have been discussions -- there are ongoing 
discussions -- to establish a framework for resolving 
the claims against the Hussein regime.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wouldn't any such 

settlement have to take into account that Iraqi -- the 
Iraqi people themselves were the most numerous and 
probably the worst victims of the terror?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Well, Your Honor, I 

think that -- that that is one consideration.  The 
United Nations has established a mechanism for funding 
many of the victims of the Hussein regime.  And -- and 
-- but the United States would have the obligation to 
represent the interests of the United States citizens

that were injured.  But, as -- as Your Honor's question 
points out, there are a lot of considerations that go 
into the diplomatic or state-to-state resolution of the 
claim beyond those that would be available to a court to 
consider in just adjudicating the particular plaintiff's 
claims.  And that is why these have historically been 
reserved for diplomatic resolution.  So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you don't 

doubt, in absence of the waiver, that this is a claim 
that could proceed under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity 
Act?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  No.  No, I don't. 
And -- and Congress has established as a means to deter 
further acts of terrorism by states that have been so 
designated --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And that claim could 

--

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  -- the abrogation 

of immunity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Putting aside the 
waiver, that claim could proceed despite the fact that 
there has been a change in the governing authority in 
Iraq?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That's right.  The

1605(a)(7) was that the jurisdiction of the courts would 
continue for any claim that arose from acts committed 
while the state was designated.  But the authority that 
the President was given in 1503 was to render those 
statutes immediately inapplicable to Iraq.  And, of 
course, it would not be inapplicable to Iraq to hold 
that today a court would have jurisdiction over Iraq and 
authority to enter a judgment against Iraq pursuant to 
1605(a)(7).  It would be application of that statute.

 So the only way that one can give full 
effect to the plain language of the statute, "make 
inapplicable," is to say that as soon as the President 
exercised that authority, 1605(a)(7) became 
inapplicable, unavailable, as the basis of exercising 
jurisdiction over Iraq.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said that there 

should be deference to what the executive did because of 
his role in foreign affairs.  But in the Foreign 
Sovereign Immunities Act, Congress deliberately withdrew 
what had been the executive's traditional authority and 
said:  President, no more; we are going to set rules of 
how sovereign immunity will operate.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  That is true.  And 
in 1503, Congress restored to the President in a sense a 
very small portion of the authority he had previously

exercised before the FSIA's adoption.  1605(a)(7) on its 
own terms turns on determinations by the executive. 
It's a statute that can be turned on and turned off by 
designating or de-designating a country.  It has a 
particular temporal consequence, the rule that -- that 
the Chief Justice alluded to.

 In 1503, the Congress gave the President a 

different authority to turn that statute off, the 
authority to make it inapplicable only with respect to 
one country, Iraq, and in the context of the most 
dramatic transformation of foreign relations that --
that could transpire.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Mr. Goldstein.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The Court will want to have available to it 

the blue brief for the Petitioners and Joint Appendix 
Volume 2, which together reproduce the statutes that are 
relevant to this case.  And I do want to talk about the 
text of the statutes.

 And the point that I'm going to make from 
the text of the statutes is that the Solicitor General

just correctly described to you what it was that 
Congress was trying to accomplish when he said that the 
structure of 1605 -- 1605(a)(7) of the Foreign Sovereign 
Immunities Act says if you are the victim of torture by 
a nation designated as a state sponsor of terror and 
that designation changes so that you are no longer on 
that list, then you still have a cause of action under 
the FSIA.  The fact that the country changes its ways 
and gets de-designated doesn't change that result.

 Now, what the Solicitor General says is that 
Congress changed that rule in 1503 and that's the debate 
in this case:  Did Congress when it said that the 
President may make inapplicable various statutes which 
they say include section 1605(a)(7), did it change the 
basic rule about what the effect of a designation and a 
rescindment of a designation was, or instead was it 
giving the President a special power to remove the 
designation?

 If all it was doing was giving the power to 
the President to immediately rescind Iraq's designation 
as a terrorist state, if it was a more modest power 
rather than effectively writing into 1605(a)(7) "except 
for Iraq," if it's just a power about rescindment, then 
the rule of 1605(a)(7) that the Solicitor General just 
cited to you, that changing somebody's designation

doesn't affect their liability, would apply here.  So 
just put it in terms --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why would -- why would 

Congress have wanted to make that distinction?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Let's -- let me take you to 

the reason, and that is in Joint Appendix Volume 2. 
Section 620A of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is 
reproduced at 344.  And this is the way that a 
country -- that a statute relating to torture and 
terrorism is made applicable and made inapplicable under 
ordinary processes to a nation.

 So to explain it to you, right now Syria, 
Iran, and Sudan, this statute applies to them.  It is 
inapplicable to Libya and North Korea.  And the reason 
is that Libya and North Korea were originally designated 
--

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a long section.  Which 

part of the section --

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I am going to take you 
straight to the text.  I am giving you the overview 
right now.

 So, they were de-designated.  It works in 
two parts.  A is the prohibition.  This is how you get 
designated.  Prohibition.  The United States shall 
not --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  Where are you?
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sorry.  I'm at 344, and I'm 

in A, prohibition.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay, this is how you get 

designated:  "Prohibition.  The United States shall not 
provide any assistance under this Act" -- this is our 
principal foreign aid statute -- "the Agricultural 
Trade, Development, and Assistance Act of 1954, the 
Peace Corps Act, or the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 
to any country" -- and here's how you get designated "if 
the Secretary of State determines that the government of 
that country has repeatedly provided support for acts of 
international terrorism."  So we've designated Syria, 
Iran, Sudan.

 Now, that designation can be rescinded and 
that's usually what happens.  But there are important 
restrictions on the rescindment that gave rise to the 
enactment of section 1503, and they are in C, recision. 
The Congress limited the President's ability to 
immediately rescind the designation:  "A determination 
made by the Secretary of State under subsection A not --
may not be rescinded unless" -- and there are two rules. 
It can happen in one of two ways.  The first is you get 
a new government:  "A, there has been a fundamental

change in the leadership and policies of the government 
concerned."  Or number 2, the old government changes its 
ways.  That's 2A:  "The government concerned has not 
provided any support for international terrorism during 
the preceding 6-month period.

 So here's the dilemma and, Justice Souter, 
this is the complete explanation for why Congress gave 
the President the power it did in section 1503. 
Remember when the EWSAA is enacted there is a whole 
discussion in the first 30 minutes about the new regime. 
There was no new regime.  There was a discussion about 
how the Saddam Hussein regime had been toppled.  No, it 
hadn't.

 When the EWSAA had been enacted -- was 

enacted, Baghdad had fallen seven days earlier.  There 
was no new Iraqi government.  We would not recognize an 
Iraqi government until June of 2004.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, there may have 
not been a new one, but there certainly was not the old 
one either.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  But, Mr. Chief 

Justice, I'm making a very particular point, and that is 
that the President lacked the power under this statute 
that I have just cited to you, 620A -- and it is also 
the statute that is cited in 1503 -- the President

lacked the power at that time because there was no new 
government and there wasn't a change in policy in the 
old government.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But there's nothing better 
settled -- well, perhaps that's broad.  It is very well 
settled that the President is the one to determine who 
is the lawful and legitimate government that he would 
deal with.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's all that was 

happening here.  And it's not just a question of one 
against the other.  It's a question of what government 
has survived.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Exactly right --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that is under -- and 
under the law something that has always been committed 
to the very large discretion of the President.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I couldn't agree with you 
more, Justice Kennedy.  And here's the relevant point. 
In the spring of 2003 when Congress enacted this 
statute, we had not recognized a new Iraqi government. 
We did that in June of 2004.  So my point is, and I 
think this is very clear from the history, Congress 
enacted section 1503 of the EWSAA because the President 
was powerless under the existing state of the law to

rescind Iraq's designation as a terrorist state.  That's 
what --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But it was -- the text of 
it was not limited to rescinding that designation.  I 
mean, that's the problem, it seems to me.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Well, let's go to the 
text, if we could.  And that is in the blue brief.  It's 
in the appendix to the blue brief.  And it's at 4A.  And 
it's the second proviso, of course, and it appears seven 
lines down.

 "Provided further, that the President may 
make inapplicable" -- that's the language that we are 
going to focus on, Justice Souter -- "make inapplicable 
with respect to Iraq" -- and then it identifies the 
statute -- "section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act 
of 1961 or any provision of law that applies to 
countries that have supported terrorism."

 Now, we are putting aside the debate of 

whether section 1605(a)(7) is such a law.  We are 
assuming it is and you say it, Justice Souter, but he is 
given the power to make inapplicable section 1605(a)(7). 
He isn't just given the power to rescind the 
designation.

 And the question just -- the term "make 

inapplicable" doesn't appear in this context anywhere

else in the U.S. Code.  We have to figure out what it 
means.  And the way that laws that apply to countries 
that have supported terrorism apply or are rendered 
inapplicable, there is a method in the U.S. Code for how 
they are made applicable and inapplicable.

 So, to return to my examples.  If you were 

to ask the United States or Mr. Franklin -- so this 
statutory scheme of laws -- sanctions that apply to 
nations that support terrorism applies to Syria, to 
Iran, it applies to Sudan.  It is inapplicable to Libya, 
North Korea, Guinea-Bissau, Britain, France.  How is it 
that they apply to some and not others?  It's through 
designation.  That's the process for taking something 
that applies and make it inapplicable.  And I can give 
you a lot of other --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this statute 

specifically short-circuits that process.  It says the 
President may at once make inapplicable.  The very 
purpose of it is that the normal process is going to 
take time, and therefore it's being replaced with an 
emergency measure that becomes effective immediately.
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, the de-designation 

becomes effective immediately.  What -- the distinction 
that I am drawing is that there is a strong version of 
the words "make inapplicable," and there is a more

modest version of the words "make inapplicable."

 Iraq and the United States say that when he 
made it inapplicable he in effect essentially wrote it 
out of the U.S. Code or wrote in the exception that says 
"except for Iraq."  We say that "make inapplicable" in 
this context is a term of art that deals with 
designation and rescindment.  And that process is all 
that Congress was trying to do, was to allow the 
President to immediately --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.  Let's -- let's 

assume --

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- for the sake of argument 

that the reasons for -- otherwise the reasons for and 
against the point you've just made are evenly balanced. 
We are on the fence.  Don't we resolve this -- shouldn't 
we resolve this in favor of the President's position, 
simply because in the absence of the statutes that we're 
talking about, starting with the Foreign Sovereign 
Immunities Act, the President would have had under the 
foreign policy power of Presidents the authority to stop 
suits like this dead in the water simply by taking the 
position that that should be the result?  So that if in 
doubt, shouldn't we construe these statutes consistently 
with the traditional foreign policy authority of the

President, in which case we get off the fence and we go 
in the way of the Petitioners rather than your way?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I would say, no, because 

that regime, as was indicated in the first 30 minutes, 
has been profoundly changed by the enactment of the 
FSIA.  We adopted a different --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it's been profoundly 

changed if we accept your argument.  I mean, at the 
moment the question is whether it has been profoundly 
changed or not.  We've got a statutory mess.  And in a 
case in which the statutes are seemingly subject to --
to -- to arguments either way, why don't we go with 
tradition?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Well, I do want to 

come to whether we are in equipoise in just a second.  I 
do think the fact that Congress changed the model so 
that we don't use, in effect, the Tape Memorandum model.
 Second, remember, Justice Souter, that this 

isn't a return to that model.  What used to happen 
before the FSIA is the President would come into court 
and say I think that this nation has immunity and the 
court would decide on the basis of that case by case. 
But it was the President making the determination, case 
by case.  This is something unknown.  This is very 
different, if I could just explain how on their --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but the President, 

quite apart from the immunity designation, the President 
had the authority to compromise suits.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, fine, and if that is 
espousal power continues to exist, then the President 
can attempt to exercise it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I don't know whether it 

continues to exist or not for the sake of this argument, 
and I'm not -- I'm not making that point for the sake of 
this argument.  I'm simply saying that if it is 
otherwise unclear, given that that power was 
traditionally enjoyed by the President, why do we not 
construe the -- or resolve the equipoise if it gets to 
that point, in the President's favor rather than your 
favor?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  So the -- two 
reasons, the first is this is not an attempt at 
espousal, unlike Dames & Moore and cases like that. 
Remember the President hasn't set up some sort of 
mechanism for resolving these claims.  He is simply 
saying that they are --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, he hasn't set it up 
because he thinks he has got the authority under this 
statute or had the authority under this statute.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Souter, it wouldn't

work like that.  If the President were engaging in an 
act of espousal then he would have set up some mechanism 
for resolving the claims.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: 

Oh, I -- I quite agree with 

that.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  So can I --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  So I suppose the first step 

in that direction is to stop the suit that's going on 
now.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, the President 

purported to do that nine -- excuse me, five or six 
years ago and if he were going to set up a mechanism, I 
think he would have.

 But can I just then just come to the premise 

of whether we are --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But why -- why shouldn't 
we treat this -- yes, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities 
Act said Congress is setting the rules.  But why doesn't 
this emergency measure effectively restore to the 
President under these special circumstances the power 
that he once had?  Congress ceding back to the 
President back to the President for the purposes of 
dealing with Iraq, the authority -- the control 
authority he once had?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  So let's -- if I

could accept the premise that -- and not try to combat 
the premise of what we would do in the case of 
equipoise, let me turn to the question of what statute 
really means and why we shouldn't be in equipoise.  The 
Court generally has not assumed that emergency 
appropriations measures issues, particular their 
provisos, changed the jurisdiction of the Federal 
courts, much less give the President the power to change 
the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.  And it has in 
related context taken language like "any provision" and 
said well, we are looking for a clear statement of law 
by Congress to make sure it has confronted this 
situation.

 When it attempts to -- when the argument on 

the other side is that the Congress has passed a law 
that shifts the balance of power between Congress and 
the legislature and the executive in cases like 
Atascadero, in cases like Raygor, Will, these are all 
cases that had said statutes that said "any," and the 
Court said well, because this a -- a relatively strange 
thing to provide in the proviso to an appropriations 
measure, for example, we would ask that there be a clear 
statement.  So that would be one reason that we are not 
in equipoise.

going to be needed to reconstruct Iraq in -- in the wake 
of the war and the money could be provided directly by 
the United States through foreign assistance, which is 
part of the thrust of -- of this provision, certainly. 
And the argument is that this is closely related to it, 
because it freed up other money that would be used for 
reconstruction.  So why is there anything odd about this 
being in an appropriations provision?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Because this -- well, 
because what Congress was doing was confronting an 
emergency.  There is not a breath, in either the 
President's transmittal of the statute, the legislative 
history of the statute, or anything else that says that 
Congress was dealing with the sort of medium to 
long-term health of the Iraqi population or the Iraqi 
government or the Iraqi economy.  It didn't -- one thing 
you would have expected if that was Congress's intent is 
that Congress would have dealt with Iraq's debts, Saddam 
Hussein's debts, and would you also suspect that this 
wouldn't sunset, which is the eighth proviso that hasn't 
been discussed never much.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why does it say then 

any other provision of law?  You know, Congress could

have explained its more narrow purpose in a few words.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  And I mean, just to add to 

that --

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  It said under 620A of 
Foreign Assistance or any other provision of law. 
Clearly they are going beyond, it seems to me, the --
the premise which your argument rests on, the argument 
that you've just made.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Oh, Justice Souter, I don't 

think that that -- let me, if I could take the 
two points in turn.  In cases like Atascadero, Will, 
Raygor, it's the same language; it's "any."  And the 
Court has said we require a plain statement when 
Congress is going to do something that would change the 
balance in the relationship between the branches of the 
government or between the Federal and State governments.

 And Justice Souter, we don't deny it goes 
beyond section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act; it 
goes to other things that involve aid to the Iraqi 
government.  What it doesn't do is reach pending --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  Fine.  But there is 

no textual basis for drawing the line once you get 
beyond 620A at the point you want to draw it.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I actually do disagree and 
believe you can logically look at the statute -- in the 
sense that the word "any" means "every," that is true. 
But if you look at what Congress was trying to 
accomplish, it was much more focused on questions of the 
immediate economic impact of the need to begin 
reconstruction in Iraq right away.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Goldstein, could I ask 

this question?  You are reading into it the exception, 
of the words "any other provision of law."  And I can 
understand your argument one of two ways, and I want to 
be sure which.  Are you saying it means any other 
provision of the law, except those that affect the 
jurisdiction of courts?  Or are you saying any other 
provisions of law that relate to foreign assistance?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I am saying that except for 
those that relate to jurisdiction, because that is the 
kind of thing that you would expect Congress to deal 
with correctly.

 The answer to Justice Ginsburg's question in 
the first 30 minutes is has this Court ever confronted a 
statute and construed it to remove the jurisdiction of 
the Federal courts without expressly saying so, is no.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you -- I would like to 
follow up on Justice Stevens's question.  Think of three

categories, A is the category which you could see that 
other questions of law apply to.  B, is this case, and 
C, is the other -- other things -- other things that it 
might apply to, but in your opinion it would be absurd 
to apply them to that.  All right, what's in category C?
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  If it's anything, it would 
be the export of military hardware.  In the immediate 
wake of the fall of Baghdad, when there is no new 
government, right?  There is no replacement regime.  If 
you read "any" to mean literally "every" then you could 
ship munitions, nuclear materials and the like when 
there is no state there and it's silly to think that 
Congress intended that.  Its reasons for enacting the 
statute had to be --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Wait, wait.  After Saddam 

Hussein falls --

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- and we have a new 

government --

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We don't have a new 

government.

shipments?  I mean, is that a real problem when there is 
nobody over there to pay for them?  You are worried 
about -- about armaments producers shipping -- shipping 
goods when there is nobody who has ordered them and is 
going to pay for them?  I mean, that's absurd.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, it's not -- it's not 

entirely clear there is still a government in Iraq.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right, is there any one 

other than that?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  Okay.

other including this case.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, Justice Breyer, in --

the same point was made in cases like Atascadero and 
Raygor.  "Any" means "every" except for the States.  In 
that example.

 But can I just make quite clear, we have two 

lines of argument.  And I think it's important to 
recognize that.  We have the debate over what any other 
means and does that include section 1605(a)(7).  That's 
what we have been discussing here, and the idea that any 
means every, and Congress spoke broadly and so that's 
what we have.

 But we have the other incredibly important 

arguments of what it means to make a sanction 
inapplicable.  Which is separate and independent of that 
point, and the question of whether the statutes sunset 
as the Acree court did.  And I want to return First to 
those point of what it is to make inapplicable a statute 
that applies to nations that have supported terrorism. 
And I want to return to the statutory text and explain 
why our more modest reading of "make inapplicable" is 
the right one.

 So the statutory text again is at 4a.  Here 
are, I think, the strong statutory indications that we 
are right, that what Congress was trying to do was to

allow the President to immediately de-designate Iraq as 
a terrorist state.  First, there is a direct parallel 
between the language "a statute that applies to 
countries that have supported terrorism" and the 
directive that the President can make it inapplicable. 
That tells you, look at how it is that these statutes 
apply in the first place, and the linguistic term of art 
is to do the reverse.  Take something that applies and 
make it inapplicable.

 And something that applies to an -- statutes 

apply to countries that have supported terrorism under 
American law only in one way, through designation.  And 
what happens is that the President was allowed to 
rescind it.

 The second textual reason for our more 
modest reading of make inapplicable is reference to 
section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act.  So we know 
one thing:  even if we debate and disagree, Justice 
Breyer, about what any means in this context, we know 
the Congress told the President he could immediately 
make inapplicable section 620A.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why did -- why did he need 
the statute to do that?  In other words if the President 
had the power to designate in the first place, normally 
that assumes the power to -- to rescind the designation.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's exactly right, but 

that's the point.  When I took you to the text of 620A, 
which was at 344 of the joint appendix volume 2, 
Justice Souter, he didn't have the power to do it right 
away.  Remember, Baghdad falls; there is no new 
government; and the old government hasn't changed its 
ways.  So he lacks the power to remove the designation. 
And I can prove that to you.  It wasn't until there was 
a new government that the President actually did 
formally rescind the designation pursuant to the Foreign 
Assistance Act.  It wasn't until 2004.  After --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's -- that's 

just a belt-and-suspenders act.  I mean, he -- he has 
the authority here, and he -- although it may look 
difficult, he has to envision there may be people who 
challenge that -- his interpretation of the law.  So 
there's the other provision that will make it 
inapplicable under that as well.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I -- I disagree, but we will 

accept that.  Mr. Chief Justice, my point isn't, hey, 
look, he himself acknowledged that he needed to exercise 
his de-designation power.  My point is different, and 
that is the fact that he didn't do this under the 
Foreign Assistance Act until 2004 is a strong indication 
that he couldn't do it before.  If he could have done it

before, he would have.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And it may also be an 

indication that he thought he had effectively 
accomplished what he wanted by -- by acting under this 
statute, and therefore he had other fish to fry.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I -- I don't understand, 

Justice Souter, why he would in 2004, after a new 
government is recognized, suddenly decide to 
de-designate Iraq.  There wasn't any -- the only --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I -- I don't know, either. 
I mean, I can't -- I can't read minds, but there is an 
interpretation that is quite possible consistent with 
the text of this statute, that he thought that by acting 
under 1503, he had done everything that he needed to do. 
Why he had at some subsequent time said, well, you know, 
I'll -- I'll use belt as well as suspenders, I don't 
know.  But it would be consistent with the assumption 
that he had the authority here.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, it -- I agree it would 

be consistent with the assumption that he had the 
authority here.  That's -- I'm not trying to negative 
that.  What I'm trying to say is that the authority 
under 620A -- the fact that he exercised it in 2004 is a 
strong indication that that's -- it's not the only 
possible reading, but it's a strong indication that

that's when he thought he got the power.  The --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But, Mr. Goldstein, 

before you finish your argument, I'd like to know what 
you think about the claim for relief.  The D.C. Circuit 
said this is a mere jurisdictional provision, and it 
doesn't provide a private right of action; the new 
statute does, but that doesn't apply to Iraq.  So, what 
was the source of the claim -- what is the source of 
these plaintiffs' claim for relief?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The Solicitor General has it 

right.  Post-Acree, these claims -- these types of 
claims were pleaded principally as State-law claims, and 
that has been recognized as providing a substantive 
cause of action.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Which -- which State law?
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The State law generally of 

the home State of the plaintiffs.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So that -- by that 
reasoning, people all over the world could sue the 
United States in their courts alleging that the United 
States has engaged in cruel and inhuman treatment with 
respect to their nationals.  The same theory would apply 
-- use the law of the state where the national comes 
from.  So, it could be Iraq, could be Belgium, could be 
Yemen -- any place.  So -- but the claim you are saying

exists would be a kind of universal one, if it's -- the 
United States could use it, any other place in the world 
could, too.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Well, that is clear -- well, 
in -- in terms of whether or not a foreign country would 
look to our law and say, well, we're just doing the same 
thing as you do, that would arise from -- also from new 
section 1605A.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No.  Looking to their own 

law.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes, I understand, 

Justice Ginsburg.  Section -- for example, section 
1605A, the statute that's created by the 2008 NDAA, 
creates an affirmative U.S. cause of action.  There is 
always going to be an underlying domestic cause of 
action that underlies the FSIA, whether it's State law 
or instead it's Federal law.  That is a -- a debate 
about whether the FSIA is a good statute or not, but 
it's one that Congress has resolved --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, no.  I mean, it's 
also a debate as to whether the call on that question 
should be a Federal one or a State one, whether -- there 
are all sorts of conditions attached to the -- the suits 
that are allowed under 620A.  And you are saying that, 
even without those conditions, any State -- Oklahoma --

can decide Americans can -- can sue foreign countries.

the source of the underlying cause of action is not 
presented by this case.  The D.C. Circuit has resolved 
that question in our favor.

it.  The -- the -- I had said that I also wanted to 
continue with the text, on the question of what it is to 
"make inapplicable."  I pointed out how it is that all 
of these statutes are applied and made inapplicable.  I 
also want to draw the contrast between the two operative

beginning, the statute says the President may suspend 
the application of any provision of the Iraq Sanctions 
Act, which is the kind of power that they are talking 
about, essentially to lift the statute; whereas, the 
term of art, we think, "make inapplicable" in the 
context of these statutes is the narrow power to 
de-designate the state as a state sponsor of terror.

 But let me just return, if I can --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

If I could just 

pause --

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- for a moment.
 The -- the President in exercising this 

waiver purported to act not only under the statute but 
under the Constitution as well.  So if we were to accept 
your argument, we would have to decide whether or not he 
had the power under the Constitution.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I don't think the question 
is presented here.  It could have been an argument that 
was made, but I don't believe it's presented by this 
case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's not 

presented because your friends on the other side think 
the -- on a narrower ground, that the statute applies.

seems to me that he has an argument -- the President has 
the argument that he has this authority under the 
Constitution.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I agree he has that 

argument; he just hasn't made it in -- in this case --
in his -- in the Iraq's -- Iraq hasn't made it in the 
cert petition, I should say, in the question on this 
Court -- on which this Court granted certiorari.

 I think to decide the debate, Justice 
Souter, of whether we're in equipoise here and the 
debate about whether or not the power was grand or 
instead more modest, we have to resolve the -- the 
question of what it is that Congress intended to do in 
this proviso to this emergency appropriations measure. 
Was it confronting a very specific moment in time at 
which Baghdad had just fallen and we needed to get 
emergency -- emergency aid to Iraq?  Or was it, instead, 
fundamentally changing our policy, making Iraq an ally 
despite the fact that there wasn't even an Iraqi 
government there?  Was he given -- was Congress giving 
the power to the President to immunize Iraq permanently 
from liability under the FSIA, which doesn't even exist 
with respect to our closest allies, Britain and France? 
That is a significant over-reading of what --

"permanently"?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Because --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Just under -- just under 
this statute, if he makes inapplicable, he can rescind 
the action that made it inapplicable.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I don't understand how, 
Justice Souter.  The -- the powers of the President 
expired.  This statute sunset.  Their whole point is --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well -- no, but during the 
period in which the statute is applicable, I don't know 
of any reason why he cannot change his designation of 
inapplicability.  So that the argument of a permanent 
change in the foreign policy of the United States or the 
-- or the powers relating to the foreign policy of the 
United States doesn't seem to me a legitimate argument.
 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's fine while it was in 
effect, but it's not anymore.  Their point is that they 
permanently made the FSIA -- the -- section 620A of the 
Foreign Assistance Act in 2008 and 2009 inapplicable, 
and that would be incredibly unusual.  Why would we give 
that power with respect to Iraq when we don't to our 
very closest allies?  Remember the statute expired, and 
they say it's still in effect.  That's their answer to 
the sunset.  It makes no sense at all.

it in its context of being a modest attempt to deal with 
an immediate problem.  And section 1605(a)(7) says what 
happens when you deal with that immediate problem.  If 
you change the designation of a state -- if they become 
an ally, if they change their ways -- they are still 
liable for the acts of torture they committed while they 
were designated.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think -- I think what 

they say is that the designation remains in effect.  I 
don't think they say that the power to undesignate 
disappears.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I don't understand --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'd be -- well, I'll ask 

them, but I'd be surprised if it's --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Let me -- let me ask the 

same question with respect to the new statute, the 
"capital A" statute.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Would there be -- and I 

just -- I don't know the answer to this.  Would there be 
authority under the "capital A" statute to undo the 
designation?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No.  That -- that entire 

provision was waived with respect to Iraq.  And we're --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  He waived it, but 

the question is whether he would have had the authority 
to undesignate or -- or to rescind the designation of 
inapplicability if he had wished to exercise the 
authority under the "capital A" statute.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I have no -- I'm not aware 
of any provision of the 2008 NDAA that would have given 
the President any such power.  They say that on the day 
the President exercised his -- his powers that the 
Foreign Assistance Act, section 620A, became 
inapplicable to Iraq, that sanction, and that that 
inapplicability survived the sunset of the statute in 
2005.  How it would come back -- how it would come back 
and continue to apply in Iraq in the case of a regime 
change in Iraq, I have no idea at all.

MR. FRANKLIN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- we have just been 

discussing?

 MR. FRANKLIN:  It is not the position of the 

Government of Iraq that in the very hypothetical 
instance in which something would change that they could 
not be redesignated.  We believe they could be 
redesignated.  We believe that is also the position of 
the United States.  When we say "permanent," we mean as 
opposed to just temporary.  And I might add it is our 
position that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought you'd say that.
 MR. FRANKLIN:  It is our position that it 

will be permanent because the Government of Iraq is now 
a very strong ally of the United States in the fight 
against terrorism, not a sponsor of it.

 Just a few other points based on the 

argument that just occurred.  They are interpreting the 
statute apparently now to say that the President only 
had the power to rescind the -- the previous 
designations, but that's not what the statute says.  If 
that's what Congress had meant, they would have done 
that.  They said "make inapplicable."  And their entire 
case depends on that statute being applicable today 
because it serves as the abrogation of Iraq's sovereign

immunity, and it serves as the predicate for subject 
matter jurisdiction.

 It cannot be both applicable and having been 

made inapplicable.

 The other point that was mentioned -- and 
also I would also say in this regard that our foreign 
policy towards Iraq is different than our foreign policy 
towards other former state-sponsored terrorism.  Libya, 
for example, was taken off the list, but there was an 
express requirement that Libya answer to the claims that 
were before it.  And, of course, that was because the --
the government that sponsored that terrorism, the -- the 
Khadafi Government, was still in power.

 Here we had gone into the country with U.S. 
military force aided by our allies, and we have ousted 
the regime, and we were seeking to support Iraq in its 
efforts to rebuild.

 There was a point about the de-designation 

that was done in 2004.  The Secretary of State -- and it 
is cited on page 25 in the blue brief.  The Secretary of 
State said in the de-designation that it was largely 
symbolic or perhaps a belt and suspenders, but he said 
it was largely symbolic in light of the prior EWSAA 
determination.  However -- and this is relevant to 
something else that occurred.  The de-designation was

also necessary to allow military exports to Iraq because 
under the proviso 3 of the EWSAA, military exports were 
specifically exempted from the President's authority.
 That also shows that Congress knew how to 

make exceptions to the President's power when it wanted 
to.

 And, finally, I would say that we do agree 

with the analysis that Justice Souter has -- has 
posited, and that is that this involves a lesser power 
than the President could have exercised on his own 
authority to -- to completely espouse the claims.  It, 
therefore, fits entirely within what is normally done in 
these kinds of cases.

 And, Justice Ginsburg, it is also the 

position of the Government of Iraq that Iraqi victims 
ought to be included in any state-to-state diplomatic 
negotiations.  But that is a matter for the two 
governments to resolve between themselves, and that is 
one of the reasons why these kinds of claims have always 
been resolved in that manner in the past.  They are 
reciprocal, bilateral concerns that affect two very 
close allies.  Those governments ought to be negotiating 
and resolving those claims, whatever claims there are on 
both sides, between the two of them.

 If there are no further questions, thank
