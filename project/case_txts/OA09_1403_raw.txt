v. Halliburton Company. 

 Mr. Boies. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID BOIES 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. BOIES:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it please 

the Court: 

 The district court below found, and it is 

not disputed here, that the plaintiff fulfilled all of 

the requirements of Rule 23(a) for class certification. 

The district court also found, and the court of appeals 

affirmed, that the plaintiffs demonstrated all of the 

requirements for class certification under 23(b)(3) 

except for the Fifth Circuit's loss causation 

requirement.  The court below recognized that whether or 

not there was an efficient market was not disputed.  It 

was conceded that we have an efficient market here. 

21 

There were no challenges -­

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Mr. Boies, if could 

23 

I just stop you there. 

24

25

 MR. BOIES:  Certainly.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What if that had 

3

Official - Subject to Final Review 

been disputed?  Is that something that can be disputed 

at the certification stage? 

 MR. BOIES:  Yes, Your Honor. 

 The -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Boies, what's the 

difference then?  Why could that be disputed at the 

certification stage, but not the question of price 

impact? 

 MR. BOIES:  Because the issue of efficient 

market goes to the presumption of reliance, and if the 

court holds at the certification stage that there is no 

efficient market, then the basis for presuming 

class-wide reliance is impacted.  And so you can have a 

situation in which the common issues do not predominate 

over the individualized issues.  That cannot happen with 

respect to loss causation because, as Respondent 

concedes here, loss causation is a common issue. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, how about materiality?

25

 MR. BOIES:  No, Your Honor, we don't think 

you can rebut materiality at the -- at the certification 

stage.  I would note that under the Fifth Circuit rule, 

loss causation is in addition to materiality. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, now I'm a little 

confused, because the efficient market and materiality 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

are all part of the prima facie case triggering the 

Basic presumption.  So, why couldn't you rebut one part 

of that case but not another part of that case? 

 MR. BOIES:  Because the issue of materiality 

is something that goes to a class-wide common issue. 

The issue of reliance can go to whether or not issues 

predominate or not.  Rule 23(b)(3) talks about whether 

common issues predominate or not.  That's the issue at 

class certification stage.  The merits issue is not 

implicated at class certification -­

stage? 

 MR. BOIES:  Excuse me, Your Honor? 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  The Basic presumption can be 

-- can the Basic presumption be rebutted at the 

certification stage?

 MR. BOIES:  The Basic presumption of 

reliance, yes, Your Honor.  For example, if you were to 

take a situation in which you -- not present here, but 

where you disputed whether or not the market was 

efficient or not, that is something that could be 

decided at the class certification stage.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Can it be rebutted by proof 

other than proof generally disproving the efficiency of 

the market? 

 MR. BOIES:  We believe under the Court's 

decision in Basic that that is something that is 

6 

reserved for trial, that -- that rebuttal. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And what is that based on, 

8 

the footnote in Basic? 

9

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

 MR. BOIES:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's pretty thin, 

isn't it?  It's a -- it's dictum in a footnote in an 

opinion issued at a time when conditional class 

certification was permitted.  Do you have anything else 

to support that?

 MR. BOIES:  I don't from this Court, Your 

16 

Honor. 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you have anything in the 

18 

rule to support that? 

19

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. BOIES:  Anything in the rule?

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes. 

 MR. BOIES:  Well, I think the -- I think 

what the rule does is it talks about whether issues of 

common issue predominate over individualized issue.  And 

since this is something that would be at the class 

certification stage, not creating individualized issues, 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

we would think that is something that's reserved for 

trial. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Boies, how would it 

4 

work in your view of the case?  That is, you say that 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

the loss, what's been called loss causation, is not 

something to be decided at the certification stage, but 

at the trial or summary judgment.  Well, how -- how 

would the plaintiff class prove loss causation?  Given 

the reliance hurdle that you have surmounted, now you're 

10

in -- you have your class certified; how does the class 

11 

prove loss causation. 

12

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. BOIES:  As -- as this Court indicated in 

Dura, in order to prove loss causation, you must 

demonstrate that you had either an increase in the 

prices, and this -- this assumes that you are concealing 

negative information; the reverse would be true if you 

were concealing positive information -- an increase at 

the time that the concealment took place or a decline 

when the actual facts were revealed.

 And it would be required at summary judgment 

by a summary judgment standard, and at trial by a trial 

standard, and at the pleading stage by a pleading 

standard, for the plaintiff to make out that case.  In 

other words, there are three times loss causation is 

tested:  Pleadings, summary judgment, and trial.  The 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

question is whether a fourth test should be interposed 

at the class certification stage. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, doesn't a lack 

4 

of response to a disclosure -- couldn't it be in some 

5

6

7 

8 

9 

situations reflective of an inefficient market? 

 MR. BOIES:  Yes, Your Honor, I think it 

could.  I think that you -- you could very well have a 

situation in which if you demonstrated a lack of 

response, that could impact the issue of efficiency; and 

10

I think that would be an issue that-- that in a proper 

11 

case where unlike this one it was presented -­

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why is it?  Why is this 

case -- why can't you pigeonhole this case into that 

argument, which, it appears what your -- what the 

Respondents have done is move away from the loss 

causation proof and gone to the issue of whether they 

rebutted reliance or not. 

 MR. BOIES:  The -- the problem is, as the 

19 

Fifth Circuit noted at page 335 of the F.3d report, 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

efficiency of this market was conceded below.  In other 

words, the Respondents conceded that this market was 

efficient?  So that issue -- that issue was not 

presented, and the rebuttal issue was not -- was not 

presented in this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. -- Mr. Boies, you 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

talked about loss causation.  The Respondents assert 

that that's not what the Fifth Circuit was really doing, 

that -- that really they're just trying to rebut the 

presumption essentially of -- of Basic by -- by showing 

that at the -- at the far end, there was -- there was 

6 

nothing that could justify the presumption. 

7

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

 Would you be satisfied if we just said that 

we agree with you that the requirement to prove loss 

causation is -- is no good, and sent it back to the 

Fifth Circuit and then let the Fifth Circuit adopt the 

theory that Respondents assert they have already 

adopted?  I mean, it's sort of a Pyrrhic victory, it 

seems to me, if you haven't just disapproved loss 

causation.

 MR. BOIES:  Well, it depends on how the 

16 

Fifth Circuit then construes reliance. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, they -- they would 

construe it the way Respondents say they have already 

construed it.

 MR. BOIES:  Your Honor, I think that if they 

simply changed the wording and called loss causation 

reliance, obviously it wouldn't make any difference. 

But as this Court indicated in Basic, and just last 

month in Matrixx, loss causation and reliance are two 

distinct elements.  And the reason that's important in 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

this particular context is that reliance can create a 

situation where you have individualized issues 

predominating over common issues. 

 Loss causation can't because, as Respondents 

concede here, loss causation is a class-wide issue. 

Either -- there either is loss causation or is not loss 

causation.  That, as this Court held in Dura, is an 

element of the merits case.  It is one that we must 

prove at all three stages -- pleadings, summary 

10

judgment, and trial.  But it is not something that goes 

11 

to the Rule 23 standard.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think what you've said is 

that there's really no difference between loss causation 

and what Respondents assert that the Fifth Circuit 

found. 

 MR. BOIES:  No, Your Honor.  I did not mean 

to say that.  I think that there is a difference.  I 

think there's a -- I think there are -- there are two 

differences.  There's a difference between what 

Respondents say and what the Fifth Circuit says.  The 

Fifth Circuit talks about loss causation, says it's in 

addition to efficient market, does not talk about 

reliance. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

 MR. BOIES:  There's also a difference

between what Respondents say and what this Court has 

said in Basic and Matrixx and the other cases, in terms 

of what is required to prove for class certification. 

What is required to prove for class certification under 

Rule 23, unless and until Rule 23 is changed, is that 

common issues predominate.  Common issues will 

predominate even with respect to what the Respondents 

here argue because -- because what they argue, just like 

loss causation, is a common issue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay, but -- but you -- you 

would want us to say that and not just say that loss 

causation -­

 MR. BOIES:  Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.  Yes, 

14 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you see or what 

difference do you see between their loss causation 

evidence and an inefficient market?  Could they -­

assuming there was no stipulation in this case, do you 

see any difference in -- in how they could use the fact 

that other information affected the market and not this 

one?  Or is it your theory of the case that there is no 

evidence that they could marshal to show that this is an 

inefficient market? 

 MR. BOIES:  I don't believe under this 

Court's decision in Basic that, given the actual 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

objective facts that have been admitted -- it's a very 

public market, very widespread distribution of 

information, a lot of analysts are reporting on it -- I 

don't believe that as a objective factual matter they 

would be able ever to demonstrate that this was not an 

6 

efficient market. 

7

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

 If you had a much smaller market, indeed if 

you -- if you had a market as the Court was considering 

in Basic, which was a much smaller market, much less 

public, much less analyst support, there may be areas in 

which they -- they could rebut it.  But I think, given 

what we all know about the Halliburton stocks -- widely 

traded, large number of shares traded, a lot of 

analysts, a lot of public information -- I don't believe 

under this Court's decision in Basic you could conclude 

16 

reasonably that that was not an efficient market. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you say to -- to the 

following argument, that there are some economists who 

say that, even in a market that is generally efficient, 

there can be instances in which the market does not 

incorporate certain statements into the price of a 

stock; and therefore even when it is demonstrated that 

the market meets the test for efficiency that the lower 

courts have settled upon in the wake of Basic, the 

defendant in a -- in a class action where there is 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

reliance on the Basic presumption should be permitted at 

the class certification stage to prove that the 

allegedly fraudulent statements had no impact on price, 

and by doing that destroy the theory that the class 

relied on the statements, because they relied on the 

6 

price which incorporated the statements?

25

 MR. BOIES:  I -- I think, Your Honor, that 

if you have a situation in which the proof is 

class-wide, it is something that goes only to summary 

judgment or trial.  It does not go to the class 

certification stage.  With respect to the issue of 

whether somebody is relying on an efficient market, that 

is distinct from whether a particular statement was or 

was not actionable.

 In other words, the summary judgment issue, 

the trial issue, is whether the particular statement was 

actionable and that includes all of the things that the 

court identifies.  But those issues are going to be, if 

there is an efficient market, class-wide issues.  In 

other words, it's not going to be the case that in a 

particular instance a statement did not get into the 

market will affect only one member of the class.  It's 

going to affect all members of the class.  Because it is 

something that is common all of the class members, Rule 

23 says that is something for trial, not for class

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, whether there's an 

efficient market is also common to all members of the 

class, so why would you make an exception for that?

 MR. BOIES:  Because if there's no efficient 

market, then individualized issues are going to 

predominate.  That is, the test under Rule 23 is whether 

individual issues or common issues are going to 

predominate.  If you destroy the efficient market theory 

in a particular case, then individual issues of reliance 

can predominate.  However, that can't happen with 

respect to loss causation or price distortion or any of 

these other issues that are fundamental to the merits 

and are common to the entire class, because if there's 

no loss causation, there's no cause of action.  As this 

Court held in Dura, there must be loss causation.  So if 

there's no loss causation there aren't any individual 

issues to adjudicate. 

 If there are no more questions, I would save 

the remainder of my time for rebuttal. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

21

22 

23 

24 

25

reasons:  First, it's conducting a merits inquiry that's 

not tethered to the Rule 23 requirements; second, it's 

taking a presumption and requiring plaintiffs to prove 

it; and third, it's confusing the distinct elements of 

reliance and loss causation.

 Just to start in with some of the Court's 

questions:  First, Justice Scalia's:  Does the court 

require proof of loss causation?  The Fifth Circuit 

could not be more clear.  It is not talking about 

rebutting the presumption of reliance, giving the 

defendants an opportunity to do that at class 

certification.  It is putting an affirmative burden on 

plaintiffs that they have to meet in every single case, 

even if the defendants do not come to court with any 

evidence.  And that is a very heavy burden, as the 

district court in this case realized. 

 And just to make this as concrete as 

possible, loss causation is the question at the end of 

the day, whether the price decline that caused the 

losses was sufficiently related to the earlier alleged 

material misstatement and whether there was any other 

15

cause that could have led to the price decline.

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

 So if a plaintiff cannot come in and prove 

loss causation, there could be many reasons for that. 

It may be because the market is not efficient.  It could 

also be because there's no material misstatement.  But 

it could also be, as this Court recognized in Dura, that 

there was a material misstatement, it did inflate the 

stock price, but then other causes such as a bad economy 

or other news about the company came along, and that's 

what caused the stock price to drop.  Justice -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you acknowledged that 

if the cause was the fact that the market was not 

efficient, that could be raised at the certification 

stage.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, that's certainly what 

the Court suggested in Basic and what the courts of 

appeals have done, is to say that that's a threshold 

showing that is sufficiently collateral to the merits 

that it needs to be made, so that the presumption can be 

invoked in the first instance. 

 But these ideas about rebutting the 

presumption by showing that at the end of the day the 

plaintiff can't prove its case, these are things, as Mr. 

Boies said, that stand or fall on a class-wide basis. 

And the real problem with the Fifth Circuit's decision 

16

13

15

is that it did not tie its proof of loss causation to 

the requirements of Rule 23.  Everyone agrees here that 

loss causation stands or falls on a class-wide basis. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The rule isn't, I take it 

-- or correct me if I'm wrong -- that simply because the 

issue is on a class-wide basis, it can't be challenged 

at the certification stage.  We don't have a rule that's 

that broad, do we?  Or am I missing a point? 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, that's what Rule 23, 

23(b)(3), which is the one at issue here -- the question 

is do common issues predominate over individual ones. 

What you're trying to answer is can this group of people 

proceed together, not can this group of people make out 

their case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But suppose there's no 

16 

demonstrated basis that that common issue exists? 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Then I think the plaintiff 

should lose at the 12(b)(6) stage, and that is a stage 

that has real bite after this Court's decision in Dura 

and after the PSLRA.  There are heightened pleading 

requirements that apply.  There are plaintiffs that will 

lose at summary judgment on the issue of loss causation, 

for example, because, A, either they don't allege a 

price drop, B, they don't connect the price drop to the 

earlier distortion of the market when there's a material

 There can be many reasons that they lose at 

that merits stage, but class certification is not a 

merits stage, and the Fifth Circuit made it one because 

of its own policy judgments about the effects of class 

certification.  And with all due respect to the Fifth 

Circuit, it's just not that Court's judgment to make 

that -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Class certification 

is not a merits determination except with respect to 

reliance?  Except with respect to the fraud on the 

market theory?  That you can; that is a merits inquiry 

and you can decide it at the class certification stage? 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And except, just to add to 

the Chief Justice's question, an efficient market 

16 

theory? 

17

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MS. SAHARSKY:  That's right.  You're asking 

is this theory going to be available to the plaintiffs 

at trial, and the way that the plaintiffs show that the 

theory is available to them is by establishing an 

efficient market and saying that they traded within the 

time period while the price was distorted.  It's just 

like establishing any other threshold inquiry that would 

make evidence or a legal theory available at trial.

 But the question the Court is supposed to be 

18

asking at the 23, at the Rule 23 stage, the class 

certification stage, is not can these people win on the 

merits.  And that's a question the Fifth Circuit was 

asking.  The question it's supposed to ask is can this 

group of people proceed together. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  You seem to -- maybe I don't 

understand your argument, but you and Mr. Boies seem to 

be arguing that whether there is a common question -­

that it is a common question whether there is a common 

10

question, and therefore that has to wait until the 

11 

merits stage.  Is that what you're saying?

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

 MS. SAHARSKY:  No, that's not what we're 

saying.  What we're saying is when common issues 

predominate on the issue of reliance, and when the 

Petitioners -- or when the plaintiffs invoke fraud on 

the market and they show that there is an efficient 

market, this Court said in Basic, they can all proceed 

together because they are showing that the price -- that 

the material misstatement was reflected in the stock 

price.  This is an impersonal market in which you rely 

on the stock price.  They all rely on it in the same 

way. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And if they show that the 

24 

statement was not incorporated in the price, in the 

25

price, and they're not claiming that they relied, that 

19
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

every member of the class actually relied on the 

statement, they're all claiming they relied on the price 

- if they show that the statement wasn't incorporated in 

the price, then why doesn't reliance cease to be a 

common issue and become a question of an individual 

issue that would have to be proved by each, each member 

of the class? 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, in that circumstance 

9 

reliance ceases to be and the case cannot be established 

10

on the merits.  They stand or fall together on the 

11 

merits.  Their theory is the same for all of them. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, but the fact that they 

would lose on the merits doesn't necessarily mean that 

they are entitled to class certification.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Right.  They're entitled to 

class certification if they have a common issue.  And 

what the Court said in Basic is that if they set out the 

prerequisites for the fraud on the market, which the 

court of appeals agreed were met in this case, that they 

could proceed together.  That threshold showing is 

21 

required. 

22

23 

24 

25

 Justice Kagan, I take your point that there 

is -- that even the question of whether the market is 

efficient is a common one, so perhaps one could 

logically say:  Well, they have a common issue on the 

20
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

efficiency of the market; why should they even have to 

show that at class certification?  But this Court said 

in Basic, and the courts of appeals have said, it's 

reasonable in that case since it's so divorced from the 

merits to require a threshold showing to even allow them 

6 

to invoke the presumption at the outset. 

7

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

 But that is very, very different from what 

the Fifth Circuit said in this case.  The Fifth Circuit 

in this case said basically:  Prove your whole case. 

You don't just have to prove that there was a price 

decrease; you have to prove that there was an initial 

material misstatement, that it distorted the stock 

price, that it led to a price decrease and that the 

price decrease can't be, can't be shown by any other 

superseding cause.  It's essentially, as the Seventh 

16 

Circuit said -­

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can you -- can you do this 

in reverse?  I mean, suppose the class comes in and, 

instead of proving at the outset that the market's an 

efficient market and allege a misrepresentation, they 

come in at the back end and they say:  When that 

statement that we assert was a misrepresentation was 

corrected, the price of stock went down and we lost 

money.

 Now, it seems to me you would have to argue, 

21

well, that's a good allegation if it's an efficient 

market, which is a common question, right? 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Right. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So they can certify under 

Rule 23 by using the back end.  Instead of proving the 

efficient market, they can prove that there was a 

statement correcting the alleged misrepresentation, the 

price of stock went down, right, and they can certify 

the class?

 MS. SAHARSKY:  No.  The Court said -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why not?  It would be -- it 

would be a common question whether the market's 

efficient or not. 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  This Court said in Basic that 

in order to establish the presumption that you need to 

show the efficiency of the market, the trading during 

the relevant time period.  I agree with you that -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They're not relying on that 

19 

assumption.  They -- they come in and show that there 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

was a correction of what we alleged was a misstatement 

and the market went down.  That's all that they allege. 

And of course, that proves anything only if there's an 

efficient market.  But that will be a common question to 

the whole class, so we'll, we'll -- we'll save that for 

later.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Well, with respect, just 

alleging that the market went down would not be enough 

to show that there was an initial price distortion 

because of the company's material misstatement.  Stock 

prices can go down for any number of reasons.  There's a 

significant linkage that's required between the initial 

material misstatement and the eventual loss. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but they assert that. 

9 

They assert that the reason it went down was because of 

10

11

12 

13 

14

15

the initial misstatement. 

 MS. SAHARSKY:  Certainly in the courts of 

appeals now, that's not the way the plaintiffs proceed. 

The way they proceed is on the Basic theory. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand that.  I'm 

just saying that seems to me it's a crazy way to run a 

16 

railroad. 

17

18

 MS. SAHARSKY:  I don't think that that's -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you can allege what's 

19 

upfront, you can allege what's -- what's in the back, 

20

and what's upfront becomes a common question, so you 

21 

certify the whole class.

 MS. SAHARSKY:  With respect, Your Honor, I 

mean, if you -- if you would like to -- if you would 

like to expand even beyond Basic and allow class 

certification.  But the courts of appeals have used

Basic for 20 years, Congress is well aware of it and has 

not seen fit to change it.  This is the way that these 

cases proceed. 

 This Court at the time of Basic recognized 

that every court of appeals had thought that it made 

sense to proceed in that way, using the fraud on the 

market theory.  This is well established.  And just to 

be clear, Respondents never suggested in this case that 

Basic should be revisited.  This is not an issue that 

the courts below considered.  This is not an issue that 

was fully briefed, and it's not something that we think 

should be considered. 

 The problem in this case is that the Fifth 

14 

Circuit took it upon itself to tighten the Rule 23

requirements.  It was not satisfied with the rules as 

they exist, and it took the class certification stage 

and turned it into a merits inquiry stage.  They 

required plaintiffs to prove almost their entire case at 

this stage of the litigation, and that just wasn't 

right, because the class certification stage -- can I 

finish this -- is about whether plaintiffs can proceed 

as a group together, as the Court in Amchem said they 

often can in securities fraud actions.  The judgment 

should be reversed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Sterling. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID STERLING 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

 MR. STERLING:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

 Basic recognized that, absent the class-wide 

presumption of fraud on the market reliance, individual 

issues of reliance predominate, as they do in any other 

fraud context.  Consequently, when a district court, 

after the rigorous analysis required by Rule 23, finds 

that the presumption is unavailable or rebutted, 

reliance ceases to be a class-wide issue. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I -- when -- what

 MR. STERLING:  We argued it below based upon 

the premise in Basic that the presumption is rebutted 

when there is proof -­

 MR. STERLING:  -- that the market price did 

22 

not distort -­

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you give me a 

24 

place in the record where you actually said that, as 

25

opposed to relying on Oscar to argue that the Fifth 

25
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

Circuit was right in addressing as a merits question 

whether the plaintiff had proven loss causation? 

 MR. STERLING:  It was not addressed as a 

4 

merits question, Justice Sotomayor.  It was addressed, 

5

as Oscar said, as a prerequisite for finding reliance in 

6 

order to certify the class.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you're not defending 

the rationale of the Fifth Circuit now?  You're -­

you're sort of backing yourself into the reliance 

element? 

 MR. STERLING:  We are not defending all of 

the language in Oscar, clearly, but the basic test in 

the Fifth Circuit, as our case made clear on pages 116a 

and 119a of the petition appendix, is not loss 

causation; it's price impact, because Basic says at page 

248 any showing that severs the link between the 

misrepresentation and the stock price defeats the 

presumption.  Basic makes clear on that same page that a 

showing that the stock price was not distorted by the 

misrepresentation defeats the presumption. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Sterling, if I 

think -- if I disagree with you and I think that Oscar 

said that loss causation needs to be shown at the 

certification stage, you agree that that is not a 

correct statement of the law; is that correct?

17 

18

 MR. STERLING:  We do agree with that, 

Justice Kagan.  But our opinion made clear that it's not 

loss causation as this Court knows it in Dura; the test 

is simply price impact.  And the Fifth Circuit 

recognized -- and the Fund recognized this below on page 

551a of the Joint Appendix -- their only burden under 

the Fifth Circuit caselaw was to show price impact, and 

they could show it either of two ways.  Their papers 

show this, page 116 and 119a of the joint appendix.

 They can show price inflation upon a 

misrepresentation, which, as this Court made clear in 

Dura, is not synonymous with loss causation.  Or failing 

that -- and they could not show that here because their 

own proof showed that none of the alleged 

misrepresentations moved the market.  So, the 

alternative way to show price impact is simply to show a 

price decline following a corrective disclosure. 

 And while that showing is similar to loss 

19 

causation, it's an easier, less rigorous showing of loss 

20

21 

22 

23 

24

25

causation, because under the price impact test at the 

Fifth Circuit, all the plaintiff need show is that it's 

reasonable to infer that some portion of the decline was 

attributable to the revelation of the truth. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Sterling, I wasn't sure 

what argument you were making in your brief.  One

24 

25

possible argument you could be making is that the 

plaintiffs have to show a price impact.  Another 

possible argument you could be making is that you have 

to have the opportunity to rebut the plaintiff's use of 

the Basic presumption by yourself showing that there was 

no price impact.  And you seemed often to be saying the 

first, even though I would think that the second is the 

most you can make as a -- as a plausible argument. 

 MR. STERLING:  If we suggested the first, 

Justice Kagan, I apologize because we did not intend to. 

Basic puts the initial burden on the defendant to show 

the absence of price impact, showing that the presumed 

fact does not exist. 

 Once that threshold showing is made, the 

burden remains on the plaintiff under Rule 301 and Rule 

23 to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the 

market price was in fact, distorted. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but why do you -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The way the Fifth Circuit 

wrote the decision, the Fifth Circuit seems to be 

saying:  Plaintiffs, you didn't show an initially false 

representation; and you, you plaintiff, didn't show a -­

a corrective statement that caused a price drop.  As I 

read the Fifth Circuit's decision, it says:  Plaintiff, 

you failed to prove one of the two things that you would

have to prove.

12 

13

 And you say:  No, they really put the burden 

on -- on defendants, Fifth Circuit put the burden on 

defendant and found that defendant had met it instead of 

the other way around? 

 MR. STERLING:  We agree, Your Honor, that 

the Fifth Circuit put the initial burden of production 

on the plaintiff and that's contrary to Basic.  We -- we 

agree with that.  However, in terms of the Fifth 

Circuit's language that I believe Your Honor's referring 

to, that is when the Fifth Circuit was discussing the 

alleged corrective disclosures. 

 Because the plaintiff could not show that 

14 

any of the alleged misrepresentations moved the market, 

15

16 

17 

18

they had to rely upon what they claimed were corrective 

disclosures.  That was the only way they could show 

price impact. 

 The Fifth Circuit, at various times, looked 

19 

at each of the alleged corrective disclosures and said 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

that's not a corrective disclosure because it doesn't 

reveal the truth in any way; it's bad news, but it's 

non-culpable bad news.  It doesn't in any way suggest 

that Halliburton said something during the class period 

that was false.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Can I -- I'm trying this 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

question out.  Try to give me your best answer.  If I 

don't have it clear enough, just forgive it and go on to 

another.  As I'm understanding this case with Basic, the 

idea is there is a presumption.  Somebody lies and says 

there's an oil well I found oil in.  A lot of people buy 

on the stock market.  It turns out there was no oil, and 

a lot of people say they lost money.  All right. 

 The point of the stock market presumption is 

9 

to say:  Smith, you're a typical plaintiff and this 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

presumption is going to help you by the following. 

We're going to say what happened to the typical person 

on the stock market during that period happened to you, 

and there are a lot of people who bought and sold on the 

stork market.  And that's why efficient markets is 

needed to show at the certification stage, because if 

there weren't certification -- if that isn't shown, the 

whole thing falls apart. 

 But what you're just saying on terms of 

19 

whether the revelation lowered the price has nothing to 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

do with the question of what happened to the typical 

person, Smith, happened to you, nothing to do with it. 

It has to do with whether anybody was hurt.  Now, that 

has nothing to do with the certification stage.  That's 

the win or lose stage.

 Now, that's how I'm understanding it at the 

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

moment.  So what's wrong with the way I understand it?

 MR. STERLING:  Justice Breyer, the -- the 

problem is, we're back to reliance.  Basic exists -­

Basic creates a presumption as an exception to the long 

understood rule that fraud cases were not appropriate 

vehicles for class actions because each individual would 

have to say, Mr. Smith in your hypothetical, I read 

Halliburton's statement and I relied upon it. 

 Basic said, because that's so impractical 

cases would never be certified, we're going to say we're 

going to assume the entire market is like Mr. Smith, and 

Mr. Smith relies on the integrity of the stock price 

when the stock price is distorted by the 

misrepresentation.  But if the stock price was not in 

fact distorted by the misrepresentation, it makes no 

sense to say everybody relied on the misrepresentation 

through its effect on the stock price. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which means you would lose. 

19 

I -- I mean, which means that the plaintiff would lose. 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

But it doesn't mean that there is not a common issue, 

that the -- that the latter question, whether in fact 

the market was affected or not is, is not a common 

question.  Rule 23 only requires that -- that there be a 

common question.

 MR. STERLING:  But Justice Scalia, Basic

7

10

12 

13 

14 

15

sets forth a special rule.  Basic is an exception to the 

long-understood rule about the nonsusceptibility in 

class actions to class treatment of fraud cases.  Basic 

says it's not just enough to allege the operative facts, 

and we will presume reliance.  Basic says you have to 

plead and prove them, and all of those operative facts 

are subject to common proof.  The efficient market:  the 

efficient market applies to everybody, it's common 

proof.  Everybody recognizes, everybody agrees, Mr. 

Boies said so today, and the government said so today: 

if the market -- if the district court does not find 

that the market -- that the market for the stock is 

efficient at the class certification stage, you can't 

certify, because it's not reasonable to infer then that 

the misrepresentation was translated into the stock 

16 

price. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 Materiality is another requirement under 

Basic.  It's a threshold condition.  Again, common 

proof.  All the courts except for the Seventh Circuit 

agree materiality must be proven at the class 

certification level.  Same thing for whether the 

misrepresentation was public.  If it was not publicly 

made, it's not reasonable to infer that it had an impact 

on the stock price.

 All of these operative facts are subject to

common proof.  But Basic says unless those facts are 

proven at the class certification stage, the presumption 

of class-wide reliance doesn't apply and individual 

issues of reliance predominate.

 The same must be true for rebuttal proof. 

Basic says eight times that the presumption is 

rebuttable, and it makes no sense at all to rely upon 

these indirect or surrogate, circumstantial proof of 

whether the misrepresentation moved the market.  That's 

all these are -- materiality, whether it was publicly 

made, whether the market was efficient.  These are all 

just surrogates of whether it is reasonable to believe 

or to infer that the stock price was in fact distorted 

by the misrepresentation.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, could you explain 

to me why in this case it's not reasonable to believe, 

meaning assuming the truth, that there was falsity in 

the statements made, those alleged -­

 MR. STERLING:  Because -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Assuming truth to those 

statements, why wouldn't a market react to corrective 

measures?  Because what I see is a difference between 

saying it's an inefficient market or that the statements 

had no price impact for some other merits-related 

reason.  But why does that tie to an inefficient market

 MR. STERLING:  Well, again, general market 

efficiency is just a proxy or a surrogate for whether 

it's reasonable to think the conditions exist for the 

stock price to be affected by a misrepresentation. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So tell me why on its 

face, with the false statements alleged here, why would 

it be unreasonable to conclude that the market wouldn't 

respond to them?

 MR. STERLING:  One reason is because the 

market deemed the information to be immaterial, the 

market didn't care about it, the market didn't react to 

it.  Another reason could be that, while a market is 

generally efficient, a market was inefficient for this 

type of information.  I -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but you conceded 

efficiency below, so you've sort of given up that 

argument. 

 MR. STERLING:  We conceded efficiency below 

because, candidly, their own proof showed that none of 

the misrepresentations moved the market.  And what we 

have here is not circumstantial proof of general market 

efficiency or materiality or whether the statement was 

public; here there was direct proof that none of these 

misrepresentations moved the market, and that is the 

34

whole premise of the Basic class-wide presumption of 

reliance. 

 Basic itself says if the stock price was not

distorted by the misrepresentation, you can't say the

entire class relied upon the misrepresentation to the 

stock price.  And that's exactly what we have here.  It 

is the DNA proof, and it makes no sense for district 

courts to be certifying class actions based upon this 

indirect or circumstantial proof while ignoring the 

direct proof of the absence of price impact. 

 And in effect what they're asking this Court 

to do is to extend Basic.  Basic itself is a judicially 

created presumption designed to make a judicially 

created cause of action easier to be maintained as a 

class action. 

 Now, it was one thing for courts decades ago 

to imply a private cause of action under 10(b) and it 

was another thing for this Court to create a rebuttable 

presumption of reliance in Basic in order to make it 

easier to maintain these cases as class actions.  But it 

would do violence to Stoneridge's admonition that the 

10b cause of action ought not be further expanded to 

make that rebuttable presumption of reliance 

irrebuttable at the class certification stage.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But your -- your argument

seems to say, to -- to get a class certified you have to 

virtually prove your case on the merits.  You -- you 

leave almost nothing over.  I mean, if you've won the 

class action certification on your basis and you've 

shown the material misleading and the price dropped as a 

consequence, the efficient market first -- you've shown 

all that, what else is left on the merits?  You win on 

the merits if you win certification. 

 MR. STERLING:  Justice Ginsburg, that -­

that is not our position.  Our position is in order to 

get the class-wide presumption of reliance, it's the 

plaintiff's burden to plead and prove upfront as 

threshold facts, a public misrepresentation that was 

material made in an efficient market.  However, the 

defendant has the right at the class certification stage 

to rebut that presumption by any showing, to quote 

Basic, "that severs the length between the 

misrepresentation and the stock price."  When that 

threshold showing is made, the burden is back on the 

plaintiff to demonstrate the necessary linkage. 

 It's not a finding on the merits.  A 

determination at the class certification stage is simply 

one of whether the Rule 23(b) predominance requirement 

is met and whether the class can appropriately proceed 

as a class, as opposed to in the traditional individual 

36
 

Alderson Reporting Company

3

fashion, and that finding is not binding on the ultimate 

finder of fact. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Sterling, maybe this is 

4 

just to repeat Justice Ginsburg's question, but what 

5

6 

7 

8

else is there?  I mean, what would not be proper to 

introduce in the way that you're talking about at the 

certification stage? 

 MR. STERLING:  Falsity, scienter, actual 

9 

proof of loss causation, and damages.

10

11 

12 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  The Fifth Circuit suggested 

that scienter could come in at the -- at the 

certification stage.  You're disclaiming that? 

 MR. STERLING:  Footnote 35 of the Fifth 

14 

Circuit opinion makes clear that it is not requiring 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

scienter.  The Fifth Circuit says, in response -- in 

analyzing what is or is not a corrective disclosure, it 

says it has to do something that suggests that a 

statement was made that is potentially actionable was 

false.  Otherwise it's not a revelation of the truth. 

And all that is, again, is a second way under the Fifth 

Circuit's test of showing whether there is the necessary 

price impact to justify certifying a class, or 

alternatively to determine that individual issues of 

reliance predominate.

 And allowing the defendants to rebut the 

37

2

presumption of reliance at the class certification stage 

is consistent with this Court's class action case law 

and with Rule 23.  This Court has consistently said that 

the Rule 23 requirements are not to be presumed, they're 

not to be assumed, they have to be found.  Actual 

6 

conformance is the test. 

7

8 

9 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The only requirement 

we're talking about is (b)(3) because it's -- it's not 

argued and the district court found that all of the 

10

23(a) requirements were satisfied.  That's not the 

11

 MR. STERLING:  Correct Your Honor.  But 

23(b)(3) requires a court to make a finding that 

predominance exists.  And the 2003 amendments to the -­

to Rule 23 make clear that a court should not certify a 

class unless and until it is satisfied that all of the 

Rule 23 requirements are met; and it makes no sense to 

say that a court is going to conduct this rigorous 

analysis and make the Rule 23(b)(3) findings without 

considering the defendant's rebuttal proof of whether, 

in fact, there was price impact, because Basic itself 

says if there is no price impact, the presumption falls 

away, individual issues of reliance predominate, and the 

class cannot be certified.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  On your rebuttal proof

point, you said just now that all you had to do was come 

forward with some evidence, but that the burden remains 

on the plaintiff.  Is that -- what kind of evidence do 

you think you have to come forward with in order to flip 

the burden back to the plaintiff? 

 MR. STERLING:  Well, under Basic, it's any 

showing that severs the link, and here it was proof -­

we had our own expert that demonstrated that, again kind 

of harping on their expert -- none of the 

misrepresentations inflated the stock price -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you're saying you can put 

an expert on the stand and the expert will say there was 

no price impact, and then the plaintiffs have to make 

the case that there, in fact, was a -- a price impact at 

the certification stage, that the plaintiffs have to 

16 

prove that by a preponderance? 

17

18

 MR. STERLING:  Correct, Your Honor.

19

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. STERLING:  Under Rule 301, the 

presumption does not shift the ultimate burden of proof. 

It stays on the party that -- that bears it.  That is 

consistent with Rule 23 as well, which puts the burden 

on the plaintiff, to prove all of the Rule 23 elements 

exist.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that does suggest that 

the Basic presumption isn't worth much in your world. 

That you put an expert on the stand, and the Basic 

presumption falls away, and the plaintiffs have to 

actually prove their case at that very early stage that 

6 

there was no price impact.

 MR. STERLING:  We agree, Your Honor, that 

they have to show price impact, but that's not a hard 

burden to show.  If any of their 22 -- they allege that 

we made misrepresentations that were false on 22 days 

during the class period.  All they had to do was show 

one day during that class period statistically 

significant price movement, and they're in.  Or all they 

had to show was any of the alleged -- I've forgotten how 

many -- corrective disclosures during the class period. 

Any one day, if there was a -- a meaningful price 

movement that a court could infer was related to the 

revelation of truth, that's all they need to show.  But 

they couldn't show that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I suppose 

if you prevail and a defendant tries to establish at the 

certification stage that there's no loss causation and 

loses, then that's law of the case and you've missed the 

three opportunities that Mr. Boies was willing to give 

you at the pleading stage, summary judgment, and the 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

2 

3

merits.  That issue is out of the case if you lose, 

right? 

 MR. STERLING:  No, Your Honor, because the 

4 

finding at the class certification stage is not binding 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

upon the ultimate fact finder.  So if the -- if the 

Court determines by a preponderance of the evidence that 

reliance is not there, if the Court -- if the case goes 

to trial and an individual plaintiff brings his or her 

own case based upon subjective reliance, that the 

10

Court's determination that the class certification stage 

11 

is not binding on the jury. 

12

13 

14 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if there's 

no -- no new evidence?  One of the objections to your 

theory is you don't have discovery at the certification 

stage.  What if you have no new evidence to put on at 

16 

later stages? 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. STERLING:  It's possible that the jury 

would agree with the judge who made the determination at 

the class certification hearing, it's possible that the 

judge -- that the jury might not.  But the discovery 

issue, Your Honor, is a complete red herring, because 

Rule 23 makes clear that the district court has ample 

discretion at the class certification stage to allow 

discovery into the merits to the extent that they are 

relevant to the class certification issue.

 And more importantly here, the Fund never 

asked for discovery.  In fact, when the Fund filed its 

motion for class certification on page 139A of the joint 

appendix, the Fund said no discovery is needed to 

resolve this motion except for expert discovery.  The 

Fund never asked for discovery at the district court 

level, the Fund never asked for discovery at the Fifth 

Circuit.  The only time they've ever hinted that they 

wanted discovery related to the class certification 

issue was at this Court. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought that the whole 

reason you -- you say that the class certification stage 

is so significant is precisely because once the class is 

certified, there will be immense discovery on the merits 

of the case, which will be so expensive for defendants 

that they're inclined to throw in the towel.  Now you're 

telling us that you -- you want to move discovery up to 

the class certification stage? 

 MR. STERLING:  Justice Scalia, that was not 

my point, and I apologize if -- if it came out that way. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I -- I'm sure it 

22 

wasn't your point, but -­

 (Laughter.)

know, Your Honor, to the district court, we think we -­

we can't -- we should not have the class certification 

hearing yet because we need some discovery on point A, 

B, C, which did not happen here, the district court can 

say fine or can say I don't think you need it.  But the 

premise of your question is certainly correct.  The 

grant of class certification is a seminal event in a 

10b-5 case.  It has huge repercussions for the 

defendant.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, no.  You -­

on page 13 of your brief you say one of the objections 

to it -- to your opponents or your friends' view is that 

it would just postpone the defendant's ability to rebut 

the presumption, result in countless classes being 

certified with the certain knowledge that they would 

have to be decertified later.  Well, if it's so certain, 

then there's no in terrorem effect. 

 MR. STERLING:  Just when -- that's assuming 

19 

that the defendant has the wherewithal to stick it out 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

through it all, but the sheer grant of class 

certification which aggregates hundreds, tens, 

thousands -- tens of thousands of these claims together 

in one big case makes every one of these cases, in 

effect, a company case, and it puts huge settlement 

pressure on the defendant.

 I mean, in -- in this case Halliburton had 

440 million shares of stock outstanding during the class 

period.  The class period lasts 2 1/2 years.  It's easy 

to do the math and say that had this class been 

certified, there would have been huge pressure upon

Halliburton to settle.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Does your rule apply in all 

fraud cases?  That is, a thousand farmers say, 

Mr. Jackson was our common buying agent, and the 

defendant lied to Mr. Jackson, and he relied on the lie. 

It is a common issue whether he relied on the lie or he 

didn't rely on the lie.  I can understand somebody 

saying at the certification stage they have to see 

whether he's really a common agent.  But let's imagine 

that's assumed.  The only question left is, did he rely 

16 

or not rely? 

17

 Is that a question for the merits or is that 

18 

a question for the common -- for the -­

didn't rely, the common agent is for the merits?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that -- is that your

 MR. STERLING:  No, Your Honor.  You couldn't

individual issue.

11

15

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  A thousand people say 

Mr. Jackson is our common buying agent, and the 

defendant lied to this common buying agent, and he 

represented us.  Relied on that.  I'm asking if you that 

issue of reliance in an appropriate case is for the 

certification stage? 

 MR. STERLING:  Yes, Your Honor, because -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

 MR. STERLING:  -- you still have everybody 

16 

having to say Mr. Jackson is my agent.  That's -­

17

18 

there is a lie?

25

 MR. STERLING:  Right.  And that's a -- but 

the individualized question of reliance is simply, is 

Mr. Jackson your agent or not?  Because of that there is 

no common issue that -- that predominates on reliance. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

 MR. STERLING:  If there are no further 

questions, we would ask that the judgment below be

 Let me respond to Mr. Sterling's statement 

that all we had to do was show one statistically 

significant price movement.  As the Court is aware from 

the briefing, on December 7th of 2001, the Halliburton 

put out a release that indicated that their prior 

statements that their asbestos reserves were -- were 

adequate were not -- were not true.  The stock dropped 

42 percent, more than 42 percent.  The actual drop was 

42.4. 

 Expert witnesses calculated that the 

19 

company's specific drop was slightly larger than that 

20

because the market was generally going up that day.  But 

21 

it was a dramatic drop. 

22

23 

24 

25

 Their own expert, as is indicated in the 

briefing, agreed that there wasn't anything else 

happening that day other than asbestos news, and so -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you win, so you 

46
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

win at the certification stage or at the pleading stage, 

whatever.  So why is it such I big deal to you here? 

 MR. BOIES:  Because under the -- the Fifth 

4 

Circuit rule, I understand that counsel disavows the 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13

actual language of the Fifth Circuit rule, but it was 

that language that the district court relied on in 

failing to certify the class.  And with -- with -- with 

respect to the Fifth Circuit test, what the Fifth 

Circuit says is that because the announcement on 

December 7th did not specifically reference the prior 

announcements, it cannot be considered a correction of 

those prior announcements. 

 Indeed, the court, the Fifth Circuit goes 

14 

even further, and this is at page 338 of the F. Supp. 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

21 

22 

23

opinion.  It says, quote:  The district court must 

decide whether the corrective disclosure more probably 

than not shows that the original estimates or 

predictions were designed to defraud. 

 So what the Fifth Circuit is doing is it's 

bringing, even the defrauding aspect, not just the 

falsity aspect, but the defrauding aspect right into the 

class certification stage. 

 And I think Justice Scalia's question was 

24 

exactly on point with respect to discovery, because 

25

either they're going to make these merits decisions

without discovery or you're going to have all of the 

discovery before you have the class certification.  It's 

got to be one or the other.  And in either case what is 

happening is you're converting what Rule 23 says is an 

issue as to whether common issues predominate into an 

issue as to what is the strength of the merits claim 

that the plaintiff has, and while it is true, reliance 

is part of the merits claim. 

 The reason reliance is different is because 

reliance, if it -- if there is no reliance, if there's 

no efficient market, then reliance can make individual 

issues predominate, but when the only issue is not a 

step issue like efficient market, but is a direct merits 

issue, there isn't any way that you can make individual 

issues predominate regardless of how you decide it; and 

loss causation and price distortion are both those kind 

of common issues; and counsel says he doesn't defend 

the -- the actual loss causation statements of the -- of 

the -- of the Fifth Circuit, and what I would ask is 

whether the Court, if the Court does decide to send it 

back, that the Court look at what the right standard is 

for the court below to be applying when it deals with 

class certification. 

 And I would urge the Court that when you 

have pleadings, summary judgment, and trial tests for 

48

7 

8

merits questions, then you don't need another merits 

test on -- at the class certification stage, even if 

Rule 23 permitted it, which we don't think it does. 

What Rule 23 is designed to do is simply say are 

individual issues or common issues going to predominate? 

And all of the class have the same loss causation, have 

the same price distortion issues. 

 If the Court has no more questions, that 

9 

completes my argument.
