Assistance Corporation v. Pamela Hood. 

 Mr. Brand. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL J. BRAND 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. BRAND:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

 This Court's  decisions recognize  that even  in 

subject areas where Article I grants Congress complete and 

exclusive  authority to make laws, unconsenting States are 

still immune from suits by private parties. 

 QUESTION:  Well,  let's talk a little  bit about 

the notion  that's raised  in one  or more  of the  amicus 

briefs, that  a bankruptcy proceeding is akin to an in rem 

proceeding or  is an in rem  proceeding, such as  might be 

the  case in an  admiralty suit  where we would  think the 

State  would be  bound. 

Now,  would  you  address  that 

argument, which I found possibly persuasive? 

 MR. BRAND: 

Certainly,  Your Honor. 

We  would 

submit that there -- there is no authority from this Court 

supporting the view that there is an in rem exception from 

sovereign  immunity  in  the  bankruptcy  context.

argument  instead  is  made  by  analogy,  as  Your  Honor 

referred,  to the 

--  

the  admiralty  case  of  Deep  Sea 

Research, but the Deep Sea Research case is limited to the 

admiralty context.  It's limited to the special aspects of 

admiralty law that  had developed over hundreds  of years, 

certainly 200 years of -- of our Nation's experience. 

 QUESTION: 

Well,  why doesn't  it  fit  in the 

bankruptcy  context  too  where the  debtor's  assets  are 

assembled  in  kind  of  an  in  rem  proceeding  and  the 

creditors  share in it? 

It  could have  very unfortunate 

consequences certainly if -- if your position were upheld. 

 MR.  BRAND: 

Well,  Your Honor,  although there 

certainly are in rem aspects to bankruptcy jurisdiction in 

the context  of dealing  with the  property of  the estate 

that is before the court and that is in the custody of the 

court,  bankruptcy  jurisdiction  also embraces  other 

--

other aspects of  in personam  jurisdiction involving  the 

parties and -- and personal relationships. 

 QUESTION:  Well, could we just stick with the in 

rem for a moment?  Suppose there's a $100,000 on the usual 

free-for-all because there  are more --

the -- the  debts 

exceed that  amount.  The State  gets notice. 

It decides 

it's  not  going  to  appear. 

The  bankrupt  is 

--  

is 

discharged. 

At the very least,  if the State  then later 

sues on the debt, is the -- can the discharge be set up as

a defense? 

 MR. BRAND: 

Well, Your Honor, there -- there is 

authority from  -- from the lower  courts that --

that it 

could in fact,  and that in --

in that situation,  the -­

the State might be bound by a general discharge order. 

 QUESTION:  Well, what --

what happened here was 

something  where --

where  a summons  was  issued to  the 

State, wasn't it?  It was -- the  State didn't just remain 

outside and do nothing. 

 MR.  BRAND: 

Well,  that's --

that's  exactly 

right, Your Honor, and it also is a situation in which the 

State was not making a  claim against the -- the  property 

of the bankrupt estate. 

 QUESTION:  Yes.  It's hard to think of a debt as 

15 

part of a res.  I -- I can't quite -­

 MR. BRAND:  And that -­

 QUESTION:  -- get that. 

 And I understand, but just on the basic point of 

whether or not just for  a discharge of a debt, the  State 

can be bound, you say you think it might be plausible, but 

the State would be bound by  the judgment if it later sues 

on the debt. 

 MR. BRAND:  I don't  want to concede that point, 

Your  Honor. 

I think there  is authority  certainly that 

would -- that could support  that, and there are decisions

from  the  -- from  the  circuit courts,  particularly the 

Fourth, the Fifth, and the  Ninth, which have held that  a 

discharge order under those circumstances would be binding 

against the  State. 

But each  of those  courts has  also 

upheld  sovereign immunity as  a bar  to a suit  against a 

State as the State asserts in this case. 

 QUESTION:  But this is not a normal suit against 

the State. 

This is  a suit  in which  the debtor  seeks 

authority to get a discharge, isn't it? 

10

 MR.  BRAND: 

That's  right, Your  Honor, except

 QUESTION: 

So  the  proceeding  itself  is  to 

determine  whether or not she's entitled to a discharge on 

the debt at issue. 

 MR. BRAND: 

Yes. 

She  is --

she has  already 

received a bankruptcy discharge,  a blanket discharge from 

debt. 

This  is  a  proceeding  to  determine 

if  this 

particular debt  qualifies under  that. 

And the way  the 

statute is  written, the way --

the way Congress  has set 

this 

up 

is 

that 

the 

debt 

is 

presumptively 

nondischargeable.  It is an exception from discharge until 

such point as  the debtor  establishes undue hardship,  at 

which point  the debt would be  absolved and she  would -­

she would, in effect, have a discharge.  But again, the -­

by -- by the nature of the way the -­

 QUESTION: 

If she  -- if  she prevails  in that 

disputed  factual matter,  then it  will be just  like any 

other discharge case.  If  -- if the hearing goes  forward 

and she  prevails as  a matter of  fact, then it  would be 

just like any other discharge case, wouldn't it? 

 MR. BRAND: 

No,  it  wouldn't, Your  Honor. 

A 

normal discharge case would essentially not involve at all 

the adjudication of individual debts.  The discharge is -­

 QUESTION:  No. 

I'm saying  if she prevails  on 

the disputed issues of fact,  thereafter it would be  just 

like a normal discharge case. 

 MR.  BRAND: 

It 

--  

it 

--  

yes,  if 

I'm 

understanding,  Your  Honor. 

Yes,  she would  have,  in 

effect, a discharge from that debt.  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  Moreover,  the -- the fact  that this 

proceeding had to be brought  against the State was purely 

a  result  of congressional  disposition. 

Congress could 

have  treated  these debts  to  the State  like  all other 

debts, in which  case they  would have been  automatically 

discharged. 

 MR. BRAND:  That's exactly right, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION: 

So --

so that the  -- the  argument 

that the bankruptcy -- the in rem nature of the bankruptcy 

procedure gives  -- gives her all the  protection that the 

Constitution  at least requires,  vis-a-vis the  State, it

seems  to me is  a strong one. 

It's only  because of the 

statute that  -- that this action  had to be brought. 

If 

Congress really wants to  discharge her from debts  to the 

State, it  could have done so by simply treating the State 

like all other debtors. 

 MR. BRAND: 

I think that's exactly  right, Your 

Honor.  The debt could be treated as a discharged debt, in 

which  case the  State  would certainly  be  bound by  the 

operation of that law, but that is not -­

 QUESTION:  Isn't it -- isn't it odd that you are 

objecting to this proceeding where, if Congress then said, 

okay, we'll make it dischargeable, you  will be worse off? 

In  other  words,  Congress is  trying  to  ameliorate the 

ordinary effect of the bankruptcy law to give the State an 

advantage. 

And  your  argument  is  to  the  effect of, 

Congress, you can treat us  just like all the others,  and 

we'll be worse off than we  are now, but once you give  us 

this 

favor, 

then  you 

--  

the 

--  

the 

law 

is 

unconstitutional. 

You can't give us a favor.  That seems 

to be the essence of your argument. 

 MR. BRAND:  No, Your Honor.  I -- I would submit 

our argument  -- our  argument is  not that  the State  is 

immune from  the effect  of the  statute that  would allow 

discharge  upon  showing  of  undue  hardship. 

We  would 

recognize that that is --

that is an appropriate part  of

the -- of the exercise of Congress' bankruptcy power. 

 Our issue is with the provisions which are there 

by virtue of the nature of the way that --

that exception 

is written and also by virtue of the bankruptcy rules that 

require that  it be  raised in  the form  of an  adversary 

proceeding  in  which  the State  could  be  summoned into 

court, in bankruptcy court, anywhere in the country. 

 MR.  BRAND: 

Well,  could  it  be  adjudicated 

without an adversary proceeding, just say the debtor comes 

in and says, I'm giving notice to the State?  If they want 

to  come in,  they can, but  it's not  -- it's --

I'm not 

going to  call it or the statute doesn't call it a summons 

and  complaint, doesn't  call it an  adversary proceeding, 

just  a  proceeding  to  establish 

the  status  of  this 

obligation. 

 MR.  BRAND: 

Your Honor,  I  think  as Justice 

Scalia  suggested,  Congress could  write  a  statute that 

would  make a student loan  dischargeable, more or less by 

operation of  law, but we would  submit that the  way this 

statute is written -- and again, if we look -­

 QUESTION: 

I'm  not  asking  about  making  it 

totally dischargeable, but Congress  wants to achieve this 

result and sensitive to your  concern.  So it says,  fine, 

we're going to make it nondischargeable unless the student 

shows undue hardship,  but because the State  doesn't want

to receive a summons and  complaint, we're going to do  it 

in a nonadversary proceeding. 

The student will establish 

it to the satisfaction of the bankruptcy court or not, and 

the State  will  be given  notice but  not  a summons  and 

complaint.  Would that be satisfactory? 

 MR.  BRAND: 

Your Honor,  I  don't  believe it 

would. 

I 

think  that  in  substance 

that  would  be 

essentially the same  as the  adversary complaint that 

--

that  we're talking about here.  And -- and under -- under 

Coeur d'Alene and -- and  the discussion in other  similar 

cases, the  question here can't  turn on the  mechanics of 

the pleading or on the -- the style of the caption. 

 QUESTION:  So  you -- you would have  no problem 

with Congress' amending  this statute so that  it reads if 

the State  chooses to  waive its  sovereign immunity,  the 

debtor  has to proceed  in this  manner.  However,  if the 

State refuses to waive its sovereign immunity by appearing 

in 

the  proceeding,  the 

debt  will  be  automatically 

discharged.  You -- you would have no problem with that, I 

take it. 

 MR. BRAND:  I'm not -- I'm not certain that that 

would not be the same type of statute that I -- I objected 

to a moment ago. 

 QUESTION:  No. 

I thought  you accepted that  a 

25 

moment ago. 

I  thought you  accepted a  moment ago  that

Congress didn't have to provide  this special treatment of 

the States at all.  If  Congress didn't have to provide it 

at all, certainly Congress could say  if the State chooses 

not to -- not to take it, not to appear in the proceeding, 

we'll dispense with it.  I  -- it seems to me the  greater 

includes the lesser. 

 MR. BRAND:  Well, I -- I agreed, Your Honor, and 

I still  agree  that 

--  

that Congress  could  fashion  a 

statute that would make student loans dischargeable in the 

same  manner as -- as  any other debt.  And  in -- in that 

case, it  -- it would  take place  the same  as any  other 

debt.  And of course, if -- if the State were to waive its 

sovereign  immunity and enter into a bankruptcy proceeding 

and -- and voluntarily participate,  then -- then it could 

do so and -- and  the court could act accordingly  without 

any special enabling legislation by Congress. 

 QUESTION: 

I --

I  don't understand  what the 

statute has --

how the  statute is involved  in this. 

I 

mean, the statute just sets  a standard for discharging  a 

-- a student  who has an educational loan.  It says it has 

to be  undue hardship.  What's  wrong with that? 

I mean, 

why  can't -- there  are dozens  of statutes --

dozens of 

statutes that say -- I guess dozens.  I'm not a bankruptcy 

expert, but  statutes  that say  you get  this  kind of  a 

discharge  if there hasn't  been a  fraudulent conveyance,

but if there has been, you don't get it, and if it's this,

All 

these may involve debts  owed to or -- the State. 

Are -­

are you saying  -- what has the  statute to do  with this? 

The statute just sets a standard for getting a discharge. 

 MR.  BRAND: 

Well, Your Honor,  I --

I believe 

that this  statute -- this particular subsection affecting 

student  loan  discharge  is 

really  unique  within  the 

exceptions to discharge. 

 QUESTION:  All right.  Let's assume it's unique. 

 MR. BRAND:  There -­

Eleventh Amendment that says Congress cannot set a special

that Congress has the power to set a separate standard for 

this type of debt -­

different position? 

 MR. BRAND:  Well, the -- the question is not the 

effectiveness of the congressional determination regarding 

how to handle that debt,  but rather the constitutionality 

of the means by which Congress --

 QUESTION:  Now, then what you're quarreling with 

is, of  course, not the statute. 

You are  quarreling, as 

Justice Ginsburg pointed out, with  a bankruptcy rule that 

happen to use  the word adversary proceeding.  But suppose 

the rulemakers had simply said,  this need not be done  in 

an adversary  proceeding.  It can  be done in  exactly the 

same kind of proceeding  as discharging any other  kind of 

debt. 

I, 

the  bankruptcy 

judge,  will  follow 

the 

congressional mandate  as to when  it is discharged. 

You 

will  notify  all  debtors, Mr.  Bankrupt,  including  the 

State, and if  they want to come  in and protest it,  they 

can. 

Now, why --

what would  be unconstitutional  about 

such  a  provision  that  never  uses the  word  adversary 

proceeding? 

 MR. BRAND: 

Well, Your Honor, our  objection is 

not merely  to the bankruptcy rules. 

I would --

I would 

repeat that -- that --

 QUESTION:  I  read your position to  be that the 

State  isn't  bound 

at  all,  for  instance, 

that  the 

bankruptcy  court cannot discharge  property liens held by

the  State.  I  mean, I --

that  the State cannot  be forced  into any aspect  of the 

bankruptcy proceeding. 

 QUESTION:  And so did I. 

 QUESTION:  I guess --

I guess the -- you  would 

say the State doesn't have to abide by the automatic stay. 

 MR.  BRAND: 

Oh,  certainly  not,  Your  Honor. 

Certainly  not.  And  I thought that we  were clear in our 

briefing  that we --

we recognize  that the --

the State 

would  be  bound  by  the 

automatic  stay  because  it's 

automatic.  It is by operation of law and  by operation of 

the Supremacy Clause -­

 QUESTION: 

I'd rather like to get the answer to 

the question which is I  understand what position you took 

in the brief. 

I want to  know why.  I want  to know what 

the logic is.  I  can't find anything in the  Constitution 

that says that Congress cannot impose the same standard in 

respect to  discharging a  debt owed  to the  State as  it 

applies to a debt owed  to anybody else.  Now, either  you 

agree with  that proposition  or you  don't. 

And if  you 

don't -- and  I think you don't  -- I'd like to  know what 

the theory is. 

 MR. BRAND: 

Your Honor,  I agree that  Congress 

24 

can make those distinctions.  I -­

proposition,  then  all  your  objecting  to is  the  word 

adversary in the word adversary proceeding, and it takes 3 

minutes or less  for a good  expert simply to  get rid  of 

that  adversary proceeding and have the same thing done in 

an ordinary proceeding. 

 Now, I  want to know the  answer to what  I say, 

not  that you disagree with it. 

I know you disagree with 

it.  I want to know why you disagree with it. 

 MR. BRAND: 

I disagree with  it because the 

--

the  legislative  reports as  to that  subsection, section 

5239(a)(8), strongly point  out that  the statute --

that 

that subsection is intended to  be self-executing and that 

the  creditor,  the  lender, the  guaranteer,  the  -- the 

guarantee institution, are not required to initiate action 

but instead can rely on the nondischarge, on the exception 

from discharge. 

 So by  -- by  structuring the  -- the  exception 

that way, we would submit that Congress, as this Court has 

recognized in other situations, has given elevated  status 

to that creditor's position, has recognized that creditors 

of those kinds of debts  have interests in the payment  of 

those debts  that outweigh  the normal  fresh-start policy 

that --

that underlies  bankruptcy. 

So our  position is 

that it  does turn on  the nature  of the statute  and not 

merely those bankruptcy rules that require -­

doesn't require, does it, that  that preferred position be

anything else, it's an adversary  proceeding and the State

is a  way of  getting to  the same  result, really  not an 

adversary 

proceeding  for 

purposes  of 

the  Eleventh 

Amendment, 

since  it 

has 

no  functional 

difference 

whatsoever from a proceeding that  isn't labeled adversary 

but simply gives the State  notice of what's going on  and

is ordinary proceedings.

bankruptcy, as  I mentioned  earlier, do  not involve  the 

individualized adjudication of debts.  They involve  other 

issues.  They involve martialing the assets.  They involve 

assessing the -­

 QUESTION: 

May  I ask  one  question? 

Did I 

understand you correctly to  say that you did  not contest 

the fact that if --

if -- that if they had a blanket rule 

that all  student loans  are automatically  dischargeable, 

that would be true even if the creditor was a State? 

 MR. BRAND:  Certainly, Your Honor, and the -­

 QUESTION: 

And does  that mean  you also  would 

agree that any ordinary commercial obligation to the State 

such as paying rent for an -- an office suite or something 

like that could also  be dischargeable and there would  be 

no sovereign immunity problem there? 

 MR. BRAND: 

Yes, Your Honor, and the  reason -­

the  reason  I agree  to  that is  because  that does  not 

require  an  adjudication. 

It 

--  

it  would  occur  by 

operation of law by which -­

 QUESTION: 

Well, but  there has to  be -- there 

has  to be  a  final order  in  the bankruptcy  proceeding 

discharging

you  know, giving  the 

--  

the debtor  a 

discharge. 

 MR. BRAND: 

But we would  submit in  a -- in  a 

very real sense that would be surplusage. 

 QUESTION: 

But the -- but  the net result  is I 

thought your position in your brief was somewhat different 

from that.  That's  why I wanted to be sure about it.  You 

do agree  that --

that the  sovereign immunity  is not  a 

valid objection to a discharge of a bankrupt estate. 

 MR.  BRAND: 

That's 

--  

that's right  when the 

discharge is  by operation  of law. 

And  again, I  would 

analogize to  the -- the  situation of the  automatic stay 

provision that --

that Justice  O'Connor raised. 

Again, 

that operates automatically when the -­

So,  but  the

automatic stay if  the -- if the  debtor had to go  in and 

prove  his  name,  serial number,  and  rank  or something 

first, so it  wasn't completely automatic, then  you would 

say you have a sovereign immunity objection.

Possibly, possibly  not.  Again,  I 

would submit that there's authority from lower courts that 

would -- would possibly -­

interested in  the authority from the lower courts as I am 

curious  about  your  position. 

What exactly  does  the 

sovereign immunity defense protect for you? 

 MR. BRAND:  In this  case the sovereign immunity 

defense protects the State from being made a defendant and 

from having compulsory process issued against it to appear 

in a bankruptcy court  that could be in  any State of  the 

union in this case. 

 Now,  the 

--  

the  reason  I was  referring  to 

authority from  other courts  is to  -- is  to remind  the 

Court  that all of the courts  that have -- that have made 

the type of holding that  Your Honor is referring to  have 

also  recognized the  applicability of  Eleventh Amendment 

immunity in adversary settings. 

 QUESTION: 

I know, but it seems  to me somewhat 

anomalous to say that if you want  to do it without giving 

us a hearing, you can go ahead  and do it, but if you give 

us notice  and a  hearing and  an opportunity to  respond, 

then you're protected by the Eleventh Amendment. 

 MR. BRAND:  Well, again -­

 QUESTION:  A rather strange position. 

 MR. BRAND:  -- again,  Your Honor, I think --

I 

think  we're talking  about very  different things  there. 

There  is --

there  is  quite  a difference  between  the 

general

individualized adjudication of -- of  debts -- that is 

--

that is  a distinct thing under the bankruptcy laws from a 

situation in --

in which  there's a proceeding  involving 

the dischargeability of a particular debt -­

 QUESTION:  Well, you say -­

 MR. BRAND:  -- such as we have here. 

 QUESTION: 

-- it could  well be that  the State 

filed a claim and proved up its claim and then there's not 

enough money to pay it, the claim, but there would be some 

kind of  proceeding to establish the claim.  Would that be 

different then? 

 MR. BRAND: 

Well,  in --

in a  case where  the 

State  had filed a claim, the State would have voluntarily 

appeared  in the --

in the  proceeding as relates  to the 

subject matter of that claim. 

So there would not be  any 

sovereign immunity situation there at all. 

 QUESTION: 

So that  if  the  State voluntarily 

appears,  it  would  automatically 

waive  its  sovereign 

immunity defense. 

 MR. BRAND:  As to that claim, yes.

United States  trustee potentially part of  any proceeding 

that the trustee wants to be involved in?  Can the trustee 

have come  into this proceeding voluntarily if -- if he or 

she chose?

I believe so, Your Honor,  but 

I'm not certain if that is applicable in every -- in every 

district.  And I'm not -- I apologize.  I'm not certain as

impractical. 

 I was curious  about the credit --

the creditor 

class for  these student loans.  It's not just States that 

are creditors when a student  tries to get out from  under 

the student's debts.  What -- what other entities would be 

in this situation, not with respect to sovereign immunity, 

but as someone who has loaned money to a student? 

 MR.  BRAND: 

Well, 

certainly  any 

lending 

institution  could  -- could  be  involved as  a  -- as  a 

creditor in a student loan.  The -- the Federal and -- and 

I guess  there are  State programs  as  well, but  involve 

fairly 

complicated 

relationships 

between 

lending 

institutions and secondary holders and guarantors at -- at 

various levels. 

 QUESTION:  Do you know what part of the business 

the  States  have,  to  what  extent,  compared  to  other 

creditors, other lenders? 

 MR. BRAND:  Well,  the -- I --

I can speak  for 

the  State  of  Tennessee. 

The  State of  Tennessee  is 

involved  as a guarantor, not as a lender, but merely as a 

guarantor  in  conjunction  mainly  with  these 

--  

these 

Federal loan  programs.  And the -- the State of Tennessee 

is participating  not as a --

a business actor,  but as a 

means  of -- of  pursuing the  public policy of  making it 

simpler and  easier for  Tennessee residents  to obtain  a

college education. 

So the -- the State as a guarantor is 

-- is not in this -- in the position at all of an ordinary 

creditor, really,  as far as its --

as far as its purpose 

and -- and  even as far as  its -- probably  its financial 

calculations in -- in how to deal  with that.  Again, it's 

-- it's a matter of  pursuing the public policy of  making 

it easier  for -- for the  students, for these  debtors to 

obtain their college education. 

 QUESTION: 

So for  -- for  the primary  lender, 

this procedure would be fine.  The -- so the debt wouldn't 

be  dischargeable  to the  initial  creditor, the  one who 

loans -­

 MR. BRAND: 

I -- I  believe -- I  believe, Your 

Honor,  certainly 

the 

--  

the  initial  creditor  could 

certainly be  involved, would  have no  sovereign immunity 

defense. 

There  would still  be the  requirement of  the 

undue hardship showing. 

 QUESTION: 

But if you -- if you -- Congress was 

to say,  well, too bad, we tried to  give them a break, we 

can't  do it,  so we're  going to make  them dischargeable 

just like any other debt,  that would have a very  adverse 

effect on all the other  creditors in the picture who  are 

not State actors. 

 MR. BRAND:  It certainly  would, Your Honor, but 

25 

it also could create complications as far as -- as  far as

whether  States  would  choose  to  participate in 

--  

in 

student loan programs.  Again, it's a policy determination 

made  State  by State. 

There's  no requirement  that the 

States participate in -- in such programs. 

 It 

--  

it's  part  of  the balancing  of  those 

interests I think that has resulted in this statute and in 

this statute being written the way it is.  At one point in 

time not too long ago, student loans were discharged in an 

ordinary bankruptcy, and then it was -- it was cut back to 

only loans  that had been  in --

in payment more  than -­

more than 5  -- more than 7  years and more than  5 years, 

and  now, of  course, it's cut  back all the  way to where 

it's only  subject to  discharge upon a  showing of  undue 

hardship. 

So there's --

there's definitely a  policy of 

wanting to make  student loan  repayment more certain  and 

make  that  a 

--  

a  different  relationship  from  other 

debtor/creditor relationships. 

 If there are no further questions from the Court 

at this time, I would like to reserve the remainder of our 

time. 

I would ask that the judgment of the Sixth Circuit 

be reversed. 

 QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Brand. 

 Mr. Gerson, we'll hear from you.

 MR.  GERSON: 

Mr. Chief  Justice,  and  may it 

please the Court: 

 The questioning of the  petitioner reflected the 

fact  that  there  is  an  inherent conflict  between  the 

requirements of the operation of the bankruptcy system and 

the State's sovereign  immunity. 

This conflict has  been 

recognized in this Court's past opinions.  For example, in 

Van  Huffel v. Harkelrode, a 1931  decision of this Court, 

it was claimed that the  sale of a debtor's property  free 

and clear of -- of the  State's tax lien was not effective 

because the State lacked jurisdiction.  This --

 QUESTION:  The State lacked? 

 MR. GERSON:  Jurisdiction over the -­

 QUESTION:  The State lacked? 

 QUESTION:  The Supreme Court. 

 MR. GERSON: 

I'm -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.  The 

Court lacked jurisdiction over the State.  And  this Court 

denied that -- the State's position. 

 Subsequent to that  in Gardner/New Jersey, which 

is  a case  that --

that which is  noted for  waiver, the 

State also took the position that not -- that the property 

that was a part of the debtor's estate was  limited to the 

debtor's equity  and did not  include that portion  of the 

property of the debtor that was subject to the State's tax 

lien. 

Again, this  Court said,  no, all property  of the

debtor is part of the  estate, including that part  that's 

subject to a State's tax lien. 

 QUESTION:  Of course, in that case the State had 

come into bankruptcy -- the bankruptcy court voluntarily. 

 MR. GERSON: 

That's correct,  Your Honor. 

But 

the opinion -- that portion of the opinion in Gardner that 

addresses that  issue does not rely upon the fact that the 

State filed a proof of claim. 

 QUESTION: 

If 

--  

if  we  were  to  analogize 

bankruptcy proceedings to  in rem proceedings in  general, 

nevertheless this  dischargeability proceeding  is set  up 

under the rules as an  adversary one where a notice  and a 

summons is  filed on the State. 

That's a product  of how 

the rules are  constructed.  Now, presumably  in time they 

could be changed, but what about this case? 

 MR. GERSON:  To allow this case to be determined 

on  the basis that an adversary  proceeding had been filed 

would  be  elevating  form  over  substance 

because  the 

jurisdiction of the court with respect to the claim arises 

from the  court's jurisdiction  over the  property of  the 

estate and  claims  made against  it and  the  -- and  the 

debtor.  They're all part of the res.  So the filing of an 

adversary  proceeding  was  merely 

a  manner 

--  

merely 

allowing the State to --

to be provided with an  elevated 

form of notice rather than being jurisdictional.

 In  addition, 28  U.S.C.  2075  states that  the 

rules, bankruptcy  rules, should not in any way abridge or 

modify the substantive  rights that are granted  under the 

code, and I  believe in these circumstances to  allow this 

decision  to be  based  upon the  fact  that an  adversary 

proceeding  had  been  filed  would  have  the  effect  of 

abridging Ms. Hood's rights -­

not  been  set up  this  way,  I  would  assume  that  the 

bankruptcy  judge  would have  to  make  his  or  her  own 

determination about  whether the condition  of the statute 

had been  met, but once you have this adversary system set 

up, I assume the  bankruptcy judge is entirely  within his 

or her  rights by just saying, hey, the State hasn't shown 

up, the State loses. 

 MR. GERSON:  I would -- I'd like -­

to be elevating form over substance.  That -- that's a big

 MR.  GERSON: 

Yes,  and  I 

--  

I  believe  I 

incorrectly stated what would happen, Your Honor.  It's -­

even -- even  in an adversary proceeding,  the court would 

still have  to find that Ms. Hood had demonstrated a right 

to a -- to an undue hardship discharge. 

 QUESTION: 

So it  wouldn't just  go by  default 

then if the State didn't show up? 

 MR. GERSON:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION: 

Do  you  know  any other  adversary 

proceedings that  work that way? 

I mean, I  suppose that 

depends on what  the -- what the rule means,  but when the 

rule describes it as an adversary proceeding, I -- I would 

take it to mean that if the other side doesn't show up, it 

loses. 

 QUESTION:  Well, in a -- in a -- in an  ordinary 

suit for money  judgment, if the  defendant fails to  show 

up, he can be defaulted as to liability,  but he still has 

to show the money damages.  He just doesn't get the amount 

that he says in his complaint. 

 MR. GERSON:  That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 QUESTION: 

Well, is --

is the amount  at issue 

24 

here? 

25

 MR. GERSON: 

The amount is at issue only to the

extent that  in order to show undue hardship, Ms. Hood has 

to demonstrate that she can't repay it. 

 QUESTION: 

Yes,  but the

but  the --

the 

amount, how much it is, is  not -- is not in  controversy, 

is it? 

 MR. GERSON:  No, it's not.

adversary  proceeding  under the  Bankruptcy  Code  -- and 

there are  quite a few. 

You've said two  opposite things 

now.  Your first time  you said, well, if the  other party 

doesn't  show  up,  the  bankruptcy  judge can  just  say, 

debtor, you  win.  Okay? 

Without looking at  the merits. 

And the  second time you said,  no, that's not  really so. 

The  bankruptcy  judge  has to  satisfy  himself  that the 

statutory standard is met. 

 Now, I  guess this  isn't the  only place  where 

there's a adversary proceeding in  the code.  So which  is 

it?  Is it like  an -- and how do  I find out?  If  you're 

uncertain, what do I look up to try to find out the answer 

to that question? 

 MR. GERSON: 

Well,  Justice Breyer,  very often 

adversary proceedings  are commenced  in bankruptcy  court 

and they're necessary when the kind of action that dispute

-- in  dispute is the equivalent  of an action  that could 

have  been  commenced prior  to  the establishment  of the 

bankruptcy.  It's just --

 QUESTION:  Yes, I -­

 MR.  GERSON: 

--  

prior,  you know,  action now 

brought  into  the 

bankruptcy  court. 

And 

then  the 

bankruptcy court could issue a default judgment because -­

it  would be  a  traditional

action.

 QUESTION:

Are 

there -- are  there any adversary proceedings,  other than 

this, one which isn't like what you just described? 

 QUESTION: 

Well,  certainly  an  action  by  a 

trustee  for 

--  

of voidable  preference  would  be quite 

different, would it not? 

 MR.  GERSON: 

With  respect  to  a 

voidable 

preference, if --

if the defendant did not demonstrate it 

had any  defense, a judgment would  be issued in  favor of 

the --

the State  because there  is a  presumption for  a 

voidable preference once certain factors are met. 

 QUESTION: 

And there you're getting  money from 

outside the estate  too.  You're getting  a money judgment 

against somebody  that would  increase the  assets of  the 

estate.

 MR. GERSON:  That's correct,  Your Honor, but it 

is not  Ms. Hood's position in this case that a preference 

action 

would 

fall  within 

the  traditional 

in  rem 

jurisdiction  of  a bankruptcy  court  and thus  the State 

sovereign immunity would be abrogated. 

 QUESTION:  So you would -- you would say that if 

the --

if there  were a  suit for  a voidable  preference 

against  the  State,  the Eleventh  Amendment  rule  would 

prevail? 

 MR.  GERSON:  I  -- that issue  is unclear, Your 

Honor. 

It's certainly not  Ms. Hood's position  that the 

Eleventh  Amendment  would  not  prevail. 

And 

there's 

actually  a  case  pending before  this  Court  right now, 

Massachusetts  v.  H.J.  Wilson,  where  at issue  is  the 

debtor's  demand  for  an  income  tax  refund. 

So  the 

opportunity  to visit  the issue  of affirmative  monetary 

relief against a State and its -- and the ramifications of 

the  Eleventh  Amendment can  be  addressed in  that case. 

It's -­

 QUESTION: 

We're trying to get -- I'm trying to 

get the answer still  to Justice Scalia's question. 

Take 

the question the  Chief Justice asked.  It's  a preference 

action. 

It's  a kind of  bankruptcy action. 

It's in an 

adversary proceeding.  Is that right? 

 MR. GERSON:  Yes.

 QUESTION:  Okay. 

Now,  the other side  doesn't 

show up. 

Okay, forget this Eleventh  Amendment business. 

I  just  want  to know  the  normal  thing in  bankruptcy. 

What's the answer?  If he doesn't show up, is he defaulted 

like a regular case outside the court, or does the trustee 

-- I mean, does the  judge, the bankruptcy judge, look  at 

the matter  and make up  his own mind  independently about 

whether it was a preference or  not?  How does it work  in 

bankruptcy? 

 MR. GERSON: 

It would  -- it  would  not be  a 

default judgment, Your Honor. 

It would be a judgment  on 

the merits.

For 

what purpose is a default  judgment not a judgment on  the 

merits?

Oh, to --

to the extent  it is -­

there's greater flexibility  of a  defendant to come  back 

and  ask  for  reconsideration,  I  believe, under  normal

procedures. 

 QUESTION:  That  doesn't make it not  a decision 

on  the merits. 

It may  be subject  to reopening,  but a 

default judgment is a judgment. 

 MR. GERSON:  That's correct. 

 QUESTION:  I thought that the question we --

we 

were talking  about before -- that  there was a  clear and 

certain answer  to the question, that -- that if the claim 

is made  that there's  undue hardship,  even if the  State 

doesn't show up -- well, let's take the -- because this is 

written for all creditors and not particularly with States 

in mind. 

If the creditor doesn't show up, the bankruptcy 

judge still  has to  find that there's  undue hardship  in 

order to make this dischargeable. 

 MR. GERSON:  That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 

 QUESTION: 

And where does that come from?  I -­

that was my understanding about  the way it works, but  is 

that a statute,  a rule? 

Where does  -- where does  that 

come from? 

 MR. GERSON:  I  think it comes from the  natural 

reading of the statute that such  a finding has to be made 

that there  would be an undue  hardship for the  debtor to 

have to repay that -- that loan. 

 QUESTION: 

You -- you could say  the same about 

25 

any default  judgment in a case --

in a tort action where 

33

the tort statute,  you know, only imposes  liability where 

the defendant has  been negligent.  The  defendant doesn't 

show up.  The court doesn't -- doesn't enter into  its own 

independent  inquiry  as  to  whether  the  defendant  was 

negligent.  It enters default  judgment.  And the statute, 

just as clearly, requires negligence there as this statute 

requires undue hardship here. 

 MR. GERSON:  The difference -- the difference is 

-- Your Honor, is that all of the property of a debtor and 

claims against  that property  -- they're  -- they're  all 

under 

the  bankruptcy  court's 

jurisdiction. 

So  a 

bankruptcy court has a special obligation to -- to protect 

the interests  of  all creditors  and  the estate,  and  I 

believe  because  of  that,  it  would have  a  heightened 

responsibility to determine whether there  was a basis for 

an undue hardship  discharge because  the decision is  not 

solely -- is -- is affecting everyone. 

 QUESTION:  In the voidable preference case, it's 

-- it's  as  if we're  -- the  suggestion is  is that  the 

bankruptcy  court  has  the  authority  to order  the  res 

brought before  it, commanding  the State  to deliver  the 

res, i.e., the voidable preference. 

 MR. GERSON:  I -- there is a question that -­

 QUESTION:  And -- please. 

 MR.  GERSON:

with  regard  to  a

voidable preference  action whether  the funds  the debtor 

would be seeking would be part of the res because it's not 

in the possession of the estate. 

 QUESTION:  Right. 

 MR. GERSON:  And certainly that distinction  can 

be made as made in California v. -- v. Deep Sea  Research, 

that if the property is in the possession of the -- of the 

State,  rather  than  the debtor,  a  different  result is 

required with respect to the Eleventh Amendment. 

 QUESTION:  Well,  before the  Bankruptcy Act  in 

1978, bankruptcy courts couldn't try voidable preferences. 

That had to be in the district court I believe. 

 MR. GERSON:  That's correct, Justice Rehnquist. 

 QUESTION:  If in fact we assume -- let's suppose 

when we look  into this --

suppose I was  to come to  the 

conclusion that  an adversary proceeding in  bankruptcy is 

identical to a case that has nothing to do with bankruptcy 

in a court.  You say isn't,  and maybe that's so and we'll 

find out.  All right. 

 Now, if that were so and if that meant under the 

Court's case law that this particular adversary proceeding 

were  invalid  under  the Eleventh  Amendment,  would  the 

bankruptcy judge under  section 105 or some  other section 

or would the Rules Committee have the power without  going 

back  to  Congress to  devise  a different  procedure that

would get to exactly the same place, say, a procedure that 

had the bankruptcy  judge adjudicate  this under the  same 

standard  while  notifying  the  State, 

like  any  other 

creditor, that it could intervene at is choice. 

 MR. GERSON: 

Yes, it could, Your Honor.  And -­

and  the  basis  for  that  would  be  to  reconciling the 

requirements of 28 U.S.C. 2075 and the requirement for the 

bankruptcy rules  because under  105, a  court could  rule 

that it would be inappropriate  to enforce the requirement 

of  Bankruptcy  Rule  7001,  which requires  an  adversary 

proceeding. 

So  105 would  give a bankruptcy  court that 

power and I believe it would be an appropriate exercise of 

that power. 

 QUESTION:  And even without 105, could the Rules 

15 

Committee then devise a different rule?

 MR. GERSON:  Certainly, Your Honor. 

 QUESTION: 

Mr. Gerson,  you 

--  

your position 

depends  heavily  on  the  characterization of  bankruptcy 

proceedings as in rem, and  one can understand that  about 

the bankrupt estate, it collects whatever assets there are 

and distributes them.  But this  is a no-asset bankruptcy. 

So how does the in  rem characterization fit a case  where 

there are no assets? 

 MR. GERSON:  Because the debtor itself, at least 

25 

the pre-petition debtor,  is also  considered part of  the

res, part of  the bankruptcy court's in  rem jurisdiction. 

That  was  reflected in  Hanover  National Bank  v. Moyses 

where  the  creditor  complained that  its  debt  had been 

discharged, but  it had  never received --

no summons  or 

complaint had  ever been filed.  In fact, it complained it 

had never received notice.  And this Court's response was, 

no, bankruptcy  is a form of  in rem jurisdiction,  and on 

that basis  the --

the claim  of that  creditor could  be 

discharged  even  though no  adversary  -- no  summons and 

complaint was filed.  Notice  as a motion was  sufficient, 

and it based -­

 QUESTION:  So  what you're saying  is the --

is 

the debtor  is not a thing, is not  a res, but a debtor -­

this is an adjudication over  a status which traditionally 

is also in rem. 

 MR. GERSON:  That's correct, Your Honor.  I know 

it doesn't entirely fit our traditional notions of  what a 

res is,  but  it's  consistent with  how  this  Court  has 

traditionally  understood the  in  rem jurisdiction  of  a 

bankruptcy court  and the needs  of a bankruptcy  court to 

satisfy its essential functions. 

 The  kinds  of  contradictions  that  are  being 

raised  in  the  questioning 

are  reflective  of  what's 

happened in the circuit courts of appeal where the  Fourth 

Circuit, the  Fifth Circuit,  the Ninth  Circuit all  have

recognized and have stated in -- in  earlier opinions that 

the  Seminole Tribe  doctrine  applied  in bankruptcy  but 

later  recognized  an in  rem exception  to allow  for the 

discharge of debts  with respect to the Fifth  Circuit and 

the Ninth Circuit and --

and the Fourth Circuit, and  the 

Fourth Circuit also recognized that principle with respect 

to the  confirmation of a plan and its binding effect upon 

a  State. 

So  right 

now  bankruptcy  law  is  in 

an 

inconsistent muddle  with respect to the  applicability of 

the Eleventh Amendment, and this case allows this Court an 

opportunity to reconcile that inconsistency as -­

 QUESTION:  Only  a small piece of  it, according 

to what you told us earlier, because you said this doesn't 

involve the preference question. 

 MR.  GERSON: 

That's 

--  

that's correct,  Your 

Honor. 

Of course, this Court  could rule that  given the 

traditional in  rem nature of  a bankruptcy  and the  fact 

that, particularly under the Bankruptcy Act  a preference, 

as  Chief Justice Rehnquist  pointed out, was  not part of 

the bankruptcy summary jurisdiction but required a plenary 

action,  that in  fact actions  requiring  any affirmative 

monetary relief against a State are not part of a debtor's 

--  

are 

not  part  of 

a  bankruptcy  court's 

in  rem 

jurisdiction, if it chose. 

 If there are no more questions, thank you.

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gerson. 

 Mr. Brand, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL J. BRAND 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. BRAND: 

Thank you,  Your Honor. 

Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

 The  State's  position in  this  case is  that a 

proceeding under the law which requires the State  to make 

a choice  between voluntarily  entering the  proceeding or 

sitting back and suffering a loss  of its -- of its rights 

is every bit as coercive  whether it's styled as a  motion 

or  an  adversary proceeding  or --

or anything  else, is 

every bit as  coercive as a lawsuit similar to  the -- the 

situation  with  the  administrative  proceedings  in  the 

Federal Maritime Commission case. 

 QUESTION:  Is that loss  of its right automatic? 

What  is your answer  to the  question of whether,  if you 

don't show up, a default judgment is entered automatically 

against you, or does the bankruptcy judge have to make the 

assessment of whether there's an undue hardship? 

 MR. BRAND: 

I am not certain, Your Honor, but I 

believe  that  an undue  hardship  showing would  still be 

necessary. 

 But in either -- in  either situation, the State 

25 

would suffer the consequences of losing its rights subject

to an adjudication, not subject  to the mere operation  of 

law as with the general  discharge at the conclusion of  a 

-- of an ordinary bankruptcy proceeding. 

 As  -- as far as the preference actions go, this 

case --

I'm sorry  -- this  Court decided  in Hoffman  v. 

Connecticut  which involved  a preference action  and even 

more than that, a turnover action where there actually was 

property  of the  estate  that the 

--  

that the  bankrupt 

trustee was  -- was entitled to recover, that in either of 

those types of situations, the Eleventh Amendment applied. 

Now, of course, that  case turned on whether Congress  had 

-- had made a clear  statement in the statute, but  in any 

event,  the  Court, having  found  that  the  -- that  the 

Congress  did not  make  a clear  statement  of intent  to 

override 

sovereign 

immunity, 

applied 

the  Eleventh 

Amendment to that preference  action, that turnover action 

in that case. 

 Now, in this case we  have no property.  The 

--

the debtor  is not seeking to -- to  get property.  The -­

the creditor  is not seeking  to make a  claim out of  the 

property of the  estate.  So we would submit  that -- that 

the  Court can decide  this case, which  involves a simple 

adversary  proceeding 

on  its  face,  the 

issuance  of 

compulsory process without  even reaching the question  of 

whether a  similar effect would -- would  occur in -- in a

preference  action  or  in any  other  type  of bankruptcy 

action. 

 So I'd like to emphasize to  the Court that this 

is an unusual statute, and  the question in this case  is, 

does  the  Eleventh  Amendment  apply  in  the  bankruptcy 

context? 

But the precise circumstances of  this case can 

well limit  a court's holding  to the question  of whether 

sovereign  immunity protects  the  State  in an  adversary 

proceeding  on  this  particular  type  of statute  for  a 

10 

particular exception from discharge.

your  brief said, well,  it's not that  the bankruptcy law 

doesn't find the States so that, for example, if the State 

as  creditor  would  sue  the  student  after  she's  been 

discharged in bankruptcy, she could then as a defense say, 

I'm not liable on this debt.  It's been discharged.  I got 

the  undue hardship  finding  from  the bankruptcy  court. 

That -- you did say that in your brief that that  would be 

-- that -- that she could have this as a defense. 

 MR. BRAND:  Well, we -- we did not mean that she 

would have obtained the undue hardship finding from the -­

the bankruptcy court,  but that she could  raise the issue

and through  tax intercepts,  but the  Federal regulations


and  State  law would  afford  the debtor  opportunity for


administrative  proceedings  to raise  the  undue hardship


issue and  prove  that she  should  be absolved  from  the


student loan debt.  So  there are State remedies available


in the context not of a State court -­
