 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

 (10:18 a.m.)

first this morning in Case 09-1279, Federal 

Communications Commission v. AT&T, Inc.

 Mr. Yang.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. YANG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The court of appeals has held that FOIA's 

statutory protection for personal privacy in 

Exemption 7(C) extends beyond the privacy of individuals 

and protects the so-called personal privacy of 

corporations.  That holding is inconsistent with the 

text of Exemption 7(C), FOIA's broader context, and the 

statute's drafting history, and would lead to anomalous 

results.

 The word "personal," standing alone, refers 

to individual -- an individual human being.  "Privacy," 

standing alone, and even more so in the context of the 

phrase "invasion of privacy," invokes purely individual 

concepts.  And the sum of those terms -- that is, the 

statutory phrase used in FOIA, "personal privacy" -- is 

greater than the sum of its parts.  It's long been well

settled that corporations have no personal privacy.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it true that there are 

contexts in the law in which the word "personal" is used 

to refer to a corporation?  For example, you could refer 

to personal jurisdiction over a corporation, couldn't 

you?

 MR. YANG:  There are -- the term "personal" 

is sometimes used as a term of art, and I think personal 

jurisdiction is one of those.  It is the modern, shorter 

term of art for jurisdiction in personam and reflects a 

distinction drawn still in the law between cases brought 

in personam and cases brought in rem.

 That -- the evolution of that term in the 

law as a term of art does not reflect what the ordinary 

meaning of "personal" is.  It's just the same as the 

term "personal property," which also invokes 

long-established traditional distinctions between 

property that could be recovered in rem or in real 

actions versus property that might be recovered in 

actions in personam.

 So -- and, in fact, I think it -- it's 

important to note that there are -- although maybe there 

are some instances that -- I think there's one instance 

that AT&T cites in its brief.  Nothing -- it never cited 

any use of the term "personal" to mean corporate or

pertaining to a corporation.  And when -- when you -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about -- what about 

personal appearances?

 MR. YANG:  A personal appearance, I think 

that -- that supports our position as well.  If you're 

making a personal appearance, it's not something that a 

corporation does.  A corporation is a -- a legal 

construct.  It doesn't exist as a thing that can make an 

appearance.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, in ordinary speech, 

the term "personal" is not -- the term "person" is not 

used to refer to a corporation.  That's -- that's 

legalese.  But in -- but since the -- the Administrative 

Procedure Act defines a person to include a corporation, 

why is it relevant here or dispositive here to look to 

the ordinary usage of term "personal" as opposed to the 

way it's -- it's used in the law?  And in the law, it is 

sometimes used to refer to a corporation.

 MR. YANG:  Well, I think that -- that point 

actually reinforces our position, because although 

"person" is used in certain legal contexts to refer 

to artificial persons and corporations and the like, 

"personal" is not.

 And "personal," as we explain in our brief, 

is not simply a grammatical alteration, an inflection of

the term "person."  It has existed in its own right 

since the late 1300s and has developed meaning that is 

unique to the term "personal," which -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Yang, can we go back 

first to this -- the request came in and, as I 

understand it, the Commission said there are two 

exemptions:  The one for trade secrets, commercial, 

financial confidential information; and then there was 

one with Exemption 7 itself but as to the employee.

 MR. YANG:  Correct.  There was an additional 

exemption, Exemption 5, which protected internal 

government communications.  But -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How does the -- does the 

Commission, unaided by AT&T, go through the papers and 

decide what would be embarrassing for an AT&T employee, 

as distinguished from the corporation?

 MR. YANG:  How does it do that?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.

 MR. YANG:  Well, I -- I don't think the 

touchstone is necessarily embarrassment.  What the 

government does, following this Court's decision in 

Reporters Committee, is tries to determine whether there 

is a personal privacy interest about individuals, and 

that is information that pertains to particular 

individuals.

For instance, in this Court's decision in 

DOD v. FLRA, the Court explained that, although an 

agency released the name of individuals, it could 

properly withhold the addresses, the home addresses, of 

those individuals, even though that might be publicly 

available in phone books, because individuals have at 

least some small personal privacy interest in that.

 So what the agency will do is try to 

identify information pertaining to individuals and then 

will conduct -- if there is certain information, will 

try to conduct a balancing to determine whether there is 

a public interest in disclosure, that is, whether 

revealing this would disclose information against the 

government.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in that instance, 

does the corporation have standing to raise that 

objection on the employee's behalf?

 MR. YANG:  Well, I think the corporation to 

the -- in a reverse FOIA case, for instance, which is 

what we have here, where the corporation is alleging 

that the government's decision-making process is 

arbitrary and capricious, it has Article III standing to 

resist the disclosure of documents.  If you're using 

standing kind of like a Fourth Amendment concept of 

standing, I don't think that -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, as an administrative 

matter, can the corporation make a FOIA objection on 

behalf of its employees?

 MR. YANG:  It can make an objection on its 

own behalf, which is to say that the government has not 

properly gone through the decision-making process by 

not -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  That's the 

next -- that was going to be my next question:  So the 

corporation can raise FOIA on its own behalf?

 MR. YANG:  It's actually -- let me take a 

step back.  FOIA actions are actions which seek to 

increase the amount of documents that the government has 

released pursuant to a FOIA request.

 We have also reverse FOIA actions, which are 

actions under the APA and here under the Hobbs Act's 

review provisions, that would give the court of appeals 

jurisdiction.  When there's a reverse FOIA action, the 

claim is that the agency's final agency action is 

somehow arbitrary, capricious, and not -- or contrary to 

law.  And so in this case, the FCC has certain 

regulations which govern its processing of FOIA 

requests.  And AT&T's claim, as we understand it, is 

that the FCC did not comply with its regulations, and, 

therefore, its decision was arbitrary capricious because

its regulations required that it consider the personal 

privacy interest of individuals.

 And I should note that, with respect to 

Exemption 6 or Exemption 7(C), the government itself 

invokes personal privacy of individuals.  That's what we 

do when we process FOIA requests, because individuals 

normally don't get any notice that there has been a FOIA 

request.  The government simply processes it and asserts 

those rights, in a sense that they're rights, asserts 

those interests on behalf of corporations -- on behalf 

of individuals.

 Going back to the text of the statute, the 

term "privacy," and particularly an invasion of privacy, 

invokes concepts that back to Warren and Brandeis's 

right of privacy, the -- their article which explained 

that or identified in the law certain human dignitary 

interests that they gave the label "privacy."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, privacy 

certainly isn't as limited as you argue "person," 

"personal," is.  Corporations have private property. 

They have private documents.  The concept certainly 

applies in the corporate context as it does in the 

individual.

 MR. YANG:  I think the term "privacy," its 

ordinary meaning, not the only meaning but the ordinary

and the commonly used meaning, does invoke individual 

concepts.  When corporations or other entities are at 

issue, normally the more appropriate word would be 

"confidentiality" or "secrecy."  Those concepts -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't have 

confidential property or secret property.  You have 

private property.

 MR. YANG:  Well, true.  But it's is not 

privacy.  When we're talking about the right of privacy, 

those -- that word we think -- again going back to 

Warren and Brandeis and up through the fifties and 

sixties when Prosser was elaborating the law of torts in 

his groundbreaking article on privacy, those concepts 

apply only to individuals, and particularly when you 

combine the terms.

 I mean, the Restatement makes clear, and 

back to Prosser it was clear, that corporations have no 

right of personal privacy.  So when Congress in 1974 was 

enacting Exemption 7(C), there would have been no basis 

for it to conclude that the rights that it was 

conferring through the phrase "personal privacy" would 

confer rights not -- beyond individuals, to 

corporations, and by necessarily implication, if AT&T is 

correct, foreign governments, State governments, local 

governments.  There's no predicate for those types of

entities having personal privacy in the law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Yang -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Our cases assert, do they 

not, that the exceptions to FOIA should be narrowly 

construed?

 MR. YANG:  There are cases -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And we've said that on a 

number of cases.

 MR. YANG:  In certain contexts, this Court 

has indicated that exceptions are to be narrowly 

construed.  We think that, when read in context, those 

cases and other cases of this Court explain that FOIA's 

exemptions are to be given meaningful reach, because 

what Congress was trying to do in FOIA -- and this is 

somewhat against our interest in this case, and we 

explain it more fully in our brief in Milner, which is 

currently pending to the Court -- what Congress was 

trying to do in FOIA was to establish a general 

principle of disclosure, but in the exemptions it 

identified very important interests that warranted an 

exception from those general rules.  And to narrowly 

construe the exception, we think, would distort rather 

than advance congressional purpose in enacting FOIA.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose Congress had used 

the phrase "privacy of a person," "privacy of any

person."  Would you make the same argument?

 MR. YANG:  Our argument would be a little 

different, particularly in the context of Exemptions 6 

and 7(C), where the phrase would be "an invasion of 

privacy of any person."

 We think, particularly when we're talking 

about invasions of privacy, even though a corporation 

might have a broader definitional meaning in context, 

Congress in that case would still, we think, be 

referring to individuals.  But, of course, that's not 

this case.  That would make it a little bit more 

difficult.  We think we would probably still prevail on 

that reading.  But -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the Privacy 

Act?  The Privacy Act undoubtedly concerns individuals, 

human individuals -­

MR. YANG:  Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- not artificial beings. 

But it uses the words "individual privacy" -­

MR. YANG:  Well, it actually uses both 

phrases.  It uses, as we explain in our brief, the 

phrase "personal privacy" to explain that that's what 

the Act was protecting.  And then within the operative 

portions of the Act, it uses "individual," but it does 

so for a very specific reason.  Congress was intending

to protect a subset of individuals, and it defined the 

term "individual" to mean U.S. citizens and lawful 

permanent residents.

 So not all individuals would be protected by 

the Privacy Act.  Now, Congress did that, not because 

had it used the phrase "personal privacy" it would have 

been extending rights to corporations and foreign 

governments, but because personal privacy would have 

been too broad in that it would have -- even though it 

would have been limited to individuals, it would have 

included a set of individuals that Congress wanted to 

exclude, that is, everybody who is not a U.S. citizen or 

lawful permanent resident.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I ask you a 

question?  I'm not sure I understood your response to 

Justice Scalia.  If there is ambiguity, if a term can be 

given two meanings, and it's not clear -- and I know 

you're challenging the clarity question here -- I 

thought that Congress's intent to have full disclosure 

would necessarily mean that where there's ambiguity as 

to the meaning of an exception, then we should change 

the narrowest meaning.

 MR. YANG:  Well, I think we disagree, and I 

think this is why:  No legislation pursues its primary 

goal at all costs, and the FOIA exceptions that are at

issue here protect very important values that Congress 

deemed to warrant exceptions from the rule.  And so if 

the Court were to put a thumb on one scale of that 

balance that Congress has tried to strike, after using 

all the normal tools of construction, we think that 

would distort rather than advance the intent of 

Congress.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand that. 

We're not putting a thumb on the scale.  Taking account 

of the fact that -- that Congress has many objectives in 

any legislation and that the limitations are as 

important as the -- the substantive end, nonetheless, 

when, having applied all of that, you end up with, gee, 

I don't know, it's ambiguous -- you say, even in that 

situation, we don't apply the rule that -­

MR. YANG:  Well, if you were to -- after 

using all the normal tools that the Court does and 

you're -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but that's what 

ambiguity means.  It does -- it means -­

MR. YANG:  That's usually a very rare 

instance, that you're exactly at equipoise.  And -- and 

we certainly aren't relying on narrow construction in 

this case, Justice Scalia.

to abandon the principle that we've set forth in our 

cases -­

MR. YANG:  Well, we think -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- that exceptions to FOIA 

are to be narrowly construed.  The Government does not 

support that.

 MR. YANG:  We do not embrace that principle.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Yang -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even though we did?  I 

mean -­

MR. YANG:  Well, we think that those 

cases -- there are -- there are two lines of this 

Court's decisions.  Sometimes the Court explains that 

exceptions are narrowly construed, and sometimes the 

Court explained that its decision has given -- its 

decisions have given the exceptions practical reach in 

order to strike the appropriate balance that Congress 

has tried to strike in FOIA.

 Now, let me just say, our narrow 

construction, to the extent the Court would want to 

reaffirm it here -- we're not advancing that -- would 

only help the Government's position.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Your argument is based on 

a case that will come before us.  So -- but in this 

case, it's to your interest to say, yes, that has been

-- that has been the Court's precedent, that FOIA 

exceptions are to be narrowly construed.

 MR. YANG:  Well, the Government has broader 

interests beyond a single case, and we think that, 

again, we're not embracing strict construction in this 

case.  But, again, that would only help the Government's 

position if you were to disagree.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I'm not going to help 

the Government's position if the Government doesn't want 

to be helped.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm happy to leave you 

where you put yourself.

 MR. YANG:  And we -- we accept that in this 

case, and we think that the language of the text, 

particularly when read in context in light of the 

statutory history, and particularly when you take a look 

at what's gone on since 1974 -- I mean, in the more than 

35 years since, there has been uniform agreement that 

Exemptions 6 and 7(C) apply only to individuals.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose -- I 

suppose families have rights of personal privacy, don't 

they?

 MR. YANG:  Well, in certain contexts, family 

members, as this Court decided in Favish, can have a

right to personal privacy.  But the Court in Favish 

recognized that that was a very, you know, significant 

departure from the prior understanding that the right of 

personal privacy in FOIA protects information about the 

individual, him- or herself, and recognized that there 

was another strain of personal privacy, which from 

longstanding tradition in terms of -- within our 

society, the Court could draw on in saying that personal 

privacy should also protect, at least in the context 

of -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So in some 

contexts -- in some contexts, personal privacy does go 

beyond the individual?

 MR. YANG:  No, still it is individual.  I 

mean, those are individual members of the family.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Aggregations of 

individuals?

 MR. YANG:  Well, no.  I think an individual 

member of the family has a personal privacy interest by 

virtue of the relationship to the decedent in Favish.

 Let me go back.  Just -- I think I would be 

remiss if I didn't remark upon this Court's decision -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  To go back to 

the Chief's question, you do not deny that the 

individuals who form the corporation, the officers and

the employees, are protected by the right of personal 

privacy, and, indeed, you will -- you will edit any FOIA 

responses to protect those individuals, even though 

there are many of them, right?

 MR. YANG:  Correct.  If there were -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But as individuals, not as 

-- not as the corporation.

 MR. YANG:  As individuals, because the 

information pertains to them.

 Now, going to the American Express case, 

which we explain in our reply, I think that is fatal to 

the proposition that -- the proposition of AT&T that 

there's a grammatical imperative that adjectives take 

the meaning of a related noun.

 In American Express, the Court construed the 

Truth in Lending Act, which includes the definition of 

"person" to include, for instance, corporations.  It 

then went on to construe a term, "consumer," which 

concerns transactions primarily for personal, family, 

household, or, at the time, agricultural purposes.  The 

Court explained that a transaction -- the transaction 

that was conducted for a corporation's business

did not concern personal purposes.  We think that's 

fatal.

 The Court, in fact, said it was the only 

possible conclusion and that there was no other possible 

interpretation of the statutory phrase, after repeating 

the enumeration of those four factors three times and 

then on the very next page saying corporate -- a 

transaction for corporate business purposes could not 

be fit within that definition.

 Finally, I'd like to remark upon the 

anomalies that this Court would set us forth upon if it 

were to decide that corporations have personal privacy.

 At least in the context of individuals, 

there's an established body of law and societal 

understanding of what a person, an individual, might 

have a personal privacy interest in.  But if we expand 

personal to include corporations, foreign governments, 

State governments, local governments, defining what 

would be personal privacy of those institutions would 

require an extraordinary exercise, a simple policy 

judgment on the part of the agencies first and then the 

Court.

 And this Court in Favish was careful to 

explain that that type of decision making would be 

improper in that appropriate guides to -- to limit and

make objective a court and agency's decision making is 

required.

 Congress provided no benchmarks, never 

addressed corporate, foreign governments, or any other 

non-human entity in the context of personal privacy.

 And, again, for 36 years, there's been 

uniform agreement that personal privacy applies in this 

context only to corporations.

 If there are no further questions -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, if an 

individual has been -- individual human being has been 

investigated by the FBI and a FOIA request is made for 

records related to that investigation, would the name of 

the individual not be turned over?

 MR. YANG:  Well, if someone is asking for an 

investigation of Tony Yang -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.

definitively, but I think I can probably answer that

there is a responsive record answers the question.  So

difficulty of defining privacy more broadly, but the 

same harm that occurs to an individual who is disclosed 

to have been the target of an investigation is an 

identical privacy right of a corporation, that a 

corporation has the same negative effects as the 

individual.

 MR. YANG:  I think -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So I think they would 

concede that privacy might need to be defined 

differently for corporations.  They're simply saying 

this privacy interest is not.

 MR. YANG:  Well, the key point is that we 

don't deny that corporations have some interest in 

confidentiality that exists out there.  For instance, 

AT&T has relied upon the common law of defamation where 

a corporation's business interests, business reputation, 

is implicated.  But even -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, parts of -- they 

pled guilty already.  So it is hard to imagine how much 

exponentially more damaging -­

MR. YANG:  Well, to be fair to AT&T, there 

was a settlement agreement in which they did not admit 

any wrongdoing.  So -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that presupposes 

some sort of investigation.  So that's public knowledge

already.

 MR. YANG:  That is public knowledge.  But I 

think the key point is that the corporate -- a 

corporation's interests in maintaining its business 

reputation has been not regarded as a personal privacy 

interest.  It's true that they have interests, and FOIA 

protects those interests, for instance, interests in 

confidential commercial or financial information under 

Exemption 4.

 And so what really the -- we come back to 

the key point, which is when Congress used the phrase 

"personal privacy," it would have had no reason in 1974, 

or even now, to think that term would have referred to 

corporations.  The fact that corporations have other 

interests and other rights that might be legitimate is 

kind of beside the point because those interests are not 

referred to in the law or otherwise as personal privacy 

interests.

 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The question in this case is whether any 

organization, including not only business corporations 

like AT&T but also nonprofit organizations and political 

associations, should be categorically excluded from 

protection under Exemption 7(C), such that this 

exemption will now offer less protection for privacy 

interests than the Constitution and the common law.

 This Court has consistently held that the 

privacy protections under FOIA are broader.  And the 

text supports that position.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you include in this 

the people, the persons that you say are shielded by 

this privacy exemption, as Mr. Yang said, foreign 

governments, State and local governments?  Those have 

all -- those all fall under the APA definition of 

person.

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Justice Ginsburg, they do. 

And we would agree that, as a matter of statutory 

construction, the concept of personal privacy does apply 

to those -- those other categories of actors.  Now, 

whether once that privacy interest is balanced against 

the public's interest in disclosure, that balance may 

well be different with respect to public or foreign 

entities, but -- but certainly they -- they have a right

to personal privacy under the terms of the statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you give us an idea 

of -- the corporation has been shielded by Exemption 4 

for its confidential financial information, trade 

secrets; and its employees have been protected under 

Exemption 7.

 What is it, what would be -- would fall 

within this privacy exception that would not be 

confidential business information or relate to employees 

of the corporation?

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Justice Ginsburg, we -- I 

could give you two categories or kinds of examples.  One 

is, for example, a series of e-mails among corporate 

officers -- granted, whose own personal names and 

identifying information have been redacted, but in those 

e-mails, they may engage in a frank exchange about the 

competence and intelligence of a would-be regulator of 

the corporation or a -- disparaging comments about 

potential -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  Why does that 

relate to their privacy?  I don't understand that.  Why 

does that relate to the corporation's privacy interest? 

Anything that would embarrass the corporation is -- is a 

privacy interest?

the answer is simply that these were communications, 

conversations, that were occurring with an expectation 

of privacy by the individuals involved on behalf of 

their employer, and to the extent that they could be 

used to harm the reputation or the customer goodwill of 

-- of the company, they do, indeed, have a -- a personal 

privacy interest in -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Anything that hurts the -­

the -- the image or the goodwill of the company?

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Your Honor, everything that 

with -- that is intended to be private is certainly 

subject to the balancing that we're asking for under 

Exemption 7(C); indeed, that Congress provided, that if 

it's -- it's an interest in personal privacy, then it is 

to be balanced to determine whether the disclosure of 

that document is unwarranted.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Klineberg, can you give 

me any example of -- your -- your brief talks a lot 

about the adjective "personal."  But we're not talking 

just about the adjective "personal."  What about the 

phrase "personal privacy"?

 "Personal," yes, can indeed apply to 

corporations sometimes, but there are certain phrases 

where it clearly does not.  For example, you talk about 

personal characteristics.  That doesn't mean the

characteristics of General Motors.  You talk about 

personal qualities.  It doesn't mean the qualities of 

General Motors.  You talk about a point of personal 

privilege.  It's not a privilege of a corporation.

 And I think personal privacy is the same 

thing.  Can you give me any examples in common usage 

where people would refer to the personal privacy of a -­

of a corporation?  It's a very strange phrase to me.

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Well, Your Honor, as 

Justice Alito asked my -- my colleague earlier, the -­

the whole concept of -- of "person" as including a 

corporation would surprise many people, the proverbial 

person on the street.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  I'm not talking about 

that.  I'll grant you that -- that "personal" could 

sometimes refer to a corporation, although the 

Government distinguishes it by etymology and so forth. 

Never mind that.  I'm talking about personal privacy. 

Do you have any examples from the New York Times, from, 

you know, Boswell, from anywhere, that anybody refers to 

the interests of a corporation as the "personal privacy" 

of General Motors?

 I cannot imagine somebody using the phrase 

like that.

of that phrase being used certainly in any statutory 

context -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you were about to 

give a second example of where, even though it hasn't -­

personal privacy hasn't been used in -- but you said one 

example is the two officials who are saying unpleasant 

things about a regulator.  And what was your other 

example?

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Well, there's a -- there's a 

sub-example within that category which is the 

disparaging of an important customer, some unpleasant 

comments about an important customer of the corporation 

that could then be used quite -- quite clearly by a -­

by a competitor to -- to harm the goodwill of the -- of 

the corporation with respect to that customer.

 But there is indeed another whole category 

of documents that goes beyond the -- the context of 

AT&T's interest here, and the example is internal 

documents within, say, an environmental nonprofit 

organization talking about their political strategies 

for defeating an amendment to the Clean Air Act.

 As an example, those political strategies 

that were shared internally by -- by members of the 

organization without any intent to -- to have them 

become public would become subject to -- to automatic

disclosures, categorical disclosure, were the Government 

to prevail in this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you think it's -­

how does that work?  If you have -- the president of the 

environmental organization says something about whatever 

it is -- we can lobby this guy to get this change -- is 

he able to protect that on the grounds of his personal 

privacy, even though the embarrassment would go to the 

-- the organization as a whole?

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, I believe 

the answer is in most cases "yes," that in -- that the 

identity of the -- the specific speaker and any 

identifying information corresponding to him or her 

would be protected.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why is it such 

a big deal, then, to extend that to the organization as 

a whole, if the individual's privacy is already going to 

be protected?

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Indeed, Your Honor, I think 

that is -- that is our position, that -- that the 

personal privacy of the corporation is -- is affected by 

such disclosure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  I mean 

you're -- you're already protected, at least to a 

significant extent, because the individual officers

would be able to assert a privacy interest, to the 

extent at least that what you find embarrassing to -- to 

the corporation is also individually embarrassing to 

them.

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Right.  But the -- but the 

redactions that would occur would in all likelihood 

simply be redactions of their names and perhaps their 

titles, but their -- the substance of their comments 

would certainly be -- would be disclosed under the 

Government's view.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Are there any examples that 

you have?  That is, in the last 35 years, has there been 

any instance where the Justice Department or some other 

law enforcement agency compiled a file for law 

enforcement purposes, that in that file there were, for 

whatever reasons, a bunch of conversations about the 

organization's strategy, and it did not interfere to 

release it with -- with anybody's personal privacy, but 

it might interfere with that organization's strategy, 

and so the organization, whatever it was, the NRDC or 

something, was very upset about it?

 Did you find a single example or a thousand 

examples?  Or how many examples did you find of that 

happening?

the -- one of the things that has puzzled us in this 

case is why -- why it has taken 35 years -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, one reason might be 

that this has really never been a problem because all 

the legitimate -- or most of them, anyway -- that these 

organizations that have interests in privacy are 

actually taken care of by the other 17 exemptions here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Another reason might be 

that personal -- nobody ever thought that personal 

privacy would cover this.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  This may be the first one. 

That's why I want to know, is there -- one of the things 

you would have looked for is an example of a real 

problem of the kind you're talking about.  I'm not 

saying you don't have one.  I would just like to know if 

you found any, and what they are, so I could read them.

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Your Honor, we haven't found 

anything specific to the -- in response to your 

question.

 But I -- I will say that one of the 

explanations for why this issue has become more 

important today than maybe it has been in recent past -­

there really are three reasons.  One is that Exemption 

4, which Mr. Yang discussed, has been increasingly 

narrowed by the courts of appeals to the point where

they specifically say, and, indeed, the Government 

concedes, that -- that the reputational concerns and the 

harm to customer goodwill is not the sort of harm that 

Exemption 4 guards against.

 And so that has become increasingly clear 

among the courts of appeals, that the interests in 

confidentiality that we're talking about under exception 

7(C) are not -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, one possible reason 

you don't find them is because it's very rare that a law 

enforcement agency is going to try to subpoena the top 

strategy of the -- of the NRDC, confidential strategy. 

There might not be too many such records.

 It -- another reason might be is that they 

don't really care.  Another reason might be -- I don't 

know.

 But if you haven't found any examples, what 

we're back to -- or -- and maybe there are actual 

examples of that -- of what you said to Justice Ginsburg 

of the other instance, where the -- what was that first 

one?

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I'd like to know about the 

example.  What was the first one again?

was comments -- comments about a regulator or -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  They're worried about 

saying something mean about a regulator.  Okay.  Yes, 

fine.  Are there examples of that?  Is this the first 

one, and what's the empirical state?

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Your Honor, it's a -- I 

cannot point you to specific examples.  They're -­

they're sort of hard to -- hard to find in the -- in the 

sense that they are -- that they're not typically 

litigated, and they certainly haven't been litigated 

under -- under this -- under this exemption before.

 But -- but I think the other explanation for 

why this matters today in a way that it might not have 

mattered so much before, two -- two other reasons:  One 

is that -- that increasingly, FOIA is being used by -­

by competitors and legal adversaries to obtain 

information, not about what the government is doing, not 

about what the government is up to, but about what 

evidence the government might have gathered from private 

parties.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that a reason to 

change what was the understanding of Exemption 7?  One 

of the items that doesn't work in your favor was the 

Attorney General's memorandum at the time of the '74 

amendments.

MR. KLINEBERG:  Well, actually, Justice 

Ginsburg, at the time of the '74 amendments the only 

existing Attorney General memorandum was that of 

Attorney General Clark, which read "personal privacy" -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm talking about the --

Attorney General Levi.

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Right, and that -- that was 

issued subsequent to the amendments in 1974, and that 

was an -- an interpretive gloss on the recent 

amendments.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, that's what I meant.

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Right.  And so at the time 

that Congress enacted the amendments, both under the 

Privacy Act as well as Exemption 7(C), the -- the only 

existing statement about what personal privacy might 

mean would be -- would have been Attorney General 

Clark's understanding that personal privacy can in fact 

incorporate interests of corporations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But if Attorney General 

Levi's description, which was -- which was issued for 

the purpose of telling all the agencies of the Federal 

Government what this new statute meant -- and it had a 

lot of ambiguities in it -- if that was wrong about -­

about this subject, you'd have thought somebody would 

have objected.

I mean, did some members of Congress who -­

who had passed FOIA say this is outrageous; what about 

the personal privacy of General Motors?  I'm not aware 

of any objections along those lines.

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Well, Your Honor, the --

Attorney General Levi's memorandum did not go into a 

long discussion or description of the -- of the 

analysis.  It simply said it does not appear or does not 

seem to apply to -- to corporations.  And it's 

absolutely true.  There -- this is not -- this issue 

hasn't -- hasn't really been litigated and presented.

 But our position is that there is nothing in 

the plain language that would indicate that Congress 

intended to categorically exclude corporations.  It is 

certainly true that the legislative history at the time, 

as the Government spends quite a bit of time exploring, 

does suggest that what was -- what was in most people's 

minds was protection of individual privacy.  But there 

is no indication that they intended to exclude -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it the burden of the

corporations, or is it your burden to show that this

our burden is to -- is to defend our view of the

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but if you're asking 

the Government to show that the -- there was an intent 

to exclude corporations, I don't think that's their 

burden.  I think it's your burden to show that this 

exemption was intended to include corporations.

 MR. KLINEBERG:  I agree, Your Honor, that we 

are -- our burden is to demonstrate to you why the words 

"personal privacy" in the statute apply to corporations. 

I think one of the background facts is that there is no 

indication that anyone thought that it was not to be 

included.  But let me -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, your 

central argument is that because "person" is defined to 

include corporation, "personal" in the same statute must 

include corporate.

 I tried to sit down and come up with other 

examples where the adjective was very different from the 

root noun.  And it turns out it's not hard at all.  You 

have "craft" and "crafty."  Totally different.  "Crafty" 

doesn't have much to do with "craft."  "Squirrel," 

"squirrelly."  Right?

 (Laughter.)

you have a "pastor" and "pastoral."  Same root, totally 

different.

 So I don't understand -- I don't think 

there's much to the argument that because "person" means 

one thing, "personal" has to be the same relation.

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, let me 

try to explain precisely what our proposed rule of 

construction is, because I think there's been some 

confusion, and I -- and I think the Government has -­

has not properly characterized it, and certainly in 

their reply brief.

 We do not agree -- or we do not sign on to 

the term "grammatical imperative," because our concern 

with that phrase is that it might suggest that the rule 

is to be applied regardless of the consequences, and 

that is not our position.

 Our position is that where the adjective 

means "of or relating to" a term that Congress has 

expressly defined, that definition should be applied, so 

long as it makes sense to do so in light of the text and 

structure of the statute as a whole.

 So, in this case, Your Honor, "personal" 

does -- is defined -- when you open up the dictionary, 

the very first definition is "of or relating to a 

particular person."  "Person" is, then, defined by

Congress as -- to include not only individuals, but -­

but corporations and other associations.

 So in this particular context, it makes 

perfect sense to look to -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Klineberg, you have 

read the brief of the Project on Government Oversight, 

where they give dozens and dozens of examples to show 

that, overwhelmingly, "personal" is used to describe an 

individual, not an artificial being.  And it is the 

overwhelming use of "personal."

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Justice Ginsburg, we do not 

dispute that personal is often, even many, many times, 

used to describe an individual and can only be 

understood in that context.  Indeed, the Truth in 

Lending Act argument that the Government made in its 

reply brief is a perfect example.  The word "personal" 

there is -- is mentioned alongside "personal," "family," 

and "household."

 And, indeed, even in that very same 

statutory definition of "consumer," the word is referred 

to as "a natural person."  So, in that context, it would 

be absurd or inappropriate to -- to borrow the concept 

of the definition of "person."

 All we're saying is when it is not absurd, 

when it is not -- does not do violence to the statute,

under those circumstances, it makes perfect sense to 

borrow the definition that Congress provided.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What would be similar to 

medical files and such, under Exemption 6, that uses the 

same phrase, "unwanted invasion on personal privacy"? 

So what would your reading do to Exemption 6, and how 

would we create or even make sense of Exemption 6?

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Your Honor, we don't believe 

our reading does any -- any damage to this Court's 

jurisprudence in Exemption 6, and the -- and the simple 

reason is that while the words "personal privacy" in 

Exemption 6 do mean -- and we agree with the Attorney 

General Clark in this -- do mean that -- that -- the 

same thing as it means in Exemption 7(C), but because -­

precisely for the reason you said, Justice Sotomayor -­

the personnel and medical and similar files limits the 

likely scope of that privacy interest to individual, 

natural -- natural persons.  And that's simply not 

because of the words "personal privacy," but because of 

the company that those words keep in that -- in that 

particular exemption.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why?  I mean, if you're 

saying that personal privacy has some overlap with 

individual privacy -- obviously, it has to if you're 

going to give meaning to personal privacy -- don't we

have to give meaning to "and similar files"?  And so 

what would those be?

 MR. KLINEBERG:  Well, Your Honor, as this 

Court said in the Washington Post case, the 

understanding of "similar files" is defined by the two 

benchmarks that are expressly provided, right? 

Personnel and medical.  So the kinds of files are 

limited to the sorts of files in which individual 

information is likely to be contained.  In that case, it 

was a passport file.

 Again, our -- our argument is simply that 

it's that part of Exemption 6 that does the limiting 

work in terms of its scope.  The words "personal 

privacy" mean the same thing in Exemption 6 as -- as 

they do in Exemption 7(C).

 The -- the other point that I -- I certainly 

want to make clear is that our position is that personal 

privacy is only the first step in the determination 

whether or not a particular document is disclosed, 

because if the Government prevails, there will be no 

need even to articulate a public interest in the 

disclosure of potentially harmful documents.  Instead, 

they will be automatically available to any competitor 

or legal adversary.

 And all we are asking for and, indeed, all

that Congress provided for is that the privacy interest 

be weighed against the public interest in disclosure. 

And what the -- what the FCC did here was to 

categorically exclude corporations from the protections 

of Exemption 7(C).  And -- and all we are saying is that 

those interests are legitimate and just need to be 

balanced.  And what the government's obligations under 

these circumstances are is that they need to weigh the 

private interests in -- in the documents against the 

articulated public interest in disclosure.  And that 

interest, of course, has to do with what the government 

is up to.  What do these documents tell us about what 

the government is doing?

 And if, as the amici on the Government's 

side suggests, there are lots of public -- lots of 

public value and public interest in the disclosure, then 

that balance is more likely to be weighed in favor of 

disclosure.  And all we are asking for, though, is that 

that balance take place.  And what's happened here is 

that -- is, as I said; it's a categorical exclusion that 

simply is inconsistent with the terms that Congress laid 

out in exemption 7(C).

 Congress did not intend for FOIA to be a 

tool for an organization's adversaries to obtain access 

to harmful or embarrassing documents compiled for law

enforcement purposes where such documents do nothing to 

open agency action to public scrutiny.  If the 

Government has its way in this case, the result will be 

what this Court decried in Favish, which was that it 

would be the failure to protect the privacy of citizens 

against the uncontrolled release of information compiled 

through the power of the state.

 If there are no further questions, I urge 

that the -- that the Third Circuit be affirmed.  Thank

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. YANG:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 AT&T appears to have changed or at least 

modified its position somewhat from the position 

articulated at page 14 of its brief.  There AT&T 

says, "By expressly defining the noun 'person' to 

include corporations, Congress necessarily defined the 

adjective form of that noun -- 'personal' -- also to 

include corporations."

 Now, AT&T has given up on the grammatical 

imperative that guided exclusively the court of appeals' 

decision in this case.  There's nothing left.  AT&T can

provide no example where the term "personal privacy" has 

ever been used to refer to a corporation, much less a 

foreign government or State or local government in any 

context, whether it be FOIA, the law generally, or even 

in common usage.

 AT&T can provide no example of any problems 

that have arisen in over 35 years of the government's 

consistent administration of this provision.  In fact, 

all indications point in simply one direction.  Personal 

privacy applies only to individuals.  The terms 

"personal" and the terms "privacy" do that alone.  And, 

together, "personal privacy makes" that clear.

 The legislative history, the decisions of 

this Court pointing to the balance applying only to 

individuals, individual rights.  All point in the same 

direction.
