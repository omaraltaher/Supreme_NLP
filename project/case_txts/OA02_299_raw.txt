CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 02-299, Entergy Louisiana versus Louisiana


Public Service Commission.


Mr. Carpenter.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. CARPENTER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. CARPENTER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


In multistate power systems, each retail rake -Â­


ratemaking body has incentives to impose cost allocations


that benefit its residents, and the only way to assure


that the power pool recovers a hundred percent of its


generating costs is for a neutral body to referee disputes 

among the States and to fix the allocations.


This case arises in the energy system where five


subsidiaries provide retail service in four different


States, where FERC has found that Entergy's cost


allocations generally can't affect its net revenues and


where FERC has thus approved a tariff that gives Entergy


authority to calculate the inter-company equalization


payments that allocate costs with a FERC complaint as the


sole remedy if the rates and allocations are believed to


be unlawful.

 Though we --


QUESTION:  What is -- what is the source of the


rule that this is the sole remedy?


MR. CARPENTER:  It's the sole remedy under the


tariff itself, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  The -- so the tariff itself provides


that.


MR. CARPENTER:  Yes.  Under the tariff itself,


the only right that is reserved to the -- this is section


4.12, joint appendix 11a.  The only right that is reserved


to the operating companies is to seek amend -- if there's


a dispute over the rates, is to seek amendments in the


tariff or changes in the rate from the regulatory body


that has jurisdiction.


There's no question here that the LPSC doesn't 

have jurisdiction to order amendments to the service


schedule or changes in the rates.  Their claim is only


that they can disallow the costs that were incurred.


QUESTION:  Is -- is the tariff provision meant


to preclude any sort of a judicial remedy?


MR. CARPENTER:  Yes, it would preclude a


judicial remedy.  It operates as a -- as a -- as,


obviously, a limitation on the operating companies'


remedies and as a forum selection clause in the event of a


dispute.

 QUESTION:  Well, there would be a judicial


remedy if they disagreed with the -- with -- with FERC's


determination.  They could -- they could appeal that to


the court.


MR. CARPENTER:  Oh, absolutely, Your Honor.  I'm


sorry.  I --


QUESTION:  They just couldn't go straight to the


court.


MR. CARPENTER:  Yes.  No, I'm sorry, Your Honor. 


I -- I meant that they can't go -- they couldn't go


straight to court, and it means that -- for the same


reason that a State retail ratemaking body can't disallow


the costs because under -- under this rate schedule, the


rate calculated by the energy system is the filed rate and


binds everybody unless and until a complaint is filed with 

FERC and FERC holds otherwise.


And in fact, the Louisiana commission here


brought a complaint for the period ending in August of


1997, and FERC denied relief on the ground that although


the tariff didn't authorize it, it was just and --


nonetheless just and reasonable for Entergy to calculate


equalization payments by including certain units that were


in extended reserve status because FERC found that those


units benefited Louisiana and the entire system.


QUESTION:  Can I ask?  The -- the section of

the -- of the agreement that you -- you referred us to,


4.12.  It says each company reserves the right to


unilaterally seek amendments or changes from any


regulatory body having or acquiring jurisdiction


thereover.  Why didn't they just say from FERC?


MR. CARPENTER:  Well, at the time this --


QUESTION:  I mean, if as you say it's only FERC,


why didn't they just say from FERC?


MR. CARPENTER:  Well, it was -- it was fairly


prescient because this -- this language I think dates from


1953, when there was the Federal Power Commission.  So,


it --


QUESTION:  Oh, I see.  I see.  Yes.


MR. CARPENTER:  But the -- the key thing here is


that it's undisputed that the LPSC can't amend the 

service agreement.


QUESTION:  Got you.  No.  I was just wondering


whether --


MR. CARPENTER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- that was so clear to the parties


at the time, and you say it is and -- and what they --


what they were anticipating is a change in the Federal --


MR. CARPENTER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- body that had jurisdiction.


MR. CARPENTER:  Right.

 QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. CARPENTER:  But -- but in the aftermath of


the FERC order that found that these charges were just and


reasonable, despite a finding of the tariff violation, the


Louisiana commission entered an order that said that


FERC's determination bound it only for the precise period


that FERC had addressed, and then entered an order that


prohibited the petitioner, Entergy Louisiana, ELI, from


recovering the same wholesale costs in retail rates for


the immediately succeeding period, beginning August 5th,


1977.


QUESTION:  Could -- could you explain one thing


to me?  And that is, why was the period so defined?  Is it


simply that it was, with respect to that period, that


actual figures were introduced before FERC?


MR. CARPENTER:  That became the period because


that was the date of the FERC order.


QUESTION:  The date of the --


MR. CARPENTER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And so, in effect, that -- FERC was


done with it at that --


MR. CARPENTER:  Yes.  That was the -- that was


the -- the theory --

Commission.


QUESTION:  Was there any question in the terms


of the order that the order was intended to operate


prospectively until FERC changed it?


MR. CARPENTER:  Oh, no.  No question at all.


QUESTION:  So the difference is unlike a filed


rate, which is a number, here is not a precise number.


MR. CARPENTER:  That's right.  Here the filed


rate is a formula that is --


QUESTION:  And it -- and it's going to change


constantly.


MR. CARPENTER:  That's right.  It can change --


it can change I believe monthly, or the -- the rate


calculated under the formula can change monthly.  And --


and FERC approves formula rates, you know, in 

circumstances where it believes that it will better


promote the overall goals of -- of the act, and it imposes


terms and conditions that will assure that the overall


goals of the act are promoted.


And here a critical term and condition was that


the determinations of the amount of the payments is


centralized at FERC and the only remedy, if there's a


disagreement, is to go to FERC and file a complaint.  As I


point out, that's clear from the terms of the tariff, and


that's what FERC said in each of the orders in which it

authorized the formula rates.


QUESTION:  But it -- from the point of view of


the public service commission, they have to approve the


local rates periodically, and how does the timing of the


thing work?  If the public service commission has to go to


FERC and then there's a proceeding, and by that time the


year is over.


MR. CARPENTER:  Yes.  But the -- if FERC were to


agree with the public service commission that we violated


the tariff, that the result was unjust and unreasonable


and a refund was appropriate, all the interests would be


protected because the -- they would order a refund at the


wholesale level with interest that the Louisiana Public


Service Commission could flow through to retail rate


papers -- rate payers.


QUESTION:  Well, wait, wait.  How would -- how


would the Louisiana Public Service Commission have


standing to come to FERC?  I mean, to come back to the


agreement, it says each company -- the companies who are


parties to the agreement -- reserves the right to


unilaterally seek amendments or changes.


MR. CARPENTER:  Yes.  Well, they have standing


under the act itself.  Section 305 I believe it is.


QUESTION:  So this provision doesn't govern what


they can seek then.

 MR. CARPENTER:  No.  But -- but they -- but --


but what it does mean is that they cannot premise a -- a


prudence disallowance on the ground that -- that ELI could


have refused to pay the costs or -- or required that the


equalization payments be calculated on a different basis.


QUESTION:  Well, sure, they can.  They could say


the company was at fault for not going to FERC.


MR. CARPENTER:  Yes.  But -- but -- sure, they


could say that.  It was imprudent not to go to FERC.  But


they can't speculate about what FERC would do in the event


a complaint was filed.  That's clear from the Arkansas


Louisiana Gas case of this Court.  So while it's


theoretically possible they could say that it was


imprudent not to go to FERC, no remedy could be predicated


on that finding of imprudence because they can't speculate 

about what FERC would do if a complaint were filed.


QUESTION:  But can they go to FERC as an


intervenor?  I --


MR. CARPENTER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- I take it that was their status.


MR. CARPENTER:  Absolutely, absolutely.


QUESTION:  So they could go in and say, look,


they should have complained --


MR. CARPENTER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- and therefore you should do what

you would have done if they had complained.


MR. CARPENTER:  Absolutely.  They can do that. 


And the point I was trying to make to Justice Ginsburg is


it -- when that procedure is followed, all legitimate


interests are protected because if FERC agrees and orders


a refund, it will be -- it can then be flowed through by


the Louisiana Commission to the retail ratepayers.


Conversely, under their procedure in which they


can disallow costs pending a FERC determination on the


precise -- on the precise issue, you have exactly the --


the interference with commerce that the Federal Power Act


was designed to prevent.  You've got duplicative


litigation of this issue.  Here in -- could be in five


different retail ratemaking bodies.


And the effect can be a trapping of costs that 

we never get back because if FERC -- you know, they --


they trap the costs pending the FERC order.  FERC then


says -- reviews it and says what we did was fine, just and


reasonable.  Then obviously FERC doesn't do anything at


the wholesale level.  In the meantime, our costs have been


trapped at the retail level, and we can't get the money


back under the general rule barring retroactive ratemaking


unless an exception were somehow made to that rule.


QUESTION:  Well, what is the function and


province of the State commission's prudence review?

What -- what can they do that's proper?  And I assume they


can do a number of things that increase costs and


therefore change rates, or am I wrong about that?


MR. CARPENTER:  Well, what they -- what they can


do is they can regulate the -- the prudence of -- of


decisions that the -- the utility had to make.  So in


circumstances where a FERC tariff provides a choice to


the -- to the retail utility, which was the situation in


the Pike County case, then -- then the -- the State


commission can find that it was imprudent to exercise the


choice in one fashion or another.


But the point here is there was no choice.  The


equalization payment bound the -- bound ELI unless and


until it was found to be unlawful by -- by FERC.  So this


is a situation where under the filed rate doctrine and 

under this Court's decisions in MP&L and Nantahala, the --


the State commission was required to treat the resulting


expense as a retail -- as a just and reasonable expense


and pass it through to retail ratepayers unless and until


FERC ordered otherwise.


There's obviously a range of other issues that


aren't -- aren't governed by FERC rate schedules at all,


as to which State utility commissions can examine the


reasonableness of the decisions of the -- of the retail


body.  But they can't say that -- that following your

duties under a FERC tariff is unjust and unreasonable. 


That's a question for FERC.


QUESTION:  In -- in the course of that regular


examination that they -- that they do, can they find


certain actions that require refunds to the -- to the


consumers?


MR. CARPENTER:  Oh, absolutely, Your Honor. 


Absolutely, Your Honor.  They can disallow -- they


disallow charitable expenses.  They disallow expenses all


the time.  There's a citation --


QUESTION:  But never if it's in violation of a


tariff or a FERC policy?


MR. CARPENTER:  Right.  They cannot, consistent


with the Federal Power Act, say that it was imprudent to


do -- to -- to do what the FERC tariff required the 

utility to do.  That's the clear teaching of MP&L and


Nantahala and -- and other decisions.


QUESTION:  Would the State commission have


authority to argue that the formula was incorrectly


applied?


MR. CARPENTER:  In the context of the retail


ratemaking proceeding?


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. CARPENTER:  No, Your Honor.  That's an


issue exclusively for FERC because, as I pointed out

before, if the rate is believed to be too high, under


the tariff, the -- the only remedy the operating company


would have would be to go to FERC and -- and complain,


and the operating company has -- has no -- no right to


refuse to make a payment on the ground that there's an


allegation that the equalization formula was improperly


implied.


But as I -- as I just said, the filed rate


doctrine clearly, you know, prohibited the order here, and


even if it didn't apply, this is an issue that -- the


issue of the -- the reasonableness of rates and the


practices affecting rates is an issue that the Federal


Power Act clearly allocates to FERC.  So even if the


tariff here didn't, you know, clearly preclude ELI from


doing what the LPSC found a prudent company would have 

done, the -- the filed -- the Federal Power Act preempted


the -- the State from addressing the issue.


And the facts of this case sort of illustrate


why States shouldn't get involved in -- in this because


the decision that was made here sort of exemplifies the


parochialism that the Commerce Clause and the Federal


Power Act was designed to prevent.  It was acknowledged by


the Louisiana Public Service Commission that the -- the


units in question, the out-of-state units in question,


benefited Louisiana and the entire system, increased the

efficiency of the entire system.  But it said that was


irrelevant.  In fact, it said that was evidence of


imprudence because the effect was to increase the costs


that ELI incurred and thus to increase retail rates, and


that's a -- the kind of parochialism that the


Commerce Clause prevents and the Federal Power Act was


designed to draw a bright line that would eliminate any


need to even adjudicate questions whether the conduct


violates the Federal --


QUESTION:  Well, what's left of public service


commissions then, if -- if you're right, so far as


policing imprudent acquisitions and that sort of thing


for a multi -- multistate company?


MR. CARPENTER:  Well, they -- they can't


regulate issues involving, you know, the exchanges 

of power within power pools, but there are a range


of other issues that, as I said in response to


Justice Kennedy's question, that the States can --


can decide.


QUESTION:  Such as.


MR. CARPENTER:  Well, the -- you know,


whether -- whether expenses not dictated by a FERC -- FERC


rate schedule are just and reasonable.  There's a whole


range of other expenses that --


QUESTION:  The cost of -- the cost of power is

just one of the -- one of the --


MR. CARPENTER:  Yes, just one of the expenses


that a retail utility would incur.  And -- and so there's


a range of issues that they can decide.  What they can't


do, though, is -- is decide that it was imprudent to incur


a cost that a FERC rate schedule required the utility to


incur, and that's the issue here.


QUESTION:  Am I -- am I correct in assuming,


as I have throughout the -- reading the briefs here,


that the -- the costs that a given operating company


incurs within its power pool is essentially the same


issue as the wholesale rate that a -- that a totally


independent company might pay when it -- when it bought


wholesale off the -- the grid?  Is -- is that a -- it


seems to me in -- in each case, the operating company 

is buying power at wholesale, whether it does it within


its group or whether it does it on an open market, and


that's what in each case FERC is regulating.  Is -- is


that fair?


MR. CARPENTER:  Well -- well, FERC regulates the


transactions within power pools --


QUESTION:  And when one of those transactions


is the -- is the -- in effect, the acquisition of power by


a local operating company, that transaction is


economically, I guess, the equivalent of buying wholesale

by an independent company that is not part of a power


pool.


MR. CARPENTER:  Yes, but FERC's jurisdiction


depends on the fact that -- jurisdiction depends on the


existence of wholesale sales which -- which exist in the


context of a power pool because each retail utility is


simultaneously, you know, providing power to the pool at


the set rate.  So it's --


QUESTION:  Oh, no, I understand that.  And --


and -- but FERC also has general authority over wholesale


interstate sales.


MR. CARPENTER:  Absolutely, Your Honor. 


Absolutely, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  So that -- so that in relation to


what a -- the reason I'm getting at it is, in relation to 

what a State utilities commission can do, the State


utilities commission, I take it, is in the same position


vis-a-vis ELI that it would be if ELI were a totally


independent company buying wholesale off the grid.  Is


that correct?


MR. CARPENTER:  That's right.  If it were -- if


it were subject to the identical rate schedule.


If there are no further questions, I'd like to


save the balance of my time for rebuttal.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Carpenter.

 Mr. Schlick, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MR. SCHLICK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Under Nantahala and Mississippi Power & Light,


the regulation of wholesale rates for electric energy in


interstate commerce is exclusively within the jurisdiction


of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  Federal


jurisdiction is necessary to ensure that multistate


utilities, like Entergy and other utilities, are able to


carry out their FERC-regulated transactions, to plan and


carry out those transactions without the interference of


potentially conflicting State regulation.


The facts of this case highlight the need for


exclusive Federal regulation.  The dispute in this case


involves the correct allocation of costs incurred for the


common benefit of five utilities in four different States. 


The Louisiana commission believed that the costs allocated


to Entergy Louisiana were too high, but the consequence of


the Louisiana commission's rate decision would be to


reallocate those costs to ratepayers in Texas, Arkansas,


Mississippi or else to render them trapped and entirely


unrecoverable.

 QUESTION:  Well, does that -- is that a death


sentence, so to speak, if you find that the costs are


trapped and unrecoverable?  May not that ever happen to a


utility legitimately?


MR. SCHLICK:  That's correct, Your Honor.  Under


this Court's decision in Nantahala, a charge that is


federally approved or that is within FERC's exclusive


jurisdiction to approve may not be trapped and disallowed


by the -- by the State regulatory --


QUESTION:  You're -- you're not talking about


costs -- trapped costs generally.  You're just talking


about this particular kind of trapped cost.


MR. SCHLICK:  That's right.  I'm -- I'm talking


about costs that contribute to the wholesale rate that --


that is within FERC's jurisdiction.


QUESTION:  So the -- the problem is that -- not


that the costs would be trapped, but that FERC has said


it's not trapped.  That's -- that's the point.  I mean,


lots of utilities lose money because costs are trapped.


MR. SCHLICK:  That is -- I -- I think that --


that --


QUESTION:  So the real point is here FERC has


said they can do it.  That's -- that's the only point that


you're making, isn't it?


MR. SCHLICK:  There are two points.  There --

there is the general prohibition on trapping, but also in


this case we have a FERC-approved rate schedule that


determines how the allocation should be carried out. 


There's a question whether or not Entergy complied with


that rate schedule, but the resolution of that question


involves what the wholesale rate is or should be, and


that's a question within FERC's jurisdiction.


QUESTION:  And that's a FERC question, period.


MR. SCHLICK:  That's right.  Only FERC can


decide that question.


Unlike the cases on which respondent relies,


this case does not involve a State contract action about a


matter that is within the State's concurrent jurisdiction. 


In the first place, there is no contract dispute between


the parties in this case, the Entergy operating companies 

and the holding company.


Rather, this case arose in the same context as


Nantahala and Mississippi Power & Light, a retail rate


setting.  And the dispute involves the correct division


among the operating companies in multiple states of costs


of operating the system.  Just like Mississippi Power &


Light, that's a cost -- that's a -- a question that only


the FERC can determine.


It's worth mentioning that --


QUESTION:  Could -- could this be

characterized as a question of a reasonable interpretation


of the tariff, or you couldn't characterize the issue that


way?


MR. SCHLICK:  There -- there is a -- an


interpretation, an underlying question of interpretation,


of the tariff, but beyond that, there's the question of


whether the resulting charge was just and reasonable.  And


that's the important reasonableness question.  That's the


question that only FERC can decide.


Here the Louisiana commission assumed both that


there was a procedural violation of the system agreement


in -- in the documentation of the operating committee's


decision --


QUESTION:  But --


MR. SCHLICK: 


-- and that the resulting charge 

was unjust and unreasonable.


QUESTION:  But what Louisiana is saying, they --


they're conceding that FERC has the authority, the


exclusive authority, to prescribe what the division would


be.  However, they're saying if, in fact, there's a


violation of that division, the States ought to be able to


adjudicate the violation.  They're still giving FERC all


of -- all of its power.  They're saying FERC decides what


the division will be, but the State agency can determine


that the division has not been carried out the way FERC

prescribed.


What is there in the act that -- that says that


FERC is the exclusive adjudicator of whether its


directives have been complied with?


MR. SCHLICK:  In the context of what the


wholesale charge is or should be, the provision of the act


is section 824d and -- and 824e.  The underlying principle


was established by this Court's decision in Attleboro,


which is that States are entirely disabled from regulating


wholesale rates.  That was implemented through the Federal


Power Act in 1935.  It was confirmed in this Court's


decision --


QUESTION:  They're not regulating the


wholesale rates is what -- is the argument that will


be made by the State. 


They're -- they're leaving it to 

FERC to regulate it, but they're adjudicating whether


the rates prescribed by -- by FERC have, in fact, been


the rates charged.


MR. SCHLICK:  Justice Scalia, in fact, they


were regulating the wholesale charge.  The necessary


determination of the Louisiana commission's order was


that the costs pass through under the Federal rate


schedule to Entergy Louisiana.  The specific costs


allocated on the rate schedule were too high.  It was


imprudent in the Louisiana commission's judgment for

Entergy Louisiana --


QUESTION:  I thought the Court said in


Mississippi Power & Light that once FERC sets a wholesale


rate, a State may not conclude in setting retail rates


that the FERC-approved wholesale rates are unreasonable.


MR. SCHLICK:  That -- That's correct.  The --


QUESTION:  So I guess that's the law, isn't it?


MR. SCHLICK:  -- the only additional step that


need be taken in this -- in this case is to determine


whether the fact that there is a dispute as to whether or


not the FERC rate schedule was violated somehow puts the


case within the State's jurisdiction.  That was the


question that only FERC can answer.


QUESTION:  But how is that different from the


State determining that a retail rate is unreasonable? 

MR. SCHLICK:  We believe it's precisely the


same.


QUESTION:  So then there is nothing extra.


MR. SCHLICK:  Our -- our answer to that question


is there is no difference.


QUESTION:  So I have to see what the other side


would say.


MR. SCHLICK:  That's correct, Justice Breyer.


QUESTION:  I -- I take it you agree with


Mr. Carpenter that the State can be heard on this issue as

an intervenor who may raise the issue before FERC.  Is


that correct?


MR. SCHLICK:  Not just as an intervenor.  Under


section 825e of the act, the State could actually bring a


complaint --


QUESTION:  I see.


MR. SCHLICK:  -- to FERC.  It could bring the


issue directly to FERC.  And --


QUESTION:  In any case, it can get to FERC if it


has a gripe.


MR. SCHLICK:  The order 415 proceeding in


1997 -- that was resolved in 1997 -- shows exactly how


this should happen.  The --


QUESTION:  No, but the answer to my question is


yes, isn't it?


MR. SCHLICK:  Oh, yes, absolutely.


QUESTION:  That's all I'm -- that's all I'm --


QUESTION:  Well, it seems to me it's quite a


different question.  Question one is whether the


allocation was unreasonable, and the State here is saying


we're -- we're not questioning the reasonableness of the


allocation.  That's up to FERC.  But we don't think that


we were charged that allocation that -- that was given to


us.  And that's -- that's not challenging FERC's decision


of what the allocation should be.  It's challenging the

factual question of whether the allocation was carried out


the way FERC prescribed.


MR. SCHLICK:  Justice Scalia, the order 415


proceeding shows precisely the problem with that.  In that


case, FERC said that there was a violation of the system


agreement, analogous to the one that's being claimed here. 


But it also said that the resulting charge was just and


reasonable.  In fact, ratepayers benefited overall from


what was done by Entergy.


QUESTION:  Must be a section of the FERC rules


or regs or tariffs which says the company may -- must --


or must pass over to the company that has the higher


number of generators a charge equal to the amount, da, da,


da, that this particular thing we have before it gives the


allocation for.


MR. SCHLICK:  Well, the -- the rate schedule


has been approved --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. SCHLICK:  -- by FERC and --


QUESTION:  All right --


MR. SCHLICK:  -- there's a requirement --

MR. SCHLICK:  -- and there's a requirement to


the comply with rate schedule.

charge a rate --

MR. SCHLICK:  That's right.

other side.  I don't see any room for the question that


was just raised.


MR. SCHLICK:  If the Court has no further


questions.


QUESTION:  I -- I do.  I mean, what -- what


happens if the -- the State says, they haven't charged it


according to that allocation?


QUESTION:  Then Mississippi --


QUESTION:  Well, let counsel answer.


(Laughter.)


MR. SCHLICK:  Justice Scalia, what -- what


happens is then the question becomes was the resulting


charge just and reasonable.  In order 415, FERC determined


the resulting charge after a violation of the rate


schedule was just and reasonable.  In fact, ratepayers in


Louisiana benefited from what Entergy did, notwithstanding


that it wasn't in compliance with the terms of the rate


schedule at that time.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Schlick.


Mr. Fontham, we'll hear from you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. FONTHAM


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. FONTHAM:  Thank you.  Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The issue in this case is the following.  The


FERC approved a contract amendment that established


conditions, procedures before a utility could bill an


affiliate for units in mothballs.  The utility failed to


follow the procedures, failed to consider the conditions,


and failed to record the decision in its minutes, as it


was required to do, and then said to the LPSC --


QUESTION:  We're -- we're within about 15 feet


of you, Mr. Fontham.  You don't have to speak up.


(Laughter.)


MR. FONTHAM: 


Thank you, Your Honor. 

And then said to the LPSC, you must take the


charges anyway.


QUESTION:  Yes, I think that's right under the


law, isn't it?


MR. FONTHAM:  No, it's not, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Because?


MR. FONTHAM:  Because the issue in this case is


a drastic departure from what this Court held in MP&L or


in Nantahala.  In that --


QUESTION:  Because?  Okay, that's exactly --

 MR. FONTHAM:  In those cases --


QUESTION:  Yes.  To get the question very


precise, that is the question.  In MP&L, it said once FERC


sets a rate, which means, I take it, that they have the


terms that we've just described in the tariffs, a State


may not conclude in setting retail rates that the


FERC-approved rates are unreasonable.


MR. FONTHAM:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  All right.  Now, what's the


difference between that and what you just said?


MR. FONTHAM:  The -- the difference is that the


FERC set the rate.  The utility couldn't bill for the


units because it hadn't gone through the procedure under


the FERC rate.  The utility billed anyway.  It says if the


rate said 5, the utility sends a bill for 10.  10 shows up


in the retail rate case.


The question is, can the State agency, looking


at the FERC tariff and looking at what the utility billed,


make the decision, instead of the utility making the


decision, in the State proceeding that it's wrong.


QUESTION:  That's the question --


QUESTION:  Maybe -- maybe it can if FERC has not


previously adjudicated that very question.


MR. FONTHAM:  And it hasn't.


QUESTION:  I mean, here what -- what they're

contending is that FERC not only prescribed the formula,


but that in order 415, it adjudicated that the formula had


been properly applied or, if improperly applied, close


enough for Government work is what they said.  And once


they decided that, their contention is, it's not up to the


State to second-guess them.


MR. FONTHAM:  Well, Your Honor, I don't -- that


may be what they're saying, but that's not what happened


in the case.  The -- in the case the FERC did refuse to


order refunds.  It held that the utility had invalidly


exercised its, quote/unquote, discretion to violate a


clear and ambiguous tariff for 10 years.


Then it said, we're going to have a new tariff. 


We're going to curb the utilities' discretion.  We're


going to require the utility to have a procedure.  We were


saying it is too -- it was too vague, but no, no.  The


utilities said, our discretion will be curbed.  The FERC


said, their discretion will be curbed.  The Court of


Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said their discretion will be


curbed.


QUESTION:  Didn't FERC -- didn't FERC also say


that the rates that had resulted during the period prior


to the amendment were just and reasonable rates?


MR. FONTHAM:  The FERC said that looking


retroactively, in effect, retroactively --

 QUESTION:  Absolutely.  They're looking


retroactively.


MR. FONTHAM:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  And having done so, and having set


the rate, how then is a State utilities commission, in


effect, able to go behind that determination?


MR. FONTHAM:  Because the costs that were


incurred and are at issue here -- actually, I lost that


issue before the LPSC.  The LPSC, as to all the charges up


until August 1997, said since the FERC retroactively


effectively changed the filed rate -- I don't know how


they can do that, but they did -- they retroactively


approved a new filed rate.  You -- we can't touch that.


Then the LPSC said, okay, now we've got a new


contract amendment that operates prospectively.  And what


does it require?  Take a look at what it requires.  This


was in -- litigated issue.  And the LPSC says, well, they


didn't follow the conditions again.


QUESTION:  But wait.  Can you please go back and


explain to me my question?


MR. FONTHAM:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  To use your example --


MR. FONTHAM:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  -- we have, I mean, it sounds to me


that what you're saying is a revolution in rate conditions

or setting in the United States.  I've always understood


it to be, because of the sentence of MPL that I read to


you, that if FERC says we have a piece of paper here that


either directly or through a formula makes clear that $5


of your cost, your total cost for the consumer, is correct


way to determine an interstate part of it, then when the


local commission looks at the $10 rate to the consumer, it


can do what it wants, but it has to take that $5 as a


given.


MR. FONTHAM:  We did that.


QUESTION:  Now, if the commission thinks that


the $5 that the company put on its line as part of the


interstate payment did not comply with every condition,


did not satisfy the law because it was unjust and


unreasonable, their remedy is to go to FERC and to say, 

FERC, they didn't comply with your conditions.  They


let -- got an unreasonable rate.  That the commission's


remedy -- the local commission -- is not to readjudicate


that itself.


And the -- the legal authority for what I've


just said I've always thought was the sentence I read to


you out of MP&L.  Now, where am I wrong in that?


MR. FONTHAM:  You are wrong, Your Honor, in


this.  MP&L says that the State commission has to take


the 5.  If the tariff says 5, it has to take the 5.

 QUESTION:  That's what I said.


MR. FONTHAM:  We're dealing with the


extra 5 here.  We're dealing with the overcharge, the


overbilling, the violation of the contract.


QUESTION:  The extra 5.  Now, I thought what we


were dealing with here was a formula set out by what I


used to call the FPC, which -- which formula said that


the 5 is made up of many things.  One of those things is


a charge that the Louisiana company is to pay to a company


in a different State to reflect the fact that that company


in the different State has generators in reserve capacity


that serve everybody, and among those generators are


generators that were put in mothballs provided that they


noted in the minutes of the joint company, et cetera that


this is a mothballed generator available for reserve 

capacity if necessary.


All right, and if I understand it correctly and


I've said it correctly, then the cost at issue here is


part of the 5, not part of the other 5.


MR. FONTHAM:  I'll give you that, Your Honor. 


The -- but the -- but the problem and the difference is


that -- there was a little more in the tariff condition. 


It said you have to have a plan to return the unit to


service.


QUESTION:  Yes.

 MR. FONTHAM:  Did they have that?  No.  It


said --


QUESTION:  No, but now we're repeating because


I -- I just said that if you think that the minutes were


not filled, if you think one of the other conditions that


was put forth in that particular tariff, which I guess


is -- what is -- page 57 or something of the -- of -- but


if you think one of those was not fulfilled, then your


remedy is to go to the FPC -- the FERC rather.


MR. FONTHAM:  And then -- and that poses the


question beautifully because we're in a State ratemaking


proceeding and now we know the question.  Does the State


get to interpret the tariff and decide what it means and


what it says, or does the utility?  Because the FERC is


not here to tell us. 


So the question is, what goes into 

rates today?  The utility's decision based on a violation


of the tariff which was litigated through the Louisiana


courts?  They got to eat the cake, but now they're back


because they didn't like the taste of the cake, to put


it --


QUESTION:  Mr. Fontham, I'm a little confused on


who is the they because my understanding was that the


Louisiana company, ELI, had no say in this, that it was


the Entergy, the -- the holding company -- the -- for all


of these five companies, that gave the instructions.  And

it wasn't as though ELI could say, well, we think you


allocated too much to us.  You're making us pay too much. 


The -- each unit is bound by what Entergy says.  So the


they seems to me to be Entergy, but the Louisiana Public


Service Commission has only ELI before it.


MR. FONTHAM:  That's true, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  So how can it say that ELI was at


fault for something that ELI is locked into by virtue of


being part of this multistate --


MR. FONTHAM:  What -- what the commission says


is that ELI is at fault in the sense of any utility, going


back to -- to Justice Souter's reference to two


independent companies in a wholesale power transaction. 


Now, we all know you can go to court to enforce a


wholesale tariff, and that's where most people go. 

In the case of a parent-subsidiary relationship,


well, obviously the parent gets to tell the subsidiary


what to do.  That's true in everything.  It's true of many


cost allocations that we see.  We see hundreds of millions


of dollars of cost allocations coming into Louisiana based


on Entergy's decisions under innumerable types of


allocation schemes, including the Federal tariff.


And ELI has an obligation, even though it's


owned by a parent, to make sure the parent follows the


terms of the tariff, just as the wholesale buyer of

argument.  Is this what it is?  That you'd -- imagine we


have a Federal FERC rule, and it says you can include in


your -- in your charge to the wholesale company the charge


of sending a salesman to the foreign State to tell him


about your product.  All right?  And now we have -- now we


have -- you go before the State commission and the company


says, and it costs me $117 to send Mr. Smith to do that.


And you want to say, I, of course, am forbidden


from arguing to you, the State commission, that they


violated the tariff.  But I can tell you that this


salesman, named Murphy, actually spent most of his time in


a chicken restaurant, and therefore, what he did for that


117 fell outside the tariff. 


It didn't violate the 

tariff.  It fell outside the tariff.


And similarly, you want to say here that the


cost of the generator in mothballs did not violate the


tariff to include it, but rather fell outside the tariff


because they never had the minutes, et cetera.  Is that


what you're arguing?


MR. FONTHAM:  I'm arguing both, Your Honor,


because --


QUESTION:  Well, what's both?  If you say --


MR. FONTHAM:  Well --

 QUESTION:  If you say you're arguing it violated


the tariff, you have an additional problem which is that


the Louisiana Public Service Commission itself said that


the staff wants us to say this violated the FERC tariff,


but we have no power to do that.


MR. FONTHAM:  No.  That -- that was as to the


refunds.  That was as to the period going up to 1996.


QUESTION:  No.  No.


MR. FONTHAM:  But -- but, Your Honor, let me --


let me take this and put it in -- in context here.  When a


State commission decides issues of intrastate ratemaking,


it decides all kinds of questions of Federal law.  It has


to decide what the Internal Revenue Code requires.  It has


to decide what the consolidated tax return provides for. 


It has to decide SEC allocations that are filed with the 

SEC.


So along comes a situation that's completely


within its expertise.  What does a FERC tariff require? 


And it makes so many decisions involving millions and


millions of dollars in which it -- it decides as -- as any


other State court.  You apply Federal law, you apply State


law.  It's the whole body of law that you're dealing with.


QUESTION:  Except that FERC specifically


addressed this question.


MR. FONTHAM:  No, Your Honor.  The FERC did not

address this question.  This is tariff 2.  Tariff 1 the


FERC did address and it said the utility violated the


tariff.


Now we're on tariff 2, and tariff 2 was


designed, according to the FERC, to curb the utility's


discretion.  And -- and that tariff 2, designed to curb


the utility's discretion, the utility then immediately


proceeded to ignore.  And even in their reply brief, they


say, we did nothing more than we ever did before.  That's


on the first page of their reply brief.


QUESTION:  But isn't the way to look at the


problem this way?  FERC says you may charge a certain


tariff.  We're not coming up with the actual number now --


MR. FONTHAM:  No.


QUESTION: 


-- because it depends on facts that 

will vary over time.  You may -- we -- we are approving a


tariff.  You supply the number and you must supply the


number according to certain conditions.  And what the


Louisiana commission is now saying is, the number that you


supplied was a number that violates those conditions.


MR. FONTHAM:  Right.  That's true.


QUESTION:  The fact remains that on the face of


it, FERC has said, if you come up with the number, that's


the tariff.  So if you are going to challenge that number,


aren't you, in effect, challenging a FERC determination?

And to do that, don't you have to go back to FERC and say,


they didn't follow your conditions, and therefore you,


FERC, should tell them that that number is, in fact, wrong


and they can't charge it?


MR. FONTHAM:  Your Honor --


QUESTION:  What's wrong with that analysis?


MR. FONTHAM:  -- I -- I don't think that's


correct.  I do think that your predicate is correct. 


They -- they -- the FERC gave them a tariff.  That's the


tariff.  The utility's decision doesn't become the tariff. 


It's like any contract case.  If I have a contract with


you, and I can charge you 5, and I send you a bill for 10,


that doesn't -- my 10 doesn't become the tariff.


QUESTION:  Right, except that in this case --


and -- and maybe this is where I'm going wrong.  Tell me


if I am.  In this case, I thought FERC did not say the


number is 5.


MR. FONTHAM:  Yes.  It said -- what it said


was -- is, you go through this process, step 1, step 2,


step 3 --


of that.


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. FONTHAM:  -- step 4.  The utility did none


QUESTION:  No, but -- but at the end -- but what


FERC is saying is, if -- if you go through that process,

the number you get at the end of the process is what our


tariff guarantees you to charge.


MR. FONTHAM:  Yes, that's true.


QUESTION:  And in this case, you're saying -- so


that -- so that the -- FERC is not saying what the number


is in advance.  It's setting the process in advance.


MR. FONTHAM:  Right.


QUESTION:  And what you're saying is, sure, they


came up with the number, ostensibly what FERC told them


they could do, but they didn't go through the right


process to get it, and therefore the number's no good. 


But in order to say the number is no good, you're still


challenging something which, at least on its face, has


been authorized by FERC.  And therefore, why isn't the


appropriate action for you to take, to go back to FERC and 

say, the number they're claiming under your authority is


the wrong number, tell them it's the wrong number?


MR. FONTHAM:  Okay.  I'll -- I'll answer the


last question first.  The reason the appropriate action


for the LPSC to take is not to go to FERC is because the


LPSC has the authority as part of its State ratemaking


authority, as part of State law to make --


QUESTION:  Yes, but that's the question here. 


That's the question here.


MR. FONTHAM:  That's the question.

 QUESTION:  Do they have it or is it preempted?


MR. FONTHAM:  Well, it wasn't preempted --


QUESTION:  And one question as to whether it's


preempted, I would think, would be can they go back to the


Federal ratemaker and -- and, in fact, get the relief that


they want.  That's something we ought to consider.


MR. FONTHAM:  And, Your Honor, the -- our


position is -- and I believe it's correct -- that there's


nothing in the Federal Power Act that preempts the State


from doing this, that the only FERC jurisdiction to decide


enforcement issues didn't even -- they created it in 1980


approximately.  They were told in 16 U.S.C. 825m that if


they found a violation of a tariff, they had to go to


United States District Court.


And there's nothing in the Federal Power Act. 

In fact, the Senate had a provision in the Federal Power


Act that the FERC can award remedies for violations of its


orders.  It was pulled out.


QUESTION:  In other words, they --


QUESTION:  Okay.  You're talking about the


condition today, and what you're saying today is, whenever


FERC sets a tariff that leaves the bottom line number to


be filled in later, a State utility commission in a


ratemaking proceeding may challenge that bottom line


number in its own bailiwick.

 MR. FONTHAM:  No, Your Honor.  We're saying that


if there's a tariff --


QUESTION:  I thought that's what you were doing.


MR. FONTHAM:  -- and it sets forth objective


requirements, and it -- and the utility doesn't follow


those objective requirements, then they're not entitled to


bill for the units.  That's all we're saying.  We're


not -- this is not --


QUESTION:  All that you're saying is that


Justice Souter was wrong to limit it to places where the


Federal tariff is open.  It's just as applicable to


instances where the Federal tariff is specific.  And


you're saying that Congress in the Federal Power Act set


up an act where you have a single central Federal body to


provide tariffs for, let's say, the billions and billions 

of kilowatt hours made every year, but that each State --


50 or 51 different local service commissions are going to


adjudicate whether or not those millions of words are, in


fact, violated and what we will have is 51 separate


decisionmaking bodies to determine when a FERC tariff has


been violated.


Now, I grant you Congress did not say in the


act, and we don't mean to do that.  But it would be an


awfully surprising thing for them to want to do.


MR. FONTHAM:  They did say we don't want to do

that.  It's in -- it's in the introduction.


QUESTION:  Well, if they said they don't want to


do it, then why are you arguing to the contrary?


MR. FONTHAM:  I'm saying that they -- well,


maybe I misunderstood what they don't want to do, Your


Honor.


QUESTION:  I mean, don't want to do that is --


means that they don't want 51 bodies --


MR. FONTHAM:  Okay, they didn't --


QUESTION:  -- adjudicating the correctness of


the application of rules for wholesale rates that are


contained of thousands or millions of words filed before


the Federal Power Commission.


MR. FONTHAM:  They -- they --


QUESTION: 


I've always thought that the Federal 

Power Act did not want to have 51 adjudicative bodies, but


rather wanted to have one centralized body that States


were free to use.


MR. FONTHAM:  Not -- not at all.


QUESTION:  No, okay.


MR. FONTHAM:  What the Federal Power Act says is


there's one central body to make the rate, to establish


the reasonable and just terms of the rate.  All the courts


in the United States can decide whether a tariff is


violated, including the State courts, and that's the way

it always has been.  In fact, the FERC wouldn't hear the


cases until 1979.


If there was a case of a tariff violation


pending in State court, you had the potential, this


potential of possible loss of uniformity, which never


really happened.  As a matter of fact, this is a


high-profile case.  Where are the conflicting decisions? 


And the reason is we have an objective tariff.  They


violated the objective tariff.  Nobody can really dispute


that.  It was litigated in the lower courts.


QUESTION:  Mr. Fontham -- Mr. Fontham, there are


five States in this and there could be more in a regional


organization.


MR. FONTHAM:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION: 


If each State's public service 

commission can do what the Louisiana commission has done,


you could have chaos.


MR. FONTHAM:  No.


QUESTION:  One will say, my utility was


underpaid.  Another one will say, ours was overpaid.  And


each one could do exactly what the Louisiana commission


has done.  It -- it seems to me that that just cries out


for having the one decisionmaker, FERC.


MR. FONTHAM:  Well, Your -- Your Honor, I -- I


will respectfully disagree that this as big a problem

as -- as you are suggesting.  And I'll -- I'll tell you


that literally billions of dollars of costs are split up


by Entergy among its companies, only a very small sliver


under the Federal Power Act.  Now, they split up these


costs from Energy Operations, which is a nuclear company;


Energy Services, which is a service company, by allocating


them into the jurisdictions.  Anytime there would be a


conflicting decision, you could have -- supposedly you


could have chaos.  What really happens is the utility


tries to shove as much costs as it possibly can into the


jurisdictions which are reviewing the rates frequently.


QUESTION:  But -- but your answer to Justice


Ginsburg and your earlier answer to Justice Breyer, with


reference to whether there is a preemptive effect in the,


what we might call, the enforcement --


MR. FONTHAM:  Right.


QUESTION:  -- or interpretation phase of the --


of the tariff, it seems to me is contrary to what we said


in Mississippi Power.  We -- we actually were quoting


Nantahala.  There we said the Mississippi Supreme Court


erred in adopting the view that the preemptive effect of


FERC jurisdiction turns on whether a particular matter was


actually determined in FERC proceedings.  We have long


rejected this sort of case-by-case analysis of the impact


of State regulation upon the national interest.

 MR. FONTHAM:  Yes, Your Honor, and -- and bear


in mind what Justice Stevens was addressing there.  The


issue of prudence -- and the Court were addressing, but


the issue of prudence is an issue is that comes up in


making the rate.  The FERC in the Federal Power Act is --


is authorized to establish just and reasonable rates.  If


you're going to raise prudence, you raise it in the


proceeding where the just and reasonable rate gets


established.  We admit they have that.


Then you have the next question.  If they start


violating their contract, is that something that the


States can't look at?  And there's nothing in the Federal


Power Act that suggests that States --


QUESTION:  Well, but it was violating the


contract in -- in a context where FERC had -- had looked 

at that -- that specific violation, and it -- and it


announced the remedy.


MR. FONTHAM:  No.  The prior violation.  This is


the second tariff, Your Honor.  This is a new tariff that


sets conditions which were supposedly designed to curb


their discretion.


But going back to MP&L, this Court's decision


affirmed the decision of the Mississippi Public Service


Commission.  It reversed the Mississippi Supreme Court. 


It affirmed the Mississippi Public Service Commission.

In -- in that decision of the Mississippi Public Service


Commission, 327 million will be incurred under the FERC


tariff.  They -- they had to actually estimate what would


be incurred.


Now, if you hand the utility the right to tell


the State public service commission that, oh, it will be


500 million, do they have to pass it through?  If this


Court is going to give the sword of preemption to


utilities, and basically, there's a test, you know.  We've


got concurrent jurisdiction.  The test for concurrent


jurisdiction or exclusive jurisdiction is unmistakable


intent of Congress.  Congress had it in there, pulled it


out of the -- in the Senate report.  The FERC can -- can


hear violations.  It was in the Senate version of the bill


in 1935. 


If you look on page 6 of our brief, you'll find 

that the Senate pulled it out.  The FERC had no -- no --


jurisdiction to hear tariff violation cases.  It could go


to court.  That's 16 U.S.C., section 825m.


In about 1980, the FERC said, well, you know


what?  We're going to infer the power to do that.  And for


the first time ever, because up until then, the FERC had


been refusing to hear cases that were pending in State


court, wouldn't even exercise primary jurisdiction.  Now,


obviously, if you have exclusive jurisdiction, there's no


need for a primary jurisdiction doctrine.  They wouldn't

even exercise primary jurisdiction.  They left it to the


State courts, all the State courts.


Now, if you leave it to the State courts, what


is -- how can you possibly say a State ratemaking agency,


which decides issues of Federal law, contracts, all the


time, has to interpret allocations, has to decide if


they're right -- how could the Federal Power Act have


taken away their power when the Federal Power Act was


passed --


QUESTION:  Well, I want to be sure I get a


response to this, though, because you said before -- and


this very interesting argument might be cut short if the


paragraph that I read to you is applied to the 19 --


post-1965 costs, which I -- aren't they the costs that


were at issue when -- when the staff was talking about 

disallowing costs?


MR. FONTHAM:  The post-1997 --


QUESTION:  No.  The post -- the -- there's the


post-'65 or -- what --


MR. FONTHAM:  August -- it's August 5th, 1997.


QUESTION:  But -- yes.


MR. FONTHAM:  You have -- you have costs


incurred in '96, which interestingly enough, were incurred


in violation of a FERC tariff as determined by the FERC.


QUESTION:  Yes, yes, that's right.  I understand

QUESTION:  And -- and when they're talking


about this, it seemed as if they're talking about


post-August 5th, 1997 costs on page 64a, 65a.


MR. FONTHAM:  Right.  That's when the new


tariff --

effective.


QUESTION:  Yes.  But you know what I'm thinking


of on page 64a and 65a of your appendix.


MR. FONTHAM:  I don't, but I'll be happy to


look.


QUESTION:  I'm a little puzzled by your


reference to the new tariff.  I thought the --


QUESTION:  It's -- it's -- they have a -- B, is


this committee precluded from determining whether the


operating committee's decision was in compliance with the


amended section 10.02 of the system agreement?


MR. FONTHAM:  It's the amendment.  Yes.  The


amendment took effect August 5th, 19 --

 QUESTION:  Yes, and they're talking about the


post-August 5th, aren't they?


MR. FONTHAM:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  All right.  Then they say, LPSC staff


argues that the MS-1 overpayment should be disallowed


because the decision violated the FERC tariff.  As ELI


argues, this commission is preempted from determining


whether the terms of a FERC tariff have been met, for the


issue of violation or compliance with a FERC tariff is


peculiarly within FERC's purview.  Any allegation of a


violation of a FERC tariff should, therefore, be brought


before FERC.


All right.  I read that and thought they seem


not to have decided this on the basis that you've been


arguing it.


MR. FONTHAM:  Your Honor, I believe they did


decide it on the basis that I've been arguing, but I'll


concede that that language is sitting in there.  It's


wrong.  And --


QUESTION:  You mean it's wrong as a matter of


law?  It's wrong at describing what they thought?


MR. FONTHAM:  It's wrong.  I think it relates


to the refunds, but it's wrong as a matter of this Court's


law, the fact that there was a primary jurisdiction


doctrine, the fact that the States have always had the

power to decide this, the fact that the FERC had to


infer jurisdiction to decide tariff violations in the --


in around 1979 or 1980.  The FERC has never had


exclusive jurisdiction to decide if a contract has been


violated.


The Arkla against Hall case.  That case is a


case that came through the -- this -- the Louisiana


courts.  This Court held there's a difference between


establishing the just and reasonable rate and enforcing


the contract.


And if you go back to the -- the Pan American


case decided by this Court, this Court held that with


regard to contract enforcement issues, which somebody was


arguing need to be decided by the FERC, there was a State


proceeding pending.


QUESTION:  Why is this a contract enforcement


proceeding?  I don't follow.


MR. FONTHAM:  Because, Your Honor, the -- it's a


contract.  This is one of the sections of the contract. 


This is the section that -- it's an amendment to the


contract that was approved by the FERC.  It's a contract


between the parties --

Entergy -- not under the contract, not because the


contract says so.  They don't have to take an illegal


charge.  But as a matter of practice, I admit that the


big boss of Entergy can tell the operating companies


what to do, and they're not going to lose their jobs


over it.  So they'll take the charge if it's an


overcharge.  You're darned right.  But not because


the contract says so, Your Honor. 
 Not at all. 

QUESTION:  Is this contract the contract that


has been accepted by and approved by FERC and, in effect,


incorporated into the tariff?


MR. FONTHAM:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  So that we're not talking about a


freestanding contract.


MR. FONTHAM:  We're --


QUESTION:  We're talking, in effect, about a


term which the tariff incorporates by its reference to the


contract.

contract itself --


QUESTION:  Well, isn't --


MR. FONTHAM:  -- more or less becomes the


tariff, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  Right.  That's --


MR. FONTHAM:  There is no separate tariff.  It's


just a contract.  It becomes a rate schedule filed with


the FERC.  But in Pan American, this Court said, you


know, in -- in its nature -- by its nature, a contract


like that is a State court contract.  And the -- and the


Court made the statement by the fact that everybody knows


there's a scheme of Federal regulation doesn't change


that.  And the State courts -- and I think it implicitly


means this --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Fontham.


MR. FONTHAM:  Yes, Your Honor.
