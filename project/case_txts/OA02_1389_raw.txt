          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument

now in No. 02-1389, the United States v. Abel Cosmo

Galletti.

          Mr. Jones.

              ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

          MR. JONES:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

          Federal employment taxes owed by a partnership

were assessed by the commissioner, and when the

partnership failed to pay the taxes, the United States

brought this action to recover the taxes against the

individual partners who were derivatively liable under

State law for all debts of the partnership, including its

tax debts. 

          QUESTION:  Did the Government have to wait until

the partnership failed to pay?  Could it have proceeded

immediately against the partners under -- under the

governing State law?

          MR. JONES:  You've addressed an -- an unanswered

question that isn't presented here, of course.  It's

unanswered because Federal law --

          QUESTION:  It -- it's not presented, depending

on what you mean by derivative liability.  I -- I always

thought that derivative liability would be liability that

doesn't attach unless and until the person primarily

liable fails to -- fails to pay up.

          MR. JONES:  And -- and I agree with that, and --

and the Uniform Partnership Act, which California has

adopted, contains a provision that specifies that the

creditor must exhaust his efforts to recover from the

partnership before he can recover from the partners.

          QUESTION:  I see.

          MR. JONES:  And -- and so that's what makes it

clear this is indeed a derivative secondary liability.

          QUESTION:  You think maybe the United States may

not be bound by that.  You -- you don't want to -- you

don't want to concede that the United States is bound by

that.

          MR. JONES:  It's not so much I don't want to

concede.  I don't feel that I'm able to concede that not

because it is related to this case, but because of a -- a

structural intellectual problem about the extent to which

whose law governs in that situation.  If it's a

limitations provision, we know Federal law governs when

the United States is bringing a claim that it acquires in

its sovereign capacity.  Whether this would be regarded as

a procedural restriction that the State substantive law

didn't -- now, whether you want to think this is

substantive or procedural may affect the answer to the

question -- the hypothetical that you've raised.

          QUESTION:  Well, can you tell me as a matter of

practice if -- if you know?  Suppose there's a partnership

which is a little murky.  It's in the Cayman Islands and

they're behind, but that one of the -- the general

partners is in California.  Can you just proceed against

him, do you know?  Does the Revenue Service ever do that?

          MR. JONES:  Well, there --

          QUESTION:  -- ever do that? 

          QUESTION:  There -- there is an -- the uniform

-- in the case law, there's a discussion of situations

where the partnership is known to be insolvent.  You're

not required to do a senseless act.  You're not required

to pursue and exhaust against the partnership when it's

known to be insolvent.  So in that situation, you have

exhausted because the partnership is insolvent.

          QUESTION:  And I take it in that situation --

you correct me if I'm wrong -- but you can't just levy on

the account if the tax has not been assessed against that

partner individually, but you can commence some other

sorts of proceedings which would allow a subsequent levy. 

Or am I wrong, or is that clear?

          MR. JONES:  Well, you've brought me through --

to a lot of levels of complexity, but I think the answer

to the question is we -- we don't dispute that you need to

give a -- a notice of assessment in order to collect

administratively through liens and levies.  That's not

relevant to this case because this is a judicial

collection case. 

          QUESTION:  Of course. 

          MR. JONES:  But, nonetheless, there is case law

that says that when you give notice to the partnership of

its liability, that's sufficient as constructive notice to

the partners to permit administrative collection through

liens and levies.

          QUESTION:  Mr. Kent, if you're not right about

that and you do have to have individual notice and demand

to the partners, then there's a consequence other than

liens and levies, isn't there, where you have whopping

penalties and interest attached?  I thought if you don't

give notice and demand within the 60-day period, then not

only can't you impose liens, but that the interest and

penalties stop running.

          MR. JONES:  I'm -- I'm familiar with the -- the

concept of interest doesn't run until notice of the

assessment is made, but nonetheless again, notice to the

partnership would be constructive to the partners.

          QUESTION:  But if you're wrong about that

constructive notice, then you could still say, well, the

statute has been extended 10 years because of the

assessment.  However, one might conclude that the interest

stops running and that you can't use administrative

collection procedures. 

          MR. JONES:  Well, I -- I don't mean to be -- I

don't mean to sound like I'm retreating from that issue. 

I'm just -- it's not presented here, and so I'm not really

capable standing here --

          QUESTION:  Well, it would be to the extent on --

if -- if this thing is remanded with instructions that the

assessment counts against all of them, that there would be

the question remaining about the interest and penalties.

          MR. JONES:  That's -- I don't -- it is possible,

and if the Court were to reverse and remand for further

proceedings, it's possible that that issue would be

raised.

          QUESTION:  Are you -- are you saying that we

should maybe flag it but not decide it?  Is it --

          MR. JONES:  I don't -- I don't know what your

practice would be.  I would think your practice would be

to decide the issue that's presented.  You could note

other issues haven't been raised, but since those issues

haven't been briefed here, we're not really in a position

to advise you on their proper resolution.

          QUESTION:  Why don't you go ahead with the

issues that are presented?

          MR. JONES:  Okay.  Well, the point I was making

was that the court ruled against us because they said that

the partnership taxes had not been assessed directly

against the partners.  But respondents now correctly

concede that there is no requirement of Federal law that a

derivative or secondary State law liability to pay a tax

has to be assessed before it can be collected, and that

concession is plainly correct in light of this Court's

decision in 1933 in the Leighton case where the Court held

that a derivative or secondary liability that arises under

State law to pay a tax may be recovered -- and I quote --

without assessment of that liability.  And there are

numerous cases that have applied that principle in -- in

related secondary and derivative liability contexts. 

          And as -- as I've already indicated, those

principles plainly apply here because under the Uniform

Partnership Act, which applies in California, the

liability of the partner is derivative for the -- and

secondary rather than principal, as I've discussed with

Justice Scalia.  Not only is it clear from the legal

structure of the UPA, but the official comments to the --

of -- to that act state that the liability of the

partnership for partnership debts is principal and that

the liability of partners is -- is in the nature of a

guarantor.  It's secondary.  It arises only when the

partnership doesn't pay its own debts.

          Federal law also makes clear that this is a

liability that attaches directly to the partnership.  This

is a Federal employment tax.  It applies to employers

because, under California law, the -- the partnership is a

separate and distinct legal entity.  It is the employer. 

It pays the wages.  Its payment of wages is what causes

the taxes to be imposed. 

          QUESTION:  But you -- you agree that it's the

law of California that imposes the derivative liability on

the partners?

          MR. JONES:  That's the way the cases describe

it.  From my -- and that's the way this Court described it

in -- in Commissioner v. Stern.

          QUESTION:  What more do you want?

          MR. JONES:  Pardon me?

          QUESTION:  I say what more do you want.

          MR. JONES:  Well, I don't want more.  I'm just

being finicky I guess, because to me we -- the Court in

Commissioner v. Stern said that these -- historically

these are substantive liabilities that Congress accepts

from State law.  And therefore, the Court applies the

substantive body of State rules in -- in implementing that

liability.

          You could also think of this -- and I'm not

asking the Court to reconsider Commissioner v. Stern.  But

you can -- even in light of Commissioner v. Stern, you can

think of this as Federal law borrowing State law for this

remedial purpose, and Congress has sanctioned that by not

altering the principles that have long existed on this.

          The -- but the -- the point that this Court made

in Leighton is that these principles that they apply come

from State law and you don't a -- actually respondents now

admit there's no mechanism in Federal law to assist this

-- assess this sort of secondary derivative State law

liability, and that's correct.  That's what the Court

addressed in the Leighton case.  And the court of appeals

in this case just misapplied those well-accepted

principles.

          Once the assessment of the partnership taxes was

made, under section 6502 the United States has 10 years

from the date of the assessment to bring any proceeding in

court to collect the taxes.  And in the Updike case in

1930, the Court held that that 10 years applies not only

to actions against the directly liable party but also to a

person whose liability is derivative or secondary and

arises from State law.  And the Court explained that the

broad purpose and broad text of 6502 applies equally in

10

both cases because in the Court's words, in a real sense

the action against the derivatively liable party is a

proceeding in court to collect the tax.  As the Court said

in Updike, the aim in the one case, as in the other, is

the same.  It's to collect the tax liability.

          Now, in this Court respondents do not dispute

that accepted understanding of 6502.  Instead, they raise

here a new and, indeed, a radical claim that no court has

adopted and that they did not raise prior to their merits

brief in this Court.  What they argue now for the first

time is that the Federal statute of limitations should not

govern this derivative liability claim because since it

stems from substantive State law, the State statute of

limitations should govern it.  Now, since they didn't

raise that claim at any time before their merits brief in

this Court -- and it is a statute of limitations which is

an affirmative defense -- they're -- they've waived the

claim as too rate to -- too late to raise it.

          But nonetheless, I think it is important to note

that their claim is plainly inconsistent with this Court's

decisions.  For example, in the Summerlin case, this Court

held that whenever the United States acquires a claim

acting in its governmental capacity, that claim of the

United States is not subject to a State statute of

limitations because of the sovereign rights -- sovereign

immunity of the United States.  And they applied that

holding in Summerlin to a situation where what the United

States obtained was a right to enforce a private note and

private mortgage that the --

          QUESTION:  May I interrupt for this question? 

You know, there are some State statutes of limitations

that -- or some States have limitations provisions that

are either affirmative defenses or some are, in effect,

conditions precedent to bringing an action.  If California

had the latter form of action, how would you decide this

case?

          MR. JONES:  I think that in -- in Commissioner

v. Bresson where the Ninth Circuit addressed that very

point, they -- they were -- they wrote a very useful

opinion that seems to me to be perfectly correct, that the

-- that if it is the passage of time after the United

States acquires its right that causes the claim to expire,

that that is what is barred by the Summerlin rationale

because the sovereign rights of the United States can't be

extinguished.  And so whether you think of it as

extinguishing the claim or limiting the -- the period of

recovery, in either event what's instrumental is that the

-- the United States had the right at the time it obtained

the claim and that the State law could not thereafter cut

that right off.

          QUESTION:  Why not?  Why -- why -- suppose that

you have a -- a bank that guarantees a debt, and the debt

is Smith's debt.  And the guarantee is to pay, including

tax debts.  That's what it says.  It was a condition of

the borrowing or some other thing.  Now, why wouldn't

State law govern the period of time in respect to which

any creditor, including the Government, has to assert a --

a claim under that note, let's say, or under that

particular written guarantee since the liability there is

a creation of State law and the State would have the right

to define its contours?  And after all, that guarantor is

not the taxpayer.  The -- the guarantor's liability arises

solely out of the fact that he happens to have entered

into a note with a guarantor who promised to pay.

          MR. JONES:  So you're talking about a -- a

private contractual right --

          QUESTION:  Yes.  Say a private --

          MR. JONES:  -- that the United States somehow

obtained rights under by --

          QUESTION:  Yes. 

          MR. JONES:  -- levying, for example --

          QUESTION:  Yes, yes.

          MR. JONES:  -- on the -- on the right.

          QUESTION:  Yes, yes, and then I'm going to say

why isn't this that.

          MR. JONES:  That's -- that's a -- that's exactly

frankly what happened in Summerlin --

          QUESTION:  Yes.

          MR. JONES:  -- except Summerlin involved a

housing program instead of the Internal Revenue Code.  In

Summerlin, the Government obtained a private note and

enforced it, regardless of the State statute of

limitations, and the Court's reasoning was that the --

that the United States as sovereign cannot be subject to

limitations imposed on the rights that it obtains.

          QUESTION:  So if I -- if I enter into a promise

with you and say in return for my lending, you know,

whatever it is, I -- I promise that I will pay your tax

debts, but by the way, I don't want to pay any tax debt

that isn't definite before January the 5th, 2004 or 2010. 

I don't want to pay anything that arises --

          MR. JONES:  It's a limit -- if you're talking

about a substantive limitation in the document itself,

well, the United States takes its -- stands in the shoes

of the assignor in that situation, and we don't get a

better substantive right -- substantive right.

          QUESTION:  Okay.  So it's a substantive

procedural distinction. 

          MR. JONES:  Well, certainly that's the way the

Court has looked at it, and I --

          QUESTION:  But you know, in -- in other cases,

let's say when the -- when the Federal Government creates

a Federal right without establishing a statute of

limitations for that Federal right, State law does not

govern, but Federal law looks to the -- to the State

statute of limitations as a matter of Federal law.  I

don't know why it wouldn't be the same thing with respect

to a -- a Federal claim.  You mean there is no statute of

limitations whatever on Federal claims?

          MR. JONES:  No.  Well, that's the second route

that the Court has used to say the State's limitations

don't control, and that is, when there's a Federal

limitations period that applies to the claim, then the

State provision doesn't control.

          QUESTION:  Of course. 

          MR. JONES:  And under -- under Updike, what this

Court concluded in Updike was that there is a Federal

statute of limitations that applies to these proceedings

in court to collect the taxes, which includes the

derivative claim. 

          QUESTION:  Well, that -- that's fine.  But I'm

talking about the more general proposition that -- that

you're -- that you're defending or -- or proposing that --

that State law does not -- never -- never applies to a --

to a Federal claim.

          MR. JONES:  Well, it doesn't --

          QUESTION:  I mean, a claim by the United States.

          MR. JONES:  It doesn't --

          QUESTION:  I think it does.  Now, it may not

apply of its own force.

          MR. JONES:  Exactly.

          QUESTION:  But it applies because of adoption by

the United States. 

          MR. JONES:  If the -- if the Court were to find

it appropriate in a particular instance to adopt a State

rule, that would not interfere with Summerlin, but that

would -- that would -- I can't think of a case exactly

like that.  There may well be some.

           But most Federal claims --

          QUESTION:  I can't imagine our not doing it.  I

can't imagine our saying that, you know --

          MR. JONES:  Most --

          QUESTION:  -- the clock keeps ticking on Federal

claims forever and ever.

          MR. JONES:  Most Federal claims come within some

general statute of limitations, and this is certainly a

situation like that.

          QUESTION:  Is it -- is this question really

academic in this case because you have not one but two

Federal limitations, one, the regular 3-year period, then

the extension by 10 years following an assessment? 

          MR. JONES:  Well, I think the Updike case makes

this discussion somewhat hypothetical, and I understood

Justice Scalia's question to be in that vein.

          QUESTION:  But here, what you're relying on are

the Federal limitations period.  So you don't need to

worry about suppose there had been no Federal limitations.

          MR. JONES:  I -- I don't need to worry about

them, and I -- but I'm only addressing them because

respondents have raised them at this point in the case,

and so I'm just discussing the two theories that this

Court has applied in rejecting that kind of contention.

          QUESTION:  You're saying it's doubly

hypothetical because they can't raise the whole issue --

          MR. JONES:  Yes.

          QUESTION:  -- at this point anyway. 

          MR. JONES:  Yes, sir.

          QUESTION:  I thought their primary position,

though, was that the partners are not secondarily liable,

they're primarily liable, so that they are the taxpayer

and they're entitled to assessment notice and demand.

          MR. JONES:  That is now clearly their primary

position, and for the reasons I've already described that

position can't be reconciled with the Uniform Partnership

Act or with -- or with the Federal law that applies to

these taxes.

          QUESTION:  Can you -- can you tell me in the

case of a corporation, if the responsible officer does not

withhold employment taxes, I -- I take it -- I thought I

remembered that -- that the responsible officer is

personally liable.  Or am I wrong about that? 

          MR. JONES:  Yes.  There is a statute that

authorizes an assessment of that liability against a

responsible officer. 

          QUESTION:  Ah, but you have to assess it.

          MR. JONES:  It -- it authorizes the assessment. 

That's -- you know, it's interesting.  There are certain

types --

          QUESTION:  Can -- can you proceed against the

responsible officer without the assessment? 

          MR. JONES:  If you have a claim based on State

law or common law, and that's the reason we have a

responsible officer statute is that this is a Federal

claim.  There isn't -- unlike in the partnership situation

and in the ordinary transferee situation, there's not a

backup State law action.

          QUESTION:  Well, if -- if in the case of

corporate officers, there must be an assessment, then by

analogy it would seem that it wouldn't be too much trouble

for the IRS to assess the partners in your case.

          MR. JONES:  Well, sometimes it is troublesome,

but it's not required in any situation under our

understanding of the existing law.

          QUESTION:  I -- I thought that it was required

in the -- in -- in the corporate case.  You said it has to

be assessed against the responsible officer.

          MR. JONES:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you were

talking about the partnership then.  Yes.  I -- the

responsible officers -- officer liability is created by

Federal statute, unlike the partners' obligation for the

debts of the partnership.

          QUESTION:  I'm simply wondering if -- if that

isn't a model, if that's what happens in the corporate

instance, in this case where the statute is -- is silent

on the point, whether we shouldn't just assume that since

it's not too much of a burden on the Government in the

corporate context to require it to assess the responsible

officer before the tax can be collected, that we shouldn't

say the same thing here.

          MR. JONES:  There is --

          QUESTION:  I'm just --

          MR. JONES:  I understand.  But the responsible

officer liability is -- is really a radically different

concept.  It only -- it only arises when that officer had

knowledge of the fact that the taxes weren't being paid as

they accrued and willfully failed to pay them and -- and

was responsible, had the responsibility to pay them.  It

is a -- it is a malfeasance claim, whereas the derivative

liability claim is just under State law, you are liable as

is the partnership, and we can enforce that State law.

          There's another example --

          QUESTION:  There's a --

          MR. JONES:  -- where the similar thing happened. 

3505, which is the lender's liability.  There was no

lender's liability for employment taxes that the Court

discussed in the Jersey Shore case.  That liability didn't

have a -- a common law precedent, and so Congress created

the liability because they saw a specific problem where

lenders were allowing or in -- in effect, helping

employers evade employment taxes by loaning them money

from which they paid wages but didn't paid taxes.  And so

Congress created this separate statutory scheme.

          But respondents are correct in their concession

that there is no mechanism under Federal law for assessing

the derivative State law liability of a partner for the

debts of the partnership.  And so as the Court held in --

in Leighton, we can proceed without assessment against

them to enforce that liability.

          Now, I do want to also mention the -- the

citations that respondents make to section 6303.  That

section appears in the portion of the code that addresses

administrative collection through liens and levies, and it

states that the Secretary is to give notice of the

assessment to any person liable for the tax.  The cases

that have interpreted and applied that statute, which stem

from 1954, have -- have concluded correctly that that

statute applies only to administrative collection through

liens and levies and has no application to judicial

collection actions.

          And there's a -- a sound historical explanation

for that, and that is that prior to 1954, there were two

independent routes for collecting taxes.  The Secretary

was authorized by the code to bring a judicial collection

suit, but there was a separate officer known as the

collector of revenue for each district.  And the collector

of revenue was, by the code, authorized to do the

administrative collection through liens and levies.  And

the predecessor of 6303 had said that the collector is to

give notice of the assessment and make demands for

payment.  And it was well established that that applied to

his actions in administrative collection and had no

application of the Secretary's independent authority to

bring a judicial collection suit.

          In 1954 in revising the code, Congress

eliminated references to the collector in the code, placed

the Secretary in charge both of the -- of judicial and

administrative enforcement and changed the predecessor

language of 6303 from saying the collector is to give

notice to saying the Secretary is to give notice.  But in

doing so, Congress did not mean to change -- and the

courts that have reviewed this have correctly concluded

did not change -- the fact that this notice of assessment

requirement applies only to the administrative collection

area, has no application to judicial collection suits like

this one.

          QUESTION:  Are you conceding then that there

could be no liens and levies against the partners here

because there was no notice and demand --

          MR. JONES:  I --

          QUESTION:  -- individually to them?

          MR. JONES:  I don't think the record discusses

whether there was notice to the partnership.

          QUESTION:  No, no.  To the partners.

          MR. JONES:  No.

          QUESTION:  You just explained these two

different routes.

          MR. JONES:  Yes.

          QUESTION:  And you said that this is a judicial

collection proceeding. 

          MR. JONES:  Yes.

          QUESTION:  So the other doesn't apply.  So I'm

asking you if you are now making the concession that those

words -- what are they -- each person liable for unpaid

tax, would stop you from using the administrative

collection route because you didn't give notice and demand

individually. 

          MR. JONES:  Let me -- I can't say what we did or

didn't do in notice because there's nothing in the record

on that in this case because administrative collection

isn't involved in this case.

          QUESTION:  Well, let's assume you gave notice

and demand only to the partnership.

          MR. JONES:  Okay, let's assume that.  If we gave

notice and demand to the partnership, what we would be

authorized to do is clearly under 6321 and -- make a lien

and levy against any assets of the partnership.  And then

as I said, although -- the -- the cases are also perfectly

consistent that the notice to the partnership is valid as

constructive notice to the partners.

          And so, for example, if we have a partnership

employment tax liability from Smith Construction and the

two partners are Bob Jones and Bill Wilson, notice of the

assessment to the partnership is valid as notice to its

two partners.  And so our lien arises, if they don't pay

the tax, but if a third party creditor is out there, First

National Bank, the First -- our notice to the partnership

may not be notice to the First National Bank.  And so in a

lien contest we might not have the prior lien vis-a-vis

this other party, but vis-a-vis the two partners, the

cases say that our notice is valid for 6303 purposes to

them because, well, of course, a partnership only acts

through its partners and notice to one of them or to the

partnership is valid, constructive notice to all the

others. 

          There is no case inconsistent with that

conclusion, but again, it's plainly not presented in this

case and we would not ask the Court to address it. 

There's no need for it to.  This is just a judicial

collection case. 

          The only issue that is really before the Court

is whether we have to give notice -- I'm sorry -- whether

we have to assess the individual partners to collect the

State law derivative liability.  And for the reasons I've

described, that the decision below is incorrect on that

and -- and should be reversed. 

          And I would like to reserve the balance of my

time.

               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

          We've heard some interesting arguments, and I'd

like to address the history here of the way in which this

alleged derivative liability is imposed upon the partners. 

We contend that the partners --

          QUESTION:  Now, the Government says you -- you

did not raise what is now your principal argument until

your merits brief.  Do you agree with that statement? 

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Your Honor, no, I don't.  This

case has always been about statutes of limitation.  We

were addressing, in fact, a argument raised in the merits

brief by the Government.  If the Court will note, at page

5 -- I'm sorry -- page 12, footnote 5, this specific

question is addressed by the Government stating that it's

a Federal not a State statute of limitation that comes

into play.  And our portion of the brief is simply a reply

to that.

          QUESTION:  Wait.  It seems to me it's -- it's --

the burden is on you to make the claim that a State

statute applies, and you never claimed that any State

statute applies.  Now, the Government here, out of an

excess of caution or maybe to explain the whole situation

to us, puts in that footnote, but that doesn't create a

claim on your part that the State statute governs.

          Did you ever assert that -- that this matter was

governed by -- by a State statute of limitations until

your merits brief?

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Yes, we did in the courts below

and our briefs below. 

          QUESTION:  You asserted that it was governed by

a State statute of limitations. 

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Your Honor, what we argued was

that if the Federal statutes did not apply, section 6303

requiring notice and demand, if these partners are not

taxpayers under the Internal Revenue Code, then State law

would govern.  And yes, we did raise it below.

          QUESTION:  Did the court of appeals touch on it?

          MR. HABERBUSH:  The court of appeals did not

need to touch upon it, because the court of appeals felt

and decided that these partners are taxpayers under the

Internal Revenue Code.  And that's the precise question I

would like to address.

          QUESTION:  Did you raise the statute of

limitations point in your pleadings in the district court?

          MR. HABERBUSH:  In the United -- this originated

in the bankruptcy court, so the district court --

          QUESTION:  Well, I mean in the bankruptcy court.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Your Honor, we did.  We raised

it both in terms of the statute of limitations under

section 6303 and under State law. 

          QUESTION:  Did you raise it as an affirmative

defense under State law?

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well, we objected to the proof

of claim which is akin to an answer, and yes --

          QUESTION:  And one ground of your objection was

under State law it's barred?

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Our objection was a fairly

generic objection in all honesty --

          QUESTION:  So we're talking about did you ever

say this claim is barred by -- it -- it is too late under

this State statute of limitations, citing the State

statute of limitations? 

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Yes, we did.

          QUESTION:  Would you provide us with --

          QUESTION:  Where can we find that in the record?

          QUESTION:  Where will we find that?

          MR. HABERBUSH:  I believe you'll find that at

the -- the district court level after the bankruptcy

court.

          QUESTION:  Well, isn't the place to raise it in

the bankruptcy court?  I mean, that's where your pleadings

-- that's where your responsive pleadings were filed.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  If indeed it is an affirmative

defense, yes.  Our objection to the claim was this was not

an enforceable claim under law, State or Federal, and our

reason for it was barred by the limitations periods.

          QUESTION:  As a Federal --

          QUESTION:  Under California practice, I assume

statute of limitations is an affirmative defense?

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Yes, Your -- Your Honor, it is.

          We, however, believe that this case does not be

controlled by State law, but rather by Federal law.  A

partner's liability for the debts of a partnership may

arise under State law, and this Court has noted in the

case of United States v. Kraft that State law defines the

rights as between the parties, but the manner by which it

may be collected, the tax itself or the claim, is governed

by Federal law.  And that is really the heart of what our

argument is. 

          There is no specific Internal Revenue Code

provision that makes a partner liable for a partnership

debt.  What the Government in this case does is it relies

specifically upon historical cases that stem from old

section 280, which is adopted as section 6901 of the

Internal Revenue Code, whereby assessments may be made

against transferees, donees, and fiduciaries, and the

cases interpreting those statutes basically find that

there is a derivative liability with a coterminous statute

of limitations. 

          QUESTION:  This would be an odd State law,

wouldn't it?  Imagine that I guarantee a debt or suppose a

partner is like a guarantor.  And suppose that the primary

-- person primary -- primarily liable is in litigation

with the debtor -- the creditor, rather.  And because of

delays and so forth, it takes about 15 years to resolve

this litigation.  I've never heard of a guarantor who

wouldn't become liable at the time the thing is final and

that the -- he just becomes -- I mean, how does it work? 

I would have thought a guarantor is liable for the debt

the debtor owes.  How does the statute work, the State

statute? 

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Your Honor, we believe the State

statute is -- is one that does not require exhaustion of

remedies as against the partnership.

          QUESTION:  It has nothing to do with exhaustion

of remedies.  I'm -- and I'm talking about States -- the

State insofar as it sees the partner as a guarantor of the

liability that is created by a different entity, namely

the partnership.  And I'm asking if under State law of

California, wouldn't it be the case that if he's a

guarantor and you get the statute of limitations on a

matter to determine liability extended, that the guarantee

also extends.

          QUESTION:  There's no State law that says you

have to sue the guarantor before the liability that he's

guaranteeing is determined.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  That is correct.

          QUESTION:  All right.  If that's correct, what

are we arguing about?

          MR. HABERBUSH:  What we're arguing about here is

that this is not a suretyship or a secondary liability --

          QUESTION:  Yes, yes.  You're back to your

question of whether under partnership law in fact this is

a guarantor or the equivalent or a surety.  I understand

that argument, but it sounds to me as if that argument is

resolved against you, this statute of limitations argument

is a serious red herring because it won't matter.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well, unless Federal law

controls.

          QUESTION:  Right.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Unless these parties are

taxpayers under Federal law, in which case --

which you want to argue, that they're taxpayers or that

they are primarily liable, you win it or you lose it.  If

you win it, you win.  If you lose it, your statute of

limitations argument adds nothing.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  I think not. 

          QUESTION:  That's my -- that's what I'm

thinking.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  I think not.  I think we win,

and let me explain why.  It has nothing to do with

limitations periods.  It has nothing to do with State law

governing guarantees.  It has to do with the way this

Court is asked to define this particular claim in this

particular case.  Is it a tax claim or is it a claim which

is derived from the partnership liability?  In other

words, is it a tax debt or is it a debt because they're

liable for a debt of the partnership so that it loses its

nature as a tax claim?

          If that's the case, this is a bankruptcy case. 

Tax claims in bankruptcy have priority over other claims

under section 507(a) of title 11 of the United States

Code.  Those claims too are not dischargeable if they're a

tax claim under section 523 of title 11.  So if the Court

determines this is nothing more than a guarantee pursuant

to State law and not a tax claim, then this debt will be

discharged in this bankruptcy case.

          QUESTION:  Do you have -- have any cases for

that, that a tax claim loses its character as a tax claim

when relief is sought not against the person primarily

liable but against somebody derivatively liable?  It seems

to me it's still a tax claim.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  No, Your Honor, we do not have

authority for that.  However, if it is a tax --

          QUESTION:  I wouldn't expect you to find any.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  However, if they are liable for

the tax, this Court has already stated on a number of

occasions, including the most recent case of U.S. v.

Kraft, someone who is subject to the tax is someone who

pays it, someone who is liable for it.  These parties are

liable for the tax.  They are subject to the tax under

section 7701(a)(14) of the Internal Revenue Code, and

therefore they are taxpayers.  Once they are taxpayers,

that invokes the provisions of section 6501 requiring

assessment or suit within 3 years.  We don't claim that

assessment is the only method.  We claim assessment or

suit, which is consistent with the history of the cases,

and that's a 3-year limitation period as to these --

          QUESTION:  No, but you say that they're

taxpayers because they're partners, and therefore they --

and -- and that's why the -- their -- their right to an

assessment can be claimed.  But by the same reasoning that

you follow, if they are taxpayers because they are

partners, why isn't notice to the partnership notice to

the partners or assessment against the partnership

assessment against the partners?  Why -- why do you, in

effect, make a metaphysical distinction in the latter case

but not in the former?

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well, Your Honor, I don't think

that we do.  I think that the argument that there is

constructive notice merely because one is a partner

creates notice to -- notice to the partnership is notice

to the partners.  There is no controlling case on this

idea, and that would be too a question I think of State

law, whether notice to a partnership is notice to the

partners.  And we've clearly cited to California law that

says you must commence a separate suit against the partner

in order to obtain a judgment against it.  There is no

California law that says that by filing a suit against the

partner, that's sufficient for due process purposes of

creating notice to the partners such that --

          QUESTION:  We don't ordinarily decide questions

of State law here.  I think we would generally feel

perhaps the Ninth Circuit knows more about California law

than we do.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well, certainly that's true. 

And that's --

          QUESTION:  I said, we would think. 

          (Laughter.) 

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well, thank you.  And -- and

yes, this Court ordinarily does not address questions of

State law. 

          We think that this is a Federal statutory

interpretation.  Either these persons are taxpayers liable

for a tax or they are not taxpayers liable some -- for

something that is not a tax.

          QUESTION:  The last part.  They are for -- they

are not taxpayers in the meaning of the statute who are

liable for something that is a tax.  And I don't know why

that wouldn't be.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well, Your Honor --

          QUESTION:  And State law makes them, in effect,

guarantors of debts.  This is a tax debt.  So they're

guarantors of the tax debt.  So, therefore, they're liable

for the tax or sureties or some other equivalent word.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  All of the cases referred to for

the coterminous statute of limitations, which is what

would be suggested would be applied here if in fact they

are liable for this tax debt and therefore the provisions

of the Internal Revenue Code apply, are all cases where

specific enabling provisions created the liability of

those persons.  Under section 6324, certain persons are

made personally liable.  Under section 6901, certain

persons may be assessed with taxes as transferees.  And

those specific statutes have provisions in them that say

that the assessment and collection and enforcement of the

tax -- this is 6901 and its predecessor, section 280,

where the collection assessment and enforcement of the tax

is subject to the same provisions and the same limitations

as the tax itself.  So it's not surprising that you have

cases like Leighton and Updike where the statute of

limitations set forth in what is now 6502 applies to them

because they're subject to the same limitation periods.

          There is nothing in the Internal Revenue Code

that sets forth a limitation period as to partners.  If

one adopts the guarantor analogy, then this is conceivable

a case where any number of years could pass where the

partners would become liable.

          Your -- I would point out the Court's record in

the joint appendix.  At pages 100 and 102, we have the

proofs of claim that were filed in these bankruptcy cases,

and these proofs of claim on their face show that the

Government in this case is not simply filing a claim as

though it were a lawsuit against these partners.  These

proofs of claim were filed as secured claims in both of

the two cases that are before the Court.  Secured by what? 

Motor vehicles and real estate.  So the Internal Revenue

Service is taking the position clearly, unequivocally that

it can enforce this debt by the summary collection process

which has been called awesome and -- and super powers that

are not available otherwise.

          QUESTION:  Whether they could or not, they're

saying that the question here is a judicial action.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well --

          QUESTION:  And -- and so maybe they're wrong and

maybe they're right about that, but that's not before the

Court.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  That's not -- that may not be

before the Court, but the Government has taken the

position the only way, the sole and single way, it can

collect taxes is to file suits against partners.  We would

suggest that if the Court were to permit assessment, rule

that they are taxpayers subject to assessment, subject to

suit, that that would enhance collection.  It would

encourage partners at the earliest opportunity to cause

their partnerships to pay taxes.  It would cause partners

at the earliest opportunity to pay the taxes.  In this

instance, you have proofs of claim --

          QUESTION:  It -- it would also cause an enormous

number of assessments to be made that ultimately would

have no -- no use.  I mean, the -- the amount of

administrative assessing going on would -- would be

staggering.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well, the amount of suits could

be staggering as well to collect these kinds of taxes.

          QUESTION:  What is the problem?  Suppose -- I'm

-- I'm failing to see it but maybe -- suppose it's true

that what the Uniform Partnership Act says is true. 

Partners are, quote, in the nature of guarantors, end

quote, rather than principal debtors on the debts of the

partnership.  So let's suppose they're like guarantors.  I

would have thought that State law was something along the

lines of a guarantor must be sued in order to collect a --

a guaranteed debt within a period of time after it becomes

determined that such a debt exists.  Now, I would think

that that's how the normal State law runs.

          So unless there's something Federal to the

contrary -- and by the way, if there is, they have 10 more

years.  But unless there is something Federal to the

contrary, there's no problem with bringing this case.

          So the only question in this case is are they in

the nature of guarantors.  And I'd be interested -- well,

A, I'm interested in your comment on what I just said, and

I'm also interested in the comment of why they're not

guarantors.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Very well.  Here the Internal

Revenue Service has filed proofs of claim in the

bankruptcy court not for the debt of the tax but for the

tax, for the penalties, and for the interest.  Guarantors

under California law are liable for the debt and perhaps

the interest, but not for the penalties.  The Court will

note that these proofs of claim are approximately three to

four times as much as the amount of tax that was

originally assessed against the partnership in the initial

instance.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that

these partners had knowledge or notice of these taxes at

any time before these proofs of claim were filed.  

          Now, under California law, if you have a

guarantor, the guarantor knows of the liability that that

guarantor is offering surety for.  That guarantor knows

that that liability exists.  That guarantor can encourage

the principal party to pay the tax or the debt in

question.  Here the policies that are urged by the

Government do not encourage collection of this --

          QUESTION:  Mr. Haberbush, do you defend the

decision of the Ninth Circuit in this case?

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Yes, we do.

          QUESTION:  That in order to collect against the

partners, an assessment would have to be made against

them?

          MR. HABERBUSH:  No, not within that specific

limitation.  We think that an assessment or a suit should

be brought within the statutory period --

          QUESTION:  Well, I thought -- I thought the

reasoning of the Ninth Circuit was that you couldn't

collect against the partners unless you assess them too.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  To that extent, the opinion is

wrong for the reason that it is a well-held proposition

that suit or assessment may be brought under section 6501

within the 3-year period, so that it's not exclusively

assessment that's involved.  And this Court and other

courts, I believe, have -- have ruled that assessment is

not a prerequisite to collection.  However, some action

must be taken within the statutory limitations periods.

          QUESTION:  And the filing of a claim in a

bankruptcy court is insufficient because? 

          MR. HABERBUSH:  It's untimely.  It is not done

within the period of time --

          QUESTION:  So this is simply a statute of

limitations case.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  That's our position.  Yes, Your

Honor.  It is simply a statute of limitations case.  The

Government has contended that this is a tax governed by

the Internal Revenue Code.  The liability may be created

by State law, and this Court has consistently said while

liability may be -- be created by State law, the

enforceability of that liability is a subject of Federal

law.  The Federal laws provide for 6303 notice and demand. 

They provide for -- 6501 provides that assessment must be

made.  The -- the Government suggests that there can --

after the argument, to furnish the Court with the places

in the record available to us where it shows that you

raised the State statute of limitations issue below?

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Yes, I can. 

          QUESTION:  Thank you. 

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Yes, I can. 

          QUESTION:  Why shouldn't an assessment against

the partnership be good as to the partners as well?  I

mean, the whole difference is that you'd have to add the

-- the names of the individual partners.  I mean, the

assessment itself is something in a file in some building. 

Right?

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well, the assessment is the

notation or recording of the liability.  However, section

6203 says that to be a proper assessment, it must record

the liability of the taxpayer and we, of course, say that

the taxpayer also includes the partners.

          And yes, there could be a single assessment

naming numerous parties.  There are examples of that.  For

example, a husband and wife are jointly assessed.  An

assessment against a husband or a wife independently is

not an assessment against the other.  So there are

multiple assessments that are capable of being made under

the code.

          There are numerous other instances where

assessments are made.  6901, for example, assessment --

          QUESTION:  Is it -- does it -- would it matter

if in fact the partners knew -- had received the -- I

assume that the notice and demand would come to the

partnership.  This is a small partnership.  There were

what?  Four partners involved?  If they had actual notice,

would that make any difference? 

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Your Honor, that might make a

difference.  We -- we would contend that it does not make

a difference.  We have cited to cases -- and I don't

recall them right off the top of my -- my head at this

moment -- where the assessment -- in fact, that was Cool

Fuel, Inc. out of the Ninth Circuit where the assessment

actually has to be received and made.  It has to name who

the taxpayer is.

          Marvel v. the United States.  While the taxpayer

there was named as a partnership's name, the individuals'

Social Security numbers, taxpayer identification numbers,

were on that -- that assessment, and that was found to be

good as to those persons even though they were not

individually named.

          QUESTION:  But certainly they had actual notice. 

Your big due process objection that you make would not --

would -- would be very thin, would it not?

          MR. HABERBUSH:  I don't disagree with that, Your

Honor.  There is nothing in the record below where there

is -- that issue has been addressed.  There is no facts

that were derived at the trial of this matter where that

was addressed.  There is nothing in the record --

          QUESTION:  But you addressed it in your brief. 

You said if they didn't get individual notice and demand,

that would be a violation of due process.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Yes.  It is not before the

Court, however, whether they did or didn't, and there's

nothing in the record suggesting that they did get such

notice.  That's why the -- the Government relies so

heavily on its constructive notice theory, although

starkly absent from that argument is any California law to

support that idea that notice to a partnership is

constructive notice to its partners.

          Turning back to the -- the idea of the -- the

assessment in this case, the -- there are striking

examples throughout the brief of the Government, although

the Government contends that it is not able legally to

assess partners, there are no less than 12 cases cited in

the briefs, 10 of which were cited by the Government, in

which summary collection process was instituted against

partners, and in -- in any of those cases there was an

assessment.

          In fact, the one case that's cited by the

Government, the -- the United States v. Wright -- that's

the case which came out of the Seventh Circuit that the

Government contends is in direct conflict with the Ninth

Circuit case in this instance is one where the United

States District Court in its findings found that the

partners were assessed.  And it's not surprising

therefore, that the Wright court found that there were --

          QUESTION:  It said that -- but I thought Judge

Easterbrook said that that was irrelevant, that there

might have been a fact question about that whether there

were individual assessments.  But in any case, the court's

rationale had nothing to do with that.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  That is correct.  However, the

district court did find that there were assessments.  The

Seventh Circuit found that that was irrelevant to the --

the determination.  However, it is entirely consistent

with the idea that in that case there were coterminous

statute of limitations.  For the reason that assessments

were made within the statutory period of time -- that was

still within the coterminous periods -- then the

collection.  The question was whether the 6502 allowed the

collection against the partners who were jointly liable

with the partnership in that instance.  The statutory

period of time allowed to the partnership, because it had

been tolled during a bankruptcy, the court found

coterminous statute of limitations, relying on the Updike

case as its example.

          We -- we believe that the collection of taxes

would be enhanced by adopting the position that we have

taken in this case.  We believe that requiring the filing

of lawsuits in every instance where partners are liable

for the debts of a partnership which has failed to pay its

taxes and which may or may not be out of business, is

simply a policy which would have litigation that is not

required. 

          If the partnership is liable for the tax and

this Court were to find that the notice provisions of 6302

and the provisions of 6501 allowing suit or assessment

within 3 years applies, that that would enhance the

collection of taxes.  We believe that -- excuse me -- we

believe that by doing that, the tax will be paid at the

earliest possible time.  Interest and penalties, such as

have accrued in this case, would not accrue because the

partners would be encouraged at every point and at every

spot to cause their partnership to pay or to pay the tax

themselves. 

          The Government is not in the business of banking

tax claims, if you will, allowing them to accrue penalties

and interest and thereafter, for who knows how many years,

potentially as many as 3 plus 10, and if suit is filed

within the 10 years under 6502, the -- the term for

enforcing a judgment.  So it could be 20-25 years that a

partner could be out there liable for the tax during which

penalties and interest continue to accrue, and then

finally one day maybe that partner or that partner's

estate or the partner's beneficiaries of the partner's

estate might become liable for this tax.

          We believe that by filing the tax -- by filing

an assessment at the earliest possible opportunity against

the partners, this would encourage tax collection.

          QUESTION:  Nothing would stop a partner from

paying the tax.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  If the partner knows, that is

correct.  If the --

partners know what's happening in their business? 

          MR. HABERBUSH:  I don't know that it's

unreasonable to assume that, but I suppose it is

reasonable.  However, there are partnerships and there are

partnerships, and some partnerships have managing partners

who are actively involved in the business of the

partnership and --

          QUESTION:  Yes, but I -- I would think, by and

large, most partners know what's going on.  I mean,

certainly there are exceptional cases, but certainly

that's not typical.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Unfortunately, I'm only involved

in my law partnership and I know what's going on there. 

I've not been involved --

          QUESTION:  Maybe you shouldn't be a general

partner if -- if you're not prepared to know what's going

on.  It's pretty risky.  I mean, that's -- that's the

responsibility you assume when he -- it only applies to

general partners.  It doesn't apply to limited partners.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  That's exactly right.

          QUESTION:  So don't become a general partner if

you're not willing to know what's going on in the

partnership.  I -- I thought that's the deal.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well, Your Honor, I don't know

whether that --

          QUESTION:  That's what it means to be a general

partner.  You're -- you're going to be liable for what the

partnership does.  So you better pay attention.  I -- and

you're saying this is unjust somehow?

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well, yes, it is, Your Honor,

for the reason that does that mean that every partner has

to go through every single piece of mail that enters the

partnership and be familiar with every single thing that

occurs?

          QUESTION:  No, but when you accumulate tax

liabilities of several hundred thousand dollars, they

ought to find that -- be able to find that out.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well, Your Honor, these are over

a number of quarters.  These were not all assessed at one

time.

          QUESTION:  Which is all the more reason they

should have known about it a lot earlier.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well, husbands oftentimes hide

things from their wives who are a joint taxpayer as well.

          QUESTION:  But we're talking about a partnership

that has not paid -- what was it -- FICA and FUTA taxes. 

Surely, the partners were aware that they were not paying

the taxes that were due year after year.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  There's nothing in the record

that suggests --

          QUESTION:  Who was responding to these letters

from the Government?  The secretary? 

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Your Honor --

          QUESTION:  I mean, does she take it in to -- to

her boss who was presumably one of the general partners

and say, hey, you know --

          MR. HABERBUSH:  If it's a --

          QUESTION:  -- the Government says we owe a lot

of money.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  If it's a managing -- if it's a

managing general partner, I assume that that's the case. 

If in fact the partnership had ceased its operations and

these notices came afterwards, who knows who received the

notices.  I don't think that the law imposes a burden upon

every single general partner to look at every single bill

and piece of paper that comes into a partnership.

          QUESTION:  No, but you shouldn't rely on the

United States Government to tell you what you -- how your

financial affairs are coming along and be the primary

source of information. 

          MR. HABERBUSH:  That may be so, but if the -- if

the Government were required to do so, partners would at

every point in time be encouraged to cause the partnership

to meet its financial obligations. 

          QUESTION:  It doesn't place that kind of a

burden on the partners that you're talking about.  They're

entirely free not to read the mail.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well, that's -- that's correct. 

          QUESTION:  But -- but the problem is they're

going to be liable for whatever debts are incurred by the

partnership if they don't do it.  That's the only burden

imposed. 

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well, Your Honor, and looking at

burdens there is no -- there is no insignificant -- excuse

me.  It's not a significant burden to place upon the

Government to simply send another notice to the partners

regarding their derivative liability for these claims.

          QUESTION:  And it's not a very significant

burden to a partner to say you better make sure they're

paying the taxes.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well, of course.  However, there

-- there have been dishonest partners, and the cases that

I cite --

          QUESTION:  You better be careful who you form a

partnership --

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Well, yes, and there are cases

cited in the briefs that say exactly that.  However, if --

if the policy is to collect taxes and collect them

promptly, then that is encouraged, rather than filing suit

against partners, by a simple assessment sent in the mail

to the partners. 

          If there is nothing further --

          QUESTION:  Does an assessment affect your credit

rating? 

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Yes, it does.  It does.

          QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Haberbush.

          MR. HABERBUSH:  Thank you. 

          QUESTION:  Mr. Jones, you have 5 minutes

remaining.

            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

          MR. JONES:  Thank you. 

          At page 3 of respondents' brief on the merits,

they say -- and I quote -- if respondents are secondarily

liable for the partnership taxes, then the Ninth Circuit's

ruling that the IRS must assess respondents to collect the

partnership taxes is incorrect.  It is clear to us that

there is -- this is a secondary derivative liability that

partners have under State law.  I didn't hear respondents

give any explanation of why that isn't so.

          Given those two facts, then this Court's holding

in Leighton seems clearly applicable, which is that we

don't have to assess a derivative State law liability to

bring suit to recover upon that liability.

          Now, respondents say, well, somehow that holding

is influenced by the fact that transferee liability is

provided in 6901 of the code.  It's interesting that in --

in the Leighton case what the Court held was that the 6901

transferee liability is a supplementary remedy that did

not displace and, indeed, left in place the right of the

United States to bring its suit upon the derivative State

law liability without assessment.

          So the -- the principle that we draw from the

Leighton case is not dependent on any of the specific

50

statutes that address specific types of -- of assignments

of transferees.  In fact, it's utterly independent of

that, which was the very issue the Court decided in

Leighton.

          Given that and -- and given that there's a

derivative sub-secondary liability, we can recover against

State law.  Then the only other question is, well, what

statute of limitations applies to that, which the Court

held in Updike that it's 6502 which applies both to the

direct liability and the derivative liability.

          QUESTION:  See, that's what I'm really wondering

about.  I mean -- but -- but I mean, A, they may have not

have raised it below.  B, it's not within the scope of the

question.  C, it may not make any difference because the

State and Federal may give you enough time anyway.  But if

you do have to get to it, I'm -- I'm a little worried

about it because I don't -- I don't really see why it

should be Federal. 

          MR. JONES:  The reason it should be Federal is

because all of these actions are designed, as the Court

stressed in Updike, to collect the tax.  We have different

remedies.  Congress could Federalize all of this. 

Congress could write a statute that said, you know, you

can bring suits for derivative liabilities and that those

suits will -- specifically subject to 6502.  And what the

Court noted in Stern was that Congress hasn't done that

because the Court has consistently applied State law to

permit such tax collection to occur.

          And -- and so that's why Updike has got to be

right because this is a strong Federal interest in

collecting taxes, not to be too big about it, but I mean,

this Court has noted that the collection of taxes is the

lifeblood of Government.  This is as sovereign a claim as

we have, and -- and because of that, we need to have a

uniform statute of limitations, which Congress has

provided under 6502.

          If -- if we were left to the haphazards of State

law, we would certainly want Congress to -- to address

that and correct it, but they don't need to correct it

because since 1930 in the Updike case, the Court has

explained that 6502 is broad enough to cover both types of

-- of judicial collection proceedings.  In the Court's

words, the action against derivatively liable party is in

every real sense a proceeding in court to collect the tax,

and that's the -- that's the statutory language. 

          And -- and I -- there has been no contention

that that's not a correct interpretation of 6502.  I do

not know what references respondents may have in mind to

arguments they raised under State statutes of limitations

before.  We're not familiar with those.  The statute

that's referred to in their merits brief is a specific

State statute.  We're not aware that that statute was ever

cited before by the parties in this case, but even if it

was, it seems to us that the reasoning of the Summerlin

case and -- and of Updike, which is -- there's already a

Federal statute -- should control that question and --

          QUESTION:  Mr. Jones, why isn't Mr. Haberbush

right at least when he says everybody would be better off

if you went ahead and listed the partners as well on the

assessment and gave them notice and demand?  Then there

would never be any hassle of whether you could use both

remedies, administrative and judicial.

          MR. JONES:  I think it's a question for Congress

what's -- you know, what makes everybody better off.  And

what Congress has said is that we can assess these taxes

against the employer.  The employer under State law is a

separate and distinct legal entity known as the

partnership.

          QUESTION:  Do you think you're impeded that you

have no authority to give the partners notice

individually? 

          MR. JONES:  We -- well, we have authority to

give them notice of an assessment and collect from them

administratively, but in terms of, if you will, making an

assessment against them directly, we're supposed to assess

          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Jones.
