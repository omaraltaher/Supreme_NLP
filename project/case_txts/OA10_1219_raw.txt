 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11  person who has sought a patent from the PTO and believes 
12  that the agency has wrongly denied his application to 
13  seek judicial review of that decision in district court. 
14  The Federal Circuit in this case held that the plaintiff 
in a section 145 action may obtain a more favorable 
15
16  standard of review, de novo review, by flouting the 
17  PTO's rules during the examination process.

 MS. ANDERS:  No. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Suppose I have no new 

1  administrative deference and exhaustion require that the 
2  PTO be given the opportunity to apply its expert 
3  judgment to all of the reasonably available evidence. 
4  For that reason, section 145 should be interpreted as a

 MS. ANDERS:  No, the Federal Circuit has 
20
21  held that in those cases substantial evidence review 
22  applies, and where the Federal Circuit gets that is this 
23  Court's case in Morgan v. Daniels.  That was an action 
24  under section 145's predecessor.  There was no new

 MS. ANDERS:  Yes, section 145 --

the predecessor? 

 MS. ANDERS:  All of the material language is 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes. 
 MS. ANDERS:  So, it's quite clear that 

1  a proceeding in the nature of a suit to set aside a 
2  judgment, the judgment of the expert agency which had 
3  made this determination, and that, therefore, because 
4  this was administrative review, a deferential standard 
5
6

8  when --

17  proceeding, wasn't it? 
18
19  Ginsburg.  It was an interference proceeding, and that's 
because, at the time, section 145's predecessor applied 
20
21  equally to interferences and to ex parte patent denials. 
22  But the Court's reasoning, its discussion of -- of the 
23  predecessor statute, did not distinguish based on the 
24  fact that this was an interference.  And also this

overcome with some convincing evidence. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought that -- it's 
1
2  interesting that the language of Morgan and one of its 
3  companion cases, not companion in the sense of being 
4  heard at the same time, but on the same issue -- Radio 
City case -- both of them don't talk in the language of 
5
6  today.  They don't talk about deference.  They don't 
7  talk about substantial evidence.  They talk about 
8  whether the PTO has expertise, and presumptions that 
9  their factfindings based on their expertise have to be 
10
11
 So, they're talking in different language, 
12  but the concept they're talking about is one where the 
13  court does accept findings of the PTO on the matters 
14  that involve their expertise and give them weight, 
15
16  the court is, in the words of Morgan and Radio City, 
17  "thoroughly convinced" that they were wrong. 
18
19  Everybody likes the deference language of today, but 
they were very clear in what they were saying:  If the 
20
21  PTO made a finding, you decide whether that finding was 
22  based on its expertise, and if it was, you don't change 
23  it, court, unless you're thoroughly convinced they were 
24  wrong.
25

 Is there anything wrong with that?  With 

substantial weight, essentially, and only overturn it if 

 So, what's wrong with that standard? 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company

Morgan, that determination should not be overturned 

 And I would note that that is essentially 

 MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think here we are 

1  that articulation of what the standard should be in all 
2  situations, whether there's new evidence or no new 
3  evidence? 
4
suggesting that in -- in 145 actions, when there is new 
5
6  evidence, the -- Morgan's "thorough conviction" standard 
7  should apply.  And that reflects the fact that the court 
8  needs to look at the new evidence, but because the PTO 
9  has made an expert determination, as the Court said in 
10
11  unless there's a high degree of certainty. 
12
13  what this Court did just last term in Microsoft v. i4i. 
14  There the Court said that when a third party is 
challenging the validity of a granted patent, that the 
15
16  third party should have to show invalidity based on a 
17  heightened burden of proof, clear and convincing 
18  evidence.  And that reflects the same wisdom that --
19  that underlies --
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Let me tell 
you what my problem is with this case.  It is the issue 
that Verizon raised and the lack of connection between 
the district court's holding and the circuit court's 
holding.  The district court excluded the affidavit for 
the proposed arguments on the basis of them being new 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

what's new evidence in this affidavit and what's new
 

question to which the PTO is not entitled to deference. 
Why, other than Federal Circuit and Patent Board 
precedent, is that right?  And can you explain why this 
affidavit that was rejected is in fact new evidence and 
not merely new argument?

1  arguments that Board rules precluded them from raising 
2  at the stage they did.  The circuit court described the 
3  affidavit as new evidence.  And the Verizon amicus brief 
4  says:  Court, be careful, because it's not really clear 
5
6  argument.
 
7
 And that question troubles me, for the
 
8  following reason:  Verizon posits that the issue of
 
9  whether a description is specific enough is a legal
 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  this as new evidence, and the reason it did that was 
18  because Mr. Hyatt made a concerted strategic decision 
19  here to present his affidavit as new evidence.  In form, 
20
21  declaration containing proffered testimony that Mr. 
22  Hyatt would offer if there were a trial.  So, it is in 
23  form factual evidence, and in order to take advantage of 
24  the possibility of introducing new evidence in the 
section 145 action, Mr. Hyatt argued that this was 
25

 MS. ANDERS:  Certainly, Justice Sotomayor. 
 I think the district court did characterize 

this is -- this is factual evidence.  This is a 

8

Official 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me what 

get away from the labels, and I want to get to the 

 MS. ANDERS:  Certainly.  I think whether or 
not the -- the ultimate question of whether the written 

1  new factual evidence that should --
2
3  -- other than that it's in the form of an affidavit, 
4  tell me what in the content was new evidence?  I want to 
5
6  substance because I've looked at all of these 
7  submissions, and it sounds like what I read in briefs 
8  every day. 
9
10
11  description is sufficient is a question of law.  It 
12  would be one that rests on several subsidiary 
13  factfindings, including what the ordinary skill in the 
14  art is, what a person of ordinary skill in the art would 
understand when he reads the specification, and where in 
15
16  the specification there is support, there is description 
17  support, for the claims that shows that Mr. Hyatt 
18  possessed the invention that he claimed. 
19
20
21  expertise, I can't tell where in the specification your 
22  claims are supported.  This is at 258 -- it's a 250-page 
23  specification reprinted in the joint appendix.  It has 
24  over 100 pages of diagrams, source code, and 117 claims. 
25

And so, the PTO asked for this information; Mr. Hyatt 

 And so, I think when you look at what 

happened at the PTO, the examiner said:  Despite my 

9
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Now, you certainly could characterize this 

proceeding, and he was -- he characterized this as 

1  refused to present it or he didn't present it, and then, 
2  on rehearing, the Board said that he had not had any 
3  cause not to present this new -- this new argument.  And 
4  so, at that point, Mr. Hyatt went into the 145 
5
6  factual evidence in order to get around, presumably, or 
7  it would be reasonable to try to get around, the Board's 
8  ruling that he couldn't present new evidence. 
9
as legal argument.  We believe that we would win on that 
10
11  ground as well, even if this were new argument, because 
12  certainly the PTO is entitled to enforce its rules here, 
13  and both the district court and the panel found that the 
14  PTO did not abuse its discretion in -- in holding that 
15
16  argument.  But that's not -- that's not an additional 
17  question presented that we -- that we added here because 
18  it's a very case-specific question. 
19
20
21  evidence --
22
23  isn't new facts, right?  That's what you'd say. 
24
25

 MS. ANDERS:  I'm sorry?
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your case is stronger if in 

Mr. Hyatt had forfeited his right to raise this 

 But at any rate, the -- the entire case has 

now been litigated on the basis of this being factual 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your case is stronger if it

evidence and applied a rule that will -- will govern, if 

1  fact it's only new argument and not new fact. 
2
 MS. ANDERS:  Certainly.  I think it should 
3  be very clear that we would win on that ground.  The en 
4  banc court here characterized this as new factual 
5
6  it's left to stand, in all 145 actions, which would 
7  permit applicants to withhold evidence from the PTO. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Anders, one of the 
8
9  problems with, I think, your position, is it sounds very 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21
22  proceeding? 
23
24  the applicant has the ability to introduce new evidence 
25

strange to have two proceedings, one where you go 
directly to the Federal Circuit under 101 -- 141; and 
then this other one where you go to the district court, 
where if that's not, as Judge Newman said, a whole new 
-- whole new game, then why would Congress create two 
judicial review routes, one in the district court 
reviewable in the Federal Circuit, the other directly in 
the Federal Circuit, if there's no difference?  That is, 
if in both of them, it's not de novo review; it is 
reviewing what the -- what the agency did under the 
ordinary standard for reviewing agency action. 

 What's different about the -- the 145 

 MS. ANDERS:  Well, in the 145 proceeding, 

that couldn't be presented to the PTO.  And I think --

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But what kind of evidence is 

 MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think there are two 

in the examination proceedings.  The first is oral 

present oral testimony, on these exact matters, but 
live. 

1
2  that, Ms. Anders? 
3
4  primary categories, both of which can be very important 
5
6  testimony.  The PTO doesn't hear oral testimony, but it 
7  is routine in the examination procedures for --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, in the 145, an applicant 
8
9  can take all his written affidavits and say:  I want to 
10
11 
12
13  bring that to the district court, yes.  Now, the 
14  district court always, under general evidentiary rules, 
can say:  I believe this evidence is cumulative; so, I'm 
15
16  not going to hear it. 
17
18  believes it would be helpful to hear oral testimony, for 
19  instance, if the PTO's determinations involve 
20
21  could hear that testimony, and that's often how these 
22  proceedings have been used. 
23
24  substance of that testimony was something that he could 
have brought to the PTO, that testimony, in your view, 
25

credibility decisions, then certainly the district court 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But to the extent the

 You say:  But these are equitable actions, 

reasonable -- some kind of justification.  Can you work 

1  would be out of bounds. 
2
3  reasonable justification for not having presented it --
4
5
6  with the word "equitable"?  I mean, this was an 
7  equitable action, and could you say that the -- to the 
8  district court, well, of course, you -- assuming you'd 
9  win on the second question.  But on the first question, 
this is not an on/off thing.  That's your real objection 
10
11  to the de novo standard. 
12
13  and generally an individual should not be allowed to run 
14  around the PTO.  So, you better have some kind of 
reason, but leave it up to the -- to the district courts 
15
16  to work with that word "equitable" and to -- it seems to 
17  me there will be a lot of shading cases here where you 
18  can't quite tell if it is new or isn't new and some 
19  parts are and some aren't.  But just leave it up to the 
district court and say:  Take into account the fact that 
20
21  people should not be allowed to run around the PTO and 
22  work equity.  That's kicking the ball back. 
23
24  don't like it, tell me what we -- why -- what should

we -- you want an absolute rule?  Tell me why. 

 Now, if you like that, let me know.  If you

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Except you have a history 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And if it says there isn't, 

1
2  proposing is that the district court has discretion to 
3  determine whether there was reasonable cause not to 
4  present the evidence to the PTO.
5
6  then it can't hear it?  I mean, imagine you're sitting 
7  there as a district judge, you think:  Oh, my God, they 
8  should have presented it, but this is the key matter 
9  forever.  Do I really pay no attention to it at all?

17  pre-APA section 145 where they apparently did take the 
18  evidence in. 
19
20
21  when Congress re-enacted this provision, you have the 
22  lower courts applying the Morgan standard and saying: 
23  Based on Morgan's reasoning, because we know that the 
24  PTO is the primary factfinder, because we know their 
25

 MS. ANDERS:  The Board applicant has the --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  You have the history of the 

decision is so important, we will apply limitations on 

 MS. ANDERS:  Well, certainly in the early 

cases, they took new evidence in.  But by 1952, which is 

14
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But then you really do go
 

understanding of what they wouldn't have a reasonable 

1  new evidence because we don't think that that
 
2  evidence --
3
4  back to Justice Ginsburg's question because your
 
5
6  opportunity to present -- I mean, it's very, very 
7  narrow.  It's a bunch of cumulative testimony that 
8  nobody would want to present and no judge would want to 
9  hear.  And other than that, you're basically saying in 
all circumstances, well, they could have done that in 
10
11 
the PTO.  So, then you have Justice Ginsburg's problem, 
which is these are two channels that are exactly the 
12 
13 
same. 
14
15
16  testimony before the PTO.  But what else?  I asked you 
17  what would be -- what's different about 141 and 145 on 
18  your view.  And you said one thing is oral testimony. 
19  What else?
 MS. ANDERS:  Well, the other primary 
20
21  category of evidence that could come in would be 
22  evidence that has a temporal component.  If there's a 
23  lot of evidence that could be relevant to patentability 
24  that develops only slowly or that might arise very late 
25

in the process.  So, for instance, obviousness is a --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you were beginning to 

answer that by saying, well, you can't have oral

 MS. ANDERS:  For the most part, the record 

 Now, there are -- there are a couple of 

new evidence even when the Board is considering the 

1  is a very common ground of rejection.  But one thing 
2  that can be relevant to obviousness is if the invention, 
3  once disclosed, has commercial success.  So, this type 
4  of sales evidence can -- can develop very late in --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I thought that your 
5
6  brief suggested that even with respect to that kind of 
7  evidence, a person can go back to the PTO.  Is that 
8  right? 
9
closes once the -- once the applicant files his brief on 
10
11  appeal to the Board.  And then it can be months or years 
12  before the Board issues its decision. 
13
14  avenues through which an applicant could still introduce 
15
16  appeal.  But both of those, as the process goes --
17  that's the request for continuing examination and the 
18  continuation application.  Both of those have increasing 
19  down sides that require the applicant to abandon his 
20
21  that he would presumably get.  So --
22
23  the new evidence is in reaction to the PTO's ruling? 
24  The PTO says:  Look, we're not -- we're not going to 
issue a patent because you didn't show us that, you 
25

appeal or give up some of his patent -- the patent term 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if -- what if 

16
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 Is that the type of new evidence that could 

be admitted? 

because I didn't have any idea that that was going to be 

1  know, the valve in the back of the thing or whatever 
2  was -- was novel, and we think that's important.  So --
3  and the applicant goes to, under 145, to the district 
4  court and said:  Well, I didn't submit that evidence 
5
6  a significant issue, and I'm -- you know, I'm sorry, 
7  but, you know, I have a good basis for not thinking of 
8  that, and here it is. 
9
10
11
 MS. ANDERS:  Well, in the first instance, 
12  the PTO's procedures actually provide -- they actually 
13  provide for this situation, and that's when the Board or 
14  the examiner enters a new ground of rejection.  Then, at 
15
16  prosecution that -- introduce new evidence --
17
18  exception?  I thought you were telling us earlier you 
19  generally can't get --
20
21 
22
23
24  there's a new ground of decision.  That is something 
that Mr. Hyatt could have tried to take advantage of. 
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh. 
 MS. ANDERS:  -- that would apply when 

MS. ANDERS:  Right.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  This 

is -- this is an exception --

grounds of rejection, and the panel affirmed that. 

 But to get back to the difference between 

in equity under 145.  So, Congress separated this in 
1927, and it appears from the legislative history that 
it's concerned with streamlining the proceeding and 
having more efficiency in -- in patent appeals. 

1  He -- he didn't.  He simply sought rehearing.  But in 
2  any event, both the district court -- the district court 
3  carefully considered the Board's grounds of rejection 
4  and decided that this wasn't -- that these weren't new 
5
6
7  141 and 145, I think Congress separated these two 
8  proceedings out in 1927.  Before that, you had gotten an 
9  appeal first on the record and then -- and then the bill 
10
11 
12

15
16  the majority of applicants, who wouldn't have new 
17  evidence, who could go to 141 and simply get a final 
18  decision from a court after one court proceeding in the 
19  court of appeals.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, you do -- in that 

1  oral testimony and because certainly, at the time, oral 
2  testimony was a major concern in interference 
3  proceedings, where you'd often have two inventors saying 
4  I invented it first; no, I invented it first.  And you'd 
have this credibility fight.  So, it was very important 
5

7  those applicants.

19  time.  But I think the -- the other alternative, to 
treat 145 as an entirely de novo proceeding that allows 
20
21  any new evidence that the applicant failed without cause 
22  to present to the PTO, thereby obtaining de novo review,

1  Judge Newman's view, but the en banc court took the 
2  middle position.  Often, in trial court evidence 
3  problems, the judge says, well, it goes to its weight, 
4  not the admissibility.  And it seems to me that's what 
Judge -- the en banc majority was saying, that the fact 
5
6  that it was not presented before or that it points in a 
7  different direction from what the PTO found goes to its 
8  weight, not its admissibility.  In other words, they 
9  will give consideration to the fact that it wasn't 
introduced and -- and maybe discount it as a result, 
10
11  unless there's a reason.  So, it just depends on the 
12  facts of the case. 
13
14  the en banc majority correctly?  And, number two, why 
isn't that a sensible way to interpret the statute so, 
15
16  as Justice Ginsburg is suggesting, you give some meaning 
17  to 145?  It's -- it performs a function that 141 does 
18  not.

20
21  that administrative deference principles didn't weigh

23  give more weight to the new evidence.

 Number one, am I reading or am I summarizing

 But that is not an adequate response, we 

don't think, because this is still de novo review.  So,

for deferential "thorough conviction" review when 

1  once the applicant introduces new evidence, the manner 
2  in which the district court evaluates the PTO's 
3  conclusions has entirely changed.  This is no longer a 
4  deferential standard looking at the evidence.  This is 
actually a de novo review, with no deference given to 
5
6  any of the PTO's factfindings, even on the evidence 
7  before it.  And we don't think that's a sensible way to 
8  read the statute because there's no basis in the text of 
9  the statute for a bifurcated standard that would provide 
10
11  there's no new evidence, but then de novo --
12
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, then -- then you're 
13  saying that we -- that we should choose either between 
14  your position or Judge Newman's position.
 MS. ANDERS:  Well, Judge Newman's position I 
15
16  think is inconsistent with Morgan, because Morgan was a 
17  section -- Revised Statute 4915 action.  It was a 145 
18  action with no new evidence.  And the Court there said 
19  that the "thorough conviction" standard should apply 
because this was administrative review.  So, to hold 
20
21  that 145 requires de novo review even when there's no 
22  new evidence would be to overrule Morgan. 
23
24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not sure why --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Morgan only talked about 

the standard of review; isn't that right?  Morgan has

 MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think Morgan did not 

1  very little to say about what types of evidence ought to 
2  be admitted in this proceeding.  And one thing we could 
3  do is to separate out these two things and say, you 
4  know, we think that there's a basis for one, for, let's 
say, giving the government a fairly deferential standard 
5
6  of review -- call it clear and convincing, call it 
7  thorough conviction -- but go the other way, rule 
8  against you, on the evidentiary point, which Morgan says 
9  nothing about.
10
11  directly address this -- the admissibility of new 
12  evidence, but by saying that the PTO is the primary 
13  decisionmaker and that the court should not lightly set 
14  aside what the PTO does, it invoked administrative 
deference principles, which in turn show why all of the 
15
16  reasonably available evidence needs to be presented to 
17  the agency. 
 And -- I do think that it -- it wouldn't 
18
19  make sense to have a de novo standard of review for 
20
21  based on this Court's decision in Microsoft.  There, the 
22  Court rejected the argument that a third party who had 
23  no opportunity to present evidence to the PTO should not 
24  be held to as high a standard of review.  So, it would 
25

be particularly perverse here to say that de novo review

review, which is de novo, new, with the -- the burdens

5
6  that attach to the proof.  Those are two different 
7  concepts.  And so, that's what Microsoft said.  Don't

23  presumption of validity and the need to give deference 
24  to the PTO's determinations are essentially two ways 
25

often give more weight or presumptive weight to some 
facts as opposed to others.  And that's what I think 
Morgan was talking about.  Morgan was very clear: 
Whether it was new evidence or not, you give -- you 
accept as valid whatever the PTO does, and you require 
to be thoroughly convinced by new evidence or not that 
they were wrong.

validity, and there it relied on Morgan. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I have two problems with 

relying just on legislative history.  I'm relying that 
the legislative history is replete with the commissioner 
of patents himself saying that section 145 required de 
novo review.  And witness after witness tried to argue 
for Congress to change it, and it didn't, arguing that 
it required de novo review. 

1  presumption of -- of validity comes from the assumption 
2  that the agency is presumed to do its job.  That's what 
3  Judge Rich said.  And that in turn is what the Court 
4  said in RCA, where it announced the presumption of 
5
6
7  your argument.  The first is -- and I know that it may 
8  be unique to me because many of my colleagues say that 
9  you don't rely on legislative history, but I'm not

18
19  1927 and 1945 you have Barrett on your side.  But there 
are plenty of courts, including the Second Circuit, and 
20
21  a very respected jurist, Learned Hand, saying that if 
22  you exclude new evidence, it should only be if it's on 
23  principles of estoppel, that someone intentionally 
24  withheld evidence from the PTO.

the early 20th century after Morgan had construed this 

1  doesn't basic -- that doesn't support your basic 
2  argument? 
 MS. ANDERS:  I think the record does support 
3
4  our argument, Justice Sotomayor, because what you see in 
5
6  as administrative review -- you referred to the 1927 
7  hearings.  There, I think many of the people used the 
8  phrase "de novo" in a very loose way that probably was a 
9  result of its dating before the APA.  They referred to

17 
 I do think it's notable that every time 
18
19  there was an objection in the cases before 1952, the 
courts applied limitations on new evidence.  Dowling, 
20
21  the case you referred to -- that was -- that was dicta; 
22  the court discussed the standard but didn't actually 
23  apply it there.  And so, I think the most natural 
24  inference is that in 1952, Congress looked to Morgan and 
25

it mostly as -- as a contrast between the original 
action and the appeal.  And that's the same thing you 
see in the early cases.  For instance, Globe-Union 
referred to this as a de novo proceeding, even as it 
said that the thorough conviction standard should apply 
and new evidence should be limited because this was 
administrative.  So, I don't think you can place very 
much weight on the use of the term "de novo."

 If I could reserve the balance of my time. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
 Mr. Panner.

1  administrative review proceeding. 
2
3
4
5
6
7
8  please the Court: 
9
10
11  long history of the provision, and this Court's 
12  constructions of its predecessors all make clear that 
13  the Government's argument that a plaintiff is barred 
14  from introducing new evidence in an action under section 
15
16  circumstance where the applicant had no opportunity to 
17  introduce the substance of that evidence, is incorrect. 
 Section 145 does not follow the modern norm 
18
19  of on-the-record review.  Such review is afforded under 
sections 141 to 144.  And no principle of administrative 
20
21  law supports the Government's "no opportunity" standard 
22  in situations where Congress has authorized a trial de 
23  novo to obtain relief from adverse agency action. 
24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The problem I have 
with your submission:  You say there are basically two 

26
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Under 145, you can add new evidence, you 

to the extent you can -- can do that. 

 Why would anybody proceed under section 141 

MR. PANNER:  Yes, Your Honor. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- on which you 

1  routes to get review of a denial by the Patent Office. 
2  The first is, under 141, you appeal to the Federal 
3  Circuit, right, and in that situation, you're limited to 
4  the record before the agency --
5
6
7  lost.  And there's deference to the agency, which ruled 
8  against you. 
9
could address questions that the PTO raised, saying you 
10
11  don't -- you haven't dealt with this valve in the back, 
12  and you could say, well, here's new evidence dealing 
13  with that.  There's no deference to the agency, and to 
14  some extent you can pick which judge you want to hear, 
15
16
17  instead of 145? 
18
19  about what is permitted under section 145, it is correct 
that new evidence can be permitted to go to issues that 
20
21  have been properly ruled on by the PTO in the course of 
22  ruling on the ex parte application. 
 The reason that appeals to the -- to the 
23
24  Federal Circuit are quite common is because often the 
issue that is the basis for the rejection is a legal 
25

 MR. PANNER:  Well, Your Honor, to be clear

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, that in -- in 

 MR. PANNER:  Well, Your Honor, if you had 

question as to which new evidence is relevant, where the 

1  issue.  And as to those issues, there's de novo review 
2  in the Federal Circuit.  The Federal Circuit will be 
3  ruling on those legal issues in time in any event.  It 
4  is really in the circumstance where there is a factual 
5

9  issue, you would go under 145?
10
11  evidence that you wanted to present, and the remedies at 
12  the PTO were inadequate for one reason or another.  But 
13  in thinking about the practical implications of the 
14  procedural option that section 145 affords, it's 
15
16  place for generations, and it has been understood by the 
17  patent bar as reflected in decisions of the --
18
19  That's why I'm -- I'm really confused, because I take it 
20
21  always appeal to the Federal Circuit. 
22
23  of cases involving rejections that are taken up into

often have an adequate remedy before the PTO.  But where

4  grounds, because the grounds of written description had 
5
6  the reasoning that justified the rejection was quite new 
7  in the decision of the Board and where there were --

11  the support for these elements --

13  Ms. Anders told us that there's a procedure before the 
14  PTO that lets you deal with these -- that sort of

18  Ms. Anders was referring to, I believe, is the 
19  possibility to reopen where there are new grounds for a

22  applicant did argue in -- in filing for rehearing that 
23  the explanation that the Board had provided was one that 
24  he had not been able to discern from the examination --

something came up that you didn't think about, and you

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you think -- in terms of

3  lacking for the features that were -- where the Board 
4  eventually did -- did affirm, there is no explanation as 
to what element was missing, why the -- why the feature 
5
6  was not supported in the specification.  The Board

11  the second question on the standard of review, I'm 
12  somewhat -- I'd like your response to the approach, that 
13  where there's ambiguity -- I mean, you're going to win 
14  if there's no ambiguity.  But if there's ambiguity, I 
15
16  that time, every agency went its own way, and you had 
17  dozens of specialized methods of review.  And the whole 
18  purpose of 50 years of administrative law has been to 
19  try to create uniformity across agencies in a vast 
20
21
22  the first case and this case, too --
23
24
25

 MR. PANNER:  Yes, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  -- is that we're chipping 

away at that, and that will be very hard for lawyers and

 And if you just look at the record in this

 And now, what was obviously worrying me in 

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

I'm sure.
 

 But that's -- that's why I'm saying if
 

 MR. PANNER:  Right.  Well, there's really
 
two points, Your Honor:  With respect to standard of 

1  for ordinary people to understand if we suddenly go back 
2  and create specialized rules in favor of each agency 
3  that always wants a specialized rule, of course; they 
4  think what they do is terribly important, which it is,

11  review, which is separate from the question of the 
12  admissibility of the evidence -- on standard of review, 
13  the APA says that where there's a trial de novo, the 
14  standard is whether the finding is unwarranted by the 
15
16
 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's -- that begs the 
17  question in a sense because they're interlinked.  I 
18  mean, the same reasons would support that it's not a

20
21
22  trial with some new evidence, and there will be a 
23  thousand different variations on that theme. 
24
25

 MR. PANNER:  Well, I think that --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  It is a -- it is an old 

 MR. PANNER:  I think that goes to Justice 

Sotomayor's point really, which is that there is a trial 

facts under (2)(F).  So --

31
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So, the new 

part -- I get that. 

 MR. PANNER:  Okay.  And then the question 

1  de novo, and clearly at a minimum what the courts are 
2  talking about when they refer to this, not 5 times, not 
3  10 times, but dozens of times, this Court several times, 
4  lower courts pervasively, when they are talking about a 
de novo proceeding, they're talking about the fact that 
5
6  the applicant can introduce new evidence to attempt to 
7  overcome the adverse action that was -- was entered by 
8  the agency. 
9
10
11
12  becomes, what is the appropriate standard of review when 
13  there is new evidence going to this question?  And the 
14  answer here goes I think to -- section (2)(F) says that 
there's a -- the question is whether it's warranted by 
15
16  the facts.  There is then the question of what weight 
17  may be afforded to a particular agency -- agency 
18  determination.  At a minimum, the fact that there has 
19  been a rejection shifts the burden.  When an applicant 
goes to the PTO, there's an assumption of an entitlement 
20
21  to patent, unless the PTO can show that the applicant is 
22  not entitled to that patent.  So, the burden is on the 
23  PTO. 
24
25

 Once there has been a proper rejection by 
the agency and the Board has ruled, then the applicant 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  bears the burden.  So, at a minimum, there has been a 
2  shifting.  And the applicant would then bear the burden. 
3  And as a practical matter, as the Federal Circuit 
4  indicated, the district judge will weigh the evidence 
before it, including the new evidence and the findings 
5
6  by the agency, in making its determination as to whether 
7  the applicant has carried -- carried his burden to show 
8  that he's entitled to the patent. 
9
what -- how does he articulate the weight that he gives 
10
11  to what the PTO find?  Does he say I give deference to 
12  this?  I give substantial deference?  This was all 
13  discussed -- page 9 of your brief, you summarized what 
14  the majority opinion of the en banc court did.
15
16
17  this same line, do you -- do you agree with that 
18  summary? 
19
20
21  determining the weight to give to new evidence and 
22  determining what weight to give to the determined --
23  prior determination of the agency, it's appropriate for 
24  the district court to look at the circumstances of the 
new evidence.  And one of the things that's -- this is 
25

 MR. PANNER:  I do, Your Honor.  That is to 
say that what the Federal circuit recognized is that in 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If the judge does that, 

 MR. PANNER:  Yes, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And in that connection, on 

33
 

Alderson Reporting Company

the Board decide, what was the basis for that, how 
strongly supported is it, versus how -- how -- to what 
extent is this new evidence something that really 
requires me to look at this anew. 

1  an equitable -- well, was an equitable action.  And, of 
2  course, the judge is sitting without a jury. 
 In Microsoft, there was obviously concern by 
3
4  this Court that there not be shifting standards of proof 
that would be confusing to a jury and could lead to 
5
6  collateral litigation about that.  Where a district 
7  judge is making a determination about a factual issue, 
8  the district judge can as a practical matter quite 
9  reasonably determine what was before the Board, what did 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  some other agency review proceeding that is somewhat 
17  like this, or is this just unique? 
18
19  unique at all, Your Honor.  That is to say, for example, 
in proceedings where there's orders to pay money by the 
20
21  FCC, the findings of the agency are given prima facie 
22  weight in an action -- in an enforcement action.  And 
23  so, new evidence is permitted, and the district judge 
24  would make a determination based on the record and the 
new evidence.  But the party or the agency seeking to

11  new evidence that can be produced?  Are there any 
12  limits, in your view? 
13
 MR. PANNER:  Well, Your Honor, I think that 
14  the principle of estoppel that was recognized in Barrett 
is not one that we're -- we're challenging.  That is to 
15
16  say, in a circumstance in which an applicant -- and, of 
17  course, that was an interference proceeding, and it's 
18  perhaps easier to foresee this happening in an 
19  interference context, but in that case, the plaintiff 
had actually suppressed, had directed witnesses not to 
20
21  answer questions that went into a particular factual 
22  area and then, when -- after appeal and when the 
23  district court action was brought, attempted to 
24  introduce the very evidence that he had -- that the 
25

applicant had deliberately suppressed.  And the district

7  simply saying unless the -- unless the person, the 
8  potential patentee, unless he wants to -- unless he has 
9  shown he can show that he's innocent, that is to say it 
wasn't deliberate, it wasn't negligent, it wasn't a part 
10
11  of a trial -- of a strategy, unless he shows he was 
12  totally without sin in some form of words in not 
13  introducing the evidence the first time, he can't 
14  introduce it now?
 MR. PANNER:  I think the difficulty with 
15
16  that, Your Honor, is not only is it inconsistent with 
17  the practice of the courts, which have always recognized 
18  that, but it also ignores the fact that there needs to 
19  be decisions that an applicant makes about what evidence 
to present to the PTO.  And there may be good cause for 
20
21  not presenting evidence in the PTO that becomes quite 
22  relevant once --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, say that.  Say unless 
23
24  he can show that there was good cause for his not having 
introduced it before the PTO, he -- the -- the court now

2
3  we would certainly meet that good cause standard in this 
4  case, but the thing that I think is difficult about that 
standard is that it could potentially lead to all sorts 
5
6  of collateral litigation.  In a typical case, for 
7  example, an applicant will seek to introduce new expert 
8  testimony that either was not or was -- is additional to 
9  whatever was at issue -- was offered in the PTO.  Often, 
10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, give us a standard 
13  and how is what -- the good cause that you're somehow 
14  willing to accept different from the Government's 
reasonable cause standard?  And equity seems to have 
15
16  required an intentional or bad faith withholding.  Is 
17  that what you want to limit yourself to?  What do you do 
18  with sort of the in between?  The intentional and the 
19  grossly negligent.
20
21  the proper standard is -- does not permit exclusion of 
22  evidence because there was good cause to present it and 
23  it was not. 
24
25

 MR. PANNER:  Justice Sotomayor, to be clear, 

 The standard for -- which we think is 

supported in the cases is one that would permit the 

37

administrative review contexts, would be -- would be 

What would be the contours of your equity limits? 

 MR. PANNER:  And I think that looking at the 

1  introduction of evidence as the Federal Circuit said 
2  consistent with the rules of evidence and civil 
3  procedure.  That's why principles of estoppel, which are 
4  reflected in ordinary equity practice, not just 
5
6  applicable and could lead to the exclusion of evidence. 
7
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And what do you see the 
8  limits of that estoppel -- equity principles?  I think 
9  that's what Justice Breyer was -- was referring to. 
10
11
12  -- at the cases that were decided before 1952, which 
13  everyone seems to -- to agree is -- is the magic date, 
14  the furthest that any court went was the decision in 
15
16  in this case also relied on the idea in Barrett. 
17
18  unfair, to characterize the cases as limited to that. 
19  Some talked about negligence.

21
22  should be intentional.  There was a debate back and 
23  forth.

 MR. PANNER:  Not --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a little bit

 So, that's a very different circumstance. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes, I agree. 
 MR. PANNER:  -- was from Barrett, and that 

1  evidence --
2
3
4  was a case that involved, again, directing a witness not 
to answer, the suppression of inquiry into a particular 
5
6  factual area where the applicant then -- changing his 
7  story and claiming a different date for reduction of 
8  practice and a different basis for reduction to practice 
9  than had been argued before the PTO -- attempted to 
10
11
12  And the courts -- the decisions are actually at pains to 
13  say that Barrett should not be over-read.  The Third 
14  Circuit in the Carborundum case said that; the Nichols 
case, which we've we cited in our brief, said that; and 
15
16  of course, as you pointed out, Judge Hand observed that 
17  in the -- in the Dowling case.  Globe-Union said that. 
18  So, even the cases that the Government itself relied on 
19  were -- accepted evidence, despite the arguments that 
were made by the defendants in those cases that this was 
20
21  evidence that should have been excluded because it could 
22  have been presented, and -- and did consider it. 
23
24  been a lot of discussion about Morgan and the standard 
of review and what Morgan has to say about that.  And 
25

 And that brings us, I think -- there has 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

cases. 

 What's critical in Morgan is the fact that 

was then adopted by Congress in section 282 as a 

1  the critical point that this Court recognized in 
2  Microsoft was that Morgan is one of the early cases and 
3  then -- and Radio Corporation is another that depend on 
4  an idea of the presumption of validity, which of course 
5
6  statutory presumption, that was given that common law 
7  meaning that required clear and convincing evidence. 
8  But the clear and convincing evidence is to overcome the 
9  grant of a property right to the defendant in those 
10
11
12  the -- the Patent Office had granted a patent to the 
13  defendant, and it was a challenge to the validity of 
14  that patent that the plaintiff's case relied on.  And 
it's -- and that's absolutely clear because the Court 
15
16  cites to Johnson v. Towsley, which is a case involving a 
17  land grant.  And what the Court says is our presumption 
18  is that when the executive has the power to give 
19  property rights, we don't get to review it.
20
21  exception because there's a statute that actually tells 
22  us we have to do it, but that exception is going to be 
23  limited.  But if you look at what Morgan relies on, 
24  Morgan is not relying on agency expertise; it's relying 
on agency authority, which is a different matter.  And 
25

 Now, in this case, we see a limited 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

right being challenged in an action where there was an 

1  so -- and the authority that the agency had to grant a 
2  property right.  In the -- in the conception of a -- of 
3  the court of 1893 and the administrative law that 
4  existed in 1893, the fact that there was no property 
5
6  effort to overcome a rejection means that this idea 
7  about the presumption of the validity of the rights that 
8  had been granted by an executive department doesn't come 
9  into play.  There had been no rights granted by the 
executive department, and there's a new proceeding in 
10
11  which, to quote Professor Merrill's article, the court 
12  had "the whole case."  And that's really reflected in 
13  the language that Congress chose. 
14
between what Congress provided under section 145 and the 
15
16  modern administrative review do lead to some -- to some 
17  questions.  There is the question, you know, what should 
18  the standard be if there is no new evidence?  Which --
19  you know, which the court looked at.
20
21  -- you're not taking the position that Judge Newman did. 
22  I think -- didn't you say that if no new evidence is 
23  introduced in a 145 proceeding, then the court engages 
24  in APA-style review?
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And on that I think you 

 Now, of course, that -- the differences

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that -- and that --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you agree with that?
 MR. PANNER:  We haven't taken a position on 

1  that if there -- that all -- all findings should be de 
2  novo in a section 145 action, but the -- the majority of 
3  the en banc court said that if there's no new 
4  evidence -- relying on what the Federal Circuit had held 
5
6  the standard would be the substantial evidence standard 
7  that would apply on appeal. 
8
9
10
11  it, but let me suggest --
12
13
14  Honor, which is that section 141 and section 144 do --
this Court in -- you know, held in Zurko that once you 
15
16  are in a situation where there is no new evidence -- and 
17  as an aside, Zurko emphasized that Morgan was a case 
18  that was on no new evidence.  Where you have a case 
19  that's on no new evidence, there -- the APA standard of 
20
21  review, applies.  And it might -- this might be the sort 
22  of narrow circumstance where to apply a de novo 
23  standard, even though that may be otherwise suggested by 
24  the language of section 145, would create an anomaly, as

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It seems to me you were

3  get out of substantial deference under the APA just has 
4  to present an expert.  That -- that's what makes little 
sense to me, trying to -- now we're hair-splitting in a 
5
6  very minute way. 
7
8  think --
9
that would -- Newman is suggesting total de novo review 
10
11  with no reference to any kind of presumption applied to 
12  the PTO decision.  Another way --
13
14

16  there's new evidence or not; what is the level of 
17  respect that you are going to give to the PTO factual 
18  findings? 
19
20
21  preponderance of the evidence.  And the question of what 
22  weight -- as the Federal Circuit said, what weight to 
23  afford to that prior finding of the PTO would depend on 
24  what the record showed.  That is the -- as the facts of 
the case may appear -- in section 145, it requires the

6  language of Morgan deals with the circumstance in which 
7  there's a challenge to the validity of an issued patent.

23  the PTO, and they say no, we've had it.  I mean, there 
24  we are.  But if we hold back something, well, then we're 
25

patent to the applicant; it was the fact that the PTO 
had issued a patent to the defendant in that case.  And 
so, there was a collateral attack, effectively a 
collateral challenge to the validity of that issued 
patent.  And that's why Radio Corporation of America 
cites Morgan, and that's how, you know, it's relevant to

heightened standard of proof.

advantage because once --

14  sorry.  Go ahead.
 MR. PANNER:  I think because it's -- it's 
15
16  frankly more straightforward and easier to try to meet 
17  those objections in the Office.  That's what usually 
18  happens, is that there's a dialogue with the examiner to 
19  try to meet the grounds for rejection.
 One of the things that I think is important 
20
21  to take into account with respect to the context of this 
22  case is there were a vast number of rejections.  There 
23  was not just a rejection on written-description and 
24  enablement grounds, but there were rejections for double 
25

patentings; there were rejections for anticipation; 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Because -- I'm 

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company

overcome in the appeal before the Board.  And at -- with 

and with respect to every single one of those, the Board 

1  there were rejections for obviousness.  And every single 
2  one -- every single one -- of those grounds for 
3  rejection was overcome in the appeal before the Board. 
4  And many of the written-description rejections were 
5
6  respect to every one, if one goes back and reads the 
7  examiner's decision, the examiner did provide an 
8  explanation as to what was lacking with respect to 
9  certain -- certain elements of the claimed invention, 
10
11  reversed. 
12
 So, where the applicant was provided a fair 
13  opportunity to try to meet the concerns, the applicant 
14  did so, and the Board ruled in his favor.  And he again 
15
16  The -- the applicant brought these arguments to the 
17  Board in the rehearing petition, in the request for 
18  rehearing, and said here's my answer to your more 
19  focused explanation.  And they -- they refused to hear 
20
21
22  and you don't have to take my word for it, again, 
23  because this procedure has been in place for so long, 
24  and problems have not arisen.  And even if there were 
25

 So, as a practical matter, I think that --

attempted -- there's no question of sandbagging here. 

uncertainty as to what the precise standard for 

46
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess, as a 

1  admissibility was, the applicants would have every
 
2  reason to test that and to -- to try to do something
 
3  along that line if that were a realistic option and
 
4  favorable.

 The fact of the matter is that that has not 
5
6  happened because the applicants have every reason in the 
7  world to pursue the application with vigor before the 
8  Office.  And the Federal Circuit, which, of course, is 
9  more familiar with the -- the patent application process 
than any other court, had no concerns that the rule that 
10
11 
they were adopting would lead to abuses. 
12
13  practical matter, these things all end up before the 
14  Federal Circuit anyway, right?
 MR. PANNER:  That's right, Your Honor. 
15
16
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And I suppose that 
17  -- if you had the same case and one is coming up under 
18  the 141 and the other under 145, I suppose it's 
19  theoretically possible they could reach different 
results because of different standards of review. 
20
21
22  both. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  I know. 
23
24  I'm not saying -- the point is that although they all 
come before the Federal Circuit, they may come to them 
25

 MR. PANNER:  Well, Your Honor, you can't do 

47
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. PANNER:  Well, Your Honor, I -- it 

wouldn't be on the same record. 

1  in a very different posture that would cause the Federal 
2  Circuit to rule differently if you had the same case 
3  under one and under the other. 
4
5
6
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right. 
7
 MR. PANNER:  If it were on the same record, 
8  then presumably the -- the issue that would be presented 
9  would be quite similar.  The only time I can see that --
10

18 
19 
20

24  Mr. Panner.
25

so, in other words, if there were a different record, 
it's true that the Federal Circuit's review of the 
district decision would be -- it would be the difference 
that this Court recognized in Zurko.  It would be the 
court/court standard of review, which is -- gives 
perhaps slightly less weight to the decision of the 
district court than the court/agency review.  But that 
doesn't seem like an advantage.  In the -- in a 
circumstance at least where an applicant has prevailed, 
the applicant would be more likely to see the victory 
taken away by the Federal Circuit. 

 Unless the Court has questions.

determination, and, therefore, Morgan's deferential 

 MS. ANDERS:  Thank you.
 
 This is an action for judicial review of
 

1
2
3
4
agency determination.  This is an action that -- that 
5
6  requires the patent applicant to -- to seek a property 
7  right from the agency, to have it denied, and to 
8  challenge that in court.  And as a result, this Court 
9  said in Zurko that this is review of an agency 
10
11  standard should be carried forward into the APA. 
12
 And in construing Morgan, the Court in Zurko 
13  did not consider that it was -- whether a property right 
14  had been awarded or not; it was simply that the agency 
had made a determination in its expertise.  And I think 
15
16  that goes to why it would not be sufficient for the 
17  court simply to weigh the evidence differently.  In 
18  every other agency -- judicial review proceeding of 
19  agency action, the rule is that the agency is the 
20
21  evidence first and make a determination.  That aids 
22  judicial review.  It allows the agency to apply its 
23  expertise.  And we generally don't think of the court as 
24  being the one who should make the first determination on

10
11 
that evidence to something that could not have been 
found with due diligence or whatever your limitations 
12 
13 
are, why did it speak more broadly?  I mean, the 
statutory language suggests "as the facts in this case," 
14 
not in the case before the PTO.  As law and -- "as
