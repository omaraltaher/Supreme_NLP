CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first this morning in Case 15-1194 Packingham v. North 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carolina. 

            

Mr. Goldberg. 

 

           

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID T. GOLDBERG 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

There are three principal features of North 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carolina's law that make it a stark abridgement of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Freedom of Speech. 

 

 

            

First, Section 202.5 reaches vast swaths of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

core First Amendment activity that is totally unrelated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the government's preventative purpose. 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Packingham is not accused of communicating with or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

viewing the profile of a minor.  He violated Section 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

202.5 by speaking to his friends and family about his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

experience in traffic court.  And if today he were to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view or respond to any of the thousands of Twitter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

messages about his case in this Court, that would be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felony. 

            

Second, the law does not operate in some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sleepy First Amendment quarter.  It operates and forbids

speech on the very platforms on which Americans today 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

are most likely to communicate, to organize for social 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change, and to petition their government. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

go ahead. 

 

            

Third, Section 202.5 --

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Please go ahead.  Please 

  

  

 

 

 

MR. GOLDBERG:  -- is a criminal law, Your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Honor, that imposes punishment for protected First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment activity without any regard to individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

culpability or lack of culpability. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could a State impose this 

   

  

 

 

 

restriction as a condition of parole? 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Your Honor, I think they have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

much more authority to impose things as a condition of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parole, and -- and States do this all the time, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they -- they -- they limit people's First Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights.  I think that they -- if you had something that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was as sweeping as this, for life, for anybody who had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed a sex offense, I don't think they could do 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

            

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Didn't --

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But they are --

  

 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Ginsburg. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The most fundamental

right is taken away from ex -- fundamentals by some --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some States prohibit ex-felons from voting.  Some States 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Federal government prohibits keeping and bearing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

arms.  Those are constitutional rights. 

  

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Right, Your Honor.  So both 

  

  

 

 

 

 

of those rights are different from the First Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They are equally fundamental, but they are different. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So in the case of voting, North Carolina does not take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away -- North Carolina draws the line at people who have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

completed their parole, their period of supervised 

 

 

 

 

 

 

release. 

            

But in Richardson v. Ramirez, the Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked to the text and history and tradition and said in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment there was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

affirmative sanction for felon disenfranchisement.  If 

  

 

 

 

 

you look at that same section, which dealt with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people who rebelled in the Civil War, you didn't need to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restore their First Amendment rights. 

 

 

 

 

            

And -- and with the Second Amendment, when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somebody is convicted of a crime, they immediately lose 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

their Second Amendment rights.  They don't lose their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

First Amendment rights.  So in the Simon & Schuster 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

case, this Court vindicated the rights of somebody who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was a serial killer who wanted to write from prison, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where he was serving a life sentence for murder, about

his experience.  So --

  

 

 

6 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's a little 

   

  

 

 

difficult to -- you said look at the text and history. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We don't have a lot of history here concerning access to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

websites and all the sort of things we're dealing with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here.  So I don't think that's a very useful guide. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  I agree, Your Honor.  But I 

    

  

 

 

 

 

think when you look at what -- when we talk about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history, the history is there isn't a tradition or a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history of taking away people's First Amendment rights. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When the Court said First Amendment rights are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inalienable, it has -- meaning when people --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  My point is, though, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you don't have a lot of history of having -- having such 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sites or access where they can provide broad access to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minors of the sort that is problematic with respect to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this individual. 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Well, I don't disagree -- we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

know as with violent video games, as with any manner of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new technologies the Court has confronted, there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't -- there isn't a framing era or -- or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reconstruction-era analogue.  But there is no history 

  

 

 

 

 

 

when you talk about all of the things that the State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

historically has restricted, they never said you lose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your right to publish a newspaper because you've been 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

convicted --

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose we try to translate 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

this into terms that would be familiar at the time of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the adoption of the First Amendment.  So suppose the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State enacted a law prohibiting anyone convicted of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

kidnapping children from visiting a nursery school. 

   

 

 

 

 

Would -- would that be a violation of the First 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment? 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  I don't think so, Your Honor. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Obviously, at the framing, the First Amendment didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply to the states.  But the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

was --

 

            

            

Columbia. 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  Suppose it 

  

  

 

 

 

MR. GOLDBERG:  All right. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  -- in the District of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GOLDBERG:  So, Your Honor, the -- a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

kindergarten -- first of all, I don't know that there's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a First Amendment right to visit a kindergarten.  And 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's fundamental here.  This law only applies in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

places where everything that happens is a First 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment activity, whether it's receiving information, 

 

 

 

 

 

speaking, associating, petitioning.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose the law simply 

  

 

 

 

 

8 

said that someone who was a sex offender could not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communicate with a minor on social media.  Would you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

agree that that would be constitutional? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Well, I think my first answer 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is that it would be much less restrictive, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shows why this law is unconstitutional; right?  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's exactly what the prosecutor --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well --

  

 

 

MR. GOLDBERG:  If you look at the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, there's a --

   

  

 

 

there's a concern here --

   

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- for the safety of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

children.  So I'm asking you -- yes, of course, it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less restrictive.  Would it be constitutional? 

  

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  I think --

    

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- and no communication 

  

 

 

 

 

with a minor? 

   

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  So I -- I think it probably 

   

   

  

 

 

 

would be, Your Honor.  I think that the difference here 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is if you take the test, the narrow-tailoring test, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is fundamentally a -- this Court had said in -- in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ward, a quantitative test, and you say, what percentage 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of what you suppress implicates the interest?  When

you're talking about communicating with minors or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

viewing the pages of minors, that is going to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

heartland of the protective interests that the State is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asserting. 

            

But here, everything that -- that they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppressing is -- as we've said, it's indifferent as to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it's core speech.  Obviously, Petitioner was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

convicted for saying, "Thank you, Jesus.  God is good" 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about a parking ticket to an audience. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But you think that even as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrowly tailored as Justice Ginsburg's example, so it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be a crime for a convicted sex offender -- or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's say someone who was convicted previously of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committing a sex offense using the Internet from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

contacting on the Internet a person who is known --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

known by that person to be a minor without the consent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the parents of the minor?  That would be a violation 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the First Amendment? 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  No.  I -- I -- I said I think 

    

   

   

   

  

 

that would be constitutional, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Oh, I thought you said it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

wouldn't be. 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  I'm sorry if I -- if I wasn't 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

clear about that.  I -- I would still say there are 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrow-tailoring questions.  I'm not here to say that

particular hypothetical law, that one of the concerns 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

with this law that I think you've -- you've handled by 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrowing it to a subset of people, this applies to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody on the registry, and it applies in a --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially on a statistical basis on the theory that as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a collective, they have a higher rate of recidivism than 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people on average. 

 

 

            

And I think this Court's First Amendment 

   

 

 

 

 

cases say that's a very problematic assumption to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

just -- and especially with a population like this that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is so heterogeneous and that is constantly being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evaluated on an individualized basis.  It's not clear to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me why you would take people's First Amendment rights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away for life if the theory --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do you think your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

best argument is?  Is this statute too overbroad?  Does 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it fail scrutiny, whatever level we adopt?  What's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the --

 

            

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Well, I -- I think --

   

   

  

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do you think -- I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know you say all of those things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Yes.  All of the above, Your 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  And this is not a case where the level of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

scrutiny is going to make a difference.

Browning, "Let me count the ways." 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Exactly, Your Honor.  So --

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but let me ask you: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Suppose there were an app -- a program in which officers 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could monitor your -- your video and your -- and your --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and your cyber -- and your cyber equipment and disclose 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you are communicating with minors.  Could that be a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law that every -- that every convicted person has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent to that -- to that app and to that surveillance? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Well, I think that goes to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the question of -- which you don't need to answer and I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want to answer Justice Sotomayor's question as well in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case.  What does the status of being a registrant 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean in terms of somebody's constitutional rights?  I --

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think that is clearly a much less restrictive from a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First Amendment perspective, because then, again, people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like Mr. Packingham, anybody who wants to do the things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that are harmless and fully protected is able to do it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

People have -- and it is -- is effective detection and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deterrent. 

            

So from a First Amendment perspective, 

   

 

 

 

that's a home run.  There is a Fourth Amendment question 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

there, which is, ordinarily, once you're done with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervised release, you have full --

run, who hit the home run? 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  I'm saying for the State, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor.  I think it does everything.  It's perfectly 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

tailored in a certain sense, except for the State has a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sense of -- of what you may be up to, which is a -- a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern.  But, essentially, they're able to deter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

people, detect people.  And the people who want to speak 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and exercise their core First Amendment rights --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

whatsoever. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I take it --

   

  

 

 

 

MR. GOLDBERG:  -- have no problem 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  I take it, Mr. Goldberg, 

    

 

 

 

 

that a part of what the State is saying here is that it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't have the capacity to do that.  It doesn't have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the capacity to check message-by-message or 

 

 

 

 

 

click-by-click what a person is doing.  And in the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

absence of that, that some kind of prophylactic remedy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is needed. 

 

            

And that's not unheard of in First Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law.  I mean, if you think of a case like Burson, which 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is the 50 feet with --

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- in the polling places, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that's kind of a prophylactic rule.  So why wouldn't the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

same be appropriate here?

MR. GOLDBERG:  Well -- well, Your Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we -- obviously, there are times when prophylactic rules 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

are permissible under the First Amendment. 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Packingham, when he was convicted, got a condition 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that said you shall not have any contact with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific victim of this crime.  That would -- otherwise, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if that were applied to you or me, that would be a -- an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abridgement of our freedom of speech. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So there's no general rule.  The Court has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

said repeatedly that you should be suspicious of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prophylactic rules because, ordinarily, you don't want 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to -- you want to allow people to speak.  But even as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we've been talking about rules like -- that are focused 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on teenagers on the Internet and having specific contact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with them, those are prophylactic rules too.  So I don't 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think it's -- the question is, can you do it at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first step?  And I think --

   

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What is -- what was your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer?  Which I forget.  A statute prohibits a 

    

   

  

 

 

convicted sex offender from being -- spending more than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

five minutes at a children's playground.  Is that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

constitutional or not? 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  I -- I think that's 

    

   

 

 

constitutional because --

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.

MR. GOLDBERG:  I -- I don't --

    

   

 

 

14 

JUSTICE BREYER:  If that's constitutional, 

  

 

 

 

instead of what most of the briefs do, is interpret the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute as broadly as possible, this is a facial 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge.  What about trying to interpret it as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrowly as possible?  And as narrowly as possible, it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems to me a necessary condition is that a violator 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

cannot go to a site that facilitates the social 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

introduction between two or more persons, and these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are -- these are children they're talking about, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guess -- for two or more persons for the purposes of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friendship, meeting other persons, or information 

 

 

 

 

 

exchanges.  So we have to say "or related information 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exchanges." 

            

And now we have a definition that sounds as 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

if they're talking about dating sites, or it sounds as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if they're talking about related play group sites, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you take younger children.  And is it possible to read 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it that way?  And if you do read it that way, is it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional? 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Well, Your Honor, a couple 

   

  

 

 

 

points.  The-- the first answer to the playground, we --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I think you start with, what is the First Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right that is being abridged?  I'm not sure that I see a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First Amendment right being abridged. 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  But that's what I --

   

  

  

 

 

 

15 

I wanted to be -- I wanted to get your answer, and I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think I have that. 

   

 

            

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  And then --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But I'm really interested 

  

 

 

 

 

in the narrow possibility of interpreting it narrowly, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as I said.  And on that basis, it's facially 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional, though it could be applied 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutionally.  That's what I want your answer to. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  So, Your Honor, this is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

criminal case.  It doesn't arise as a civil suit in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

district court.  This is first and foremost an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as-applied challenge because the relief that we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeking is to overturn the --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  You're not -- you're not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

attacking the statute.  You're only attacking it applied 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to your client? 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  In a criminal case, you --

   

  

 

 

 

 

the Court has the power to say -- and I think it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate in this case -- that this -- the problem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here is the problem for every application.  And that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what we've argued. 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. GOLDBERG:  And clearly --

to my question.  So I'm treating it as an as-applied 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge.  I don't want to just repeat the question. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I want to get your answer 

    

 

 

 

 

 

to the question. 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Right.  So -- so the answer 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

is, Your Honor, that this -- that narrow construction, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm not sure that -- that's possible, and that narrow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

construction isn't going to be -- in this case, make any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference, because as I understand your hypothetical 

   

 

 

 

 

statute or construction, that is not -- Mr. Packingham 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did not violate the law, but --

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Wait.  Don't you see, all 

  

  

 

 

 

 

I'm doing is reading one word before information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exchange.  And the word I'm reading is related 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

information exchange.  And as so interpreted, that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

clause, too, which you're much more familiar with than I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

am --

 

            

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Sure. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- seems to be talking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

about dating sites or the lower age level equivalent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  I don't --

    

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  If -- if that's -- it does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what it says, facilities the social introduction between 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two or more persons for the purposes of friendship,

I've now got it a social dating or equivalent site. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I think I can say that. 

    

   

 

 

 

Now, if I say that, is it constitutional?  That's what 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm trying to get your answer to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  If -- if it were limited to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dating sites, I'm assuming that it is constitutional, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Your Honor.  I don't think the State has ever said that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this is about dating sites.  They -- they say there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category of --

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, they couldn't 

  

 

 

 

because of your case. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Right.  Exactly. 

  

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So your case involved 

  

 

 

 

 

boasting about getting off a traffic ticket. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Right.  So -- so that -- that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is my first and most important point, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Packingham was not on a dating site. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  So then the answer to this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be they have not applied it that way here, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

given the way they've applied it here, they can't do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.

other cases involved. 

 

 

18 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  I don't think they've ever 

    

 

 

 

 

applied it.  I think the main focus -- dating sites tend 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have age restrictions that go -- apply only to adults 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and so I think it's their position that those are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

excluded from this.  I -- they're -- I think the State's 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

position, and you can hear from them, they've never 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposed that as a construction because they want to go 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after these -- these sites, the classic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

social-networking sites. 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Yeah, the -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

interpretation that Justice Breyer -- the -- the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language that Justice Breyer is referring to and other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language in this statute, I think, could, for the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose of avoiding First Amendment problems, be limited 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to core social networking sites, including Facebook and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things like Facebook, Google Plus, that sort of thing, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and excluding a lot of the other sites that the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

electronic frontier says are included, like the New York 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Times and Betty Crocker and things like that.  So it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be limited just to social networking sites. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Would you agree that it could be read at --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using constitutional avoidance, it could be narrowed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at least those? 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  So honestly, Your Honor, I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

not sure that it can, but it's very important for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional question that that is irrelevant.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

this goes back to Justice Sotomayor's question, which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was what is -- how do we win this case?  What is the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- what is the biggest problem with this statute? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the biggest problem is --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, just to put it in --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in context.  It -- it is important for purposes of an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as-applied challenge because if -- what your -- what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your client used was a social -- was Facebook, right? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay. 

  

 

MR. GOLDBERG:  So --

  

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Even if it were limited 

  

 

 

 

 

 

to -- to those --

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  You would say it's 

  

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional. 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Our -- our position -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the very reason we've talked about, which is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- just like the law in the Jews For Jesus airport 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case from Los Angeles that said no First Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity in this place, this is a law that says no First 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment activity, and it says it indiscriminate, so --

my problems with all of these sites today is that none 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

of them are purely -- or very few of them are purely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything anymore. 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Take something like 

  

 

 

 

LinkedIn, which many, many people in our society today 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are looking for jobs there, but high school students are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permitted to look for jobs and to post their data, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

personal data on that site. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

So, is that traditional social media or not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GOLDBERG:  I -- I think the State says 

    

   

 

 

 

 

that it is because it meets the definition. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I just want to get back to Justice Alito's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question --

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's my point, 

  

 

 

 

 

which is -- I'm -- Facebook, many people, many 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

businesses are using it for commercial advertising. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Right.  And -- and that's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

very true and -- and there was another defendant who was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecuted alongside Mr. Packingham who was an IT 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

person, Mr. Christian Johnson, and he lost his job 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because his employer said it's impossible for you to do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your job if you can't get on these sites, so --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even if you don't --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, all of -- all of

these questions implicate what Justice Sotomayor asked 

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier and I and others interrupted you. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

What is the category that we use?  If -- if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we rule for you, we say this statute is a violation of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the First Amendment because, what -- what are -- what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are the basic rules or the basic --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  So -- so the basic rules --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- doctrinal choices you 

  

 

 

 

 

offer us to say why this is unconstitutional? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Sure.  So the most 

  

  

 

 

 

straightforward, basic doctrinal basis to say it's not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrowly tailored and stop there or overbroad, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the flip side.  Sometimes overbroad is a -- is a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

confusing word because it has this third-party standing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dimension.  In the airport case, it was used to say this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes way too far because it prohibits lots of First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment speech. 

 

            

So if you just take the word narrow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tailoring test or you take the test in Frisby, in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Taxpayers v. Vincent where you say does this -- is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory of this law that it restricts speech on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility that that will lead to some other harm, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inherently is not going to be a narrowly tailored law. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Or you can look at it the way Weir did which -- which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said let's look at how much of -- is -- is protected

activity is suppressed, how much of that implicates this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose and, again, that's a really straightforward way. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now that -- we think, and our brief argues 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that there are multiple prongs.  If you go through every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prong of the word "analysis," this is a really stark 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case in terms of alternative channels.  This forecloses, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

as I said, some of the most important channels of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communication in our society. 

 

 

 

            

So -- so you could do that, you could say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that too.  But what -- what the Court said in McCullen 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is once you get -- if it's not narrowly tailored, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then it's unconstitutional and I don't see --

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, one of the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

I mean, under narrow tailoring, I think it's -- it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incumbent upon you to come up with a narrow -- more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

narrowly tailored alternative. 

 

 

            

So if you wanted to -- you're in the North 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carolina legislature and you're told you can't do this, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what would you do as the most effective alternative? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Well -- well, Your Honor, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

I -- I think the opinion in McCullen said it was not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incumbent on the challenger to come up with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative, but here it -- it said the State has to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show that it seriously considered alternatives, but --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What -- I thought you 

   

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

23 

agreed with me earlier that North Carolina could ban 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communicating with a minor --

   

 

 

            

            

            

that --

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- via social media. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. GOLDBERG:  Right.  So I think that --

   

  

  

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess in 

   

  

 

 

 

response to that is, well, how do you know that it's --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that it's a minor or -- or how is the -- I -- I mean, I 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assume that minors can put on -- they -- they don't have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have their age in their e-mail.  They don't have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communicate it in the text of the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Right.  So --

  

  

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- message that's 

  

 

 

 

 

put on the site.  So I -- I think the response might be 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that that's not terribly effective. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  So -- so two -- two answers 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to that.  First of all, if you look at page 11 of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blue brief where -- where there is the closing argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the -- the DA in this case, the DA lays out what --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again, this is not a case where we've come up with some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exotic theory about how you could narrow this law.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the DA says to the jury, in order to convict, you might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not like this law, you might prefer a law that says 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't have specific contact on Facebook with minor

children or a law that says don't say specific things 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

that might entrap teenagers, and this law doesn't say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  It doesn't.  But even if you don't agree with it, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if you don't like it, the law says you can't access. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So --

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe he doesn't say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it because it wouldn't work.  He doesn't say that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law would be perfectly fine.  He says here's an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative you might like.  Maybe the legislature 

  

 

 

 

 

 

didn't enact it because it made the -- concluded that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wouldn't be effective. 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think it would be effective or ineffective exactly the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same way this law is effective or ineffective. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The -- the premise -- one of the things that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the State argues about effectiveness is that this law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will prevent people from doing something.  The only way 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it prevents people is by punishing them and deterring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them.  It -- it doesn't enable the State to find people, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and as Justice Kennedy was asking about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

monitoring, that's a way that you can actually detect 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

what people are up to. 

 

 

 

 

            

The nature of this law is that it finds --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's most likely to find the people who are doing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing wrong, who have -- are doing innocent things. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

And if you envision the subcategory of predators who are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using the -- these sites, they -- and lurking on these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

sites, they are going to do their very best to hide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their identity. 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. -- Mr. Goldberg, why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

was your client using an alias? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  I -- I think --

    

   

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If he -- if he wasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lurking or otherwise trying to stay hidden? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  So, Your Honor, he wasn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

lurking.  I don't think there's any basis for saying he 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was lurking because they then looked at his hard drive. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They got the information from Facebook.  There are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes that they could have charged him with, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumably, if he was doing something that was a serious 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation involving teenagers, he would have been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prosecuted for something like that. 

 

 

 

 

            

So the alias that he was using was -- it --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I'll put that in -- in scare quotes -- was his name 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that he goes by and his middle name.  And his -- his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page had his picture, and he had a profile that linked 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to his father whose name is Lester G. Packingham, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Senior.  And so the officer in this case was able to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find him in about two seconds.  And obviously, he was

religion and his experience at court that --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Go back to Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Kennedy's question, if you would, which is, is there a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capacity to determine the age of a user; meaning, is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26 

there a way for the State to be able to track whether or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not a potential defendant is actually in communication 

   

 

 

 

 

 

with a minor. 

   

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Well, two things, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

This statute -- the State's description of the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has always -- they already have a law about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

communicating using the Internet with a minor.  So they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

already -- that's -- that's a different law.  Their 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

theory of this case is about the power to gather 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information. 

            

The second thing is that people's ages are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verified by Facebook.  And in a prosecution, if the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

assumption was that the person was younger than 18, they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would then be able to verify that by getting the records 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and finding out. 

 

 

            

If the Court has no further questions, I'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like to reserve the balance of my time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr. Montgomery. 

 

          

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. MONTGOMERY 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it please the Court: 

 

 

 

27 

            

For many years, North Carolina, like other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

States, had laws prohibiting sex offenders from being at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

physical places where children congregate; schools, 

 

 

 

 

 

playgrounds, day cares, and parks. 

 

 

 

 

            

In 2008, North Carolina decided to prohibit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sex offenders from being at virtual places where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children congregate online; specifically, commercial 

 

 

 

 

social networking websites. 

 

 

            

North Carolina passed Section 202.5 to cover 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the people most likely to sexually assault children. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Unlike some of the other alternatives -- or unlike the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternatives proposed, this law is enforceable and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effective. 

            

            

One of the things that was said --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Social networking, it 

  

 

 

 

includes Facebook, obviously; it includes LinkedIn; it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

includes Twitter; is that right? 

 

 

 

 

            

correct.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So -- so a -- so a person in 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

this situation, for example, cannot go onto the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President's Twitter account to find out what the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President is saying today?

Your Honor. 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  That -- that's correct, 

  

 

 

 

 

28 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Not only the President.  I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

mean, we're sort of aware of it because the President 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

now uses Twitter.  But in fact, everybody uses Twitter. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All 50 governors, all 100 senators, every member of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

House has a Twitter account.  So this has become a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

crucial -- crucially important channel of political 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communication.  And a person couldn't go onto those 

   

  

 

 

 

 

sites and find out what these members of our government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are thinking or saying or doing; is that right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  That's right.  However, 

  

  

 

 

there are alternatives.  Usually those congressmen also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

have their own web page.  As far as Twitter --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it seems to me, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't know if -- that we ever did have a public square, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but assuming we had a public square a hundred years ago, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

could you say that this person couldn't go into the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public square?  The -- the sites that Justice Kagan has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

described and their utility and their -- and their --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent of their coverage are -- are greater than the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communication you could ever had, even in the paradigm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of public square. 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  In essence, States have 

  

 

 

 

 

said that sex offenders can't go into the public square;

that they can't go into parks or they can't go into --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't go near playgrounds. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe those have the same 

  

 

 

 

 

 

problem.  I mean, why -- why?  Why are we trying to 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit that?  People all the time want to speak to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18-year-olds, 17-year-olds.  It doesn't -- it doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

limit this even to those that have sex problems with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children.  All right?  This is -- this is everybody 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

who's ever had a sex offense. 

   

 

 

 

            

And you're not -- you're, I take it, you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rejecting any effort that I might have hypothetically 

   

 

 

 

 

 

made to narrow the statute, and you're saying, hey, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nowhere.  Nowhere, really, because children are 

  

 

 

 

 

everywhere.  And I don't -- what is the difference?  I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

want to go to a park and I want to talk to 16-year-olds 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about helping get some petition drives.  You know, I can 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

make endless examples. 

 

 

            

So what's the basis here?  The State has a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason?  Yeah, it does.  Does it limit free speech? 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dramatically.  Are there other, less restrictive ways of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

doing it?  We're not sure, but we think probably, as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you've mentioned some.  Okay.  End of case, right? 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  No.  No.  Our position is 

  

  

  

 

 

 

there are not any enforceable least-restrictive ways for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this particular interest that the State has --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What about all the


  

 

 

 

 

orders -- about all the ways you just listed that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have all the statutes would say you can't approach 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children and say certain things.  You remember you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

30 

started that way. 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Certainly.  And -- and 

  

  

 

 

 

those are the -- that's in the physical world that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't be approached. 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the difference? 

  

 

 

 

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Well, there really is no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

big difference.  And that's why in the virtual world, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they shouldn't be allowed to approach either.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact is, the Department of Justice has reported that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's a 50 to 60 percent crossover from adult victim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rapists to children.  So all of them, no matter what --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who the victim was, are capable of offending against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children.  So that's why it would apply to everyone. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are you able to find 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

out from the site operators, from Facebook, who one of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the registered offenders is communicating with? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  There --

  

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  To the extent --

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. MONTGOMERY:  -- there may be some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

instances in which that would happen, but most of these

messenger feature which doesn't show up.  In other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

31 

words, a police officer couldn't go to the website and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just look at it and necessarily know who was being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communicated with. 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that Facebook 

    

 

 

 

didn't allow -- didn't allow access by former sex 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenders. 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  That -- that's correct, 

  

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg.  There is a prohibition on Facebook 

   

  

 

 

 

 

and on some of the other major commercial sites --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that's Facebook's 

  

 

 

 

choice, it's not the State. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  That's correct.  And 

  

  

 

 

certainly the State has implemented this law to be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deterrent so that these offenders will not go on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Facebook, whereas that -- the deterrent effect of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Facebook having the policy is not the same thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So the State has made a decision, 

   

 

 

 

 

particularly in the area of information gathering, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because these offenders can go to these sites and can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quietly lurk and find out information.  And there are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

links.  The -- the crucial factor that the State 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believes that narrows the statute is that the site must 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have links to other users' profile pages.

that narrows it.  It -- it takes the nytimes.com out of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

the statute, but it doesn't take the sites that people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

use today, as I suggested -- whether it's Twitter or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it's Facebook -- which have become incredibly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important parts of our political culture, of our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

religious culture. 

 

            

If you ask, there are surveys that say how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many Americans have communicated their faith on social 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

networking sites in the -- in the past week, and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

turns out that one in five.  That's about 50 million 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Americans use this for religious community purposes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So whether it's political community, whether 

 

 

 

 

 

it's religious community, I mean, these sites have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

become embedded in our culture as ways to communicate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and ways to exercise our constitutional rights, haven't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they? 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  There -- there are other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

alternatives, still.  This is a part of the Internet, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

but it's not the entire Internet that is being taken 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

away from these offenders.  They can still have their 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

own blog.  They can read blogs.  They can do podcasts. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They can go to nytimes.com.  They can do other things to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

communicate with people.  This does not prohibit sites 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that have discretely just e-mail or Instant Messenger or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

message boards.  So there are other alternatives.

And one point to make also about what's --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Petitioner did in this case, he was arrested for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accessing Facebook, not for what he wrote on Facebook. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So he did post something on Facebook, but this law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevented him from accessing Facebook. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you're not making a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

conduct speech distinction, are you?  I thought you had 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

dropped that in your briefs. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  No.  No.  That's -- that's 

  

  

  

 

 

 

correct, Your Honor, although the North Carolina Supreme 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court certainly recognized that there was a conduct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

component to this, just like going to a park or going to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a playground.  But it is speech, that's correct.  But 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fact that he made a religious statement, it wasn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically because of that that he was arrested and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

charged and convicted for this offense.  But yes, it is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speech that is implicated. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How was -- how was he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

apprehended? 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  The -- the officer went to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

his own Facebook account and had a -- had a list of sex 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenders that he was searching for using their names or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aliases or family members.  And he was able to find 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Packingham's father and then was able to see 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Packingham -- even though he was using an alias --

was able to see his picture and know that it was him,

and he was on the list of sex offenders.  So that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way that he did this.  He apparently found six others or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so in this session that were sex offenders on Facebook. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you have a statute says 

   

  

 

 

 

 

convicted swindlers cannot go on Facebook -- or cannot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go on the Internet on sites that tell people -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tell people where to gather to discuss money? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  I'm not sure about that --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I can multiply 

    

   

 

 

these examples.  Convicted --

  

 

 

            

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Certainly. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  We can think of -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

know, pretty soon, you're going to have everybody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted of different things not being able to go 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anywhere and discuss anything. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Well --

  

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I exaggerate.  Let's just 

    

  

 

 

stick with the -- we can't have convicted swindlers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going on Facebook to discuss money. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Well, swindlers are not sex 

  

 

 

 

 

 

offenders, and that's --

 

 

 

            

difference?

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Sex offenders have -- have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

been -- there have been civil disabilities applied to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sex offenders and to other felons, but certainly to sex 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenders, such as the registry itself.  As this Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Smith v. Doe said that the registry was -- was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional.  And lower courts have found that the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

restrictions on going to parks or playgrounds and those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sorts of places are also constitutional. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

These are some of the worst criminals who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have abused children and -- and others and committed sex 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses.  And this Court has recognized that they have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a high rate of recidivism and are very likely to do this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

again.  Even as late as 20 years from when they are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

released, they may recidivate. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. -- Mr. Montgomery, can I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ask you a question that has to do with the law's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exemptions?  Because it just confused me when I was

exempted by the law seems, I have to say, some of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most dangerous stuff.  So you exempt any website that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provides only a chat room or only photo sharing.  So why 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is that?  Because if I would have said, like, where the

MR. MONTGOMERY:  The -- the legislature in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

36 

North Carolina wanted to have some narrow tailoring to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this -- to this statute.  So the fact that it eliminates 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or exempts some of those things is really a virtue, not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a vice.  Those are pure forms of communication.  Yes --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It just seems to exempt the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

stuff that's most easily used to -- to do exactly the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things that this statute is meant to prevent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Well, this statute is -- is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant to prevent at its core harvesting of information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anonymously, which is not something you find as much 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when you're talking about chat rooms or -- or e-mail or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those sorts of things.  Typically, there's not the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

transparent amount of information or the anonymity that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes with the social networking website in which you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can click on a link and go find out information about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

someone that you don't know. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could --

  

 

 

MR. MONTGOMERY:  And so --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- North Carolina --

  

 

 

 

 

could North Carolina bar those as well?  Bar the photo 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sharing and the chat room? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  The problem then may be

that it would not be as narrowly tailored as it should

be. 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then what did you mean in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

your brief when you said that North Carolina can proceed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one step at a time, that it could take further steps 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent with constitutional --

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Well, certainly, there are 

  

 

 

 

 

other steps that may be taken, and perhaps that would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one.  But -- but at this point, the --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what did you mean 

  

 

 

 

 

 

in your brief, then, when you said North Carolina could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take other steps, additional steps? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  There -- there are -- there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

are certainly other laws that could be put in place to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

try to prevent sex offenders from finding out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  When you just said to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg, well, maybe that would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional if they included these things that are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

instead exempted, so you mean that there's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional right to use Snapchat, but not to use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Twitter? 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  I'm not sure I understand. 

   

  

 

 

 

That -- that Snapchat -- Snapchat and Twitter seem to be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

included under this statute.

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I would have -- I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

38 

would have thought that Snapchat is -- is -- maybe I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have it wrong.  I'm not any expert on this.  But isn't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Snapchat photo sharing? 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  I believe that is some of 

    

 

 

 

 

 

it.  I don't --

    

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  So that falls under 

  

  

 

 

 

 

the exemption; right?  So you can use Snapchat, but you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't use Twitter? 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Well, Snapchat, as I 

  

 

 

 

 

understand it, you don't get the level of information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you get from something else.  Because Twitter is --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can find out much more information than you could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from however many seconds of video or pictures or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatever you get with Snapchat. 

 

 

 

 

            

So I think it's a -- it was a decision to go 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

for the sites in which the most anonymous information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could be collected by an offender.  And that offender 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then would use that to groom the child or otherwise use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that information to go meet the child and begin a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relationship so that the child --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Look -- look:  The case 

  

  

 

 

 

 

books are filled with cases where to allow certain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

groups of people to speak is actually dangerous.  Like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the communists under -- you know, years ago, they said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

it was a good idea to have a revolution.  And all kinds 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

of people have said dangerous things. 

 

 

 

 

 

39 

            

Here, you take a group of people who've done 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

something wrong, been fully punished, and you're saying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that they might say something to somebody which would be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dangerous.  And you're right; it might be.  On the other 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hand, your remedy from that is to cut off their speech. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, I suspect my law clerks, in the space 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of half an hour, would find many cases that put it the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

level of generality I've just put at, say it is hornbook 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law that you can't.  You can't unless there is at least 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a clear and present danger, you know, homes.  There are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lots of qualifications. 

 

 

            

So why don't you tell me when my law clerks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are going to look all these up -- and I think I have a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

few in mind -- what case we should look up to be sure we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get the opposite, which is what you're arguing, I think. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  This case is much more like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Burson v. Freeman, in which this Court said that this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

100-foot buffer zone, that a campaign-free zone at a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

voting place was permissible.  And that was suppressing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

political speech. 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I think that's --

    

   

 

 

 

does not help you at -- at all.

40 

was applied to everyone.  It was 100 yards.  You could 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have all the political speech in the world outside 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- was it 100 yards or 100 feet, whatever it was. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It seems to me that -- do you have -- do you have any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better case than that? 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

reason --

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Well, the only -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you cite Burson, I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think -- I think you lose. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  The reason that that case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

is the one that I mentioned is because the rationale for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was that these kinds of crimes that happened in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that zone often go undetected --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Montgomery, I agree with 

   

  

 

 

 

you.  That's your closest case.  It's the one that I 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked Mr. Goldberg about, because it's the only case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that I know of where we've permitted a prophylactic rule 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

where we've said not all conduct will have these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dangerous effects, but we don't exactly know how to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate out the dangerous -- dangerous speech from the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not-dangerous speech, so we're going to have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prophylactic rule.  That is like one out of a zillion 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

First Amendment cases that we've decided in our history. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

And as Justice Kennedy says, there are many reasons to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41 

think it's distinguishable from this one. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Well, the fact that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

applied to all in Burson, I believe, makes our case a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better case because it doesn't apply to all.  It applies 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to sex offenders who have committed crimes, who have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shown that they cannot conform to the law and are likely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to be recidivists.  So the fact that it's a narrower 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

group is not -- does not make it more problematic, but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes it -- makes it better than Burson. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that was -- that was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not the rationale of Burson v. Freeman.  Under that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rationale, you -- you could have said that it applies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only to members of a political party and it would have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been narrower.  That would make it worse.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner here is saying you are singling me out and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying that I can't have the First Amendment rights that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody else does.  That's exactly the opposite of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what was happening in Burson. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  But it wouldn't be like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

singling out a political party.  These are people who 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

have committed sex offenses.  So, again, they have had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certain disabilities already, civil disabilities.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

this Court has -- has certainly said that felons can be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevented from having guns and felons can be prevented

offenders who have committed heinous crimes and are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

likely to recidivate. 

 

 

42 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is -- is a provision 

   

  

 

 

 

 

like this ever added to the sentences as opposed to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following from the sex registry? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  As -- as part of probation, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there can be certainly those sorts of provisions added 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for the length of parole, for instance, or probation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They can be a condition.  A lot of times, those are 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

completely banning the Internet altogether.  And one of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the things about that is that when somebody is on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probation or parole, of course, they usually will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent to having searches done.  So it's a lot easier 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a parole officer to determine whether this person 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

has five computers or a smartphone or what they're using 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

during that period, unlike --

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose it's hard 

    

 

 

 

 

to generalize, but do you have any idea what the period 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of parole or probation is for someone who commits a sex 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense such as the one at issue here? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  I -- I am not sure.  I

years, but I'm -- I'm not positive on that.  Yes.

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Not if it was -- if it was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's much longer. 

  

 

 

 

MR. MONTGOMERY:  If it was a Federal crime, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

it would be much longer. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I -- I'm still 

    

   

 

 

 

having some difficulty because you're building layer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon layer of speculation or -- or statistical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inference. 

            

Yes.  There's a high statistical inference 

   

  

 

 

that recidivism will follow with one sexual crime to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another, but then what's the statistical inference I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to draw that people who have abused a neighbor's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child but never used the Internet, will now use the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Internet to abuse a different child?  Because this rule 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

is not being applied to just people who have been found 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to have enticed a child on Facebook or some form of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Internet usage.  It's being applied indiscriminately to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

people who have committed a sexual crime of statutory 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rape or of -- or even if they're teenagers, more than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

four years apart, or something else of that nature. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What -- what's the inference that every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual offender is going to use the Internet to lure a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child? 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Well, it's -- it's often 

  

 

 

 

 

 

44 

impossible to know whether the sex offenders use the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Internet or not.  Unless they contacted the victim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

online, it may be impossible to know whether they use 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Internet.  And certainly, as -- as far as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recidivism, you -- you don't know how many actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses these sex offenders have committed when they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have -- have been in rehabilitation and said that they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

committed -- they've only -- only about 5 percent of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what was reported is what came out when they took a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

polygraph.  So there's much more crime committed by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

these offenders than ever gets reported. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So the fact is that they could -- they could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have used the -- the Internet for any of their crimes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It may be impossible to know if they use the Internet 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for their crimes.  Some you would know, but many you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not know. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that might be true 

  

 

 

 

 

 

of every criminal today. 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  It could --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or committing almost any 

  

 

 

 

 

crime. 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  That could be, but again, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

we're talking about social --

Facebook and find the location of the bank they want to

rob.  They can go on the Internet and find out who's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employed there.  The Internet could be used for almost 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any crime --

 

 

            

            

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- by anyone. 

  

 

 

 

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Those -- those are even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

more speculative as to how many people would use that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Here, we -- here we know from studies that about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

82 percent of online sex crimes against children, social 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

networking websites were used to gain information about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

their likes and dislikes.  And 62 percent of online sex 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes use -- use social networking websites to gain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

home and school information.  So we know that there's a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very high percentage of these offenders who -- who are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

using social networking websites to find out 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information. 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can they go on the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

school website? 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  They can go on the school 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

website.  I'm not sure that those have individual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

information about students typically, personal 

 

 

 

 

information that would be of the sort you get off a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

social networking website, which is whether someone --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether a child likes puppies or whether their parents

have recently been through a divorce, that kind of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

46 

information can't be gathered from a school website. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

And -- and, again, there are ample 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative channels here.  These offenders can go on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

noncommercial social networking websites.  They can go 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on social networking websites which only allow adults. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They can go to news sites.  They can use blogs, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

podcasts, those sorts of things, so there are other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ways.  And, in fact, most -- there are plenty of people 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who don't use these kinds of websites and find out their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information just fine.  So it's not a matter of a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessity to have this sort of a website that you can go 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  How many people under 30 do 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you think don't use these sites to get all their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information?  Under 35?  I mean, they're --

    

  

 

 

 

increasingly, this is the way people get everything 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- all information. 

 

 

 

            

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  They --

  

 

 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  This is the way people 

  

 

 

 

 

 

structure their civic community life. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  They -- they do get a lot 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

of information.  Obviously, most anything you can get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

there, you can get somewhere else.  The news is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

typically not coming from Facebook.  It's coming from

some other website if they're getting news there.  There 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are other ways that people can communicate other than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through Facebook.  And certainly, when you have social 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

networking websites like Facebook, My Space, Instagram, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that say, as a sex offender we don't want you here, you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can't come here, obviously, there are ways those people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can get their information.  They don't have to use that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to get that information. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the -- and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there was a -- a brief -- the electronic frontier, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and even if -- if the New York Times is not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

included, the point is that these people are being cut 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

off from a very large part of the marketplace of ideas. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And the First Amendment includes not only the right to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

speak, but the right to receive information. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I mean, you don't -- you don't question that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they are being cut off. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  No.  They are -- they are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

being cut off.  And again, it has to be remembered that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these are sex offenders who have been convicted of sex 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses, and they should be cut off from sources of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information that they can use to perpetuate their crimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against children.  And so they are being cut off from 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these particular websites, but they have other means in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which they can gather news, that they can communicate

with friends, that they can share pictures.  Those kinds 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of things can be done in other places. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I do think it's important to make it clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- that the statute does not include nytimes.com. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And if --

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why?  I got a page here 

    

   

  

 

 

with -- printed from nytimes.com, from the New York 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Times, where on the side there's commentary by people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who have created profiles on themselves having a public 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

discussion between them on a news article that was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

printed in the New York Times.  That appears to be a new 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

feature of the New York Times, but it appears to be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common feature of most newspapers today that are printed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

online. 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  They -- they often do allow 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

commenting, but the requirement in the statute is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they allow someone to go to a profile page, and on that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profile page then link to people that they don't know. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Where is that in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

statute?  Because I don't read the statute to impose 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

that as a requirement.  So tell me where you find that. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Certainly.  That -- that is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

in (B)(iii) of the statute.  So B sets out the four 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broad requirements, four requirements to define a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

commercial social networking website. 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  So (B)(iii). 

  

  

 

 

MR. MONTGOMERY:  (B)(iii). 

  

 

49 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It -- it allows users to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

create web pages or personal profiles that contain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information such as links to other personal web pages. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So you're reading the "such as" as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement, but "such as" is not a requirement.  "Such 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

as" is just like here's an example, but you don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily need this. 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  The -- the other way that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it can be read and the narrower way would be if you had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an implied colon after the word "contained," so that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read "allows users to create websites or personal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profiles that contain," colon, and then four different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things; 1, information such as the name or nickname of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the user; 2, photographs placed from the personal --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, then you need an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

implied colon and an implied semicolon. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Well, semicolons --

  

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

semicolon. 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  And then another implied 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Semicolons would be --

  

 

 

 

 

semicolons would be --

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Well, semicolons would

be -- would be better, but I -- I -- they certainly 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be better.  I would be --

    

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But all this implying of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

punctuation marks, I mean, if you just read this, it's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contain information such as a bunch of things, which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

none of which are necessary, but these are good examples 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of things that characterize allowing users to create web 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pages or personal profiles that contain information. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's your requirement. 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  It really makes no sense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not to have all four of those, because that would mean 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you could have the -- the -- the fourth one, links, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but not the first one, the name of the person. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you know, you might 

  

 

 

 

 

 

read this to -- you might read a personal profile to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean something more than just a nickname.  A personal 

    

   

 

 

 

 

profile -- the definition of a profile is a concise 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

biographical sketch, which seems to be -- seems to refer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to enough information so that you can get a -- an idea 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about who the person is. 

 

 

 

 

            

Why don't you read it that way?  And if you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read it that way, would it include nytimes.com? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  No.  That still would not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 

 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

   

 

 

 

include nytimes.com because -- well, our position still 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51 

is that it has to have links, so I'm not sure I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answering your question exactly as I should. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'm saying suppose we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think that -- that it's a stretch to get to links, but 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it does require a personal profile, and I wouldn't think 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

that just a nickname.  Somebody says my nickname is, I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't know what, Joe, that that's a -- that's a profile? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  No, that would not -- that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would not be a profile.  The other point is --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So would a name and a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

picture be a profile?  And your ability to discuss in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that comment section personal information or public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

information, whatever you want to discuss? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. MONTGOMERY:  Not -- not under our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reading of the statute.  It still would require all four 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of these.  And one other point about that is in -- in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subsection (b)(4), there's a list that starts with "such 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as" and includes a -- a -- the word "or," whereas in 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number 3 it has "such as," but it has the word "and." 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So the legislature certainly knew how to say "or" or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"and" in those portions. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But "such as" does not mean 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"each of."  You're reading it as though "such as" means 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"each of."

MR. MONTGOMERY:  No.  We're reading it as 

  

  

 

 

 

 

52 

"such as" only modifies the name or nickname of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

user, and then you have three other elements to it.  So 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there could be things in --

 

 

 

 

 

            

sentence. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can finish your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. MONTGOMERY:  In -- in this instance, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the -- not a co-defendant, but the other person charged 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here in this case that's not before the Court used

MR. GOLDBERG:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

I'll -- I'll try to make four points. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

As to the New York Times, our main 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

submission is it doesn't matter.  But that said --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because it is overbroad as applied to any one site --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but that reading of the statute doesn't work 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

grammatically.  If you look in the (a) and in the (b), 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it talks about sites that create web pages or personal

profiles.  And in (a), it says to become members or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

create personal web pages.  So you can't have a links 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

53 

requirement if there are sites that -- that qualify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without creating web pages. 

 

 

 

            

Second, when they told Mr. Packingham what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this law requires and what this means, they didn't say 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything about links.  If you look at the State supreme 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court opinion, they assumed -- and not just for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisional purposes -- they said to the extent that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner is right, there are alternatives.  So they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't embrace this construction. 

 

 

 

            

And just recently on this question of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Snapchat, after the State filed the brief, which is all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about links, they prosecuted somebody for using 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Snapchat, which is a site that doesn't have links of the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind that -- that we're talking about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So that construction and -- and, as my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend is saying, maybe somebody might understand what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"profile" means, but this is a criminal statute.  And I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think if any of us were advising somebody on the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

registry whether they can do it, the plain language, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history, and the Supreme Court opinion all say you're in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

great danger of -- of liability here, steer clear.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's what the officer in this case, when he was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross-examined on that question, that's what he said.

The second thing about alternative channels, 

 

 

 

 

 

54 

this is -- there is a President.  There are also 500 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

million Tweets a day.  There are 10 billion Snapchat 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

videos.  It's not just people under 30 --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose this case had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

come to us in 2003, before Facebook was created.  Would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there be alternative channels then? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  In 2003, I'm not quite sure 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

what the -- in 2003, the predominant area was -- was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chat rooms and that's explicitly exempted.  So I'm not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure -- sure what that -- what they would be going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after. 

              

I think on the -- on the question of -- so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are people in Ladue who did not have lawn signs, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but there are more than three billion people in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

world who are using these sites, a very small --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But --

  

 

 

MR. GOLDBERG:  -- percentage of people --

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE ALITO:  But what I'm asking is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

whether the existence of alternative channels asks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether these are channels that people like to use or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether if the channels that are affected by the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are taken away, there are still alternative channels. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, I know there are people who think that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

life is not possible without Twitter and Facebook and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

these things and that 2003 was the dark ages. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  But I don't know that --

   

  

 

 

 

 

that any channels of communication that were available 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55 

at that time have been taken away.  So if there were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative channels then, why would there not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alternative channels now? 

 

 

            

MR. GOLDBERG:  Well, I think, Your Honor, 

   

  

 

 

 

you have to look at it -- and this is back in 2008 --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and you have to look at it in practical terms about what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people's communicative life is and what -- what they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

able to do. 

 

 

            

And if you look at the cases that had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforced those -- that requirement, if you look at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Lindmark, you look at City of Ladue, are the two cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that have struck down laws.  Even in the context of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adult zoning, the Court has said that there has to be a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

substantial amount of -- of access and protected speech. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In the Los Angeles Airport case, that was one place. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These are the places where everybody is speaking and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interacting and looking for work and petitioning the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government. 

            

Every single representative -- there are 

 

 

 

 

 

political debates.  The President is speaking to the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

people through this medium.  So it is an extraordinary

argument to say not everybody does it.  I don't think 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56 

that's the test.  The test is how much of your core 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First Amendment activity is foreclosed.  And the ability 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to speak with this networked group of people all over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the world is as strong -- this is, as Justice Kennedy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said, well beyond the traditional town square.  And I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure there were people who didn't go to the town square, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but that wouldn't be a basis for -- for upholding a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

restriction there. 

 

            

The -- the core point here, though, is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Packingham -- this law reaches speech that is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamentally at the core -- I'm sorry, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

sentence. 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can finish that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. GOLDBERG:  I'll just say this -- this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, this wolf comes as a wolf.  This is core-protected 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

speech.  There is nothing about it that implicates the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's purpose.  And the fact that he was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

convicted for a felony is why this law is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional. 

            

            

Thank you, Your Honor. 

 

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

The case is submitted. 

 

 

 

            

 

(Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the
