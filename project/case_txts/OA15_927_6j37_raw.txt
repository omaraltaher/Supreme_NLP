ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN J. BLACK 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. BLACK:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

please the Court: 

 

 

11 

            

In Petrella, the Court reaffirmed the 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

principle that when Congress enacts a limitations 

   

 

 

 

 

period, that courts may not apply the doctrine of laches 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to shorten the statutory period. 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

In patent law, Congress prescribed a 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

six-year lookback period from the date of suit and a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20-year patent term.  Injecting judicial discretion into 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the statutory scheme would frustrate the will of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress, and create uncertainty about something as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fundamental as the timeliness of suit. 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

            

There is nothing in the Patent Act which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

compels the creation of a unique patent law rule, and if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Court were to create an exception here, that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

invite litigation in the lower courts over a wide range 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of Federal statutes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You don't dispute 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

that equitable estoppel applies across the board? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. BLACK:  That's correct, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

4

10 

Equitable estoppel applied has been part of the law, on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the law side of the Court, since the mid-18th century, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the Court held in -- in Dickerson in 1879.  It was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

originally actually called "estoppel in pays," and it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

became known as equitable estoppel, but it's been a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal principle for over -- well over a hundred years, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it applies to all actions at law and in equity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  For this -- for this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

argument I'm not sure, because of course they dispute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, and they have a long list of cases, Alsterbach --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or what, Aukerman and so forth, going back into history. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And they have the man who wrote the statute, and they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have words in the statute.  And they say if we look 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through all of those cases, what we will find is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a long history of applying laches in one legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context, or that it's -- that it's patents.  And anyway, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost all patent cases were equitable cases, and so it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would be a big change, and you know all those arguments. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

Now you've come back and you have two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

arguments -- two cases the other way, and you say two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are mistaken.  So it seems to me what I have to do on 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that one is read the cases.  And if I come to the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

5 

conclusion that there is this long history here, then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the laches should stay.  And if I come to the conclusion 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that no, if you really look at these cases, there isn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that history, then it should go.  But neither is it a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, one way or the other, of us making up anything. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's a question of what was the heart of the law for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

quite a long time before.

MR. BLACK:  Your Honor, let me address --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that right?  I mean, 

    

  

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

that's how I'm approaching it, and I'm asking you to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comment on that because I don't want to waste a lot of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time reading cases I don't have to read. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

MR. BLACK:  No, Your Honor.  You don't have 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

to read the cases.  What you should read is the statute. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The statute is what controls. 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  In the statute is the word 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

"enforcement."  And -- and when it is invalid, what's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the word --

 

 

19 

            

20 

            

MR. BLACK:  "Unenforceability." 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  -- "unenforceable."  And 

  

  

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

that could apply just to the -- the -- you know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

monkeying around with the patent, doing bad things to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the patent, or it could include laches.  And the guy who 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

writes it says, yeah, it includes laches.  And you could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read it the other way not to.  So I didn't get too far 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

6 

1 

with the statute, either. 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. BLACK:  Your Honor, let's discuss 

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

unenforceability.  One of the interesting facts about 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the case is that the Federal Circuit did not actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take up the position that the word "unenforceability" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant laches.  And I think part of the reason for that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is for those of us who practice in this area every day, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we just don't think of laches as an unenforceability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

doctrine. 

10 

            

Unenforceability brings to mind rendering 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

the patent unenforceable, may not be enforced.  And that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly applies when there has been egregious conduct, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like patent misuse or a fraud on the patent office.  But 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it does not apply to laches.  The patent can still be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enforced in this case and any others, seeking damages 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from the date of suit through the date of trial. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

We did not have a dictionary definition here 

   

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

of "unenforceability," from 1952 or any other time.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent's position is that it was known, but they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't actually have any support in a dictionary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

definition, in the case law, or in the legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history.  And the --

  

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They have some cases 

  

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

from us in other courts relating unenforceability to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patents.  We even called one patent unenforceable 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

7 

because of laches.  So -- I mean, I agree with Justice 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Breyer that the case law on both sides is fairly sparse. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I don't know what judgments to draw from that.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there are some cases that use the word "unenforceable" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in that sense.

7 

            

MR. BLACK:  I believe --

    

 

 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And that's what --

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

that's what Federico -- Federico did, right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. BLACK:  Well, Mr. Federico --

  

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

Mr. Federico's -- I believe there's only one case that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually used "unenforceability" or "unenforceable" with 

 

 

 

 

 

laches.  Occasionally, the word "enforce" is used. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

But let me address Mr. Federico's 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

commentary --

 

15 

            

16 

            

17 

point. 

18 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Their timing. 

  

 

 

MR. BLACK:  I take that -- I take that 

    

   

 

 

 

 

Let me address Mr. Federico's commentary. 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

All he said was that laches was included.  He didn't say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was an unenforceability.  Federal Circuit didn't take 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that position up.  And he certainly didn't say --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, just to stop 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

you there.  I'm just reading what the -- this is in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

red brief, so you can correct it if it's wrong, but he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said the commentary, his commentary explained that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

8 

quote, "unenforceability," end quote, was, quote, "added 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by amendment in the Senate for greater clarity, and that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as amended, the defenses would include equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defenses such as laches." 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

Now there are words in between the quoted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

passages, so are you going to tell me those are --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

MR. BLACK:  There -- there are words in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

between.  We have to interpret sort of the semicolons in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Federico's post-1952 commentary to reach the result. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

He believed that laches was included in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute, but he never said -- and no court has ever said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- that the form of laches which is being asserted here, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which would be unique in all of Federal law, was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applicable.  We have Section 283 of the Patent Act, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which applies the remedial provision for injunction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And we have Section 284, which provides the damage 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

remedy. 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

Section 283 says that injunctions may be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issued according to the principles of equity.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly includes laches, and that's our position, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's consistent with the court below. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Section 284 is the damage remedy.  And there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is no -- there is no power granted to courts to overrule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the clear language in Section 286, which is the time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitation on damages in the Patent Act. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the clear 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

language argument really doesn't help you at all.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean, it doesn't say -- there is no clear language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying laches doesn't apply in this context.  It gives 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you a time limit.  And the question whether laches is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied is just an issue that's not addressed in that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

language. 

8

MR. BLACK:  Respectfully disagree, Your

18

23 

24 

            

Section 286 is entitled -- it is titled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Time Limitation on Damages."  That is the timeliness 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule that Congress selected for patent infringement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases in 1896.  It was enacted for a very clear purpose: 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

To create a statute of limitations.  That's what they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

called it in 1896, to supplant this Court's ruling in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Campbell v. Haverhill, where the Court was put to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Hobson's choice of saying that the law -- the patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law, was that there either was no limitations period or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we apply State law. 

 

 

 

            

The result was that the Court had to rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State-by-State limitations period.  The intent of 

  

 

 

 

 

Congress was to abolish State-by-State limitations 

 

 

 

 

 

period, and I think that they would be very surprised to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

find that it's now judge by judge under the doctrine of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

laches.

5 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I have one question on 

    

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

that.  I dissented in Petrella, and I thought to myself, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

I lost.  Okay?  I lost that case.  How right I was, but 

    

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

nonetheless. 

9 

            

So I don't want, I think in this case, just 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

to repeat, I'm still dissenting, so I'll take Petrella 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as the law, at least I'm tentatively doing that.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then I looked here to say, well, is there a significant 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference?  And I found so far you've mentioned them. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

Maybe case law and history, but I have to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

look that one up.  Maybe language, but there are two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sides to that too. 

 

 

 

17 

            

Then I found this.  That in Petrella, to me 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

in dissent a major point, which was well-answered by the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

majority, is what's going to happen after about 30 years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where the plaintiff has just laid in wait to see if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

material is a success, after they spend all the money 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's a success, and he sues for the last six years and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collects all the profit while the defendant was the one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who paid all the money that earned the profit. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

Never fear, said the majority, because you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

11 

1 

2 

3 

can deduct all that expense from the six years' profit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that you're suing for.  Never fear.  And I didn't really 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

overcome that argument very well. 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

But in this case, it isn't true that you can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

deduct, and therefore plaintiffs can lie in wait to see, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and it is 40 times more difficult for a company that has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relied on their not suing to change the hundreds of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

billions of dollars in investment, and in case we think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's theoretical, Dell has filed a brief involving 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Sprint, Lucent and other companies where they spent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

close to billions knowing there was somebody out there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who might sue, but he wasn't going to.  He led them to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believe he wasn't, approximately.  And then later on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they come back and they try to get all this money, just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the profit, without the deduction of the loss when it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

too late for the company to change. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, I'll look into that, but that, in my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mind, is a big difference. 

   

 

 

            

MR. BLACK:  Understood, Your Honor.  Let 

  

  

 

 

 

me -- so let me address that a couple of ways. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

First of all --

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May -- may I just 

   

  

 

 

 

23 

clarify? 

24 

25 

            

Petrella explained, in the context of that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case, that it wasn't unscrupulous for this woman to wait 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

12 

to see whether there was anything in it for her.  Why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should she spend her money on a lawsuit when there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't anything in the bank? 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

So the -- the point was that it wasn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

unscrupulous to wait to see whether the suit was worth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the expense of suing.  That was --

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

8 

            

9 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I accept that. 

    

 

 

MR. BLACK:  That's my answer, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  No, that isn't.  If it 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

isn't -- look.  If it isn't unscrupulous -- if it isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unscrupulous, laches doesn't apply.  If there is nothing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

unjust or inequitable about it, laches doesn't apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I am not getting into an argument about who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did or didn't behave unscrupulously.  I am assuming that 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

there was unscrupulous behavior that would ordinarily 

 

 

 

 

 

 

call into play laches.  I am assuming that. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

For example, after telling him, don't worry, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I won't sue, he phoned him up every day to see if the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence has been burned up. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BLACK:  That would be estoppel, Your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Honor.  And that -- that would be estoppel. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  I want to --

    

 

 

 

            

MR. BLACK:  For all --

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, you -- please. 

  

 

 

 

 

              

I think that whether there is unscrupulous 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

13 

behavior or bad or unfair behavior is a function of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether an existing doctrine, laches, applies to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  And that I think is the issue here. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

So I have to assume laches applies to the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

case, if laches applies at all, and that's what we are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

arguing about. 

 

7 

            

8 

            

MR. BLACK:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, but don't 

  

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

lose the estoppel argument there. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. BLACK:  I'm not going to, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

I'm --

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I want to hear what you 

    

 

 

 

 

 

were going to say. 

 

 

 

            

MR. BLACK:  Lying in wait -- the lying --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's the lying-in-wait question.  There are a couple --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it's not.  It's the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

difference -- the difference that when, in fact, in an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate case, you do sue under copyright, what you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get is the profit from the last six years, minus the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

costs to produce that profit. 

 

 

 

 

            

When you do sue in patent, and the examples 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are in the Dell brief, you get the profit for the last 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

six years without subtracting the money that previously 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went in to produce that profit, and moreover, companies 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spend hundreds of millions of dollars in reliance on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

14 

1 

whatever conduct gave rise to laches.  That's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

differences. 

3 

            

4 

            

MR. BLACK:  Okay.  Three points, at least. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

First, there is a significant difference 

   

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

between laches, which requires only delay and is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

timeliness rule, delay and prejudice, it's a timeliness 

   

 

 

 

 

 

rule, and it conflicts with the timeliness rule in 286. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

For egregious conduct we still have 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

estoppel.  Estoppel requires misleading conduct that 

  

 

 

 

 

leads the infringer to believe that they will not be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disturbed.  That still applies.  Estoppel is -- is not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

being addressed here.  We are only talking about laches, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which is delay, and it is a timeliness rule that was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

developed in the equity courts and was used occasionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the law courts when there was no statute of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations.  But as --

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wait, wait.  This is --

  

  

 

 

 

 

this is still an issue in this case.  There is an issue 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether estoppel would apply. 

 

 

 

            

MR. BLACK:  Yes, Your -- yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

What happened -- what happened below is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

summary judgment was granted on estoppel and laches. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Went up to the court of appeals, they reversed on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estoppel finding there was a genuine issue of material 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact on whether or not the defendant actually relied on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

15 

1 

any -- on any conduct of the plaintiff, and sent it back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

down. 

3 

            

But with respect to the laches, the court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

said, well, we have these presumptions that apply, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore, there is no -- there is nothing to try. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So is estoppel an 

  

 

 

 

 

7 

unenforceable -- unenforceable? 

 

 

8 

            

9 

            

MR. BLACK:  Estoppel -- it's --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Render the patent 

  

 

 

 

10 

unenforceable? 

11 

            

MR. BLACK:  It's -- it's unclear.  There are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

certainly some cases that tie the two together, but it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably just --

 

 

14 

            

15 

laches. 

16 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Just like here with 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. BLACK:  Laches, no.  There -- there 

  

  

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

are -- there are some cases on estoppel, but I think the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

estoppel doctrine really emanates from the same place it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

emanates in copyright law, which is, it's a general 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense, generally applicable in actions in law.  Like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

collateral estoppel.  Like a coordinate satisfaction. 

   

  

 

 

Everything doesn't have to be in 282. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You've got two more 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

points that you wanted to raise. 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

MR. BLACK:  Yes, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

16 

1 

            

Lying in wait.  We have to understand what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

the practicalities are at the district court level.  For 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those of us that live in the trenches, here's what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

really happens. 

 

5 

            

So you have Section 287 of the Patent Act, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

which the Respondents really don't want to talk about. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress considered this lying-in-wait problem, the 

 

 

 

 

 

problem of a defendant who doesn't know about the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringement, and it did three things. 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

First of all, it made patent filings public, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

and they're searchable on the Internet, and there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent attorneys on the other side of this who are fully 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capable of looking these things up. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second, they enacted Section 287, which is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

specific limitation on damages.  You cannot claim back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages in a patent case unless you comply with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 287.  287 says, you must give actual notice to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the patent -- to the -- to the defender, to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant, or you have to mark your product with the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent number.  There are some extensions, but that was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the way Congress dealt with this problem of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

infringer who wouldn't know about a patent. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But most of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

things we are worried about, we are not worried about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the lever or something, it's chips and things like that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

17 

1 

and you can't mark those. 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

MR. BLACK:  That's right.  So what that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

means is the plaintiff can't mark; the plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

therefore, in most cases, has to give actual notice to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

the infringer. 

 

6 

            

Now, once that happens, the infringer is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

tortfeasor, and they are on notice.  So they have a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couple of choices. 

 

 

9 

            

They can go to the patent office, under the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

old rules and new rules, to try to defeat the patent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They can file a declaratory judgment action.  They can 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

change their behavior, or, they can do what happened 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here, on full notice, they decided to plow ahead, to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

collect a lot of profits over years, and at the end of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the day they might have to pay what the statute 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requires:  A reasonable royalty. 

    

 

17 

            

There is nothing unreasonable about that. 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

Unlike copyright law where the infringer can be stripped 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of its profits, the remedy is a reasonable royalty in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

patent cases. 

 

21 

            

So going back to the statute, which really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

24 

25 

has the control here, Section 286 is the timeliness rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress provided.  They had a very clear 

   

  

 

 

 

 

delineation of the remedies.  283 is injunctions.  284 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

is damages.  Then they had the time limitation on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

18 

1 

2 

3 

4 

damages, which they called the statute of limitations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's how they set the statute up.  And they put a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

separate requirement that in order to claim back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages, you must comply with Section 287. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

This is an integrated whole.  And you also 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

have a 20-year patent life from the date of filing of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the application now, which means usually 17 years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Takes a couple of years to get through the patent 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office, unlike copyright law where the copyright could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go on for 70 years and with a three-year rolling window. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Patent law is limited.  You have a six-year window.  And 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

most of the time, patents are not as valuable in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first couple of years.  It takes time for technology to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

make its way into the marketplace. 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

Once it does, the patentholder has a choice. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

Patentholder, if he sees a small -- he or she sees a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

small infringer who is not a threat, just like in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Petrella, they can decide, you know, I don't want to go 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to the expense of Federal litigation.  I don't want to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spend ten years and millions of dollars on litigation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But if down the road that little threat, which was not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

much of a threat, turns into an existential threat, the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patentholder can sue. 

 

 

            

But Congress dealt with that problem by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, you can only get six years of back damages when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

that happens.  Six years.  And your patent term is going 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to run out at some point.  So the rolling window is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to collapse into the patent term end in a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relatively short period of time.  And that's the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

structure of the statute that Congress set up. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

This Court has said that if it's going to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

make -- assume that Congress intended a clear departure 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

from well-established equity rules that it will demand 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the party asserting that provide clear -- evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a clear statement.  There is a good discussion of this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the Medinol amicus brief. 

 

 

 

 

12 

            

The Court said it in eBay.  Same principle. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

You had an equitable principle that was applied by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal circuit in a way which was very different from 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied in other contexts.  And the Court insisted that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent law be conformed to other areas of the law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  Can I go back a step, 

   

   

  

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

because you may have -- if I understand what you're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying, we have a case that would otherwise be laches. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That is, every one agrees that Smith has Jones' patent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But Smith thinks that Jones has given him approval, a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

license, a very complex kind, and so he goes ahead and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uses it.  Jones sells to a -- let's use a phrase that's 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not happy, but "patent troll." 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

The patent troll gets the patent.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

20 

1 

2 

3 

patent troll looks at the license.  The patent troll 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says, I don't think this really works, the license.  I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to bring a lawsuit. 

   

 

 

4 

            

He brings a lawsuit.  The judge thinks this 

   

  

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

is very unfair, given what the patent troll and everyone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

else had told the defendant.  Laches would normally 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

apply. 

8 

            

And I was saying now they're going to get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

vast profit without the expense that went into making 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the profit.  You say I'm wrong.  The reason I'm wrong is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because you only get a reasonable royalty.  And in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

calculating the reasonable royalty, the judge will 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subtract the costs of producing that royalty during the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

six-year period, so you'll end up where you end up in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

copyright. 

16 

            

17 

            

Now, do I have the argument correctly? 

   

 

 

 

 

MR. BLACK:  Not close, but let me just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

clarify one point to make sure we are on the same page 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

here. 

20 

            

If the patent -- let's say the defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

has -- or the infringer has a profit margin of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 percent.  In copyright law, all 40 percent could be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stripped away, and then the defendant has to kind of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

work backwards to apply the costs to that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

            

It's not how it works in patent law.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

21 

patent law, expert will come in and say, well, what's a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable royalty that arm's length transaction would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have resulted in if the negotiation had taken place the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

day before infringement began?  And the number might be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3, 4, 5, 7 percent, but it wouldn't be 40, because a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40 percent royalty wouldn't leave anything for the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant, and that's not what happens in -- in real 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4

life. 

9 

            

Another point about the patent -- the patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

trolls, there is an FTC report that came out on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

October 6th of this year.  FTC has been concerned that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what they call patent assertion entities, the polite 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term, that what is the effect on the economy? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

            

And they've been looking at this for several 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

years.  They actually did a study where they collected 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

confidential data from lots of different participants in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the patent assertion arena, and they came up with some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interesting conclusions, with which -- actual data. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

            

And what happens often in court is that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

people say "patent troll," and you don't really know --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we don't really know exactly what they mean by that.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't really know what the effect is.  But we know two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

things: 

24 

            

First of all, SCA is no patent troll.  It's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

an operating company.  You have Medinol, whose got a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

22 

petition pending, an operating company.  You have Romag 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that has a petition pending, an operating company that's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

out on laches after five months.  The companies that get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hurt by this are operating companies who don't like to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sue and therefore wait until they have to. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

The patent trolls normally can't file patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

cases and get back damages because they usually can't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comply with Section 287 and they don't -- if they give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

notice ahead of time, they have to sue to monetize. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

The Court said in Halo, one of the arguments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

12 

13 

14 

made there -- it was rejected on the grounds of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute controls.  One of the arguments made in Halo was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that the patent trolls were collecting a lot of money 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

based on licensing threats, sending letters and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

collecting money. 

 

16 

            

The FTC has actually now done a study, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

they concluded on October 6th that that's not what's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happening, that the lower end of the stratum, what we'd 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

probably think of as the patent trolls, are actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only making money if they file lawsuits.  They have an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest in bringing lawsuits quickly. 

 

 

 

 

22 

            

And there was something you said about a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

license and the patent troll.  I just want to make 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another thing clear.  If somebody buys a patent from a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

predecessor, they are bound by the predecessor's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

23 

licenses.  That's part of the law.  So the patent --

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

company buying a patent that wants to sue on it, they're 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bound by prior licenses and they're bound by the actions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of their --

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I was thinking of the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

6 

examples in the Dell brief, which undoubtedly you've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

read. 

8 

            

9 

            

10 

my mind. 

 

11 

            

12 

            

MR. BLACK:  Yes. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Those are the examples in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BLACK:  Sure, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

One of them was an estoppel case.  It was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

decided on estoppel laches wasn't necessary.  One of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

them, the first one, which I guess is their poster 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child, I think that at the district court level, there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was only 10 months of damages at issue because the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entity which bought the patent waited so long, and they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were only going to get a reasonable royalty for 10 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

months.  The case was decided on summary judgment on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

invalidity. 

21 

            

What you won't see in the cases or when you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

do Westlaw searching is a lot of cases that actually get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided on laches.  What's not been said here is two 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

things: 

25 

            

One is the ABA and the AIPLA, you have a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

24 

pretty broad brief, have both said that laches is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

burden, that it's not necessary to deal with the patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trolls.  They've come out very strongly in getting rid 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the doctrine of laches and conforming patent law to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other areas of law. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

            

The other thing is that -- the reality is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

that there aren't -- there aren't -- there's a lot of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation over laches.  What happens in the real world 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the trenches is that a plaintiff files a complaint 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

for patent infringement.  The plaintiff seeks back 

  

 

 

 

 

 

damages.  The defendant is pretty much bound to file an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

answer claiming laches.  Why?  Because the Federal 

  

  

 

 

 

 

circuit has said under its presumptions that, well, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laches can apply at any time, and it applies by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presumption after six years. 

 

 

 

16 

            

So every case -- you have answers filed all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

the time in patent cases with laches.  The plaintiff 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then says, okay, I've got a defense; I have to deal with 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it.  They send an interrogatory.  They say, what's your 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

prejudice? 

21 

            

Defendant usually says, prejudice is I 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

expanded my business. 

 

 

23 

            

The plaintiff says, well, you probably would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

have done that anyway -- which is what happened in this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court -- and then we have to go off and have a trial on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

25 

1 

that issue. 

 

2 

            

And most of the time -- this case is the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

exception -- those trials take place after the trial in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

front of the jury, but there's a tremendous amount of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

discovery.  In this case, there were 15 deposition 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

excerpts submitted with summary judgment.  But there are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

very few decisions that actually reach a conclusion that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

laches is applicable.  And if you search for cases where 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so-called patent trolls have been barred by laches, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will find very, very few. 

 

 

 

 

            

If I may reserve the rest of my time, Your 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr. Waxman. 

 

            

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN J. BLACK 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please the Court: 

 

 

            

This Court has repeatedly recognized that 

 

 

 

 

 

the 1952 Patent Act sought to retain and reflect patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law as it then existed.  When Section 282 codified 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defenses applicable in any patent action, it did so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against the backdrop of a decades-long consensus that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

laches is an available defense. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where is the 

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

26 

1 

2 

codification?  I don't see anything in that -- what is 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it?  2 -- 282? -- other than the word "enforceable." 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Right.  And that -- well, the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

lower court -- the Federal circuit didn't specify 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it was codified under the words "unenforceable" 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or "absence of liability."  But as we point out in our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief, this Court repeatedly and other courts have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized, as did PJ Federico, that laches is an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unenforceability defense, and that in enacting those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

defenses --

 

11 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, how could it be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

12 

when it doesn't make the patent unenforceable? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  It -- it does in exactly the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

same way, for example, Justice Ginsburg, that estoppel 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

does; that is it is a defendant-specific defense, just 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

as estoppel, which all concede is an unenforceability 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense.  And for that matter, if we can just cast our 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

memories back --

 

 

19 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I don't know -- I don't 

    

   

 

 

 

20 

21 

22 

23 

know if all would concede that.  I think we were just 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

told that unenforceability relates to things that would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bar you from ever enforcing the patent, like patent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misuse or misrepresentation to the patent office. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, in the 46 

  

 

 

 

 

 

25 

years since this Court decided Blonder-Tongue, we've

become accustomed to the principle of non-mutual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offensive collateral estoppel, that is that permits a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party that wasn't a party to the prior suit to raise 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defenses that were successfully waged against another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party.  That principle did not exist in 1952.  There was 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

non-mutuality for all of these equitable defenses that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are concededly covered by unenforceability, including 

 

 

 

 

 

patent misuse and inequitable conduct, which Your Honor 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was referring to.  That is unenforceability, as all of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cases recognized, and we've cited this Court's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinions and lower court opinions applied to equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defenses, none of which were applicable to the law --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the world as a whole, prior to this Court's opinion in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I do -- I do understand 

    

   

 

 

 

you mentioned the issue preclusion in -- in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Blonder-Tongue is such a case.  So what -- what is there 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about issue preclusion that was different than --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  So -- so, for example in -- in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the first case, the claim for patent infringement is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defeated on an argument of, you know, collateral --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inequitable -- equitable estoppel or inequitable conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or patent misuse or prosecution laches.  That defense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was not established, and had to be litigated anew by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant in the second, third, and fourth case.  And if

I --

 

2 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Some of them -- some of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

them, misuse would go across the board -- board.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can have an estoppel as to one alleged infringer, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and not have it to another. 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

            

7 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  So --

  

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So I don't see how -- how 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

issue preclusion would then work. 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, the question 

  

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

in this case is what Congress understood the patent law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine was in 1952.  And we think that there is a --

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there is a literal mountain of cases.  Every single case 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that was decided in any court at any level from 1897 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when the six-year damages cap was put into place until 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

today, with the exception of one district court decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Massachusetts which demonstrably misapplied the two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authorities that it cited, every single case has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognized that -- that laches was a defense in an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appropriate case to claims for damages.  And no case has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ever said or suggested to the contrary.  And so, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

therefore --

 

22 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That mountain of 

  

 

 

 

 

23 

cases were in equity, right? 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

MS. SULLIVAN:  Well, in equity and in law. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

There were law cases that were applied and --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

29 

1 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's where 

  

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

your mountain becomes a mole hill, right?  I mean, 

    

   

 

 

 

 

the -- the cases in which laches was applied at law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were -- is insignificant, certainly not enough to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

support a consensus that Congress could be understood to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have adopted for the simple reason that -- that, as you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point out, actions were brought in equity, because you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could get both an injunction and damages. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  That's right.  As was sought, 

  

  

 

 

 

 

for example, in this case and almost every case, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

is --

 

12 

13 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's a little 

   

  

 

 

 

hard to talk about this mountain if they are all equity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14 

cases. 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Will, I don't -- I don't think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

so, but let me take my -- let me take my run at the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mountain of your question. 

 

 

 

            

As you point out, almost all of the cases, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

98 percent, according to Professor Lemley, were brought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the equity side, and they don't even have an argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that laches wasn't available as a defense to claims for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages which could be sought in equity courts beginning 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in 1870, and there are plenty of cases showing that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, there were, as Your Honor suggests, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that some cases -- if I just may finish -- there were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

30 

some cases that were brought at law, usually where the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent had expired and no equitable -- no injunctive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relief could be sought.  We have cited the Court to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those decisions that have considered the question. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Every single one of those decisions that considered the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question -- and there are not many; there are the Ford 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, the Seventh Circuit cases, I think are the ones 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that were available before the merger in law and equity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The point is, whether it's a mountain or a mole hill, 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the cases all went in that direction, and whether the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petitioner thinks that those Ford cases were wrongly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decided or not, they were the law.  And after 1938 --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you would -- you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

would concede that if you're just looking at those four 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases, that's not enough of a well-accepted consensus 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that Congress could have considered to have adopted the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rule in those cases. 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I don't think that when 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Congress was -- was enacting the '52 law they were only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at the pre-1938 cases.  They were also looking 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all the cases --

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Maybe they were -- they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

23 

24 

25 

were looking at what the statute of limitations -- what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the origin was that equity invented laches 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because there was no statute of limitation.  And so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

31 

there was a gap to fill on the equity side.  On the law 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side, you had a statute of limitations.  And we are 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

told, and I think it's right, that this Court has said 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that when you're seeking damages at law and there is a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute of limitations, the statute of limitations is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what Congress ordered, not laches.  It's just like it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was in the old days, when you went into a law court for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages, you had a statute of limitations, and that was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what applied, and not an extra delay -- not an extra

doctrine. 

11 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, I will return 

   

  

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

to respond to -- to complete my previous answer.  But, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Ginsburg, the State -- whether or not you think 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that what is now Section 286 is a statute of limitations 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or not, and it notably does not run from the time of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

knowledge and -- and inactionable knowledge, unlike 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laches and the copyright statute of limitations, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact is, that unlike in the copyright context, the 1952 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress was not creating a statute of limitations of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

sort, or even amending it.  It was simply continuing a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision that was put in place, by the way, in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equity provision of the revised statute, Section 4120 --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23 

            

24 

limitation? 

25 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does it support a time 

   

  

 

 

 

MR. WAXMAN:  Excuse me --

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

32 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In support -- sorry. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR. WAXMAN:  It is a -- it is a limitation 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

1 

            

2

on the damages.  You can only recover damages for six 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years out of the 18-year patent term. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

But the point I'm trying to make -- and if I

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

make no other point, please let me not be misunderstood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here -- Congress in 1952 simply continued in haec verba 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the statute that had existed on the books since it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put in on the equity side in 1897.  And there were --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether it is a mountain, a mole hill, or a mesa, all of 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- okay.  Never mind.  I'll just stick with mountain 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or mole hill.  All of the -- I mean, I -- I don't think 

   

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- I hope I live long enough to have another case where 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I can come to Court and say, all of the case law that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decide -- that examine this question, all of which was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjudicating the applicability of laches to claims of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages alongside the six-year damages limitation 

 

 

 

 

 

provision, all of them recognize that laches existed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comfortably alongside that provision. 

 

 

 

            

And there is nothing really anomalous about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that, Justice Ginsburg.  The very same thing occurs, for 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, in Title VII, where there is a statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations.  You've got to bring your claim within 180 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

days or 300 days, but there is also a damages limitation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that says you can only get two years of back pay.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

33 

the fact of the matter is, the question is what was --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what did Congress think that it was either codifying, if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you accept our 282 argument, or what it was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpreting -- what 286 -- what became 286 meant, it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looked back and it could find nothing in the case law. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And there are nine circuits, Mr. Chief Justice.  Three 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never considered the question.  Nine circuits that by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

1952 -- and I think for that matter by 1946 and 1938 --

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had all recognized that laches was an applicable defense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in those instances in which it was proven for claims of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages and other forms of relief.  Whether the claims 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

came up on the law side or the equity side, and I -- I

10

13 

simply. 

14 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The question is not --

  

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

the question is not whether laches was available.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question is whether it was available in face of a time 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitation set by Congress.  And frankly, I don't see a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

big difference between the way the patent statute of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limitations work than the way the copyright statute did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20 

in Petrella. 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  I -- I completely adopt your 

    

   

 

 

 

articulation, Justice Ginsburg.  The question was 

  

 

 

 

 

whether laches was available in the context of, and in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

light of, the time provision that was enacted in 1897 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and that was continued in the 1952 Act, and the answer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

34 

1 

is a resounding unquestionable yes. 

   

 

 

2 

            

There is no court, with the exception of one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

district judge in Massachusetts, who ever even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questioned whether -- whether the case was brought at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law or in equity prior to 1938, laches was an available 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense.  And to the extent, Mr. Chief Justice, that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that distinction still mattered in 1952, we have the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

authoritative treatise at the time. 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

Walker on patents, the 1951 edition, 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

11 

12 

page 106 of the 1951 provision that says expressly --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I'm going to quote it as soon as I find it.  Law may be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interposed -- "laches may be interposed in an action at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

law." 

14 

            

And so what was Congress to understand the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

rule was, either when it codified unenforceability as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense or when it continued Section 286 in the law as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it had been there for 55 years, and the answer was, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking at the case law, looking at what that -- what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr. Federico was drafting for the committee and for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress, looking at the authoritative treatise writer, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and I'm not aware of any contemporary treatises that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even suggest otherwise, that, yes, laches coexists with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Section 286 remedy. 

 

 

 

24 

            

And that's the question, Justice Ginsburg, 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

that this Court has to decide.  What was -- what was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

35 

1 

Congress's understanding when it enacted the 1952 Act? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

3 

            

Now, we also have --

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the 

  

 

 

 

4 

5 

well-established understanding that laches cannot bar 

 

 

 

 

 

claims for the legal relief that have their own time 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

limitation? 

7 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  So, there is a maxim, and it

clearly did apply.  It -- it doesn't apply in many 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contexts, some of which are rehearsed in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice Breyer's dissent in the Petrella case.  But in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any event, even if there -- even if patent law were the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only case, and I -- I've cited Title VII as another 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, but even if patent law were the only case, the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact of the matter is, that what -- that as this Court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has explained repeatedly, including as recently as the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Halo decision this term -- last term, this year, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress was attempting to retain and reflect patent law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as it existed, not some general maxim that might apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in another context.  And in this case, whatever force 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the general maxim had, and there are plenty of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions to it, in patent law, the case law was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uniform and substantial that --

 

 

 

 

23 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But speaking of the general 

  

 

 

 

 

 

24 

25 

maxim, Mr. Waxman, wouldn't we expect that if Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted to make an exception for patent law or wanted to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

continue exception that existed as a result of the

MR. WAXMAN:  I -- I think not in a context 

    

   

   

 

 

 

in which we are -- Congress is not enacting something 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new.  It's simply continuing the 1897 six-year 

  

 

 

 

 

 

limitation against a backdrop of uniform case law, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

uniform treatise writers. 

 

 

            

The -- the legislative history of 

 

 

 

 

 

Senator McCarren making one of the four amendments in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the Patent Act be unenforceability to include in what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

became Section 282 and a cognate provision in the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages remedy, Section 284. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did the senator that you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

just quoted, did he use unenforceability the -- the way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

you do?

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, he said we need to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

include unenforceability because of the -- and this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is -- this is recited; I can't remember what the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevant language in our red brief -- we have to amend 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this to include unenforceability, because there are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrines that are reported in the cases -- and these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are all equitable doctrines, including laches -- that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prevent the recovery of damages where -- even if a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent is determined to be valid and infringed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

And that's why, he explained, there also had

to be an amendment in what became Section 284 so that it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't simply apply damages to patents that were valid 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and infringed but only in cases in which the plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't otherwise entitled. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the problem with 

  

 

 

 

 

that argument that you're making is that, yes, that was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said.  But we don't know what they had in mind.  There's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing to show us directly what they had in mind, other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than what they spoke, and they spoke about the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

traditional conditions like patent misuse and the other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things that are specified. 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  I -- I --

    

   

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I still don't see in the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

history where the people who were drafting at the time, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not two years later or time later, really were thinking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of this in the way you're speaking of. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Sotomayor, you are 

  

 

 

 

 

correct that in amending the statute to include an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unenforceability defense, and again, I want to reiterate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that even if you don't think unenforceability applies to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the litany of equitable defenses that have long since 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been imported into substantive patent law on both sides, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even if you don't agree with that, you still have to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpret 286, which they claim is the bar to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

38 

application of laches against a backdrop of uniform, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

very substantial case law from every circuit that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered the question, that recognized that laches 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was, in fact, such a defense. 

   

 

 

 

            

But you -- you are --

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You won't get very far 

  

 

 

 

 

 

with me on that, because I don't know how to import 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something in that's not stated by Congress in any way. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  What is stated by Congress, and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

this Court has accepted repeatedly, is that Congress in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1952 intended to retain and reflect patent law as it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

existed, and that's why, for example, this Court found, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even though there is no codification, that the doctrine 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of equivalence is still applicable after the 1952 Act, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even though nothing was said about it.  And --

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There is a whole series 

   

  

 

 

 

of decisions in the courts of appeal.  On the legal

This Court has never ruled on it.  Is the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court estopped because there have been a number of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts of appeals who have ruled one way?  This Court 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has never addressed the question. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  This Court is never estopped 

  

 

 

 

 

 

from anything that it doesn't think it's estopped from. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

case, Justice Ginsburg, is what did Congress in -- did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress in -- in enacting the 1952 Act intend to retain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and reflect the patent law, laches case law, as it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

intended to retain and reflect patent law in general? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And there are -- I mean, I gave you the example, for 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example, to Justice Sotomayor's question of where was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- you know, an express intent to include laches, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gave you the example of the doctrine of equivalence. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

There are many, many other doctrines that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

were continued and that this Court has found were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

continued. 

13 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  A weak point in your 

    

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

argument is all -- most of those prior cases were --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were equity cases, but the weak point's weakened because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most of those equity cases after 1897 were under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions that had a statute of limitations, and the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason you didn't have laches in equity is because it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

didn't have a statute of limitations.  But here you did 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have a statute of limitations. 

   

 

 

21 

            

So you have all those cases; that's your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22 

23 

argument.  And I'm -- I'm actually just trying to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

summarize it so you'll tell me where it's not correct. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 

            

25 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  I just want to strengthen it. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Strengthen it, but 

  

  

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

40

2

4 

when you strengthen it, will you please spend about a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minute or two on what I thought was another argument, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which now has been seriously undercut, and I want to be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure you have a chance to address it. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

5 

            

6 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  And this is --

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I was -- I was afraid of --

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

and I think I might have been well wrong to be afraid of 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it -- but moved in part by the Dell brief, I was afraid 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that a person with a patent or the transferee of that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent, in year 2, would have told the -- a licensee, go 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right ahead, go ahead, or not said anything when he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could have or something like that, that would have given 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rise to laches.  That licensee would have spent billions 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on technology that is very hard to change. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

16 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Breyer --

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And then in year 18, this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

person, now the transferee of the patent, sues him, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he is going to get six years worth of profits and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing deducted.  Now they have told me that's totally 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong because what you would have done is gone back to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

year two, figured out a reasonable rate of return, and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's what it would have gotten. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'm still a little worried that he brings 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the same lawsuit in 19 -- year 19, year 20, years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thereafter, and thereby really fixes this guy who has,

chance. 

5 

            

6 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Yep. 

  

 

JUSTICE BREYER:  But I want to give you a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR. WAXMAN:  Thank you. 

  

 

 

Justice Breyer, the Dell brief is one of a

dozen briefs that addresses the very significant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequences to extending Petrella to the very, very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

different statutory and commercial context.  The -- the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

industry as a whole, across the board, is so clear that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- that laches should apply and continue to apply, that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the -- the Intellectual Property Owner's Association, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the group that represents people against whom laches are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asserted, has told this Court in an amicus brief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supporting neither party that laches existed, exists, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and should continue to exist in this case.  And the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason why is, in addition to --

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Waxman, can you get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

to Justice Breyer's question?  What is the economic 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

consequence other than paying a reasonable royalty? 

   

 

 

 

 

Let's assume somebody waits till year 19.  They are only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going to get a reasonable royalty from year 14 or -- my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

math is horrible -- year 13 to 19.  What else?  What's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the other economic loss? 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, the -- the economic -- of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

42 

course we're now just talking about retrospective 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages.  And as this Court explained in Petrella, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and -- and explained first in 1880 in the Menendez case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

laches can apply when the -- the severity that the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unreasonableness, and inexcusably, the delay is long 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enough, and the prejudice is substantial, to defeat all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

forms of remedy. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

            

But the prejudice here is that, unlike in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

the copyright area where Congress adds -- adds two whole 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Roman numerals of this majority's opinion, and Petrella 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explains, there are many, many signals otherwise in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way that the copyright law is constructed, that Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was knowledgeably and intentionally assuming and 

 

 

 

 

 

accepting that -- that claims would be brought years and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

years after the fact that would limit the damages to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only those net profits for three years out of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hundred-plus years of the copyright life. 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

            

In this case, we are talking about six years 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

of a 20 -- really more like 17 years -- and we are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talking about instances recounted in the amicus briefs 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in which defendants are locked in.  And they are not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just defendants in copyright law. 

 

 

 

 

            

In order to be a defendant, you have to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

copy.  You have to know that you are copying something. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And copyright law doesn't apply to third parties or

people who use it or make nonpublic displays. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

            

In the patent law, there is strict 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

liability.  Independent invention is no defense. 

  

 

 

 

 

4 

            

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Mr. Waxman, to follow 

  

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

8 

up on this point, Mr. Black made several -- made several 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

points.  One is that asserting a laches defense is 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

obligatory, and therefore it leads to a lot of pointless 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation, according to his submission. 

 

 

 

 

9 

            

And second, that the reasonable royalty is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

not such a tremendous penalty. 

   

 

 

11 

            

12 

two? 

13 

            

So could you just respond briefly to those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, I don't know how often 

   

  

 

 

 

 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

laches is asserted or not asserted.  It is true that it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not often found to have been satisfied.  I mean, the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-- the existence of laches is -- and laches as a defense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to damages -- and then I will get to the economic harm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

part -- was so settled, that -- I mean, that's the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason why this Court has never addressed it.  It was so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

settled, that in this very case in which the plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sued for an injunction and damages and laches was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asserted, until after this Court announced its decision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in Petrella, the defendant never in any of its pleadings 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or briefings or defenses said, laches?  Laches doesn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply to damages.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the Federal Circuit's 

  

 

 

 

 

6 

position was clear. 

 

 

7 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  That -- that's entirely right. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

The point here is that -- that the principle that laches 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied to damages was so unexceptional, that it simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

wasn't defended. 

 

11 

            

Now, on the monetary damages, you have --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12 

13 

14 

15 

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

you can say, oh, yes, you know, perhaps the appropriate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy is reasonable royalty.  Although reasonable 

  

 

 

 

 

royalty is the floor, it's damages not less than 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable -- than a reasonable royalty.  But it's being 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

applied against not just people who -- who make or sell 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the invention, but people who use the invention, like in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

theory -- in theory, any of us with respect to devices 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that have chips that can't be marked, and against people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who had no idea that they were necessarily infringing a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

patent. 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

The Petitioner's own amici make the point of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

how difficult it is to know, even if you know of a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patent, how the claims will be construed, or whether it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will be -- you'll be ascertained to have, in fact, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

infringed that particular --

 

 

 

2 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  The part -- the part I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

3 

4 

5 

6 

missing in your argument, I've focused it -- look.  Year 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13, okay?  It all turns on a license.  License.  Year 1. 

   

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Gone.  Disappeared.  Far.  Can't find any witnesses, 

  

  

  

 

 

 

okay?  So therefore, laches, if laches exists. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

7 

            

Now, you say, the difference with copyright 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

9 

10 

is that the people there involved are really locked in, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that -- those are your words, "locked in."  I want to 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say respect, locked in.  So what?  Why does that make a 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

difference? 

12 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, because, in the -- in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

14 

15 

copyright context, since in order to even commit the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tort of copyright infringement you have to know you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

copying, and you can always choose some other form of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

expression. 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

In the patent doctrine, where it is -- it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strict liability where independent invention is not a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense, there are many, many opportunities recounted in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the amicus briefs in which there's every opportunity to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

design around a particular patent claim. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE BREYER:  "Locked in" means you can't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

change.  Why is it relevant that you can't change? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  It's relevant you can't change 

  

 

 

 

 

 

because at the point -- at the later point in which the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

-- the plaintiff who unreasonably and without excuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comes in to your substantial prejudice and says, a-ha, I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

got you, you don't have the option of mitigating. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You've built a $1 billion plant, or the -- you're using 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the patent to -- a -- a standards-essential patent --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How much do you have to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

8 

9 

10 

pay?  You have -- it's only six years.  And if what you 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have to pay is a reasonable royalty, that doesn't sound 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so horrendous, does it?  And it sounds like just what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress meant when it gave you a six-year statute of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

limitations. 

12 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  It is damages not less than a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

reasonable royalty. 

 

14 

15 

16 

17

22 

23 

24 

25 

            

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What does the judge 

  

 

 

 

 

usually charge -- now in many of these cases, at least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one of the briefs said, are tried to a jury.  What does 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the judge instruct the jury about the monetary recovery 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in a patent suit? 

   

 

            

MR. WAXMAN:  Oh, there are -- I mean, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

ordinarily, what plaintiffs will seek are the lost 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

profits of the -- of the plaintiff, or another measure 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of damages, and the judge instructs the jury that as a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

safeguard, the floor is not less than a reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

royalty.  In other words, the judge instructs the jury 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in accordance with the provisions of -- of Section 284. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

But the point here is -- I mean, again, I --

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

2 

3 

you keep saying -- and whatever is -- and it is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainly true that in the -- may I finish my sentence? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4 

            

5 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure. 

  

 

 

MR. WAXMAN:  In the event that there is a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

statute of limitations, whether you call the 1897 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision one or not, what is one to make of a laches 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense?  The case law and the commentators answered 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that question pellucidly for the 1952 Congress. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10 

            

Thank you. 

 

11 

            

12 

            

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr. Black, you have four minutes remaining. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

Five minutes.  Sorry. 

  

 

14 

          

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN J. BLACK 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

              

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 

 

 

 

16 

            

17 

            

MR. BLACK:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

Patent law is an important branch of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

law, but it is just a branch, and this Court's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedence is the trunk and the roots.  And this Court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedent were very clear before 1952 -- in Homebrook in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1946, U.S. v. Mack, 1935; Wehrman, 1894 -- that laches 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot bar damages within the period of a Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute of limitations.  On the equity side of the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court, laches could bar a claim.  It was almost treated 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

like a jurisdictional issue, and an issue in copyright 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

48 

as well as in patent, because the way the equity courts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worked, if you wanted to seek injunctive relief, you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

went to equity. 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

            

If you only wanted to seek a monetary 

   

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

remedy, you could not go to the equity court.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under the Root case, and naked accounting was not an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acceptable basis for equity jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

8 

            

So plaintiffs would go to the equity court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

They would seek an injunction, and then they would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

get -- as additional remedy if they survived the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability phase and the laches findings, they would then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

go on to -- go to see a Special Master to deal with an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

accounting, an accounting of the profits.  That was the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remedy on the equity side. 

 

 

 

 

15 

            

They've got a statistic in their brief about 

   

 

 

 

 

 

16 

17 

18 

19 

damages in equity cases, but they were very rarely 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

awarded because the real candle was disgorging the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opponent's profits just as in copyright law.  It's not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available in patent law. 

 

 

 

20 

            

The number of damages cases, if you really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

wanted to look at it, you'd have to look at all the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases on the law side because those are always about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damages, and a small fraction in which a Special Master 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

awarded on the equity side damages rather than the --

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the accounting for profits. 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company

Congress abolished that provision in 1946

7

because it was unworkable.  The legislative history of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that Act reads like Bleak House.  It was a horrible 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

procedure which frustrated the parties, which they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

described as -- in terms of "justice delayed is justice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

denied," and they abolished that. 

 

 

 

 

            

So it was in front of Congress in 1952 with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three things.  This Court's precedent that said that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

laches could not be used to bar legal relief.  You had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the merger of law and equity in 1938 which scrambled all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the eggs.  You had the 1946 Lanham Act, which also went 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through the committee on patents and copyrights where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they specifically included the word "laches" in the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute.  And you had the abolition of the remedy that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties had been seeking as the primary means of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

monetary relief in patent law for 60 years. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There is no way that you can look at that, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that fact, and get around it by pointing to a book, a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

treatise, which, by the way, does not have a section in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it on unenforceability. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Black, I take it 

   

  

 

 

 

 

that Mr. Waxman's principal point is that what separates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

out the patent context is that laches was operating true 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in equity but with a statute of limitations, and that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that just wasn't true in other places.  The Congress was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

50 

used to the notion that laches would operate with a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute of limitations in place. 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

            

4 

            

So what's your response to that? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BLACK:  Laches could bar the suit in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

6 

7 

equity, but -- and then the plaintiff was out of court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but not on the law side.  On the law side, damages were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

available to the plaintiff. 

 

 

 

8 

            

 

 

 

There was an overall -- there was an overall 

 

 

 

 

 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

17 

18 

19 

20

22 

23 

24 

25 

requirement, though, in Section 286.  And in the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

original 1897 version, which was just called a statute 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

of limitations, that said no matter what, if you're in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law, if you're in equity, you cannot get damages more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than six years before suit. 

 

 

 

 

            

But what happened in the equity courts is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the courts would take a look at whether or not the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiff had clean enough hands to continue pursuing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the case.  And if they'd waited too long, the equity 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

courts had that power which was granted to them back at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

common law -- not in common law -- back in England, and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they exercised the power to say, you know what, equity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is not going to help you because you waited too long. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Not true on the law side. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now, my opponent says there weren't any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases on the law side, but part of the reason for that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was you couldn't plead laches in a case of law.  You 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

51 

couldn't even plead it prior to 274(b), which I think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was 1919.  Then courts got -- that was the beginning of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merger.  Then courts got a little confused, and you have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases like Banker, which just got it wrong. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

            

But courts did not consider laches in cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 

7 

8 

9 

10 

11 

12 

13

16 

17 

18 

19 

20 

21 

22 

23 

24 

25 

of law because they couldn't.  It would have been like 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pleading contributory negligence in a contract case.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

just wasn't a recognized defense. 

   

 

 

            

But when we look at this Court's precedence, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it was very clear, laches cannot bar legal relief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Petrella has a tremendous benefit to it.  It 

   

  

 

 

 

 

has a very clear -- clear rule of decision that decides 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this case and any others that might come before the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court on the nature of laches.  We look to the nature of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the remedy in modern litigation, not to the vagaries of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the merger of law and equity or ancient equity practice. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We look to the remedy.
