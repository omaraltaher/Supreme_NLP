CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 01-1229, Pierce County v. Ignacio Guillen.


Mr. Hamilton.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. HAMILTON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. HAMILTON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


From the enactment of the 1966 Highway Safety


Act, a congressional report, specifically number 17 to the


89th Congress, which is quoted on page 2 of the blue


brief, congressional reports noted that, quote, no other


part of the State program is as basic to ultimate success,


nor as demanding of complete cooperation, end quote, as 

State collection of accident reports, because they are the


basis for hazard identification and correction.


However, soon after the 1973 Highway Safety Act


made accident data collection a condition to Federal


hazard elimination funds the Secretary of Transportation


reported to Congress that States strongly objected,


because they feared that their collection of accident data


would be used against them in damage actions.  Because of


this, unintended liability exposure threatened the


integrity and proper operation of a cooperative Federal-

State program that has saved thousands of lives --


QUESTION:  Would you help us figure out how to


interpret this statute?


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  It says data, highway safety data


compiled or collected by a State.  Now, I suppose that in


a crossing like we have here, where there might have been


accidents from time to time, that there would be police


reports or highway officer reports of motor vehicle


accidents at that site, right?


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  And those presumably are not either


compiled or collected for the purpose of getting highway


funding from the Federal Government.  They're compiled, I


gather, to serve the normal functions of law enforcement. 

MR. HAMILTON:  Your Honor, no, that's not


completely correct.


QUESTION:  No?


MR. HAMILTON:  They are collected and compiled


for purposes of highway hazard identification --


QUESTION:  Isn't --


MR. HAMILTON:  -- from the very beginning.


QUESTION:  Well, don't you suppose that at least


in some jurisdictions, maybe not Tacoma, but in some


jurisdictions you will find just ordinary police

reports --


MR. HAMILTON:  Well, it's my --


QUESTION:  -- of accidents, and sometime later,


perhaps the State might decide, or the county, I'd like to


have some Federal money to make some changes at that


crossing, and maybe we can use some of the data to


assemble it to try to apply for Federal money.  Now, how


should we interpret that statute?


MR. HAMILTON:  Well, in the -- if I understand


the hypothetical, the -- Your Honor is postulating a


situation where there is an accident report purely State


in origin.  Just to help the Court, I don't know that such


a thing exists after the crash data forms.  It's to be


understood that the Department of Transportation has been,


since 1966, working with the States to develop a uniform 

crash data form, and that -- I think it's becoming more


and more successful as that goes on, so I'm --


QUESTION:  So your point is that the police


officers are using a kind of a unified Federal traffic


report --


MR. HAMILTON:  Essentially --


QUESTION:  -- when there's an accident?


MR. HAMILTON:  The forms are not all the same,


because each State has the right to choose how to put it


together, but the elements of the forms are dramatically

Federal in their nature, and they're Federal totally


directed toward the issue of highway design.  That's


why -- Nation-wide there was a report cited by the


Washington State amici and multi-State amicus, amici


briefs that pointed out that Nation-wide before 1966 there


was no standard at all.


QUESTION:  Well, let me ask you this.  At page


20 of the respondent's brief we have four different


interpretations, possible interpretations of the acts set


forth.  Do we have to choose among those in order, as a


predicate before reaching the constitutional issue, and


I'll just -- and this is in line with Justice O'Connor's


question.  If we took the most expansive view of the


alternatives that she presents, then the opinion that we


would write, it seems to me, would be different than if we 

took the more narrow, the most narrow view, and that leads


me to the question, do we have to have a statutory


construction at the beginning point of our holding?


MR. HAMILTON:  I don't believe so, Your Honor,


and the county's position, and we believe it's well-


founded, is that the constitutional issue is not an excuse


for artificially narrowly interpreting --


QUESTION:  Well, but I think that our Court has


always preferred, along the lines suggested by Justice


O'Connor and Justice Kennedy, to construe a statute to

avoid constitutional problems if we can, and certainly the


respondents here at least suggest there are several


different constructions.  Are you not prepared to say


which of those you favor?


MR. HAMILTON:  Well, I've -- I'm happy -- in


fact, I had intended to, if given the opportunity, to


provide the Court the way the county believes the statute


should be interpreted.


QUESTION:  Well, I'll give you that opportunity


right now.


MR. HAMILTON:  Okay.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  Yes, that's our question, and you


might bear in mind if you wish that I think we generally


construe evidentiary privileges narrowly.


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes.  However, as the Court


pointed out on that issue of narrow construction that --


in the Shapiro case, I believe, which was also a raw data


case whose purpose was to encourage participation, that


even after quoting the standard, the test of a narrow


construction -- the test was first put to Congress'


intent, and that the issue of, you know, that particular


rule of construction is not to be used in a way to


artificially narrowly interpret what Congress meant, and


if Congress meant something, then that's the test.

 To answer Justice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist's


question, how does the county say the statute should be


interpreted, pretty much we agree with the logic of the


United States Solicitor General, but just would suggest


that the, their logic be extended to what we believe is


the logical conclusion.  In other words, we disagree with


plaintiffs that it only covers generated documents,


because under 409 that's interpretation conflicts with


what this Court has said the plain meaning of compiled


means, as this Court has discussed in the John Doe case


cited to the Court.


Also, this reads out of 409 the express


protection also of data collected, not just generated.  It


ignores the legislative history of why 409 was amended,


and why it used the language compiled --


QUESTION:  You're telling us what's wrong with


the other reading.  Which is your reading?


MR. HAMILTON:  Our reading, Your Honor, is that


there should be -- this Court should establish a bright


line rule that documents collect -- as the language says,


for -- we would ask the Court to enforce the language of


the statute, which reads, documents and data, quote,


compiled or collected for the purpose, end quote, of


specified highway safety programs, and here's the


operative language, quote, shall not be subject to

discovery or admitted into evidence in a Federal or State


proceeding or considered for any other purposes in any


action for damages arising from any occurrence at a


location mentioned or addressed in those documents or


data.  In other words --


QUESTION:  It doesn't say documents.  I mean,


you quoted it, you began the quote after --


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes --


QUESTION:  -- after the noun.


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes.  I --


QUESTION:  The noun you inserted was documents.


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes.  There are specific --


QUESTION:  It says --


MR. HAMILTON:  -- references to specific types.


QUESTION: 


It says data, doesn't it? 

MR. HAMILTON:  It says data, and also lists


reports, lists -- and that sort of thing, and I was trying


to condense it down, but yes.


QUESTION:  To be plain, do you mean that


everything that goes to the Public Works Department,


everything that eventually gets to the Public Works


Department and is relevant to the safety of highway


crossings is exempt from discovery?


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes, Your Honor, that is what


we're saying.

 QUESTION:  Every fact, so that if the Department


of Environmental Protection has prepared a report saying


the accidents are wrecking the grass and the flowers at an


intersection, and that report is then given to whatever


the data collection agency here is for this purpose, that


all of that data, including the data in the Department of


Environmental Protection, is then covered by the


privilege?  Is that your position?


MR. HAMILTON:  To the extent that that


characterization goes to the data that's in the reports. 


It's not to say that -- all we're saying --


QUESTION:  That's my question.


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  The same data is in the environmental


report. 


That data is then given to the collection agency. 

Does the data, even in the hands of the Environmental


Department, become subject to the privilege at that point,


on your reading?


MR. HAMILTON:  We believe the -- again, if it


meets the test of dealing with an occurrence at a --


again, following the language of the statute, an


occurrence at the location mentioned or addressed in such


reports in the damage action, then that report that it's


collected and compiled by --

I'm talking about the fact which is reported.


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  The data in the report.


MR. HAMILTON:  Well --


QUESTION:  Does that -- does that data --


QUESTION:  You can answer that yes or no.


QUESTION:  -- become subject to the privilege?


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes, if Your Honor means, when


you say data, going to the report to get the data, to --


if you were to -- if that person wanted to raise that


issue were to go to the person who, or the entity that


created that information, and were to depose that, those


people, they could get the information that way.  All


we're talking about --


QUESTION: 


Then your -- then the answer to my 

question, I guess, is no, the data does not become, as


such, subject to the privilege.  It's only the data as


held by the collection agency.  You can still go to the


Environmental Department, depose them, get your


information?


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes, you can.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes, and I'm sorry I


misunderstood you.


QUESTION:  Well, could you --

 QUESTION:  What if you don't have to depose


them?


QUESTION:  -- go to the Police Department under


this uniform Federal form you were telling us about it?


MR. HAMILTON:  I'm sorry, I missed the question.


QUESTION:  You said at the outset that there's a


uniform document for collisions or crashes or something.


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  And the Police Department fills it


out.  Can you go to the Police Department and get that


information?


MR. HAMILTON:  Under our interpretation, you


could find the officer, you could depose the officer, but


you cannot get the report if it's collected and filed for


hazard identification.


QUESTION:  Well, so then Justice Souter's


hypothetical is different from this.  You said in Justice


Souter's hypothetical that you could go to that Department


and get the document, but if you go to the Police


Department you can't get the document.


MR. HAMILTON:  No --


QUESTION:  You didn't say he could get the


document.


MR. HAMILTON:  No.


QUESTION:  You said you could depose him --

 MR. HAMILTON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- and that was what my question was


going to be.  Are you drawing a distinction between


getting the document that was generated in the


Environmental Agency and deposing the person who made the


document?


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes, Your Honor.  That's a


distinction that the cases make --


QUESTION:  Why?  It says data.  I don't care


about the cases.  I care about the text of the statute. 


It says data.  It's data whether it's in a document or


whether it's in some deponent's head.  Data is data.


MR. HAMILTON:  I think that certainly is a fair


interpretation of the statute.  What we're trying to do is


synthesize how the courts have looked at this, and they 

have drawn the distinction saying that really what the


purpose of this was to put plaintiffs back in the position


they were before.  All this mechanism of creating accident


data existed beforehand.  That's what they had to do. 


They didn't have this silver platter.


QUESTION:  They could get a police report of an


accident.  Isn't that standard routine in negligence


cases?


MR. HAMILTON:  Your Honor, before the 1966


Highway Safety Act they could not get an accident, a

collection of accident reports, at least in Washington


State, and it's my understanding Nation-wide, just by


asking for them --


QUESTION:  But you could certainly get a


police -- at least judging from my own practice in Arizona


you could certainly get an individual police report of an


accident.


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes.  If you knew the -- and


that's the point.  You essentially have to know what


plaintiffs are trying to find out to get the document,


because you couldn't ask for all the accidents at this


intersection.  You could ask for a date and people


involved, but you couldn't ask for, give me all the


accidents at a particular intersection.


QUESTION: 


No, but you could ask for the police 

report of the particular accident that you were concerned


with.


MR. HAMILTON:  Prior to 1966, yes, Your Honor,


that's correct.  That's --


QUESTION:  I'm still slightly mixed up.


MR. HAMILTON:  Okay.


QUESTION:  Imagine the forest service in the


State collects, because they have tree lovers, a piece of


paper that says the elm trees at the intersection of such-


and-such were diseased, all right.  Now, that's done for

purposes of tree health, and there's a piece of paper in


the environmental tree section which has that written


right on it, and one day the Transportation Department for


safety reasons says, send us a Xerox of that, okay.


The question I think Justice Souter was asking


and Justice Scalia, and I would certainly ask, is, in your


view, when they send a subpoena or discovery to the tree


department to get that piece of paper, can they get it?


MR. HAMILTON:  No.


QUESTION:  No?


MR. HAMILTON:  No.


QUESTION:  Very well.  Suppose that the


Transportation Department one day wrote a witness' name


down, an address which they got from the internal State


government telephone book. 


In your opinion, could a 

plaintiff go and ask for a telephone book?  The answer, I


guess, is no.


MR. HAMILTON:  Let me think about that for a


minute.


QUESTION:  Well, I don't see what the difference


would be.  They didn't collect the telephone book for


purposes of -- they didn't make the telephone book for the


purposes of accidents, but one day somebody went to the


telephone book and copied some information out of it for


the purpose of accidents --

 MR. HAMILTON:  I think what they copied --


QUESTION:  -- and that's why, you see, exactly


why I find your interpretation of the statute rather


strained, so what is the answer to what my hypothetical


suggests?


MR. HAMILTON:  Well, since my answer would be


strained if I said the photo, the telephone book, what I'm


referring to would be what was written down for the


purposes, and collected for the purposes --


QUESTION:  But you said that they could not get


the piece of paper --


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes.


QUESTION:  -- in the Tree Division --


MR. HAMILTON:  The --


QUESTION: 


-- and all I'm having trouble is 

distinguishing between the piece of paper written for tree


health and the address in the telephone book written so


people can know where people should be phoned.


MR. HAMILTON:  The piece of paper written for


tree help -- and I'm sorry I misunderstood the question. 


I thought the Court was asking about the telephone book. 


The telephone book, no.  The piece of paper that was


written down from that, yes, because that's collected and


compiled, and that's really what the SHOTS case said, that


if there's a question about this of whether this was

25

really fairly included for the purposes of 152, then for


that purpose you have an in camera inspection.


QUESTION:  But what is there that suggests that


Congress wanted to change the game to that extent?  One


can understand what you've suggested before, wanting to


keep personal injury plaintiffs in the same place they


were before this legislation, but your interpretation


takes away from plaintiffs things that they would have had


access to before.


MR. HAMILTON:  Your Honor, we -- respectfully,


we disagree with that characterization of our position.


QUESTION:  Well, you just, in response to the


Chief's question, said that at least the police report of


this accident was routine.


MR. HAMILTON: 


The police report of this 

accident, when you go and ask for -- and the reason why is


because -- because of the Highway Safety Act, 1966 Highway


Safety Act, the accident reports were indexed by location. 


You could go and get a specific report if you knew the


facts enough of the accident, but only that accident


report, not all of them, and that is how 409 --


QUESTION:  But that's not because of a


privilege, is it?


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes.  It is because of a


privilege.

 QUESTION:  I thought the reason for that is the


police said, look, we don't have to do your homework for


you.  If you know what you want, we'll give it to you.  If


you don't know what you want, we don't have to search for


it.  Isn't that the reason?


MR. HAMILTON:  Yes, because the police don't do


that.  The police don't care about highway design factors


other than because the form asks them to.


QUESTION:  Okay, so in the past, then, and in


accordance with Justice Ginsburg's question, you could


have asked for the police report, and in Justice Breyer's


example, I presume you could have gone to the Tree


Division and said, let's have the slip of paper that says


the elm trees are diseased.  Now, you can't do that.


MR. HAMILTON: 


Well, Your Honor, I believe 

that --


QUESTION:  And Justice Ginsburg's question is, I


thought it was supposed to leave things, as it were,


level, the way they were, that a disadvantage was not


being created, it was simply, the intent was simply to


avoid creating a new advantage which would deter the


State.  Isn't that the way we should read the statute?


MR. HAMILTON:  I think the purpose, yes, Your


Honor, is to avoid discouraging States from participating,


and allowing them to get accident reports from the hands

you very much.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS INTERVENOR


MR. CLEMENT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The 1995 amendment to section 409 is, contrary


to the determination of the Washington State Supreme


Court, constitutional.  The provision protects data that


is compiled and collected for purposes of applying for


Federal highway funds from being used in State and Federal 

court litigation.  The documents at issue are inherently


Federal in character, and so Congress has the power to


prohibit the use of those documents in both Federal and


State court litigation.


QUESTION:  Well, what about documents created


not for the purpose of getting Federal funds, not for


section 152, but for some other purpose, some of which are


later incorporated in a Federal funding application --


MR. CLEMENT:  I think those documents --


QUESTION:  -- by a different agency?

documents were sought from the party that collected them


for a purpose different than the Federal highway funding


purposes, but what the statute, I think, does prohibit is


somebody going to the State Highway Traffic Department and


essentially engaging in a one-stop shopping enterprise


where they can get all sorts of documents that have been


collected --


QUESTION:  But you differ from petitioner in


your reading of the statute.  Yours is much narrower, I


take it.


MR. CLEMENT:  That's exactly right, Justice


O'Connor, and so as a result of our interpretation of the


statute, the typical police accident report can be 

obtained from the Police Department and, I think with


respect to Justice Breyer's hypothetical, the report about


the tree can be obtained from the State Tree Department or


the State Environmental Department.


QUESTION:  Let me ask a somewhat different


question, although I'm not sure we've resolved the point


that we've been inquiring about.  Would a State have the


right to waive this privilege?


MR. CLEMENT:  I think that's a difficult


question, Justice Kennedy.  I think that as you know, as a

general matter evidentiary privileges are waivable, and


so -- and that's the proposition this Court has


established in cases like Menzonato and Hill, but there is


a sense in which this privilege exists, in our view,


primarily for the benefit of the Federal Government, so


that we can obtain accurate, complete, and candid


assessments of highway traffic safety requirements, and


so, there's a suggestion, for example, in the Hill


decision at footnote 3 that, when a third party's


interests are at stake, that the court may not find waiver


under those circumstances as readily as it would


otherwise, so our view I think would be that although the


Court need not definitively resolve it in this case,


there's a strong argument that the privilege would not be


waivable.


QUESTION:  Let me just interrupt you, if I may. 


Are you saying that the lawyer defending the county, if


the plaintiff called him up and said, I'd like to see


these reports, and the lawyer said, well, they're


privileged, but I think I'll give them to you because I


think it's in everybody's interests to know the facts,


that would violate the Federal statute?


MR. CLEMENT:  I think the admissibility of those


materials --

them to the plaintiff.


MR. CLEMENT:  I think there's a sense in which


it would violate the Federal statute, but I'm not


suggesting that the Department of Transportation is going


to be able to leap to the defense of the statute in that


hypothetical and assert the interests of the statute.  I


think, however, if a State wanted to take a systematic


policy of disregarding section 409, I think that would


implicate the Federal interests, and I'm not sure that a


State would be able to do it.


QUESTION:  Well, supposing this simply comes up


during a trial.  A witness is put on the stand, asked


about the preparation of a report, and the State doesn't


object, and it would be objectionable under the statute. 


Now, is that something that could be challenged on appeal, 

say?


MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think so, Chief Justice. 


I think it is something that could be procedurally


defaulted, but I do think if in a case like that the State


went to the trial judge and said, look, there is this


provision of Federal law, section 409, that says this


material can't come in, but we're happy to just disregard


that provision, I think the trial court might well be


within its rights to say that no, we're not going to


disregard that provision of Federal law, we're going to

keep the material out, but I do think it could be --


QUESTION:  With these rights, is it a matter of


discretion for the trial court?  I mean, it would be one


thing to say it's mandatory, it's a Federal requirement,


and now you're suggesting that the lawyer can overlook it,


and the court could or must act on its own?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I'm suggesting that the


language of the statute is mandatory.  It says that it


shall not be admitted, so I think if the language is


brought to the attention of the trial court judge, he or


she would be in a position where they ought to exclude the


evidence.


QUESTION:  How would this be enforced by the


Federal Government?  I understand, and correct me if I'm


wrong, that the Federal funding is not tied to the 409 

privilege, but is tied to the 152 reporting obligations,


so what Federal enforcement would there be for a county


that says, we think it's fair for the plaintiff to have


accident reports, so we'll give them.


What Federal -- how would that mandatory


requirement that you just stated be enforced by  Federal


authorities?


MR. CLEMENT:  I think under the circumstances


that you're envisioning, Justice Ginsburg, the Federal


Government would not provide funds under 152 or 130 or 144

to that particular locality.


QUESTION:  So you're saying that the 409


privilege is not simply a right of the State agency, but


is -- that the funding depends on the State's asserting


that privilege?


MR. CLEMENT:  It certainly depends on the States


or the localities abiding by that privilege as a general


matter.  I don't think a State or a locality can take a


cavalier position of saying, we're just not going to be


bound by the provisions of this Federal statute, but yet


we'd still like to take the money under those three


statutes.  I don't think that's permissible, and the


reason is, is that section 409, although it may benefit


the State in a particular litigation, does serve an


important Federal interest, and that is the interest in 

getting complete and candid information to assess and to


award Federal highway funds.


By analogy, I would suggest this Court look to


its decision in the Buckman Company v. Plaintiff's


Committee case, because in that case this Court recognized


that the FDA approval process, and the process for


applying for FDA approval, is inherently Federal in


character, and so this Court preempted State tort law that


might distort the effect of applying for FDA approval.


In the same way, the process of applying for


24

18

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

Federal highway funds and the documents that are used for


that purpose have an inherently Federal character, and so


the Federal Government has an interest in making sure that


the information provided to the Federal Government is


accurate and complete, and it has an ability, Congress has


the power to take those essentially Federal documents and


protect them both in State and Federal court litigation.


Now, I would suggest that the answer to the


waiver question, unlike the answer to the statutory


construction question, is not a necessary component of


this Court's decision.  We think the better view is that


it could be -- is that it could not be waived, at least in


gross.  Of course, if it could be waived, I think that is


an additional answer to any accountability questions that


may arise, but again, we think the better view is that it 

can't be waived.


QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, one of the arguments


made by respondent Guillen is that -- is a Tenth Amendment


argument.  Do you think he has standing to make that


argument?


MR. CLEMENT:  I think the better view is that he


doesn't have standing to raise that argument, and I'll


also suggest that if they wanted to make a Tenth Amendment


argument, and wanted this Court to decide the difficult


question of whether or not an individual had standing to

raise a Tenth Amendment argument, that they probably


should have raised the Tenth Amendment argument before the


conclusion section of their brief, and I think this Court


would be well-advised not to definitively decide whether


or not an individual had standing to raise a Tenth


Amendment issue.  I --


QUESTION:  Why -- what's special about the --


this is just an assertion that the Federal Government has


no authority to do what it has done, and you say an


individual who has been harmed by the Federal Government's


exceeding its authority does not have standing to


challenge?  It seems to me we do it all the time.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, Justice Scalia, I don't


think all Tenth Amendment challenges are created equal,


and I think therein lies the difference. 


If all the Tenth 

Amendment challenge is, is a mirrored reflection of


Congress not having the enumerated power to enact a


statute --


QUESTION:  But that's all it --


QUESTION:  How about a Commerce Clause


challenge?


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. CLEMENT:  Absolutely.  In those kind of


cases, the individual does have standing, but this Court


on various occasions has suggested that there's an

additional component to the Tenth Amendment, that it's not


just a reflection of the enumerated powers of Congress,


but, rather, there are certain special areas of State


prerogatives that the Federal Government can't intrude


through congressional acts.


QUESTION:  Well, we allow those challenges all


the time in separation of powers cases.


MR. CLEMENT:  I think that's right, but Justice


Kennedy, I think there's something that certainly seems


different.  If the gravamen of the complaint is that


there's some element of State sovereignty that Congress


cannot intrude upon, and the State doesn't object to that


intrusion, it seems odd that the individual would have


third party standing to raise that objection.


QUESTION: 


Why couldn't you say the same thing 

for the Executive and the legislature in a case like


Chadha?


MR. CLEMENT:  Again, I think you could, and I


think that's why with respect to a more typical Tenth


Amendment challenge that's based on an enumerated power,


or the lack of an enumerated power, there would be


standing.  I think what this Court suggested --


QUESTION:  I don't -- whenever the Government


goes beyond its enumerated power, it is infringing upon


the powers of the States, isn't it?

 MR. CLEMENT:  Well --


QUESTION:  All the Tenth Amendment says is, you


know, other than the enumerated powers, the other powers


continue where they used to be, with the States.  In other


words, I don't see anything special about a Tenth


Amendment claim.


QUESTION:  In Buckley v. Valeo we held that the


Appointment Clause, where the President had signed the


legislation, could be raised by private individuals.


MR. CLEMENT:  No, I understand that, and that


was also true in Chadha.  I think if there is a


difference, and this Court suggested there might be a


difference in the TVA case, if there is a difference it's


because there are certain Tenth Amendment challenges that


have the nature of just an intrusion on State sovereignty 

that's particularized.  The hypothetical that the cases


have often talked about is moving a State capital, and if


the State doesn't object to moving the State capital, it's


hard to see why an individual ought to be able to raise


that question.


I think the more important point, though, for


this case is that there was a suggestion to this effect in


this Court's TVA decision.  If this Court wants to revisit


that decision, it probably doesn't want to do it in a case


where the Tenth Amendment challenge is not properly raised

and isn't even raised at all in the briefing before this


Court until the conclusionary section of the brief.


With respect to the enumerated powers questions,


which I think are the gravamen of respondent's case and


the Washington Supreme Court's decision, there's no


question the individual has standing.  That was true in


this case, in this Court's decision in United States v.


Lopez and would be equally true here.


And I think this Court can take comfort in


knowing that this is, at bottom, an enumerated powers


case, not a Tenth Amendment case in any specialized sense,


because the Washington State Supreme Court found it


unobjectionable that section 409 would apply in its pre-


1995 amendment version, and what that indicates is that


there's nothing sacrosanct about State courts' procedures, 

or State evidentiary rules.


QUESTION:  Don't you think that our opinion in


the Commerce Clause case, in order to have persuasive


force, should begin with an interpretation of the statute,


recognize that a privilege can be waived or not waived?  I


find it very difficult to see how this opinion can be


written when we're not sure of the reach of the statute.


MR. CLEMENT:  I agree with you entirely, Justice


Kennedy, that this Court should define the scope of the


statute before deciding whether or not it's


29

constitutional, and we would urge the United States'


construction of the statute.


I would say that the waiver question is somewhat


different.  I don't think the constitutionality of the


statute turns on the waiver question.  If the Court


disagrees, we would urge the Court first to find that this


privilege is not waivable at least in gross and, second,


that even if it is waivable, the statute remains


constitutional.


QUESTION:  Do we have a final State decision


here, Mr. Clement?


MR. CLEMENT:  I think you do have a final State


decision, and I think that's most clear with respect to


the PDA action -- that's the State Public Disclosure Act


that was brought -- because in that case the Washington 

Supreme Court held that the four documents were


disclosable and said that attorney's fees would be


appropriate.  In this --


QUESTION:  There was a fifth document, though,


and they didn't -- there was no appeal on that one, right?


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, but there was no cross-


appeal on that document either, Justice Scalia, so I think


that document is no longer part of the case.  When the


Washington Court of Appeals held that four of the five


documents needed to be disclosed, Pierce County took an

appeal to the Washington State Supreme Court, but I don't


think that the Guillens filed a cross-appeal suggesting


that the fifth document ought to be disclosed, and so I


really think the fifth document is no longer in the case,


and since the Washington Supreme Court found that


attorney's fees were appropriate, that means that there


was a final judgment.  That's true both at the --


QUESTION:  Mr. Clement, there was -- you said


that the PDA suit, the four documents were required to be


turned over under that, but I thought the Washington


Supreme Court said that accident reports from nonofficers,


from witnesses, would not be disclosable under the PDA,


though they would be subject to discovery under rule


26(b), so the notion that the PDA suit was the one that


determined that these four documents were required to be 

turned over, I don't understand that, because I thought


there was one part at least, the reports from nonofficers,


that the county prevailed on before the Washington Supreme


Court, but that it was a Pyrrhic victory because they lost


on that point under 26(b).


MR. CLEMENT:  That's not how I read the


decision, Justice Ginsburg.  I thought -- I read the


decision as the four documents were clearly going to be


disclosed as part of the PDA action.


QUESTION:  Did you read the decision to say that


31

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

these documents are not disclosable under our Freedom of


Information Act, nevertheless they can be discovered in a


civil litigation?


MR. CLEMENT:  That's not, with respect, how I


read the opinion.  I read the opinion that those four


documents are disclosable under the PDA.  The only


objection to disclosure under the PDA that was raised by


the county was section 409, and with that issue resolved


against the county, I took the import of the decision that


those documents would be disclosed.


At that point, I think it's clearly a final


decision, because this Court has held in the Beckton


Dickinson case in the context of section 1291 that the


fact that attorney's fees need to be resolved on remand


doesn't deprive a decision of finality, and in that 

decision this Court relied on 1257 decisions, and so I


would think that the same rule would apply in both


contexts, so I think that the PDA action clearly is final.


I think the tort action is a more difficult


question as to whether that's final.  I think this Court


might have to change its -- to modify its precedents a


bit, but I think it might be a wise course in light of


what Congress has done here.  I think this case is quite


analogous to a case that this case found final called


National Mercantile Bank v. Langdow, and in that case

25

there was a State venue provision that a Federal statute


trumped, and the State supreme court found that the --


this Court found that the State's decision saying that


State law trumped the Federal statute was final, and I


think the cases are quite parallel.


They both involved congressional efforts to


modify State procedure in order to serve a Federal


interest, and in both cases when the State court


disregarded the Federal interest and either through


constitutional means or statutory means found the Federal


statute inapplicable, this Court found that there was a


final judgment in the Langdow case, and I think by


extension of that decision, they could find a final


judgment here.


I think the main difference between this case 

and Langdow is that in Langdow this Court took the


position that upon remand there would be no further


litigation available in the State court where the lawsuit


was filed.


Here, there might be some litigation that would


go on in the tort action, for example, but I think the


important thing is that the Federal interest has been


extinguished, and I think if there's any play in the


joints in this Court's finality decisions, I think that


this would be a particularly important case to find a

final decision, because an act of Congress has been held


unconstitutional.


QUESTION:  Do we need to find finality with


respect to both?


MR. CLEMENT:  I don't think so, Your Honor.  I


think that these actions are severable.  They were


consolidated for purposes of appeal before the Washington


Supreme Court, and I think that --


QUESTION:  So if I don't want to wrestle with


the complexities of the tort action, what would we do,


just dismiss that case as improvidently granted and decide


the other one?


MR. CLEMENT:  I think that would be fair, or


this Court could just sort of ignore the tort case and say


that it's going to take jurisdiction over the PDA action 

and decide this Federal statutory issue in the context of


the State PDA action, and --


QUESTION:  Well, we can't ignore it.  I mean,


we've taken the case.  We've granted certiorari.  We've


got to do something with it.


MR. CLEMENT:  Well, I --


QUESTION:  Just hide it under --


QUESTION:  There's only one case --


MR. CLEMENT:  I mean, I think that this Court


could say that to the extent that the tort action is

before it, that that action is not final, and that -- or


they're not going to -- the Court's not going to


definitively resolve that, and that the PDA action is


final.


I would -- this Court in a different context


actually managed to bifurcate a single case and say that


one part of the case was final and the accounting action


that was subject to remand was not final.  That's the


W. W. --


QUESTION:  We wouldn't want to do that too


often, I think.


(Laughter.)


MR. CLEMENT:  No, no, but I think if you can do


that in a single case, I think you can certainly do it in


a case like this, where they started as separate actions, 

were consolidated only for purposes of appeal, and really


have separate life.


If, for example, this Court hadn't exercised


jurisdiction, what would have happened is that the two


cases would have gone back down.  The PDA action would


have been essentially over, because as the county


suggested, there's nothing left in the PDA action on


remand.  The tort action would go on, and once the PDA


action went back to the trial court, then it would have


been appropriate to appeal that on a separate track from

the tort action, and there would have been really no point


to making the county go through that exercise, and so I


think the PDA action is final.


If there are no further questions, I think the


important submission from the Government is that the 1995


amendments can be given force in a way that renders them


still quite well within the Congress' power under the


Commerce, Spending, and Necessary and Proper Clauses.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Clement.


Mr. Mungia, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF SALVADOR A. MUNGIA


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. MUNGIA:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The statute does have to be construed, but 

regardless of how the statute's construed, it clearly does


not meet this Court's requirements under South Dakota v.


Dole because 409 is not conditional.  You read the plain


language of 409, and it's not conditional in nature.  It's


a mandate, and if somehow it could be construed as being


conditional, it's certainly ambiguous, as we've seen many


interpretations and many questions as to the operation of


409.


409 cannot be justified under the Commerce


Clause.  It does not regulate commercial or economic

activity.  Instead, it regulates State courts, and that is


the peculiar nature of this dispute, because what is at


issue is, is what does a State -- this is completely an


intrastate concern.


QUESTION:  Why is it intrastate?  If you simply


have a -- if you interpret the statute to say, a document


that is prepared primarily for this -- for getting money,


primarily for getting money out of the Federal Government


can't be discoverable in a tort action?  What part of the


Constitution would that violate, if that's how you


interpret it?


You'd get all your documents, I guess, and so


would anyone like you, but that seems to be basically what


the Government's arguing --


MR. MUNGIA:  Justice --


QUESTION:  I -- yes.


MR. MUNGIA:  Justice Breyer, I agree with the


Solicitor General's interpretation of the statute, we


still get our documents, and I do want to make it clear


for the record, and I think it's clear in the briefs,


Pierce County took a different tack on this and had a very


wide scope of interpretation.  However, despite that fact,


there still has to be authority under the Commerce or


Spending Clause, and I may not get it in this issue if we


get our documents, that's correct, but I'm saying that no

matter what, the act has to have authority under some


article I, section (a) basis.


QUESTION:  Well, that's certainly right, and so


Congress says, we have a Federal interest in trying to


minimize accidents, and in order to do that, we want to


get information from the States when they want our money,


and to be sure the information is accurate, we want to be


sure that at least the information they give us, they're


collecting with an eye towards being accurate rather than


with an eye towards protecting themselves from tort


litigation.


MR. MUNGIA:  Justice --


QUESTION:  It sounds reasonable to me.  What's


unreasonable about that?


MR. MUNGIA: 


Justice Breyer, because the 

analysis starts, is this commercial or interstate activity


that in fact the Federal Government is regulating, and


they're not, they're regulating State courts.  And


again --


QUESTION:  But they're regulating in the


interest of a commerce-type thing that's preventing


automobile accidents.


MR. MUNGIA:  That is the disputable part, as to


whether or not there's any evidence in, within -- not only


in the record, or anywhere that can be found, whether this

action, indeed, would prevent any further accidents.  All


the statute does --


QUESTION:  When Congress makes that judgment,


don't we owe it substantial deference?  That is, we're not


going to sit as a committee of Congress to determine


whether there's a link between the condition of these


intersections and vehicles going in and out of States.  If


Congress made that judgment, it's not for us to question


it, is it?


MR. MUNGIA:  Justice Ginsburg, that is the


historic and that is the correct analysis.  This Court has


been very deferential to Congress', even if there's


something within the information source that could support


that reasoning, and again I'll go to U.S. v. Lopez and


U.S. v. Morrison for that proposition, where in U.S. v. 

Lopez, there were no congressional findings at least this


Court alluded to.


They do not have to make congressional findings,


as long as there's something out there, some information,


and the same thing with U.S. v. Morrison.  Even when


Congress did make a congressional finding, this Court said


we're not going to necessarily find that in fact they had


a substantial effect on interstate commerce.


QUESTION:  May I ask you just to back up for a


moment to address the question that Mr. Clement did about

the separateness of these two?  Is there anything in the


tort action that you are seeking that's different from the


PDA action, or are these essentially two actions seeking


the same material?


MR. MUNGIA:  Justice Ginsburg, no.  They are


seeking different materials, and the materials we sought


in the tort action were much broader than what we sought


in the Public Disclosure Act, and the materials -- I do


want to say this as far as that, there is no judgment in


the tort action.  I mean, that should be clear.  There is


no final judgment.  This is a discovery order that was


taken up on interlocutory appeal.


Now, whether or not there is a final judgment in


the PDA action is a closer question, but I would point out


to the Court, page 114 of the Washington State Supreme 

Court's opinion that you'll find at Appendix A-114 directs


the lower courts to make their rulings in accord with the


court's opinion, and did not simply say these documents


either are or are not discoverable, and thus it is


debatable whether or not there is a final judgment even in


the Public Disclosure Act case.


QUESTION:  But the way you interpreted it,


although you say it's debatable, is that everything that


falls under the PDA, everything that -- those four


documents, those are not available to you.  That's what

Mr. Clement said, I think, that that's what rendered the


PDA action final.


MR. MUNGIA:  Correct, and I read the opinion


differently, where in fact we do get those documents, and


I -- we may have a fight back at the trial court as to the


language of the Washington State Supreme Court, because I


realize in its opinion it said that those would normally


not be discoverable under the PDA, but then you have to


look at the purpose of the documents.


QUESTION:  You set forth four alternative


interpretations at page 20 of your brief.  Do any of the


documents involved in either of the tort action or the PDA


action comprise just those set forth in your category 1,


which is reports and data that the State agency actually


prepares itself?


MR. MUNGIA:  Justice Kennedy, the documents that


we sought under the PDA, even under the narrowest


construction, under the narrowest construction, we get the


documents, just on a statutory construction under the PDA


request.


QUESTION:  But some of the documents you


requested fit naturally within your category 1?


MR. MUNGIA:  Correct.


QUESTION:  All right.


MR. MUNGIA:  And so at least in this case, this

Court need not address the constitutional issues, finding


no final judgment in the tort action and, in fact, a


narrow construction for the PDA action.


QUESTION:  I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understood. 


You say the documents that you requested fell within


category 1?


MR. MUNGIA:  Of our interpretation, which is a


very narrow construction of the statute.  That's correct,


Justice Stevens.


QUESTION:  In other words, they were documents


that were actually prepared to get highway funds?


MR. MUNGIA:  No, I'm sorry, if I --


QUESTION:  That's what I understood you to say.


MR. MUNGIA:  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  I'm saying we


would get those documents under our construction.  In


other words, they do not fall within the parameters of


that narrow construction, because these are documents that


in fact were prepared by another agency.


QUESTION:  So in your view, none of the


documents that you're -- that are in dispute fall within


category 1.


MR. MUNGIA:  Correct, under the PDA action, that


is correct, not the tort action but the PDA action.


QUESTION:  Do they fall in category 2?  Can you


tell us?

 MR. MUNGIA:  No.  If they don't fall within


category 1 -- I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.  If they fall


within category 2, yes, they would.  Under the PDA action,


those documents would fall within --


QUESTION:  Documents the agency has in its


possession?


MR. MUNGIA:  Correct, they fall within category


2.  And I do want to point out to this Court that, in


fact, Pierce County's position, and it's shown in the


record, was that we could not even discover the names of


witnesses or the names of the people involved in the


accidents, and that's surely not part of the Federal


highway funding data, because why is the Federal


Government concerned with the names of the people involved


in the accidents, and I think this is a concern about 

putting documents, if you will, in a black hole and


allowing certain information which our supreme court has


held is essential to the proper determination of these


claims, based upon State and local law.


They are essential to those determinations going


in, and now no longer being discoverable.  I think that is


a very basic concern with this statute, and why at least


one reason it should take a narrow construction, or at the


very widest, the construction put forward by the Solicitor


General.

 QUESTION:  But the construction put forward by


the Solicitor General, as I understand it, is you can get


it from the agency, like a law enforcement agency, but not


from the Public Works Department if the purpose is to


implement the Federal program.  That's the Government's


position?


MR. MUNGIA:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.


QUESTION:  But under that position, I suppose,


in the day when we have this great data base and all


reports are there initially, then under the Government's


approach, everything would be exempt from discovery.  Do


you read their position to say that?


MR. MUNGIA:  Correct, Justice Ginsburg, I do,


and that is the day, if it's not today, that this court --


QUESTION:  No, I didn't read it that way.  I


thought what they were saying was consistent with if it --


and maybe it's in this case.  I don't think it is, but I


mean, if you ever have the great single data base, you'd


look to see whether the document was primarily created for


the one purpose or the other.  Where it's primarily


created for accident reports, you get it.  Where it's


primarily created to get money from the Government, you


don't.  I mean, does that work as an interpretation?  I'm


not sure we have to reach it, but if we did?


MR. MUNGIA:  Justice Breyer, as far as

interpreting the electronic portion, it probably is a


reasonable interpretation, and you're right, I mean, it's


not part of this case, but it probably will have to be


faced sooner or later.


Going back to the scope, again, because we are


talking about the interpretation of this, Pierce County


took the position they were -- and this is in the


companion Witmer case, which is the one -- there was a


companion case at the State level, where private highway


surveys done by, I believe it was the McDonald's and a


Chevron Company, which the county then took within its


possession, it was unwilling to disclose because under


409, so again I think the county's position was a very


broad one, that anything that goes in within their


possession then becomes nondiscoverable and you cannot use 

it, which I think is a completely unreasonable


interpretation.


I do want to take a few minutes and talk about


the Spending Clause, because this is not a condition.  If


you read section 409, the plain language of 409, it's


mandatory, and surely when Congress has intended to use


its Spending Clause powers, I think especially in the


Federal highway setting, it's been very clear.


QUESTION:  I don't see how you can characterize


section 409 as a condition.  It's an incentive provided

to -- for the State to participate in this Federal funding


program.  The Federal Government hopes to get information


from the State, and thinks that they'll be more apt to get


it by providing the protections of section 409.  I don't


see it as a condition at all.


MR. MUNGIA:  Justice O'Connor, I agree.  I don't


think it's a condition either.  Whether you want to term


it as an incentive or something else -- they term it as a


mandate.  I think regardless of how you term it, then it


cannot be authorized under the Spending Clause.


QUESTION:  But --


QUESTION:  Well, why not?  It's a necessary and


proper means of ensuring that the Federal money is spent


wisely and efficiently.  Now, I don't see the big issue


there, frankly.


MR. MUNGIA:  Under the Spending Clause analysis,


this Court has long gone through through Pennhurst,


through South Dakota v. Dole, and just recently in Durham


v. Gorham, it's clear that the conditions have to be


spelled out.


Now, this is clearly some sort of imposition,


and if it's not Spending Clause, then they'd have to have


it under the Commerce Clause authority, which goes under


another analysis.


QUESTION:  You'd have another --

 QUESTION:  No State has to participate in this


program if it doesn't want to.  If a State wants to turn


down Federal money it can, can it not?


MR. MUNGIA:  It can turn down Federal money, and


that's the interesting, Mr. Chief Justice, about 409. 


Again, just reading the plain language of 409, it is


mandatory, and there's no provision -- even if you cross-


reference to 152, there's nothing which puts anybody on


notice about how this -- how a State can avoid the


mandates of 409.


QUESTION:  Well, it can avoid --


QUESTION:  But you can agree, nonetheless, that


a State can refuse to participate?  You say you can't, by


reading 409, tell that it isn't just a legislative command


based on something other than the Spending Clause, but 

don't -- you do agree, don't you, that if a State didn't


take the Federal money, it would not be bound by 409?


MR. MUNGIA:  Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's


an open question, and I don't necessarily agree with that.


I think you have to read the plain language, and it seems


like Congress is saying you will do this.


QUESTION:  You think it's just categorical,


then?


MR. MUNGIA:  Correct.


QUESTION:  But how could that be if -- how could

any document be collected for the purpose of participating


in the Federal program if the State doesn't participate in


the Federal program?


MR. MUNGIA:  Because if you read section 152,


what it mandates States to do is come up with a list and a


survey of hazardous sites.  That's all it says, in 52(a),


that's the mandatory part.


So Congress, if it has the authority, can tell


the States, do this list.  Now, the question, that begs


the question whether or not Congress has that authority. 


I think then that's when you have to turn to the


Commerce --


QUESTION:  Do the list whether or not you have


any Federal money, is that what you're saying?  This is


not tied to Federal spending. 


That's what you seem to be 

saying.  That it's independent Federal obligation on the


States whether or not they receive any Federal money.  Is


that how you read 152?


MR. MUNGIA:  Justice Ginsburg, that's correct. 


I think if you read the plain language, 152, unlike 23


U.S.C. 131, 141, 159, 161, where it's clear that Congress


says you must control highway billboard signs or you lose


10 percent of your funding, you must control size and


weights of vehicles that go on interstate highways or you


lose 10 percent of your funding.  Those are all clear.

 In fact, in the Dole case, under 23 U.S.C. 158,


I think that the title of the act was withdrawal of


Federal funds.


QUESTION:  Aren't we losing sight of the fact,


the rather plain fact that the States and the counties


wanted this?  They weren't satisfied with the program


originally because they feared these documents would be


discoverable, and make the county liable.  Do you have


another Spending Clause case where the States and the


counties came to Congress and said, please give us a


privilege, and then say, well, now it's mandatory and it's


some kind of a club rather than a carrot?


MR. MUNGIA:  Justice Ginsburg, I have two


responses.  One, I think actually this Court addressed


that same sort of analysis in New York v. U.S., where the 

Solicitor General argued that because New York officials


wanted the benefits of the Low-Level Hazardous Waste Act,


therefore it cannot later challenge certain provisions of


that act, and this Court rejected that argument.


QUESTION:  But this very provision they wanted,


not the thing in general.


MR. MUNGIA:  And that goes -- then to my second


part of my response is, and I think it's a fundamental


part of the constitutional analysis, because here, if the


States wanted this protection they had the means to do it


49

themselves, and this Court has explained, again citing


from New York v. U.S., State sovereignty isn't for the


benefit of the States, it's for the benefit of the


citizens to derive the benefits of liberty from the


division of separate powers, so it really, just because


State officials want it, it's clearly that the people of


the State of Washington did not want this, because it


infringed upon a State cause of action.  In fact, so much


so that the State supreme court was willing to hold it was


unconstitutional.


QUESTION:  Well, that goes to the waiver point. 


I assume the State can waive it if its citizens instruct


it to do so, or maybe not.  The Government says no.


MR. MUNGIA:  I -- Justice Kennedy, you look at


the language, and in fact you look at the early responses 

by Pierce County, where Pierce County clearly said, we


cannot -- I mean, we must -- we don't have that choice. 


We cannot --


QUESTION:  The hypothetical is that the State


could waive it if it wanted to.  That's the --


MR. MUNGIA:  And Justice Kennedy --


QUESTION:  -- hypothetical question.


MR. MUNGIA:  Yes, and I -- Justice Kennedy, my


response is, I don't see how the State could, because I


think just for the very reasons, as was pointed out by the

Solicitor General, where do you cross that line between, I


guess, a single waiver, and then it becoming endemic.  I


think that's the whole problem here.


Under the recent cases under the Commerce


Clause, and again I just want to spend a couple of minutes


on the U.S. v. Lopez and Morrison cases, it seems clear


that again this type of activity, what's being regulated


is, in fact, State courts, in fact, the admissibility, the


discovery of evidence, and that is certainly intrastate,


and there's no contention here that somehow justice, or


the discovery of documents is somehow commercial in


nature, and you cannot make that argument, so I think


there is no basis under either the Spending or the


Commerce Clause to support this legislation.


QUESTION: 


Well, is it irrelevant under your 

argument that the object of the Federal legislation is


safety in an artery of commerce?  Is that beside the


point?


MR. MUNGIA:  Justice Souter, the object at least


for the Federal Highway Act is safety.  I don't think the


same thing can be said about 409, because then you're


becoming -- as this Court said in U.S. v. Lopez, you're


building inference upon inference, because you have to go


and say, if these documents are no longer, in fact,


discoverable, would it result in safer interstate travel,

and there's just too many intermediate steps.


QUESTION:  So you that think the Federal


interest in this case is comparable to the Federal


interest in Lopez, the ultimate interest?


MR. MUNGIA:  I think that the -- Justice Souter,


the Federal interest in section 409 --


QUESTION:  No, I'm talking about the ultimate


Federal interest that gives rise to all of this


regulation, which is the safety of an artery of commerce. 


Are you either disputing that that is the object, or are


you saying that that object is on par for constitutional


purposes with the significance of the Government's object


in Lopez?


MR. MUNGIA:  Justice Souter, I think it's more


the latter. 


I'm saying that the Federal Government 

certainly has an interest in the safe passage of


interstate --


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Mungia.


Mr. Hamilton, you have 3 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. HAMILTON


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. HAMILTON:  Thank you, Your Honor.


Very quickly -- 3 minutes, quickly -- I would


like to correct I think what was a misstatement by


respondent's counsel, or at least one of them, dealing

with what the Court should do if it adopts the United


States' position.  Plaintiffs say that if you adopt that


position, then they get the documents.


I'll point out that on page 24 of their own


respondents' brief they say their -- interpretation


number 2, which they say the U.S. reflects, they say on


page 24, if the Court construes the statute in this


fashion, then a remand would be necessary to determine


which specific discovery requests would be precluded and


which would be, still be allowed.  They're not entitled,


even under their own admission, under the U.S. position,


and in fact I would point out on page 20 of our reply,


yellow brief, where we point out that in fact, if that


were the case, even if the U.S. position were adopted,


these particular documents would have to be protected. 

Furthermore, obviously there is some confusion


as to where we differ with the United States, and it's a


very narrow difference.  We both agree that generated


documents are protected.  We both agree that collected and


compiled documents in the hands of Public Works are


protected, and we both agree that in some situations


they're protected in the hands of third parties.


They, though, very narrowly define that in


situations where the third party gets it, is a transferee


agency, where you can only get it by indexing, or where


53

it's part of a computer base.


I would ask the Court to consider its own


St. Regis Paper Company case, where it addressed a statute


that only made a protection when it was in the hands of


third parties or officials, and it contrasted the language


of that statute with other statutes, 45 U.S.C. section 41,


and 49-320, whose wording is almost identical to 409.  If


you would compare those, you would see that the case


distinguished those types of statutes from a statute only


protecting in the hands of third parties.


So whatever 409 does, it certainly protects more


than just in the hands of third parties, and I would also


like to point out, the reason why we differ from the U.S.,


we believe their logic is correct with protecting in the


transferee hands and in a computer data base and where 

it's indexed, but if you carry that logic through, we


believe a bright line rule should be established by this


Court, because obviously the State courts have been


very -- some State courts, a minority of State courts have


been very resistant.


Other State courts have been trying to do their


best to comply with the language of the statute, but some


States, of course, have found every opportunity to try to


misinterpret the statute, and it required Congress at


least twice to amend the statute to get back to what they


54 

intended.


When you look at the situation of why they


wanted, the Solicitor General believed that documents in


the hands of the transferee agency are protected, they


said that the reason for that was that they would not


exist but for the planning agency's collection of that


information.  Well, so, too, accident reports would not


exist in their totally different form, they would not be


indexed and therefore accessible, and they would not be in


the county's possession but for the Highway Safety Act, so


you extend that logic through, then you come to a bright


line rule which we believe the Court should adopt.


Thank you, Your Honor.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Hamilton.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
