(10:04  a.m.) 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  14­8358,  Lockhart  v. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States. 

 

            

Mr.  Zas. 

 

             

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  EDWARD  S.  ZAS 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

This  case  concerns  the  ten­year  mandatory 

 

 

 

 

 

minimum  prison  sentence  that  Section  2252(b)(2) 

 

 

 

 

 

sometimes  requires  Federal  judges  to  impose. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  statutory  language  in  dispute  reserves 

 

 

 

 

 

the  severe  punishment  for  a  defendant  with  a  prior  State 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

conviction  for  an  offense  relating  to  any  kind  of  sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse  involving  a  minor  or  ward.  Because  Petitioner's 

   

  

 

 

 

 

prior  offense  did  not  involve  a  minor  or  ward,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute's  mandatory  minimum  penalty  does  not  apply  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Suppose  the  conviction 

  

 

 

 

had  been,  under  Federal  law,  the  ­­ the  conviction  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual  abuse  of  an  adult  and  we  have  the  same  question: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Does  the  mandatory  minimum  apply? 

 

 

 

 

              

I  take  it  if  it  had  been  under  Federal  law,

then  the  mandatory  minimum  would  apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  That's  correct.  If  the  conviction 

  

  

 

 

 

 

had  been  under  Chapter  109A  of  Title  XVIII,  which  covers 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual  abuse  offenses,  then  it  would  trigger  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mandatory  penalty.  But  Congress,  in  this  statute,  since 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  time  it  was  first  enacted  in  1978,  has  never  sought 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  create  symmetry  or  parity  between  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicates  and  the  State  predicates. 

 

 

 

 

            

This  may  be  most  clear  now  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsection  2252(b)(1),  where  you  can  see  that  a  prior 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  conviction  for  sex  trafficking  of  anyone,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  a  violation  of  Section  1591,  the  corresponding  State 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

analogue,  is  textually  limited  to  sex  trafficking  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children. 

            

So  this  decision  to  treat  prior  State  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  predicates  differently  is  inescapable,  and  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  true  ever  since  the  first  statute. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

So  from  1970  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  ­­ I  don't  ­­ why  ­­ why 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

is  it  in  this  case  ­­ it  ­­ it  does  seem  to  me  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress,  eight  years  later,  when  it  wrote  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second  statute,  used  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  same  style  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  very  much  favors  the  government.  But  then  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  that's  inapplicable,  because? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  Because  when  this  language  was

first  added  ­­ first,  it  was  added  in  1994. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Yes. 

  

 

MR.  ZAS:  The  Federal  predicates.  At  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

time  there  were  still  no  State  law  predicates  at  all. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  1996,  when  the  language  was  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

introduced,  and  it  was  then  introduced  in  Section  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsection  (b)(1),  which  applies  to  the  distribution  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

receipt  offenses,  even  then  the  penalty  for  simple 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possession  of  child  pornography  was  the  only  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicate. 

            

So  someone  in  Mr.  Lockhart's  position  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  time  would  not  have  faced  the  mandatory  minimum 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

penalty  even  if  people  who  ­­ who  committed  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distribution  offenses  would  or  even  if  ­­ even  if  he  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  conviction  for  ­­ under  Chapter  109A. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  ­­ and  then  in  1998,  when  this  language 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  dispute  was  then  added  at  the  government's  urging  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsection  (b)(2),  even  at  that  time  Congress  clearly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wasn't  aiming  for  parity  because  then  they  added  a  new 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  predicate,  Chapter  117  offenses,  which  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

violations  of  the  Man  Act:  Transportation  for  illegal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual  activity. 

 

            

But  at  that  time  it  didn't  add  any  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  ­­ State  offense  analogue  for  that  offense. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  has  continued  up  to  the  present  day.

So  in  2003,  there  were  amendments  to  add  the  obscenity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses,  the  Federal  obscenity  offenses  in  Chapter  71 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  list  of  Federal  predicates,  but  no  corresponding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  crime  for  obscenity  offenses. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  How  do  you  say  it  works 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

now  for  the  manufacturing  and  distribution  offenses?  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  your  position  on  the  possession  ­­ well,  you  said 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  a  disparity  between  a  Federal  conviction  and  a 

   

   

 

 

 

 

State  conviction.  How  about  a  conviction,  either  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

manufacturing  or  distribution? 

 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  Yes.  So  ­­ so  that  offense  is 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

covered  by  the  different  provision  of  Section  2251(e). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  penalty  provision  for  the  much  more  serious 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crime  of  actually  using  minors  or  children  to  produce 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  material. 

 

            

The  language  in  2251(e)  as  amended  in  2006 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ it  does  seem  to  track,  to  qualify  the  predicates 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  include  State­law  abuse  offenses  that  involve  adults 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  well  as  children.  But  that's  because  there's  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  textual  difference  between  Section  2251(e)  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute  we're  talking  about. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  if  you  go  back  to  Section  2252(b)(2), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you'll  see  an  important  textual  point  here,  which  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word  "or."  This  may  be  easier  to  follow  if  you  actually

look  at  the  statute  if  you  don't  have  it  open  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  appendix  to  the  blue  brief  at  pages  ­­ at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  10A.  You'll  see  that  the  list  is  written  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  sexual  abuse,  sexual  abuse,  abuse  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual  ­­ I'm  sorry,  or  abusive  sexual  conduct  involving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  minor  or  ward  or  a  bunch  of  other  offenses. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  "or"  before  abusive  sexual  conduct  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  be  there  on  the  government's  reading.  That  is,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abusive  sexual  conduct  involving  a  minor  or  ward  were  an 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent  stand­alone  offense,  the  "or"  does  no  work. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  unnatural  to  be.  Then  the  list  would  just  read, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  sexual  abuse,  sexual  abuse,  abusive  sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  involving  a  minor  or  ward,  or  ­­ and  it  would 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue. 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  there's  another 

  

 

 

 

possible  explanation  for  that,  because  the  last  item  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  list  itself  involves  a  great  many  ­­ itself  involves 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  list.  So  the  second  "or"  could  be  a  substitute  for  a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

semicolon. 

            

But  let  me  ask  you  another  question  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  language  that  you  just  read.  As  I  understand  your 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument,  this  provision  would  apply  to  sexual  abuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving  a  minor  and  also  abusive  sexual  conduct 

   

 

 

 

 

 

involving  a  minor. 

   

            

Is  there  any  difference  between  those  two

things? 

            

            

both  in? 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  No,  Your  Honor.  We  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  So  why  did  Congress  put  them 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  ZAS:  Well,  because  I  think  the  first 

   

  

 

 

 

 

point  here  is  it  must  be  for  the  same  reason  it  used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  sexual  abuse  at  the  beginning  of  the  list, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  ­­ which  I  think  both  sides  agree  does  no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

independent  work.  It's  already  covered. 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  there's  something  that 

  

 

 

 

 

jumps  out.  It's  a  strange  list,  aggravated  sexual 

   

  

 

 

 

 

abuse,  sexual  abuse.  Sexual  abuse  would  include 

  

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  sexual  abuse.  So  that  seems  to  be  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reference  to  aggravated  sexual  abuse  seems  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redundant.  And  abusive  sexual  conduct,  if  understood  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinary  ­­ in  the  terms  of  ordinary  language,  does  seem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  duplicate  sexual  abuse. 

 

 

 

            

 

But  there's  an  explanation  that  jumps  out, 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  is  that  this  ­­ almost  this  precise  terminology 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appears  in  Sections  2241,  2242,  and  2243.  And  in  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provisions,  all  those  terms  are  defined  so  that  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean  something  different. 

 

 

            

So  it  seems  to  jump  out  at  the  reader  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  Congress  was  doing  in  this  list. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Why  is  ­­ what  is  wrong  with  that?

MR.  ZAS:  Well,  first,  if  you  go  back  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  this  ­­ this  language  we're  talking  about  was  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

added  in  1996,  that  Congress  not  only  knew  how  to  ­­ how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  what  Your  Honor  is  suggesting,  that  is,  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tracking  the  Federal  predicates  exactly.  Because  in  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

different  provision,  the  provision  that  became  2241(c), 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  did  exactly  that.  It  ­­ it  describes  State  offenses 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whose  conduct  would  constitute  a  Federal  crime  if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

committed  within  Federal  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

            

So  they  didn't  do  that  here,  and  they  didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  it  again  when  they  added  the  particular  language  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1998  to  (b)(2)again.

MR.  ZAS:  Yes. 

  

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  As  I  see  it,  they 

   

  

 

 

 

 

did,  as  Justice  Alito  said,  track  pretty  much  exactly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2241,  42,  and  43  in  developing  the  list  that  they  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  add  ­­ that's  before  us  today.  I  didn't  understand 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  response. 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  there  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

really  two  responses.  One,  the  one  I  gave  to  Justice 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Alito  is  that  this  Congress,  in  1996  and  '98,  knew  how 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  track  when  they  wanted  to  track.  They  did  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

explicitly  in  other  provisions  of  the  same  legislation.

In  1996,  the  other  provision  was  2241(c).  In  1998,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  provision  was  2426(b).  So  it  knew  ­­ it  knew  how 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do  it,  and  didn't  do  it,  and  has  never  done  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  it  could  have  done  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  clearly.  That's  certainly  the  answer  to  this  whole 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  They  could  have  handled  this  issue  a  lot  more 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly. 

            

But  that  is  the  ­­ the  idea  that  they  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

picking  up  the  definitions  in  the  Federal  provisions  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  explanation  for  this  rather  strange  ­­ this  list. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  other  makes  the  list  terribly  redundant,  and  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't  heard  your  explanation  as  to  why  they  would  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that. 

            

Why  include  both  sexual  abuse  and  aggravated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual  abuse?  Why  include  sexual  abuse  and  abusive 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual  conduct? 

 

            

            

MR.  ZAS:  Two  responses,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

First  ­­ and  this  goes  to  the  Chief 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice's  question  as  well  ­­ this  list  does  not  track 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  predicates  as  precisely,  I  think,  as  some 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  suggested.  The  Federal  list  of  predicates  has  four 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes,  sexual  ­­ aggravated  sexual  abuse,  sexual  abuse, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual  abuse  of  a  minor  or  ward,  and  abusive  sexual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contact.  If  Congress  had  meant  to  track  those,  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

surely  would  have  used  the  same  four­prong  list.  They

didn't  do  that.  Instead,  they  used  a  different  term, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

"abusive  sexual  conduct." 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I  don't  understand  how 

    

 

 

 

that  answers  the  redundancy  question.  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

redundancy  in  both  interpretations,  but  much  more  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yours  than  in  the  government's. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  Well,  I  ­­ I  disagree  with  that. 

   

   

  

 

 

 

I  think  the  government  reads  the  modifying  clause  out  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  statute  in  terms  of  doing  any  operative  work  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all.  But  ­­ but  let  me  respond  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  I'm  not  sure  how  your 

  

 

 

 

 

 

answer  was  responsive  to  Justice  Alito's  redundancy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question. 

            

MR.  ZAS:  It  wasn't.  But  that's  the  second 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

part  of  the  answer. 

 

 

 

            

The  redundancy  here  was  meant  to  go  very 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

broadly,  to  pick  up,  not  the  Federal  predicates,  but  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms  or  crimes  that  the  States  might  create. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  we  cited  this  in  the  yellow  brief  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reply.  You'll  see  that  the  States  call  sexual  abuse  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

variety  of  different  things,  including  aggravated  sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse  of  a  minor,  sexual  abuse  of  a  minor,  abusive 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

sexual  misconduct.  So  Congress  is  using  these  redundant 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms  as  it  sometimes  does  to  emphasize  inclusiveness. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Whatever  the  label  is,  Congress  wanted  to  protect

children  by  picking  those  up. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  it  limited.  It  limited  the  reach  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms  by  setting  a  bright  line  floor.  And  that  floor 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  at  children.  The  statute,  after  all,  its  principal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purpose  as  its  title,  as  the  title  of  Chapter  110 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suggests,  is  about  protecting  against  sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

exploitation  and  other  abuse  of  children. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Zas,  is  it  possible  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  read  these  three  terms,  as  you  say,  Congress  might 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  meant  to  be  just  trying  to  pick  up  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceivable  State  statute  it  could  think  of.  But  it's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

possible  also  to  think  of  these  as  the  aggravated  sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse  is  the  worst  offense;  the  sexual  abuse  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

medium  offense;  and  the  abusive  sexual  conduct  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  somewhat  a  more  minor  offense,  in  other  words, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  include  things  that  are  not  sexual  abuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

themselves.  Let's  say  indecent  exposure  or  something 

  

 

 

 

 

 

like  that. 

 

            

And  if  you  understand  the  provisions  in  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  as  sort  of  going  from  the  top  to  the  bottom  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meant  to  pick  up  everything,  then  it  would  seem  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving  a  minor  or  ward  really  ought  to  refer  to  all 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  them.  Right?  That  there's  no  reason  why  the 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving  a  minor  or  ward  would  ­­ would  refer  only  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  most  minor  offenses  as  the  others.

MR.  ZAS:  Well,  I  think  ­­ I  think  Your 

   

   

  

 

 

 

Honor  makes  a  good  point.  We  have  not  been  able  to  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Maybe  I  said  that  wrong.  I 

   

  

  

 

 

 

think  I  said  the  exact  opposite  of  what  I  meant. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It  makes  sense  to  me, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

though. 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  What? 

  

 

If  you  read  ­­ if  you  read  them  going  ­­

MR.  ZAS:  Well,  Your  Honor,  we  have  tried  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

figure  out  what  ­­ what  in  the  world  the  difference  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  sexual  abuse  and  abusive  sexual  conduct  when  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

give  these  terms  their  ordinary  meaning.  There  is  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaningful  difference.  Sexual  abuse,  as  ordinarily 

  

 

 

 

 

defined,  is  just  the  misuse,  physical  or  nonphysical,  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another  ­­

not. 

            

            

What  do  you  think  follows  from  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  ZAS:  Well,  again,  first,  even  with  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

assumption,  you  have  this  prefatory  language  to  the  list 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here,  "relating  to,"  which  this  Court  has  described  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  defined,  has  interpreted,  to  be  very  broad.  It  only 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

means  "to  stand  in  some  relation  to." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  When  I  think  ­­ what  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

think  you  would  say  is  that  if  it's  in  descending  order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  that,  you  don't  have  to  make  the  third  one,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  already  less  than  the  second,  which  is  less  than  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first.  You  don't  have  to  make  the  third  one  a  teeny, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

teeny,  teeny  third  one  by  tagging  on  children  only  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  third  and  not  to  the  other  two. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  seems  to  me  much  more  regular  to  assume, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  you  do,  that  the  limitation  to  children  applies  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  three  of  these  descending  crimes.  And  ­­ and  isn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  answer? 

 

 

            

            

            

MR.  ZAS:  Yes,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Your  answer. 

  

 

 

MR.  ZAS:  It  ­­ it  is  the  answer.  And  ­­

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  is  essentially  an  instance  of  the  principle  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  ­­ that  has  come  to  be  known  as  the  series

problem  with  that  is  ­­ maybe  I'm  wrong,  but  I  think  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  conceded  that  there  is  no  difference  between  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last  two,  that  it  ­­ it's  ­­ it's  not  descending.  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean,  it's  ­­ it's  Justice  Kagan  who's  suggested  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abusive  sexual  conduct  could  mean  exposure,  for  example, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

indecent  exposure,  which  would  probably  not  fit  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

second  ­­ the  second  term.  Haven't  you  conceded  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  two  are  the  same? 

 

 

 

 

            

it  ­­

 

            

            

MR.  ZAS:  Yes,  we  have,  but  we  don't  view 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What  did  you  do  that  for? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  ZAS:  We  do  not  view  it  as  ­­ we  don't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

view  it  as  a  concession.  We  have  allowed  for  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

possibility,  as  ­­ as  Justice  Kagan,  I  think,  is  trying 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  do,  of  trying  to  come  up  with  some  fine  distinction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  meaning  between  the  last  two  terms,  but  whether  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  or  isn't  a  little  bit  of  daylight  between  those 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms,  it's  all  overcome  by  the  terms  "relating  to." 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Anything  relating  to  one  is  going  to  relate  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other. 

            

And  pity  the  poor  district  judge  who  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  to  decide  in  cases  around  the  country,  does  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offense  relate  to  sexual  abuse,  in  which  case  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  reading,  it  doesn't  matter  whether  a  minor

Then  think  of  several  other  sections,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  the  one  I  hadn't  thought  about  which  Justice  Alito

drafter  explanation  of  why  he  uses  these  words.  Because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  first  look  to  41,  and  that's  aggravated.  And  then  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  to  42,  and  that's  sexual  abuse  without  aggravated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  conduct  is  just  the  same  as  contact,  but  the  drafter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  thinking  maybe  we  should  go  a  little  bit  bigger. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Now,  the  difficulty  is  in  each  of  the  sections  I've 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mentioned,  there  is  a  special  related  section  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

children. 

            

So  the  difference  between  the  two  for  adults 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  the  nature  of  the  force  requiring  a  person  to  perform 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  sexual  act.  A  threat  of  violence,  et  cetera.  That's 

    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one.  Right? 

  

            

And  then  the  next  section,  abuse,  it  can  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  other  kind  of  threat.  Then  we  get  to  the  way  it

deals  with  children,  and  it  deals  with  children  under 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  12  ­­ under  12.  That's  one.  And  it  deals  12  to  16. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  the  next.  And  then  we  have  a  section  called 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

contact,  and  that  has  to  do  with  sex  acts  basically  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  weren't  sex  acts  but  for  a  certain  kind  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct  which  is  defined.  All  right. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  read  this,  I  say,  hey,  that's  what  they 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

picked  up.  They  just  ­­ a  drafter  just  picked  it  up  and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changed  a  little  bit,  but  that's  what  he  had  in  mind. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Then  the  question  is:  Your  question.  And  in  your 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

favor,  I  think,  is  the  fact  that  each  of  these  earlier 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sections  does  have  a  special  section  dealing  with 

   

 

 

 

 

 

children  under  the  same  number. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  don't  tell  me  I'm  right  if  I'm  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right,  but  that's  what  I  suddenly  saw  when  Justice  Alito 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asked  his  question.  Just  tell  me  your  reaction. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  ZAS:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You're  not  going  to  tell 

  

 

 

 

 

 

him  he's  right. 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

            

MR.  ZAS:  I  wouldn't  do  that,  Your  Honor. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

The  courts  of  appeals  that  have  addressed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  precise  question,  just  ­­ just  so  it's  clear,  none 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  them  ­­ they've  all  rejected  the  idea  that  I  ­­ that

meant  to  ­­ meant  for  courts  to  interpret  these  terms  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reference  to  the  Federal  predicates.  In  fact,  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government's  position  here  as  well. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  parties  are  on  common  ground  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying  that  these  weren't  meant  to  track  the  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicates.  And  as  I  pointed  out  earlier,  Congress  not 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

only  knew  how  to  do  it  when  they  wanted  to,  they  did  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  these  two  pieces  of  legislation  in  '96  and  '98. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  it's  true  that  these  terms  existed  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Federal  predicates  before  they  were  added  to  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section.  But  they  also  exist  all  around  the  country  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  50  States.  So  Congress  wasn't  ­­ wasn't  trying  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

track  them.  It  could  have  just  said,  any  State  offense 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  would  be  a  violation  of  Federal  law  if  ­­ if  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  jurisdiction.  It  ­­ it  ­­ it  didn't  do  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

It  was  recognizing  that  States  do  all  kinds 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  things.  And  it's  using  these  terms  to  say,  anything 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relating  to  it.  It  doesn't  have  to  even  be  sexual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse;  it  just  has  to  relate  to  sexual  abuse.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  that  could  pick  up  misdemeanor  sex  offenses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

around  the  country,  committed  only  against  an  adult. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Public  lewdness  would  be  an  example. 

 

 

 

 

 

That  ­­ that  crime,  we  sited  one  statue  in  the  briefs. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  ­­ the  statutory  maximum  is  30  days  in  jail.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  that  were  picked  up,  suddenly  someone  who  is  in

JUSTICE  ALITO:  When  they  use  "sexual  abuse" 

  

 

 

 

 

 

and  "sexually  abusive  conduct,"  they  were  not  ­­ they  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  had  in  mind  the  Federal  provisions,  but  they  didn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  those  terms  in  this  provision  to  mean  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  as  they  mean  in  the  Federal  provision,  even 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

though,  according  to  you,  there  is  no  generally  accepted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding  of  the  difference  between  sexual  abuse  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abusive  sexual  conduct. 

 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  That's  right.  That's  right. 

  

  

 

 

 

They  ­­ they  didn't. 

 

 

 

            

Sex  ­­ I'm  sorry.  Chapter  110,  the  chapter 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  contains  the  statute,  has  its  own  definitional 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

section.  There  is  no  definition  there  of  any  of  these 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

terms.  The  only  potentially  pertinent  term  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

defined  is  the  term  "minor,"  which  is  defined 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

differently  in  this  chapter  than  it's  defined  or  used  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Sexual  abuse  is  defined,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

abusive  sexual  contact  is  defined,  are  they  not? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  They  are  ­­ they  are  defined  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  109A.  But  as  Justice  ­­ as  Justice  Scalia 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed  out,  they  didn't  use  abusive  sexual  contact. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  used  abusive  sexual  conduct.  So  it  ­­ it  could  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

viewed  as,  that's  going  broader,  but  with  a  floor.  We 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  brightline  it.  If  you  commit  any  kind  of  sexual

relating  to  sexual  abuse,  you're  going  to  face  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

severe  penalties,  so  long  as  it  involves  a  minor  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ward.  That's  the  focus.  Congress  was  trying  to  protect 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

children,  and  to  punish  and  deter  those  who  would  harm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them. 

            

There  is  nothing  in  the  history  or  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understanding  of  these  provisions  at  the  time  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

enactment  to  suggest  that  they  were  also  focused  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual  abuse  ­­ State  sexual­abuse  crimes  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adults.  Now,  that's  a  serious  crime.  No  one  disputes 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

that.  But  it  wasn't  the  focus  of  this  legislation. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  why  would  they  be 

  

 

 

 

 

 

focused  on  Federal  sexual  abuse  involving  adults  but  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  sexual  abuse  involving  adults? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  Because  the  1996  Congress  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

focused  on  a  very  specific  problem  that  they  identify. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that's  the  link,  the  connection  between  child 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pornography  and  other  sex  offenses  against  children. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  that  was  their  focus.  And  given  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

focus  and  given  that  the  other  State  law  predicates  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  statute  are  also  limited  to  ­­ to  crimes  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

children,  they  naturally  limited  these  offenses  as  well 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  children. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  No,  but  the  ­­ the  Federal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicate,  the  Section  109,  I  believe  it  is,  does  apply

to  adults  as  well.  So  why  would  they  be  focused  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adults  with  respect  to  Federal  offenses  but  not  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  State  offenses? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  Because,  I  think  most  importantly, 

   

  

 

 

 

Congress  controls  the  Federal  ­­ Federal  crime.  It 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

creates  them,  it  knows  what  they  are,  they're  a  finite 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

set,  and  it  knows  that  those  predicates  are  not  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  without  congressional  action. 

 

 

 

            

Once  the  national  legislature  has  to 

 

 

 

 

 

consider  50  penal  codes  around  the  country  which  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

change  at  any  time  and  can  cover  things  that  may  relate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  sexual  abuse  or  abusive  sexual  conduct,  Congress 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonably  may  have  decided  that  it  didn't  want  to  sweep 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  broadly,  so  it,  again,  created  this  floor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Involving  a  minor  or  ward"  was  the  key  phrase.  And  our 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading  is  the  only  one  proposed  that  gives  it  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operative  work  to  do. 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

I'd  like  to  reserve  the  balance  of  my  time

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

            

This  case  involves  two  competing  canons  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutory  interpretation,  and  there  are  four  basic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons  why  we  think  the  government's  interpretation  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct. 

            

First,  Petitioner's  interpretation  creates 

 

 

 

an  unexplained  redundancy  where  the  Court  would  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conclude  that  Congress  created  a  list  of  three  things, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  of  which  are  the  same. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Second,  our  interpretation  is  consistent 

 

 

 

 

with  the  only  possible  reading  of  Section  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Excuse  me.  Let's  do  them 

  

  

 

 

 

 

one  by  one. 

 

 

            

 

On  the  first  one,  even  under  your 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation,  two  of  the  three  are  the  same,  aren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they? 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Under  our  interpretation, 

  

 

 

 

what  ­­ what  we've  said  is  that  the  first  category  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  third  category  are  logically  subsets  of  the  more 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  category  of  sexual  abuse. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Right. 

  

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  But  there's  a  couple  of 

   

  

 

 

 

explanations  for  why  Congress  may  have  done  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  first  is  that,  when  they  added  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law  predicates  to  the  Section  2252(b)(1)  for  the

first  time  in  1996,  there  already  were  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

predicates  on  the  list  that  included  aggravated  sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse,  sexual  abuse,  and  sexual  abuse  of  a  minor  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ward.  So  even  though  it  may  be  true  that  Congress  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  covered  everything  it  wanted  to  cover  in  the  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  crimes  by  just  saying  "sexual  abuse,"  it  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opened  itself  up  to  arguments  if  it  had  just  said  all  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  Federal  crimes  and  then  any  State  law  relating  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual  abuse,  that  those  other  types  of  sexual  abuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  State  law  were  not  covered. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Especially  with  respect  to  the  third 

 

 

 

 

 

category,  sexual  abuse  or  abusive  sexual  conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving  a  minor  or  ward,  Congress  made  clear  when  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

included  that  third  category  that  it  was  picking  up 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State  law  offenses  where  a  person  is  deemed  incapable  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consenting  to  sexual  contact  or  sexual  conduct,  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  their  status  as  either  a  minor  or  a  ward. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  our  interpretation  can  be  explained. 

 

 

 

 

 

There  is  redundancy,  and  we're  not  asking  for  just  an  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  straight  invocation  of  the  canon  against  surplusage. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Both  interpretations  contain  surplusage.  But  it's  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reason  why  it  doesn't  make  sense  to  apply  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

series­qualifier  canon  here,  because  it  ­­

doing  was  picking  up  basically  the  definitions  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  offenses  that  are  worded  almost  identically?  If 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  they  are  doing,  then  it's  understandable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  is  meant  by  all  three  terms.  If  that's  not  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  were  doing,  it's  a  strange  coincidence. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

And  not  only  is  there  redundancy,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  ambiguity  about  what  is  meant  by  sexual  abuse  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed  to  abusive  sexual  conduct,  and  why  they  had  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

put  in  aggravated  sexual  abuse  in  addition  to  sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse. 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Justice  Alito,  we  ­­ we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  that  Congress  was  trying  to  pick  up  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exact  definitions  of  the  three  Federal  statutes.  And  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that's  most  clear,  as  Petitioner  pointed  out,  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  there  are  other  provision  in  this  chapter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  Congress  used  different  language  when  it  wanted  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  so. 

 

            

The  most  clear  example  is  the  recidivist 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  for  the  sexual  abuse  offenses. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Yes,  they  could  have  done  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

more  clearly,  of  course.  The  ­­ the  statute  is  ­­ is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

poorly  drafted.  You  know,  we  give  them  a  "D"  for  their 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drafting  of  this  statute. 

 

 

 

            

But  what  is  the  difference  between  sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse  and  abusive  sexual  conduct?  Putting  aside  the

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Just  catchy  phrases  that 

  

 

 

 

 

came  to  their  mind? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  No.  I  think  the  last 

    

  

 

 

 

category,  "sexual  abusive  conduct  involving  a  minor  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

ward,"  was  meant  to  ­­ to  indicate  and  make  clear  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  was  picking  up  State  offenses  where  a  person  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deemed  incapable  of  giving  consent  because  they  are  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minor  or  a  ward.  They  are  deemed  incapable  by  the  law 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  though,  under  a  generic  definition  of  "sexual 

   

 

 

 

 

 

abuse"  that  may  apply  to  everyone  ­­

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Right.  Well,  we  think  the

I'm  asking. 

 

            

most  ­­

 

            

say  they  were  achieving,  it  would  ­­ it  would  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sufficed  to  say  "minor." 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  No,  I  don't  think  so. 

   

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  No? 

  

 

MS.  O'CONNELL:  A  minor  ­­ a  ward  is  not 

    

   

 

 

 

 

just  a  person  who  is  a  minor  or  a  foster  child,  or  a 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  who's  been  placed  under  a  guardianship  because  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

mental  incompetence  or  something  like  that.  Those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

people  are  all  wards,  but  as  we've  explained  in  our 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief,  a  ward  also  very  clearly  includes  a  prisoner,  and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  would  have  known  that. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

Federal  sexual  abuse  of  a  ward  provision  refers 

   

 

 

 

 

 

basically  to  ­­

they  had  to  say  was  "minor." 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  No  ­­ no.  I  think  that  a  ­­

    

   

  

 

 

 

 

a  ward  is  also  basically  deemed  incapable  of  giving 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Prisoners  ­­ prisoners  are 

  

 

 

 

 

deemed  incapable  of  giving  consent? 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  The  law  has  the  same  sort  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operation,  yes.  It  ­­ it  deems  the  conduct  abusive  even 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  it's  consensual.  The  Section  2243  does  that,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  sexual  abuse  of  a  ward  statute.  And  we've  cited 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  footnote  14  a  lot  of  State  laws  that  prohibit  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  thing. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  "concrete"  would  mean 

  

 

 

 

 

that,  if  it  was  a  prison  guard  and  a  prisoner  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  ­­ even  if  the  prisoner 

  

 

 

 

 

 

said,  "Yes." 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Exactly.  That  that  would  be 

  

  

 

 

 

 

deemed  abusive  sexual  conduct.  It  would  be  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  But  a  ward  ­­ a  ward  could 

   

   

  

 

 

 

also  be  a  40­year­old  person  who  is  incompetent. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Correct.  A  ward  could 

    

  

 

 

certainly  be  an  adult.

is  trying  to  say  that  there  is  this  clear  pattern  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  had  when  it  was  creating  the  ­­ these  lists, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  the  Federal  crimes  can  involve  both  adults  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minors,  but  it  was  always  limiting  the  State  law  crimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  crimes  against  children.  And  it  just  isn't  the  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  even  under  his  interpretation,  because  "wards"  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

included,  there  is  at  least  some  adult  sexual­abuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

crimes  against  adults  that  are  being  swept  up  even  if  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies  to  all  three  categories. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  also  in  Section  2251(e),  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  enhancement  for  child  pornography  production 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses,  the  only  way  that  you  could  read  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  is  to  include  sexual  abuse  offenses  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adults. 

            

And  so  it's  not  the  case  that  there  is  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  clear  pattern  where  Congress  was  only  including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child  victim  counterparts  to  all  of  the  Federal  offenses 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it  was  putting  on  the  list. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Ms.  O'Connell  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Is  Petitioner  right  when 

  

 

 

 

 

Petitioner  says  that  it  was  the  Department  of  Justice's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

original  view  that  involving  a  minor  or  ward,  it 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

modified  all  three  categories?  That  that  was  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  position  that  the  government  took  and  then  the

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  agree.  And  what  I  worry 

    

   

  

 

 

about  is  the  rule  of  lenity.  You  have  these  dueling

means  what  the  petitioner  says  it  means.  And  if  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case,  it  seems  to  me  the  rule  of  lenity  comes  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

play.  That's  ­­ that's  what  concerns  me  most  about  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  not  the  dueling  canons. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Justice  Scalia,  I  think  if 

   

  

 

 

 

you  read  the  text  of  the  statute  once,  you  may  think,  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  know  what  this  means.  It  could  go  either  way. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  if  you  just  read  the  rest  of  the  list  of  things  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  included  and  take  a  look  at  it,  we  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  four  things  that  jump  out  that  make  clear  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving  a  minor  or  ward  only  is  modifying  the  last 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

category.  The  first  is  the  ­­ the  redundancy  problem 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Petitioner's  interpretation  creates. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  could  I  ask  about 

   

  

 

 

 

your  ­­ your  basic  theory  as  to  that,  which,  if  I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  it,  says  the  reason  why  we  shouldn't  worry 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  redundancy  you  create  is  because  Congress  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wanted  to  make  absolutely  clear  that  the  sexual  abuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  also  sexual  abuse  involving  somebody  who  couldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent.  That's  basically  your  theory. 

  

 

 

 

            

And  there  is  a  very  easy  way  to  do  that,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  have  completely  made  this  ­­ I  mean,  made  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  hundred  percent  clear.  Congress  would  just  have  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aggravated  sexual  abuse,  sexual  abuse,  or  sexual  abuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving  a  minor  or  ward.  And  just  by  using  the  exact

same  language,  it  would  have  been  clear,  but  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction  was  between  sexual  abuse  and  sexual  abuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving  a  minor  or  ward. 

   

 

 

            

 

But  Congress  doesn't  do  that,  right? 

 

 

 

 

Congress  changes  the  language  of  the  third  noun.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  creates  the  puzzlement.  And  ­­ and  so  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seems  to  me  that  your  theory  doesn't  really  cohere  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  this  third  term  ­­ although,  nobody  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  exactly  what  it  means  that  is  different  ­­ the  third 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

term  is  linguistically  dissimilar  from  the  second  one. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  It  is,  but  ­­ but  under  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

generic  interpretation  of  sexual  abuse,  any  generic 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  that  a  court  has  come  up  with,  I  think  one 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  a  typical  one  is  sexual  conduct  that  uses  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

misuses  or  injures  a  victim  so  as  to  cause  harm  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

damage.  They  all  include  sexual  conduct.  And  so 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

regardless  of  whether  sexual  conduct  is  ­­ you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  Federal  law,  sexual  conduct  could  be  both  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual  act  or  a  sexual  contact,  anything  that's  defined 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

within  the  Federal  provision.  But  the  term  "sexual 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse"  was  already  broad  enough  to  cover  abusive  sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct. 

              

I  can't  say  that  I  know  why  Congress  didn't 

   

 

 

 

 

 

say  "sexual  abuse  of  a  minor  or  ward"  as  opposed  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"abusive  sexual  conduct  involving  a  minor  or  ward."  But

I  think  the  key  part  of  it  to  focus  on  is  the  fact  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  use  the  term  "involving  a  minor  or  ward."  It's  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same  category  or  category  of  people  that  they  are  trying 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  pick  up  that's  reflected  in  the  prohibitions  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  why  not  just  say 

  

 

 

 

 

 

­­ drop  the  "abusive"?  Just  say  "sexual  conduct  with  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minor  or  a  ward"?  Because  now  you  have  to  deal  with  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adjective  "abusive."  So  how  does  that  get  you  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consent  or  no  consent? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  I  think  Congress  could  have 

    

 

 

 

 

done  this  without  saying  abusive,  but,  you  know,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  sexual­abuse  statute  of  ­­ of  a  minor  or  ward  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

called  sexual  abuse  of  a  minor  or  ward.  They  also 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  the  word  "abusive."  I  think  it's  just  ­­ the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ambiguity  really  is  that  abuse  could  mean  different 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things  depending  on  who  the  victim  is.  Something  could 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  abusive  because  it's  done  to  or  in  front  of  a  child 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  not  an  adult.  And  so  that  may  be  ­­ it's  not  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  why  Congress  wouldn't  ­­ needed  to  use  the  word 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"abusive,"  but  there  ­­ there  is  a  reason  ­­ it  is  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  why  there  could  be  some  daylight  between  the  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  What  were  the  ­­ what  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  three?  You  said  there  were  four  reasons.  I

started  where  I  think  Justice  Scalia  did.  Of  course,  I 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  more  often  than  he  think  that  the  canons  don't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

help  us  all  that  much.  And  this  ­­ this  is  a  poster 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

child,  I  think,  for  that  proposition. 

   

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

 

And  so  you  said,  no,  there  are  four  things 

 

 

 

 

here  that  show  that  this  isn't  ambiguous.  You  shouldn't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

end  up  that  way.  Now,  one  was  a  redundancy,  which  I'm 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  sure  what  it  was,  and  then  you  didn't  get  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  three,  which  I'd  like  to  hear. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Okay. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  apologize  for  that.  I 

    

  

 

 

 

jumped  in  on  it. 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  No  apology  necessary. 

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  it  wasn't. 

  

 

 

 

MS.  O'CONNELL:  The  second  reason  why  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

think  the  Petitioner's  interpretation  doesn't  make  sense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  because  in  the  penalty  provision  for  production 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses  Section  2251(e),  Petitioner  agrees  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  way  you  can  read  that  penalty  provision  is  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

include  State  sexual  abuse  offenses  against  adults, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  Congress  worded  it  slightly  differently.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

included  all  the  same  crimes,  but  the  way  that  provision 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ reads,  it  says,  "State  laws  relating  to  aggravated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sexual  abuse,  sexual  abuse,  abusive  sexual  contact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving  a  minor  or  a  ward  or  sex  trafficking  of

children." 

            

So  it's  no  longer  ­­ involving  a  minor  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ward  is  no  longer  a  modifier  that  appears  at  the  end  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  list.  This  is  at  page  13A  of  the  appendix  to  the  gray 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief. 

            

And  so  there's  only  one  possible 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  of  the  list  of  State  sexual­abuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses  in  Section  2251(e),  and  there's  two  possible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretations  of  the  ­­ the  same  three  crimes  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

next  provision.  And  so  the  Court  would  have  a  choice 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  saying  that  those  ­­ the  State  sexual  abuse 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses  have  different  scopes  in  the  two  provisions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Third  is  that  it  ignores  ­­ Petitioner's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interpretation  ignores  the  clear  parallel  between  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  three  main  categories  of  sexual  abuse  offenses  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chapter  109A,  the  Federal  offenses. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yeah.  And  the  other? 

  

  

 

 

 

MS.  O'CONNELL:  That's  the  ­­ and  the  three 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

categories  that  it  created  for  State  sexual  offenses. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Right.  And  the  fourth. 

  

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Which  is  not  a  parallel 

   

  

 

 

 

if  ­­ if  you  read  the  word,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  It's  not  exactly  parallel. 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Contact  is  not  conduct.

is  debatable.  I  mean,  there's  ­­ there's  sexual  conduct 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  It's  debatable  that  contact 

  

 

 

 

 

and  conduct  are  different  words?  That's  not  debatable. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Not  that  they're  different 

  

 

 

 

 

words.  But  I  think  even  Petitioner  points  out  that  in 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  abusive  sexual  contact  provision,  sexual  contact 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  ­­ they  start  out  by  calling  it  sexual  conduct  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstances  where  it  didn't  amount  to  a  sexual  act. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  all  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  You're  not  suggesting  this 

  

 

 

 

 

is  just  a  scrivener's  error,  are  you?  That  it  was  meant 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  contact? 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  I  think  the  ­­ they  both  do 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  job.  So  I  don't  ­­ I  don't  know  why  it  was 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

changed,  but  I  don't  think  there  is  a  reason  why  it's  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Fourth,  fourth. 

  

 

 

MS.  O'CONNELL:  The  fourth  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  interpretation  would  frustrate  the  purpose 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  statute  because  under  the  categorical  approach, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  would  exclude  as  predicates  any  sexual  abuse  crimes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  were  committed  against  children  if  the  defendant 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  convicted  under  a  generally  applicable  sexual­abuse 

   

 

 

 

 

statute.

in  this  one  and  it's  not  in  the  other  one  for  a  reason. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He'll  say  they're  superfluous  reading  both  ways.  He'll 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  ­­ I  can't  remember  the  third  ­­ but  the  fourth

under­inclusive  for  the  reason  you  say,  and  you  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  reading,  it  will  be  overinclusive  for  the  reason  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says. 

            

So  if  we're  at  ­­ this  is  the  only  place

that's  been  described,  and  the  report  is  used  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

describe  what  the  general  intention  was.  I'm  not  saying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  hundred  percent,  but  very  often  with  technical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes,  that's  how  it  works. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  read  that  report,  and  what  do  I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

discover?  A  repeat  offender  with  a  prior  conviction 

    

   

 

 

 

under  da­ta­da,  or  under  any  State  child  abuse  law,  or

its  letter  noting  that  the  provision  they  just  passed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  individuals  with  prior  convictions  for  child 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abuse.  And  recommending  an  enhanced  penalty  as  well  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  had  a  prior  conviction  for  sexual  abuse  of  a  minor. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Okay.  So  I  read  that  and  said,  short,  but 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

clear.  And  that's  what  the  drafter  would  have  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

looking  at  when  ­­ the  first  one,  anyway  ­­ working  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  staff  of  the  committee  when  trying  to  translate 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

general  intentions  of  senators  and  representatives  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actual  language.  And  I  think  it's  not  contrary  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

popular  belief  to  say  that  senators  and  representatives 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  hire  staff  to  do  such  things  and  do  not  sit  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  pen  and  pencil  thinking,  where  does  the  "or"  go? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Okay?  So  what  is  ­­ what  is  the  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Department's  response  to  that?

MS.  O'CONNELL:  I  think  there  are  two 

    

 

 

 

 

things.  The  first  is  the  response  I  gave  before,  which 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  just  that  this  may  have  been  a  useful  shorthand  way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  describe  the  conduct  that  Congress  would  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most  concerned  about,  for  the  person  writing  the  report 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  for  the  Department  of  Justice  trying  to  convince 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  to  add  these  State  law  crimes  to  the  child 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pornography  possession  recidivist  enhancement. 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  the  other  response  is  just  that, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  if  you  think  the  letter  is  against  us,  you  look  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  Congress  actually  did.  And  they  created  a  ­­ a 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

provision  that  basically  parallels  the  three  Federal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offenses.  They  included  many  Federal  offenses  that  can 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

involve  adult  victims.  And  then  eight  years  later,  when 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  added  State  law  predicates  to  Section  2251(e),  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

made  very  clear  they  understood  the  modifier  to  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  to  the  last  category. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Ms.  O'Connell,  you  ­­ you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  Congress  can  leave  it  to  its  staff  to  decide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  a  statute  means,  do  you? 

   

 

 

 

            

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Isn't  legislative  power 

  

 

 

 

nondelegable? 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Right.  We  think  the  ­­ the

You  think  they  can't  do  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  O'CONNELL:  Justice  Breyer,  I  think

definition  of  a  crime  as  distinct  from  the  penalty 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  attached? 

 

            

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  The  Court  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  It  seems  to  me  there's  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

argument  that  it  should  apply  equally,  but  have  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

talked  about  that? 

 

 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  I  think  the  Court  has 

    

 

 

 

 

typically  applied  the  same­strength  rule  of  lenity  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

both  substantive  provisions  and  penalty  provisions. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  That  ­­ that  makes  a  great 

   

  

 

 

 

 

deal  of  sense.  It  ­­ other  than  that  rule  of  lenity  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  extent  it's  based  on  notice,  it  seems  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhat  more  force  when  it  applies  to  the  substantive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

definition  of  the  offense  as  opposed  to  the  punishment. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  I  ­­ you  could  argue  it  either  ­­ either  way. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  have  we  ­­ have  we  talked  about  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

distinction? 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  There  has  not  been  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

distinction  in  the  Court's  cases.  There  have  been  a  few 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

times  where  criminal  defendants  have  tried  to  say  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  should  be  a  supercharged  rule  of  lenity  in  a  case 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  talking  about  mandatory  minimums  or  maximums  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consecutive  sentence.  And  the  Court  has  resisted  that. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  this  would  be  not  a  ­­ not  a

good  case  for  the  Court  to  go  down  that  path  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  guidelines  range  for  this  particular  criminal 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defendant  was  78  to  97  months.  His  minimum  was  120. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  not  actually  a  huge  difference.  And  under  ­­ under 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

current  law,  the  statutory  maximum  would  have  been  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

same,  regardless  of  ­­ of  whether  this  enhancement 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

applied. 

            

Justice  Breyer  has  helpfully  walked  me 

 

 

 

 

 

through  all  of  my  points;  so  if  the  Court  has  no  further 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

questions. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well,  can  I  go  back  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ to  the  language?  You  know,  it's  confusing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

language.  And  I  showed  it  to  all  my  clerks  and  ­­ and 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basically  said  how  would  you  read  it.  And  two  came  out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  one  side,  and  two  came  out  on  the  other  side.  But  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  I'm  sort  of  left  with  this  feeling  that  it  ­­ we're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  in  ­­ in  a  situation  where  there  are  dueling  canons. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  actually  might  be  in  a  situation  where  one  canon 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trumps  the  other. 

 

 

              

I  mean,  you  have  this  last­antecedent  rule, 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it's  an  important  rule.  But  it  gives  way  when  a

antecedents  when  they're  all  parallel  and  when  the  last 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

modifier  equally  sensibly  refers  to  them  all,  right? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  that  that's  a  situation,  so  that  series­qualifier

rule  is  in  some  sense  a  rule  about  when  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

last­antecedent  rule  doesn't  apply. 

 

 

 

            

that. 

            

So  I  guess  I  would  ask  you  to  comment  on 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  O'CONNELL:  There  ­­ I  have  a  couple  of 

   

   

  

 

 

 

different  responses. 

 

            

The  first  one  is  that  the  context  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

most  important  thing.  And  it's  not  the  case  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  hasn't  applied  the  last­antecedent  rule  in  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  the  statute  involves  a  list  of  parallel  terms. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  think  the  FTC  v.  Mandel  Brothers  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

best  example  of  that.  There's  a  list  of  a  purchaser, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

consignee,  factor,  bailee,  correspondent  or  agent,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  other  person  who  is  engaged  in  dealing  commercially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  fur  products  or  fur. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  Court  said  it  didn't  make  sense  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  apply  this  to  a  purchaser  who  is  also  dealing  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ in  the  fur  products,  and  so  we're  going  to  apply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  only  to  the  last  antecedent.  The  series­qualifier 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

principle,  you  know,  petitioner  relies  quite  heavily  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  explanation  in  ­­ in  Justice  Scalia's  book  that  goes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  all  of  the  canons.  And  the  book  even  says  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  series  qualifier  principle  more  so  than  others  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

highly  dependent  on  context  and  can  be  overcome  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

something  doesn't  feel  right  about  the  way  that  it  ­­

Justice  Breyer,  you  mentioned  during  the 

 

 

 

 

 

Petitioner's  argument  that  you  noticed  that  each  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  predicates,  2241,  2242,  2243,  have  a  provision 

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  applies  to  minors  and  wards.  Section  2242  does 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not. 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No.  But  it's  followed  by 

  

  

 

 

 

 

what  could  be  taken  as.  They  just  gave  it  a  different 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number;  isn't  that  right?  2243  does,  in  fact,  deal  with 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

minors? 

            

MS.  O'CONNELL:  2243  is  the  sexual  abuse  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  minor  or  ward  provision. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Right. 

  

 

MS.  O'CONNELL:  2241,  aggravated  sexual 

  

 

 

 

abuse,  has  a  special  subsection  dealing  with  very  young 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

children.  Section  2242,  the  general  sexual  abuse  crime, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  include  any  specific  for  minors  or  wards. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

saw  that. 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Yes,  yes,  yes,  yes.  I  ­­ I

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Zas,  you  have  four  minutes. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

           

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  EDWARD  S.  ZAS 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  Justice  Alito,  Justice  Scalia,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer  I  think  all  echoed  the  same  theme,  which 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  at  the  very  least,  this  statute  is  not  unambiguously 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

correct,  which  is  the  standard  language  this  Court  used 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  Granderson  for  when  the  rule  of  lenity  must  apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

So  under  that  rule  ­­

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  don't  think  I  actually 

    

   

 

 

said  anything  about  the  rule  of  lenity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

say  ­­

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  No,  no.  Your  ­­ Your  Honor  did 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  don't  think  he  ever 

    

 

 

 

 

mentioned  the  rule  of  lenity. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  But  he  did  say  ­­ he  did  use  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

word  "ambiguity,"  and  he  did  say  that  the  statute  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

poorly  drafted.  And  I  think  ­­ I  think  we  certainly 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

would  agree  that  this  is  ­­ this  is  not  a  model  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

drafter's  art,  by  any  means.  But  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  you  ­­ you  are  making 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  argument  that  an  awful  lot  of  this  big  book  is  ­­ is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subject  to  the  rule  of  lenity  because  a  lot  of  it  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  poorly  drafted.

MR.  ZAS:  Well,  this  is  ­­ this  is  ­­ this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  not  just  poorly  drafted.  We  ­­ both  sides  have  gone 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

through  all  the  canons,  all  the  tools,  legislative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history.  And  at  the  end  of  the  day,  as  Justice  Kagan 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed  out,  you  can  read  it  reasonably  both  ways.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  think  as  a  matter  of  text  we  actually  have  the  better 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading. 

            

My  colleague  from  the  Solicitor  General's 

 

 

 

 

 

office  conceded  when  she  was  up  here  that  there  is  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

difference  between  sexual  abuse  and  abusive  sexual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conduct.  So  the  parties  agree  on  that,  and  yet  we  draw 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

radically  different  conclusions. 

 

 

            

The  government  says  the  solution  is  to  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

limit  the  modifier  to  the  second  term,  but  that  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eliminate  surplusage.  It  causes  the  entire  modifying 

  

 

 

 

 

 

phrase,  the  entire  category,  abusive  sexual  conduct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involving  a  minor  or  ward,  to  effectively  drop  out  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  statute. 

 

            

Our  solution  is  to  say,  give  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonredundant  portion  of  the  statute  involving  a  minor  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

ward  some  meaning.  Congress  used  those  words  for  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason.  And  the  reason  was  the  problem  they  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

focused  on,  which  is  the  danger  to  children. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  way  to  preserve  effect  for  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  modifying  phrase  is  to  apply  it  to  all  three  terms,

which  makes  perfect  sense.  If  two  of  them  mean  exactly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  thing,  why  in  the  world  would  Congress  limit 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  one  to  minors  and  children?  They're  synonyms.  It 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

makes  sense  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  My  problem  is,  why  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  include  adults  as  a  predicate  for  the  minimum  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  crimes  but  not  in  straight  State  crimes. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  Because  ­­

  

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  know  they  have  done  it 

    

 

 

 

 

 

in  other  situations. 

 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  Yes. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  why  here?  If 

  

  

 

 

 

they're  worried  about  the  abuse  of  children,  why  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  not  capture  every  conceivable  person  or  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceivable  abusive  act  towards  kids? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  Well,  in  ­­ in  addition  to  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fairness  and  administrability  problems  we've  identified, 

 

 

 

 

 

Congress  reasonably  could  have  determined  that  people 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  commit  abuse  offenses  against  adults,  as  bad  as  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is,  don't  pose  the  same  level  of  danger  to  children. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  she's  saying  why  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

but  they  ­­ they  do  include  the  sexual  abuse  adult  when 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  talking  about  prior  conviction  of  a  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

crime. 

            

MR.  ZAS:  Yes.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  And  the  answer,  I  guess, 

   

  

 

 

 

has  to  be  that  you  ­­ the  drafters  know  what  they're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting  into  with  the  Federal  crimes,  and  they  have  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

idea  what  they're  getting  into  when  they're  dealing  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  State  crimes.  Is  that  your  response? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  ZAS:  That's  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  BREYER:  I'm  not  trying  to  put  words 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  your  mouth.  I  want  to  know  what  ­­ that's  what  I 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

read  in  the  ­­

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  ZAS:  Your  Honor,  that's  one  answer. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Let's  take  a  ­­ an  offense 

   

  

 

 

 

 

as  to  which  there  isn't  much  ambiguity:  Rape.  All 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  Under  the  ­­ the  ordinary  meaning,  why  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rape  in  a  Federal  enclave  qualify;  rape  a  few  yards 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

away,  perhaps,  in  State  territory,  not  ­­ not  qualify? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  ZAS:  Because  Congress  was  not  focused 

  

 

 

 

 

 

on  symmetry  in  that  way.  The  ­­ the  Federal  predicates 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  added  by  the  1994  Congress.  They  were  ­­ they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  ­­ yes.  They  were  made  Federal  predicates.  The 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

later  Congress,  1996  Congress,  was  the  one  that  added 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  law  predicates. 

 

 

 

            

So  it's  not  as  if  the  same  legislators  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

making  this  decision  at  the  same  time:  Should  we  cover 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  and  ­­ and  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Chief  Justice,  I'm  sorry.  I  see  my
