 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-728, Bloate v. United States.

 (12:59 p.m.)

 Mr. Stancil.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK K. STANCIL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. STANCIL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Pretrial motion preparation time is not 

automatically excluded under Section 3161(h)(1) of the 
Speedy Trial Act.  Such delays are subject to exclusion 
only on a case-by-case basis under (h)(7).

 I would like to focus today on three 

features of the statutory text that make that abundantly 
clear.  First and foremost, when crafting (h)(1) 
Congress specifically addressed pretrial motion delays 
and precisely defined that exclusion.  Subparagraph (D) 
declares that the exclusion shall begin with the filing 
of the motion and end with the hearing on or other 
prompt disposition of the motion.

 Reading the general language in (h)(1) to 

encompass preparation time would circumvent the 
deliberate legislative choice to limit the pretrial 
motion exclusion.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That would allow the 

prosecutor's time to be excluded, right?  On your theory 
that it starts -- the trigger is the filing of the 
motion, and it ends when the motion is disposed of.  So 
the prosecutor might say, I need additional time, and 
that would be included in the suspension period, right?

 MR. STANCIL:  Yes, Your Honor.  The 

government's motions and the defense motions are treated 
equally under (h)(1), which is why the government's rule 
to treat defense motions, or defense requests for 
additional time differently --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I'm --
MR. STANCIL:  The exclusion -- I'm sorry, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.
 MR. STANCIL:  The exclusion begins with the 

filing of the motion, be it the defense motion or the 
government's motion.  That is clear on the text, the 
face of the text of the statute, which --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the clock -- the 

clock would run, on your theory, during the preparation 
time of the defendant.  It would not run during the 
preparation time of the prosecutor.  So I don't think 
they are being treated the same.

 MR. STANCIL:  No, Your Honor, that is not

our position.  The clock runs up until the moment of 
filing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Right.
 MR. STANCIL:  Whether it is a defense motion 

or a government motion.  So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No, no.  I'm talking 
about the prosecutor's answer to the defense motion.

 MR. STANCIL:  Oh, yes, Your Honor.  Their 
response to the motion, it is tolled -- or the clock 
stops during the preparation of the response by either 
side.  And that was a deliberate legislative choice by 
Congress.  It says -- on the face of (h)(1), it says the 
clock stops at filing and remains stopped through the 
conclusion of the hearing or other prompt disposition of 
the motion.

 That was an express choice by Congress.  It 

was not lost on them that a response time would be 
treated differently.  And the government's suggestion 
that that, therefore, means we should factor back in 
preparation time is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Shouldn't we be 

looking --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  One point that I would 

like you to clarify.  I -- I understand you to take the 
position that the interest of justice would be the route

to take, where the judge would have to stop and make a 
finding.  In your view, would it be appropriate, 
assuming your interpretation of (B)(i) holds, for us to 
send the case back, or is it too late, because the 
interest of justice finding was never made?

 MR. STANCIL:  It is too late because this 
Court answered that question -- that very question in 
Zedner and held that an (h)(7) ends of justice finding 
cannot be supplied retrospectively on remand.  That was 
the precise question put to this Court and it was 
rejected by the Court unanimously.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you think it could be 

found.  If it doesn't have to be found on the spot by 
the judge, when is the latest time the judge could make 
the interest of justice filing?

 MR. STANCIL:  Zedner says that as long as it 
is made -- or the latest it could be made is the time by 
which the district court rules on the motion to dismiss 
on speedy trial -- on speedy trial grounds.  So it can 
be made in the district court up until the time the 
district court decides the speedy trial motion.  It does 
not -- at least it is left open in Zedner.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So the result in your 

case would be that the case is dismissed, period.

 MR. STANCIL:  Yes, Your Honor.  It would be

-- it would be remanded with instructions to dismiss. 
However, the district court -- it remains for the 
district court to determine whether to dismiss with or 
without prejudice according to the factors specified in 
the act.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it clear that a period of 

time attributable to a defense request for time to 
prepare pretrial motions can fall within (h)(7)? 
Because (h)(7) speaks of a continuance.  Isn't that a 
very -- wouldn't that be a very odd use of the word 
"continuance"?

 If you make an application to a judge for 
time, additional time to prepare pretrial motions, do 
you say, "I want a continuance of the date on which my 
pretrial motions are due"?

 MR. STANCIL:  I think that's not an unusual 
reading of the term "continuance," yes, Your Honor.  I 
think they frequently -- trial counsel will frequently 
ask for a continuance of the date.  But what I think 
both parties agree is that that is how the courts almost 
universally interpret (h)(7), that any time that is 
excluded, even if it doesn't result in the moving of the 
trial date per se, is treated as an (h)(7) exclusion.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there's -- but the 

courts of appeals have almost universally read

(h)(1)(D), or overwhelmingly read (h)(1)(D) to apply in 
this situation as well.

 I'm sorry.  Not (h)(1)(D), but the 

introductory phrase.

 MR. STANCIL:  Yes, Your Honor, but this rule 

wasn't confined to pretrial motions.  So even in those 
jurisdictions that follow the majority position at issue 
here, also to my understanding use (h)(7) to exclude 
intermediate delays before trial.  In fact, in the 
government's brief, the government acknowledges that 
courts treat pretrial motion delays under either (h)(1) 
or (h)(7), and more specifically (h)7)(B)(iv), which 
specifically speaks in terms of preparation.  And in 
fact, that's still further evidence that Congress 
specifically contemplated that preparation time would go 
under (h)(7).  Both (h)(7)(B)(ii) and (h)(7)(B)(iv) 
specifically direct district courts to consider the need 
for additional time for adequate or effective 
preparation.

 And Justice Alito, back to your concern 

specifically with motions.  (B)(ii) specifically refers 
to pretrial proceedings.  So I think there, in that 
sense, there is evidence that Congress didn't think that 
a continuance under (h)(7) would refer only to a 
continuance of the trial date.  At least, that's --

that's my understanding.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, at the time 

that (h)(1)(C) -- or (D) was being looked at, wasn't it 
a fact that some circuits had reviewed the prior 
exclusion as applying only to the date in which there 
were actual hearings before the court?

 MR. STANCIL:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So isn't it -- shouldn't 
we be looking at what you did with respect to this time 
period in light of the need that it was addressing?
 MR. STANCIL:  Yes, Your Honor.  And the 

Court -- and Congress did decide to expand or clarify 
the end point and beginning point of the (h)(1)(D) 
exclusion.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, what's wrong with 

the logic of district courts who have ruled in this --
in the government's favor, that say Congress was only 
looking at that particular part of the proceeding --
what related to the hearing, the filing of the motion, 
its actual adjudication -- but they weren't considering 
a motion by the defendant for time to investigate, and 
that can be another proceeding?

 Can you imagine a situation in which a court 

grants that adjournment to a defense attorney where we 
would reverse that finding by the court?

MR. STANCIL:  I'm sorry, Your Honor? 

Reverse --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But -- it would seem to 
me that if a defense attorney comes to a court and says, 
I need an adjournment, and the Court says, you can have 
it, isn't that implicitly a proceeding in which the 
court is saying there is a need for this?

 MR. STANCIL:  Not in a speedy trial context, 

Your Honor, for two reasons.  First, it is not a 
proceeding.  There is no pretrial proceeding until the 
motion is filed.  That is -- that is the definition of a 
pretrial motion proceeding.  It is a formal initiation 
before the district court.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  "Proceeding" doesn't 

mean an act -- it is an act before the court.  The 
entire action is before the court.  But it is a 
proceeding in which the defense attorney is looking at 
whether there's anything to file motions about.

 MR. STANCIL:  If that were correct, Your 
Honor, then preparing your witnesses is a proceeding 
respecting trial.  I think that takes "proceeding" and 
expands it so that everything would be excludable delay.
 But if -- if I may return to your original 

question, Congress did look at preparation time when 
drafting (h)(1) and (h)(1)B) specifically --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the Senate did.
 MR. STANCIL:  Pardon me.  Yes, the Senate 
Judiciary Committee specifically considered a proposal 
by the government no less to include preparation time, 
and the committee rejected that proposal as 
unreasonable.  I think this is simply not a case in 
which we are left to guess whether preparation time was 
on the table.  It was on the table and it was declared 
unreasonable to suggest that it would be within the 
automatic exclusion.

 Moreover, I think that makes abundant sense. 

It is not the case that simply asking for more time 
necessarily means that you have some prejudice in the 
speedy trial context, or even that the trial date 
necessarily would move.  In this case, the counsel 
requested the extension for pretrial motions.  That 
extension was granted.  The trial date held.  It wasn't 
moved until much later, under an (h)(7) exclusion on 
unrelated grounds.  So I think it's a -- I think it's a 
false -- a red herring, if you will, for the government 
to suggest that when the defendant asks for something, 
it's necessarily -- it ought to be granted, fair enough, 
but that it's necessarily going to prejudice the speedy 
trial calculation.

 With respect, I don't think that's the case.

I think ordinarily, these things will come very early in 
the speedy trial -- speedy trial clock, and there will 
be relatively brief delays.  And so I think it's quite 
reasonable to think that district courts could be 
allowed to give more flexible preparation time to decide 
whether to file, what to file, and then the exclusion 
starts with the filing.  And I think Congress has made 
that abundantly clear in -- on the text of the statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That would certainly 
encourage judges who don't want to get involved with 
making findings, which you have to do to satisfy 
interest of justice, to just say:  Motion denied; I'm 
sorry, I'm not going to let you have the clock run while 
you -- you are asking me for a favor.  You want time to 
prepare, and the clock is going to run in the meantime. 
Forget it.  You are not going to get the extension.

 MR. STANCIL:  I disagree, Your Honor.
 First, I think courts will granted them when 

necessary.  Again because it is early in the clock, 
there won't necessarily be speedy trial -- some sort of 
speedy prejudice to the government.  But moreover, all 
this means is that the court needs to put findings on 
the record to say this is preparation time that is 
legitimately needed, the defendant's interests here 
outweigh the public's interest, and so I'm going to

grant that and I'm going to put those findings on the 
record.  And I think it's clear from the statute that 
that's how Congress anticipated this would work.  But 
I --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What must the judge --

the judge must make a finding orally or in writing.  Can 
it just say, okay, I'm giving it to you in the interest 
of justice?

 MR. STANCIL:  I think -- I don't believe 

that precise question has come to the Court.  But courts 
are very permissive in terms of how much needs to be put 
on the record, and it's my understanding that this 
happens quite literally every day in scores of contexts 
where courts, as long as they make the finding, it is 
reviewed for an abuse of discretion only and that's 
sufficient.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So the rule that you are 

arguing for really will accomplish nothing, other than 
to benefit a small set of defendants who -- who got 
pretrial preparation time in reliance on court of 
appeals decisions saying that those could be done 
without making explicit ends of justice findings on the 
record?

 MR. STANCIL:  No, Your Honor.  If we are 
correct, the decision will have significant effect on

the public's interest.  In fact, an individual defendant 
has very little to gain from such gamesmanship as the 
government suggests would be at issue.  What you get is 
a dismissal of your indictment with or without 
prejudice, and there are no statute of limitations 
problems --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how is the public 

going to benefit if all the judge needs -- presumably, 
district judges are not granting these extensions of 
time in situations in which they do not think that the 
ends of justice are served by granting the extension of 
time.

 So what is going to be served by requiring 
them to recite this -- to make this rote recitation on 
the record?

 MR. STANCIL:  First, Your Honor, it's not 

rote.  It specifies four factors that they have to 
consider, including and before, it says, whether its 
time -- the time is necessary for effective preparation, 
taking into account the exercise of due diligence.

 What this -- what putting this under (h)(7) 
and making that process required will do is weed out the 
very worst sorts of delays where counsel, even for the 
defendant or the government, comes in and asks for the 
delay without the exercise of due diligence and without

any showing that this is actually necessary.  And I 
think that's exactly what Congress was doing by not 
putting this under the automatic exclusion in (h)(1).

 If it's automatically excluded, and there is 
additional time granted for no reason whatsoever or for 
something that wouldn't meet the due diligence standard 
in (B)(iv), the speedy trial clock is effectively 
lengthened automatically.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you tell me how it 

works in district courts?  This district court set 
September 13 originally for the -- for the motion.  Do 
the district courts generally have a custom schedule for 
every case where they set times or do they have local 
rules on the subject?

 MR. STANCIL:  With respect to pretrial 

motions specifically?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.
 MR. STANCIL:  It varies widely from district 
to district.  For example, in some districts the default 
is 21 days.  So, if you try a case in Chicago, you go to 
arraignment, your pretrial motions, unless set by a 
different rule, are due in 21 --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's -- that's part 

of -- that there in the local rule of court?

 MR. STANCIL:  Yes, Your Honor.  In D.C., it

is 11 days.  In many other jurisdictions and here, there 
is no set time limit.

 And one of the problems -- one of the 

fundamental problems with the government's rule that a 
request -- a defense request for additional time must be 
treated differently and does stop the clock, is that 
gives speedy trial consequences to those variations in 
local rules.  So, in districts where you have a very 
short standard timeframe, the defendant has to run in, 
if he wants to file pretrial motions, and stop the clock 
almost automatically.  If you have -- say, your motions 
are due automatically in seven days; you have got to run 
in there and stop the clock.

 As a practical matter, the speedy trial, the 

70 days, it's that much longer in those districts 
because you have got to stop the clock compared to 
districts where, say, 21 days are ordinarily allotted. 
Well, they may not have to stop the clock.  It's clear 
that Congress did not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I'm -- I'm not sure 
that that isn't -- that that argument doesn't cut both 
ways.

 MR. STANCIL:  I'm sorry, Your Honor?
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm not sure if that -- if 

you have a district where you have five days, a very

short period and almost nobody can comply with it, then 
maybe that's an argument for the government's rule.

 MR. STANCIL:  I disagree, Your Honor.  I 

think that illustrates the problem, because if there is 
a -- call it an unreasonably short time period in this 
district, the speedy trial clock only burns for four or 
five days or a week, and then someone is going to have 
to run in and stop it.  So those trials are just going 
to take longer.

 Let's assume that it takes two weeks on 

average or three weeks on average to prepare a 
reasonable pretrial motion.  Well, in those 
jurisdictions that have that local rule, the short local 
rule, you get two extra weeks on the speedy trial clock, 
because you have to run in and hit stop on the clock by 
asking for additional time.

 In those districts that give you 21 days by 
default, by contrast, that whole 21 days counts against 
the 70 days.  And that is, I think -- I think that is an 
essential judgment that Congress made.  It decided on 70 
days --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I think an 

assumption in your mathematical analysis is that there 
will be a difference in the time that it takes to 
dispose of the motion.  If the time to dispose of the

motion is the same, then you are wrong, I think.  I will 
work it out.

 MR. STANCIL:  I don't believe so, Your 

Honor.  If you assume hypothetically 21 days to prepare 
--

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right.
 MR. STANCIL:  -- 21 days to respond and call 

it 21 days to rule --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right.
 MR. STANCIL:  -- in a district that allows 

21 days of preparation time by default rule, 21 days 
will burn and then 42 days with response and ruling.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right.
 MR. STANCIL:  In a district that allows only 
five days, five days burn, and then you have to stop the 
clock for the additional 16 days of preparation, plus 
21, plus 21.  You end up effectively, if the difference 
is 5 days or 21 days, there is an 86-day speedy trial 
clock in the district with the short rule and a 70-day 
speedy trial clock in the district with the local 
rule -- with the 21-day rule.

 And so I think it's -- and it's clear that 
what Congress did not want in the Speedy Trial Act was 
these time periods to be amended by local rule 
effectively.  And that's what would happen.  I think

more fundamentally --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Where does that show, 

because the disposition time isn't going to be the same 
from district to district?  Districts vary.

 MR. STANCIL:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Congress could have 

required, as they have in some instances, to have a 
judge decide a matter within a certain period of time. 
They didn't do that, did they?

 MR. STANCIL:  That's not correct, Your 

Honor.  In subparagraph (H), 3161(h)(1)(H) allows only 
30 days during which a matter is actively under --
actually under advisement by the district court.  So 
here they actual did set a 30-day clock on which to 
rule.

 There is an exception to that.  If there is 
a hearing subparagraph (D) says, well, you know, we are 
not going to govern the time in the hearing, and this 
Court's in Henderson gives district courts flexibility 
in that regard, when there is a hearing.  But Congress 
was pretty clear in trying to put a book end at either 
end.  It starts on filing and it ends with disposition, 
and we only give you 30 days without a hearing or after 
the hearing to dispose of it.

 And I think more fundamentally this is a

quintessentially legislative judgment.  Congress said, 
this is a system of rules that we need in place to move 
cases more expeditiously toward trial.  We are going to 
give you 70 days.  We are going to exclude certain 
things automatically, and we are going to give district 
courts flexibility under (h)(7).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could a district 

judge, as part of his normal pretrial order, say that I 
am inclined to grant normal motions for extensions, but 
I think so we don't run into these problems that it's in 
the best interest of justice that whatever time I grant, 
I issue an order covered by (h)(7)(A)?  That avoids all 
this problem.  I don't have to worry about the Speedy 
Trial Act when I grant you a motion, because whatever I 
grant you is going to be excluded under (h)(7)(A).

 MR. STANCIL:  I don't -- that sounds a lot 
like a prospective waiver of speedy trial, which is --
this court rejected in Zedner.  If I understand the 
hypothetical correctly, if the district court says if I 
give you extra time, we are not going to complain about 
it later.  I don't think that the court could do that, 
and I don't think that would be consistent --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But presumably, a 

judge can do it in every case.  You are saying they 
can't tell you in advance this is what they are going to

do, but they can do it automatically in every case?
 MR. STANCIL:  I don't believe so, Your 
Honor.  I think, if I understand the hypothetical 
correctly, if a -- if we appear before the district 
judge and the judge says exclusions or extensions for 
pretrial motions will qualify for (h)(7), that sounds 
like to me in an individual case a prospective waiver of 
that defendant's Speedy Trial Act --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wait a minute.  If a 

defense attorney comes in to you and says -- I'm a 
district court judge -- I need time to prepare; granted, 
I am excluding time under (7)(A).  You are saying that 
is insufficient?

 MR. STANCIL:  No, Your Honor.  If it's done 
on a case-by-case basis, where the time is requested and 
the continuance or the delay is granted with the (h)(7) 
findings made either then or later, that would be 
perfectly appropriate.  That's how Congress --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But it's not okay for a 
district court to say, you tell me how much or you have 
21 days to prepare motions and I'm excluding time 
because of that?

 MR. STANCIL:  No.  I'm not sure I -- I 

apologize.  I'm not sure I under --

district court judge:  Defendant is arraigned; you have 
21 days to file motions.

 MR. STANCIL:  Yes, Your Honor.  That is --
that time is not excluded if it is just set by local 
rule.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you finish 

answering one earlier question.  You said that there is 
no statute of limitations problems if we rule in your 
favor.  Could you explain why?

 MR. STANCIL:  Yes.  Under 18 U.S.C., I 
believe it's 3288 and 3289, essentially gives the 
government six months after the dismissal of an 
indictment to reindict a defendant.  And courts have 
almost universally held that that applies -- or I 
believe it's universally held that that applies where 
the dismissal is based on Speedy Trial Act grounds.  I 
think we are in agreement with the government that there 
is not a statute of limitations problem.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could under that retrial 

provision the court begin excluding time?

 MR. STANCIL:  The speedy trial clock starts 

anew after a new --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what I mean.
 MR. STANCIL:  Yes, Your Honor.  That is 

clear under the statute.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you have any idea how 

many convictions would be at risk for reversal under 
this rule, that would be currently pending and subject 
to a ruling in your favor now?

 MR. STANCIL:  I don't know.  My supposition 

is that it's not very many.  The government certainly 
hasn't suggested that there are a lot.  It would have to 
be cases within those eight districts or -- pardon me --
I guess it would be nine or ten, that have either not 
taken a position or take the government's position, in 
which the defendant raised this argument in the trial 
court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In a timely manner.
 MR. STANCIL:  -- in a timely manner.  So I 

think if that is the case, it's an exceedingly small 
number, and for that matter, that would be a problem in 
any case in which this Court reverses an incorrect 
ruling.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is -- is there any 

indication in the circuits that follow what seems to be 
the majority rule -- that is that the clock is stopped 
during preparation time -- that there have been 
excessive delays, in comparison to the -- what is it, 
two circuits who go the other way?

 MR. STANCIL:  Not that I am aware of, Your

Honor, but nor has there been any indication that 
district courts in the two jurisdiction where they get 
the rule right in our view deny defense requests for 
additional time.

 I think -- I think this rule will matter if 
you assume that the average pretrial motion extension is 
relatively modest and that the lawyers are fairly 
reasonable in what they request.  We are talking about, 
you know, additional delays of a week or two weeks, but 
that is -- again, that backs right up into the 
congressional judgment, the legislative judgment that 
Congress made.

 And so those trials will on average in the 
majority of jurisdictions, I think, just take that much 
longer to get to trial.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, what is your 

systemic concern with the -- with the government's rule? 
The judge has to grant the continuance under either --
under either of your rules, and you say he has to make a 
finding that it's good.  But are you concerned the 
continuance would be because the attorney wants to play 
golf or take a vacation with his kids, and that that's 
not the cause?

 MR. STANCIL:  Well, that --

your concern?

 MR. STANCIL:  Well, that would be -- that is 
the most important function of (h)(7), to screen out the 
truly unmeritorious delays.  That's what Congress wanted 
to get at most of all.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But wouldn't judges in 

many cases do that anyway just in the course of deciding 
whether to grant a continuance?

 MR. STANCIL:  The court may --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Give -- give me the 

consequences of ruling for the government that you see 
that are adverse in your view.

 MR. STANCIL:  The consequence -- ruling for 

the government would mean that any time a defendant 
needs any extra time, or -- or we would say either side 
needs any extra time, the clock stops.  And so any time 
you need additional time for pretrial motions there is 
no balancing.

 So in the routine case that is not complex, 
where the -- where the defendant's counsel may be just 
simply not exercising due diligence, you could ask for 
two weeks and there is no -- there is no balancing.  The 
district court doesn't even have to ask, what's the 
delay, you know, why the extra delay?  And that time is 
automatically excluded.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's my point.
 MR. STANCIL:  Yes.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I assume the district 

judge will ask.  Or is --

MR. STANCIL:  In the absence --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or do you doubt that?
 MR. STANCIL:  I am sure it will vary from 

court to court.  But in the absence of (h)(7) and 
putting it on the record, the district court is 
certainly not required to ask and may not -- certainly 
won't put those findings on the record.  And I think 
this Court made that point very clear in Zedner, that 
(h)(7) balances substantive open-endedness with 
procedural strictness, and the procedure is what 
matters, and Congress made that explicitly clear in 
drafting (h)(7).

 If I may, I would like to reserve the 

remainder of my time for rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Mr. Roberts.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

pretrial motions is automatically excluded from the 
Speedy Trial Act deadline for commencing trial.  For 
three reasons, that time falls under section 3161(h)(1) 
which excludes delay resulting from other proceedings 
concerning the defendant.

 First, Section (h)(1) excludes delay 

resulting from various listed proceedings and other 
proceedings that are analogous or ancillary to those 
proceedings.  A court's grant of additional motions 
preparation time is ancillary to pretrial motions 
themselves, which are a listed proceeding.  It 
facilitates the motions because adequate time to prepare 
them is critical to their fair and accurate resolution. 
The exclusion is similar to other excludable delays that 
result from proceedings ancillary to listed proceedings.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could I ask a 
specific date question?  Am I right that you would 
exclude the time from September 7th to October 4th?

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, the time from 

September 7th to October 4th.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that 

doesn't -- I'm not sure that makes much sense.  Before 
the motion for extension was filed, the hearing date for 
pretrial motions was September 20.  After the extension 
was filed and granted, the hearing date was October 4th.

So the only period of delay that you could say resulted 
from the extension was from September 20 to October 4, 
or 13 days.

 Well, how can you possibly count the time as 

a delay after he filed his extension up to the point 
when things would have been due anyway?

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, the delay is just the 

time that's being used for preparation, which was 
presumably the time all the way up to the period at 
which the waiver of the intent to file motions was 
filed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but how is 

that a -- how is the time being spent for preparation a 
delay, when some of that time was going to be allowed 
anyway?

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, I think the act --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In other words, the 
motions were not due until September 25th.  So I don't 
see how the time he spent before then can be regarded as 
a delay.

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, that's -- that's a 

result of the fact that the act doesn't exclude the time 
before a routine deadline for filing the motion, because 
it only excludes the time -- the delay resulting from an 
individualized proceeding.  But it makes sense not to

exclude the -- the time before the routine deadline as a 
general matter, because if you excluded all that time, 
then you -- the result would be that the basic deadline 
of the act would be extended and time would be excluded 
in cases where no time was being used for consideration 
or preparation of pretrial motions.  But once you 
know --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What is the -- what 

is the proceeding from which you count in determining 
what should be excluded?

 MR. ROBERTS:  The time running from the 
order of the district court granting additional time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay, that order --

that proceeding was initiated and ruled on the same day. 
The person comes in and says:  I would like time.  The 
judge that same day says yes.

 MR. ROBERTS:  There were --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That proceeding 

takes a day.

 MR. ROBERTS:  The request -- the request for 

time, that proceeding was done.  But the order -- the 
order granting additional time is a proceeding, and the 
additional time that --

flowing from the order is a proceeding?

 MR. ROBERTS:  And it's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And that's one day.
 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, but it's the delay 
resulting from the order that we are talking about.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ah.  Now that -- now

provisions of the act.  If you take (h)(1)(A), that 
excludes delay resulting from any proceeding to 
determine mental competency.  Okay?

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And under your 

theory that would include the time from the filing of

competency, right?

 MR. ROBERTS:  I think courts have excluded 

from the filing of a motion seeking an examination, yes. 
You could also, that would probably be excluded under 
(h)(1)(D) --

(h)(4) excludes any period of delay resulting from the 
fact that the defendant is -- is mentally incompetent.

 MR. ROBERTS:  Right.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me 

redundant if you exclude the delay from the examination 
and then also exclude mental incompetence.

 MR. ROBERTS:  I don't think so, Your Honor, 
because the delay resulting from the examination would 
-- would be excluded from the order granting the 
examination until the examination was complete.  And 
then there would be a determination of competence or 
incompetence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All right.  Well, 

let's look at (h)(1)(G).  That excludes delay resulting 
from consideration by the court of a proposed plea 
agreement.  But then (h)(2) says any period of delay in 
which prosecution is deferred pursuant to a written --
written agreement with the defendant, for the purpose of 
allowing the defendant to demonstrate his good conduct, 
which sounds an awful lot like a plea agreement to me.

 MR. ROBERTS:  I don't -- I think that 
that's -- that that's a different -- a different 
deferral, Your Honor.  It's not for the court's 
consideration of a plea agreement or even for 
negotiations.  It's saying we're going to take time out

so that the defendant can demonstrate his -- his good 
conduct.

 I think that the plea agreement provision is 

once the parties have proposed an agreement to the 
court, the court has time to consider whether it should 
approve that and that time's excluded.  And in fact 
courts have excluded the time that the parties are 
engaged in plea negotiations as ancillary to that 
provision of consideration of the proposed plea 
agreement.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If I disagree with 

you that, when the time that is extended before a 
hearing on the pretrial motions and the acceptance of a 
waiver, which runs from 13 days, September 20, the 
original date, and the date that it actually took place, 
which is 13 days, and if I think, contrary to your 
submission, which is that the whole time from the filing 
of the extension to the final hearing is delay, even 
though it was only 13 days that was pushed back, then 
you lose, right?

 MR. ROBERTS:  I'm not sure.  If you think 
that the -- that there's delay that results from the 
grant of the extension, I don't think that the 
Petitioners ever challenged the length of the delay that 
was excluded, so the only issue that's before the Court

is whether that delay is excluded.

 I don't know that the Petitioners preserved 
any argument about the length of the delay, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Putting aside what 
Petitioners may or may not have argued, if I think that 
the delay is only how far the date for consideration of 
a motion and acting on the motion has been moved -- in 
this case, from September 20 to October 4; in other 
words, it's 13 days, not 28 days -- then you lose, 
right?

 MR. ROBERTS:  I'm not sure that we lose.  I 

have to confess that I haven't calculated the -- the 
exact amount of time that that results.  In any case, 
there are other periods of delays --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess it 

would be, take 15 days from what time you have 
calculated, and that's -- that's under the wire -- or is 
it above the wire?

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yeah.  I'm sorry, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In other words, I am 
contesting 15 of your days, and you figured out how much 
days you think can be excluded or not excluded.

 MR. ROBERTS:  Right.  I guess I would say, 
if there was some question about the length of delay, 
the appropriate thing would be to -- to rule for us on

the issue that's before the Court, remand to the courts 
below, allow them to decide whether the Petitioners 
preserved the question about the length of delay and 
what the effect is on a rule that would only limit the 
additional delay.

 You know, we also have other arguments for 

the fact that we think that, even if this time isn't 
excluded, that, based on -- based on the additional 
preparation time, that there's still no Speedy Trial Act 
here, that we raised in the -- in the brief of -- in 
opposition, and we would think that that should be taken 
into account on any remand like that as well.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was -- what was the 
second point you just made, Mr. Roberts?  That, even if 
the clock is running, you would still have an argument 
that you come within the 70 days because?

 MR. ROBERTS:  Because the -- on 

September 25th, Petitioner filed a notice of intent to 
waive pretrial motions, and then there was a hearing on 
that on the 4th, and so that filing would be analogous 
to a motion or a motion that would trigger it's own 
delay, that it would trigger it's own exclusion of time 
even if the time starting on September 7th was not 
excluded.

information, what's a motion to -- to waive?  I mean, 
why does he need permission to waive?

 MR. ROBERTS:  The -- the court had 

originally said -- the court had originally provided in 
its order that on the deadline for filing motions the --
the Petitioner should either file the motions or 
indicate whether he wanted to waive the motions and then 
set a hearing on either one, on the 4th, and that's what 
happened.

 After he filed that paper on the 4th, the 
court held a hearing, and the defendant -- discussed 
with the defendant personally whether he wanted to waive 
his right to file motions.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I see.
 MR. ROBERTS:  And the defendant waived his 

right to file motions, which had a consequence, you 
know, in the case.

 The second reason that the additional time 

granted for preparation of pretrial motions is 
automatically excluded is that the exclusion in Section 
(h)(1)(D) for delay resulting from pretrial motions 
themselves excludes the time that a court grants the 
non-moving party to prepare a response.

 And, as Justice Ginsburg, in her questions 
suggested, it would make little sense automatically to

exclude time granted to respond to motions, but not the 
time granted for the specific purpose of preparing them.

 In fact, this Court employed similar 

reasoning to that in the Henderson case when it held 
that the Act excludes the time after a court has held a 
hearing on a motion while the court's awaiting further 
written submissions.

 The Court reasoned that it would make no 

sense not to exclude that time because the act excludes 
all the time before the hearing, as well as 30 days 
after a motion's taken under advisement; and likewise it 
would make no sense not to exclude time that is 
specifically granted to prepare motions when the Court 
excludes the time granted to respond to them.

 Third --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Except for the -- for the 
language, which -- which says that you -- you time it 
from the beginning of the time granted.

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, section -- Section 

(h)(1), Your Honor, expressly states that it excludes 
delays, including, but not limited, to the listed 
delays, so no negative inference arises from the fact 
that the listed examples don't specifically address 
delays resulting from the grant of additional motions 
preparation time.

Section (h)(1)(D) is addressing a related, 
but different delay, the delay from the pretrial motion 
itself.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, what's the effect of 

that language then?  Why didn't (D) just read "delay 
resulting from any pretrial motion"?

 MR. ROBERTS:  Because Congress specifically 

amended it in 1979, in response to previous 
interpretations by some courts that had excluded only 
the time that was spent in actual court hearings, and 
the language makes clear that all the time from the 
filing of the motion through the hearings, including 
the -- not just the Court hearing time -- is excluded, 
and it -- the language continues to -- to make that 
clear, even if preparation time is also sometimes 
excluded.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, do you disagree 

with your adversary, that there is no statute of 
limitations problem if we rule against you?

 MR. ROBERTS:  No.  I don't think that there 

are statute of limitations problems, Your Honor, but 
requiring judges to make superfluous ends of justice 
findings --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But is it superfluous?

wanted district courts to think about why some things 
were being -- additional time was being requested.  Not 
all motions by defendants would a district court 
actually feel were warranted and might say to that 
individual if they came in:  Look; that shouldn't take 
you three weeks; that should only take you a week.

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, a court should always be 

doing that in considering whether to grant additional 
time that's requested, Your Honor.  Neither the 
defendant nor the public is going to have an interest in 
rushing to trial without adequate time to prepare --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that doesn't answer 
my point.  Without a requirement that the judge actually 
has to make a finding in the interest of justice, once 
the defense attorney comes in and says, I want a month, 
and isn't the judge required to give him the month 
because it's automatically excludable?

 What, otherwise, forces the judge to look at 
the request and say, no; is it really in the interest of 
justice for me to give you that month?"

 MR. ROBERTS:  The -- the judge doesn't have 
to give him the additional time.  Presumably, the judge 
should only give him the -- the additional time if more 
time is needed to prepare the -- the motions, based on 
the justification that the defendant --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what -- so what 

additional requirements are we imposing on the judge 
that the statute itself doesn't command?
 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, what --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If the judge always has 
to listen to the reason, weigh it, determine whether or 
not it is in fact in the interest of justice or not, how 
much more burden are we putting on a judge than to say, 
look, you are right, you need a month; I will exclude it 
under (7)(H).

 MR. ROBERTS:  The judge has to specifically 
consider all of the specified factors that are in (b)(1) 
through (4).

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We have never required 
the judge to give a litany of each of the factors under 
(h)(7).  We have never required him or her to do a 
detailed finding.  We've just required them to say 
there's some reason for it.

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, the court -- the statute 
says that the judge shall consider the specific factors, 
and some courts at least have -- have reversed -- if 
a -- situations where the court hasn't considered the 
factors.

 In addition, there have to be specific ends 
of justice findings, which I would respectfully disagree

with counsel on the other side:  The findings have to be 
made before the continuance is granted.  What --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what Zedner seems 

to suggest.

 MR. ROBERTS:  What Zedner says is the 
findings have to be made before the continuance is 
granted.  They can be recorded later, but they have to 
be made, because otherwise the continuance isn't made on 
the basis of the findings.  So if the judge didn't go 
through, consider the factors, and make the findings, if 
only in the judge's mind, then the judge shouldn't be 
recording them later on.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Roberts --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And counsel wouldn't know 
until -- wouldn't know whether the time was excluded or 
not until -- until a later finding is either made or not 
made.

 MR. ROBERTS:  Is recorded.  I guess -- I 

guess not, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask you, 

Mr. Roberts, to comment on your opponent's argument that 
you are creating a rule that if a particular district 
has a standing order that motions be filed after seven 
days and then another district has a standing order that 
it be 21 days, the effect of your rule would be to make

the seven-day district an 86-day -- give them 86 days 
under the Speedy Trial Act?

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yes, Your Honor.  The -- the 

act just doesn't operate so that -- so that all the 
districts' excludable delays are even across districts. 
The exclusion in Section (h)(1)(D), the exclusion for 
pretrial motions, excludes the time that's allotted to 
prepare responses.  And there is wide variation among 
the different districts in the time that's allotted to 
prepare responses.

 So, for example, the Northern District of 
Florida gives 14 days after the motion.  The Northern 
District of Illinois gives ten days after the motion.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's for response time.
 MR. ROBERTS:  For response time.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  And that's automatically 

excluded, so that won't affect the -- well, like you 
said, it's --

MR. ROBERTS:  It's going to be different.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.
 MR. ROBERTS:  So it's the same -- it's the 

same issue.  They're just -- it isn't in lockstep.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But if the difference is 

specifically authorized by Congress?

authorized by Congress, too, because section (h)(1) is 
-- is a general exclusion for delay resulting from 
proceedings concerning the defendant.

 And, you know, these are -- the list of 

things are examples only.  And this covers those 
proceedings and other proceedings, including those that 
like this one that are ancillary to the listed ones.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But doesn't it seem fairly 

clear that the district which has a 21-day rule, they 
won't have to -- normally, they won't need extra time in 
the routine case for an extra motion, whereas the 
districts with a seven-day rule would pretty 
automatically need another 10 days or so.

 MR. ROBERTS:  I think it depends on the 
particular case and what motions are in -- or what 
motions are involved, Your Honor.

 But the -- the rule is going to operate 

differentially, too.  Under Petitioner's theory, people 
come in asking for different extensions of time to get 
(h)(7) continuances, which Petitioner says are not going 
to be very difficult to get granted.  So I think, both 
in terms of the response time varying and in terms of 
the rule having the same effect, whether it's excluded 
under (h)(1) or (h)(7), I'm not sure that you are going 
to ever get a complete parity.  That's really not what

Congress was intending.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, this may be 

the same question I was asking earlier, but I want to 
make sure I've got your answer.  Let's say the original 
date for filing motions is, as it was here, 
September 13th, right?  On September 7th, Mr. Bloate 
asks for additional time.  So the judge's, you know, 
runs a tight ship, and he says, I will give you one day. 
One more day, so now it's due on September 14th.

 You would say the delay resulting from that 

extension was seven days, from September 7th, when he 
filed it, to September 14th, and not one day.

 MR. ROBERTS:  That's the way the courts have 

interpreted it, because once the -- once the 
determination has been made that there should be time to 
prepare a response, then you know that you're outside of 
the case where you don't know whether any of this time 
in the routine deadline is being used for response --
for consideration of motions or preparation of motions. 
You know that counsel is using time for that purpose.

 But I would say, you know, the same answer 

back to you, that -- that the issue here is whether 
additional time should -- is excluded when it's granted. 
The issue isn't how much time should have been excluded. 
And if -- if the court thinks that an incorrect amount

of time has been -- was calculated as excluded, I think 
that the appropriate thing to do in that circumstance 
would be for the Court to leave that open on remand, 
assuming that it's -- that it's preserved.  But, you 
know, I think that -- that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you would argue it 
wasn't reserved because both sides thought the period 
was from September 7th until October 4th, and one 
thought that that whole period should be excluded?  That 
was your position, and then the other side said none of 
it --

MR. ROBERTS:  That's right, Your Honor.  I 

Petitioner never argued, at least as far as I am 

--
aware, that the error was a miscalculation of the amount 
of time, rather than the exclusion of the time under the 
wrong statutory provision.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  How -- how do you think it 

should work?  It seems to me they are two separate 
things.  On September 7th, the defendant comes in and 
says, "Judge, you've told me I have to have everything 
ready by the 13th.  I would like additional time to 
prepare."  And what he said was, "until September 25th." 
He said that on the 13th:  "I want until 
September 25th."  This is what I think the Chief Justice 
is asking, in part.

Now, what the judge did is excluded 

everything from September 7th all the way to 
October 4th.  And if I understand your argument -- I'm 
not sure I agree with it, but on the 7th to the 13th, 
that really wasn't additional time, but nonetheless, 
maybe there's something there.

 What about the period from the 25th to the 

4th?  I don't know what the theory could be on excluding 
that one, because what the defendant said on the 7th --
on September 13th, he said, "Judge, I don't want any 
more time.  I don't even want to file any motions."

 MR. ROBERTS:  On the 25th.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  On the 25th, he said 
that.  So what is the basis of excluding the 25th to the 
4th?

 MR. ROBERTS:  As I was saying before, what 
-- he did make a filing on the 25th, and the Court took 
action in response to that filing on the 4th, by holding 
a hearing at which he waived the motions as he indicated 
that he was doing on the -- on the 25th.  So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the delay -- so 

saying I'm not going to file any pretrial motions 
results in a delay from a pretrial motion?

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, in this particular 
instance, Your Honor, he made a filing and then the

Court -- the Court held a hearing in response to that, 
and actually engaged in a colloquy with the defendant, 
asked the -- asked the defendant, "Do you understand 
what you are giving up?  Do you want to waive these 
motions?"  He said, "Yes, I want to do that," and the 
Court ruled, then, on that on the 4th.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that a normal course 

of practice?  I've never quite heard of other --

MR. ROBERTS:  I don't think it's a general 

practice, Your Honor.  It does seem to be typical in 
this -- in this district, but I think that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But then the Court's 

view a decision or statement that no motions are going 
to be filed as a request for a waiver of that 
obligation?

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, it was in fact a waiver 
notice, a notice of intent to waive, that the defendant 
filed.  Not just --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Intent to waive.
 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, I mean, it was framed as 

a waiver, a waiver of pretrial motions.  It's Docket 
Entry 21.  But I don't think it's -- you know, it's in 
the record, but not in the -- in the JA.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I didn't see it as 
a motion.  It didn't move to waive.  It said, "I waive."

MR. ROBERTS:  That -- that's true, but the 
Court didn't -- the Court held the hearing on the 4th. 
And it engaged in this conversation with the defendant 
and then made a decision on the 4th that the time was 
waived, that the -- the waiver, not --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So it's --
MR. ROBERTS:  Not at the time it was filed.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what I understand. 

You get the period from the -- the 25th to the 4th comes 
under (D) or (H).  It's a motion that is filed, and it's 
under advisement.

 MR. ROBERTS:  I think that the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So it comes under (D) or 

(H).  Is that right?

 MR. ROBERTS:  It comes under -- it probably 

comes under (h)(1), Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, I don't mean little 

(h)(1).  I mean big (H).  It's attributed to a period 
during which any proceedings actually under any 
advisement -- or maybe it comes under (D) -- a motion 
not to file a motion is a motion.

 MR. ROBERTS:  I mean, it could come under 
(D), Your Honor.  It could come under (h)(1).  I would 
say it really comes under both -- best fits under (h)(1) 
as analogous to a motion that's not exactly a motion.

But, you know, either way, the point is that 

it was something that the Court required the Court 
action, or at least as the Court had set the rules in 
this proceeding required Court action, and then it did 
ultimately did have Court action on the Court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Would you repeat that just 

so I have you:  It comes under (h)(1) -- what sub?

 MR. ROBERTS:  I think just under -- I would 

say, Your Honor, just under the general language of 
(h)(1), because it's not strictly a pretrial motion, but 
it's the equivalent of a pretrial motion.

 But you could say that it falls under --
under (h)(1)(D), and think of it as a motion itself.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Did --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you have any idea of 
how many, if we rule against you, until we -- speaking 
hypothetically, how many convictions would be at risk

courts of appeals.

true.  I mean, I can't say that they are going to be --
and I would have to agree with -- with Petitioner's 
counsel that, you know, that there are consequences in 
whatever ruling that the Court -- that the Court makes 
in a case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I would have been -- I 

would have been interested in knowing the effects of 
Zedner.

 MR. ROBERTS:  Yeah.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And how -- what kind of 

burden it placed.

 MR. ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, I don't have any 
precise -- precise information on that.  But I think 
that, you know, even apart from the transitional effects 
that there are going to be on a going-forward basis, 
sometimes judges are going -- would -- would grant 
additional preparation time and neglect to make the 
required finding.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's true of all 
Speedy Trial Act actions by the district court.  They 
always run the risk of forgetting to make a finding. 
That's why you have two attorneys, presumably --

appropriate if findings under (h)(7) were necessary. 
But section (h)(1) is designed to address frequently 
recurring situations in which the ends of justice are 
virtually always going to be served by delaying the 
trial for the purpose.  And that's exactly what we have 
here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can I ask you about the 

language of (h)(1)?  Do you think it's -- do you think 
it's proper to consider a period of delay that precedes 
the filing of the motion?  That is, a period of delay in 
order to prepare the motion, as a delay resulting from a 
proceeding that has not yet occurred?

 MR. ROBERTS:  No, we -- we agree with that, 

Your Honor.  That's why Petitioner is wrong in saying 
that (D) addresses the delay we are talking about here 
and precludes its recognition under -- under (h)(1). 
The delay we are talking about here is not resulting 
from the pretrial motion, it's resulting from the grant 
of -- the order granting additional time to prepare for 
the motion.  And that, that is the related but different 
proceeding and a different kind of delay related to 
motions practice.  So I would agree with Your Honor 
that --

 MR. ROBERTS:  -- and if the delay results 
from that order and the order is ancillary to a listed 
proceeding, which is the pretrial motions because it

MR. ROBERTS:  -- (h)(1).
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  -- no subsection talks 

about another proceeding?  That's just your gloss on the 
statute; is that right?

 MR. ROBERTS:  Well, I think (h)(1) says any 

period of delay resulting from other proceedings 
concerning the defendant.  That could be a period, and 
it covers a whole range of proceedings that generate 
delay.  And then --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  I see.
 MR. ROBERTS:  Then there is a list of 

examples.  And the examples are intended only to be 
illustrative.  And what's -- what's covered is in 
addition to those examples, other proceedings that are 
analogous or ancillary to them.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you say the order is a 

proceeding for that purpose, the order granting the 
extension of time?

 MR. ROBERTS:  That is the proceedings 

beforehand, Your Honor.  Yes.  But the -- that's not

delay following an order of removal or an order 
directing the transportation of the defendant.

 And, so, I think that there's indication in 

the examples themselves when orders are sometimes 
proceedings.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But just one quick 

question.  It seems to me that everything described in 
(7)(A) would fit your description of proceedings.

 MR. ROBERTS:  It -- there -- there would be 

an order, so there would be a proceeding.  But it 
wouldn't be a proceeding that would be covered under 
(h)(1) because it -- to be covered it has to be a 
proceeding of the type that is listed here.  It has to 
be analogous to these proceedings or ancillary to them, 
facilitating these proceedings in some way, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's a tough argument.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Mr. Stancil, five minutes.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. STANCIL:  I would like to quickly 

address what I hope to be just four points.  The first 
is the government's fundamental principle.  The 
fundamental tenet is that the specific treatment of 
pretrial motions in subparagraph (D) suggests no

negative inference or limiting inference on the general 
standard of (h)(1).

 The fall on that is evident by looking at 
subparagraph (h), which automatically excludes up to 
30 days during which a matter is under advisement by the 
district court.  If the government's reasoning is 
correct, subparagraph (h) just does not address or 
contains -- or suggests no negative inference on whether 
the 31st day of a matter being under advisement is 
automatically excludable under (h)(1).  That's why there 
are settle -- in the statutory interpretation.

 We take the general standard, first of all, 

is it a proceeding?  There is no pretrial motion 
proceeding until the motion is filed.

 Second, if you think there is any 

uncertainty as to what a proceeding is, well, look at 
how the enumerated subparagraphs that follow, what do 
they describe.  One specifically addresses pretrial 
motions.  It has a starting point and it has an end 
point.  That's the end of this case.

 But even if you think you want to look 

further.  Well, is there any support in these enumerated 
subparagraphs for the government's rule that you would 
treat a defense request for additional time differently? 
No.  None of the enumerated subparagraphs distinguishes

between defense requests and government requests.  None 
distinguishes between routinely granted time or 
specifically alloted time.

 In fact, with respect to defense requests 

specifically, it was not lost on Congress how to -- how 
to treat government counsel and defense counsel 
differently.  In (h)(7)(C), which is about the end of 
justice exclusion, it specifies that the government 
cannot get an end of justice exclusion based on its 
inability to exercise due diligence in obtaining a 
witness or preparing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand -- I 
don't understand the government to be argue -- to be 
arguing that they are treated differently.

 MR. STANCIL:  Well, the government's rule I 

think is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  They are saying whoever --

whoever asked for the extension of time in order to 
prepare the motion gets it.  And -- and it's the time 
limit's suspended.

 MR. STANCIL:  That's not their position in 
their brief, Your Honor.  They say the defense requests 
for additional time --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well --

government request.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- they made it very clear 

here that they think it applies to both the defendant 
and the government.

 MR. STANCIL:  If that's their position, it's 
more unmoored from the text of subparagraph (D), because 
then both types of requests -- so subparagraph -- pardon 
me -- so (h)(1)'s general standard is expanded even 
farther --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You are right, (D) has a 

special time limit built into it -- I mean, (h) or 
whatever the number is now.  It says not to exclude 
30 days.  Okay?

 MR. STANCIL:  Yes.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  None of the others do.  So 
I would say right there, Congress doesn't want the judge 
to have it for more than 30 days.  Congress doesn't say 
a word in any of the others that says anything about 
preparation time.

 MR. STANCIL:  Well, I disagree about 

subparagraph (D) Your Honor.  (D) says from point B 
to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I know.  But there is 

not an indication about preparation time.  Their 
argument is a literal argument under the statute.  Is it

from other proceedings?  Yes, we know that because of 
(D), okay?  Does it result from other proceedings?  Yes, 
because, in fact, the preparation time is a direct 
result of the other proceedings as defined in (D). 
Therefore, it is an ancillary matter related to other 
proceedings that was caused by the other proceedings. 
QED, their argument is literal and there is no policy 
against it.  That's what they said.

 Now, as soon as you get to the last (h), you 

would find a big policy against it.  Called not 
exceeding 30 days.  Now, I take it that's roughly their 
argument.

 MR. STANCIL:  But there is no --
JUSTICE BREYER:  At least my interpretation 

of it.

 MR. STANCIL:  There is no difference, Your 
Honor, between not exceeding 30 days and from and to. 
And I think this is -- this case -- it comes to that and 
that alone, which is Congress specifically addressed 
pretrial motions, any delay resulting from a pretrial 
motion and it said from point A to point B.  And even if 
you had to look behind that, you would look at the 
legislative history and the Senate Judiciary Committee 
was asked a specific question by the government no less, 
can we include preparation time, and they said no.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, is your 

friend correct that the issue of the proper calculation 
is not before us?  So that the time I spent figuring 
that out should be excluded from something?

 (Laughter.)
 MR. STANCIL:  As the question was presented, 
Your Honor, it was specific to preparation time and the 
period -- and the period from -- I don't want to get the 
dates wrong but, September 7th to October 4th.  But I 
would add that the government didn't raise this argument 
below, either.  Nor did the government suggest, as I 
understand it, that the delay that's at issue here 
results from the grant on September 7th of additional 
time.  Rather their argument as I have understood it and 
understood it when reading their briefs is that the 
delay -- the ancillary delay stems from the pretrial 
motion, the time allotted for pretrial motions itself.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I would have thought 

that whether or not you think that type of delay is 
excludable depends on what that type of delay is, which 
requires some sense of how it's going to be calculated.

 MR. STANCIL:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Does six days make a 

difference to your case?  If they lose six days, do you 
win?
