CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

first  this  morning  in  Case  14­1280,  Heffernan  v.  City  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Paterson,  New  Jersey. 

 

 

            

Mr.  Frost. 

 

               

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  MARK  FROST 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

Public  employees  have  a  right  not  to  be 

   

 

 

 

 

 

demoted  on  patronage  grounds.  It  does  not  matter  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  affiliated  with  a  specific  party  or  that  you  are 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonaffiliated.  It  does  not  matter  if  you  are  mistakenly 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perceived  by  your  employer  or  supervisor  that  you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaged  in  political  association  to  be  protected  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First  Amendment. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  How  would  you  define  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right  at  issue  in  this  case? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  The  ­­ the  issue  here  is  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  How  would  you  define  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

right  that  your  client  wishes  this  Court  to  vindicate? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  I'm  defining  the  right  in  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant  to  Elrod  and  its  progeny,  that  there  ­­ it  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  necessary  to  have  any  affirmative  acts,  that  by

virtue  of  being  a  public  employee,  he  has  the  right  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  engage  in  political  association. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Well,  that's  just  a 

  

 

 

 

 

restatement  of  ­­ of  Elrod.  I  ­­ I  ­­ would  ­­ would  ­­

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  it  be  fair  to  the  proposition  that  you  are  putting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

before  the  Court  to  say  that  you're  asserting  the  right 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  free  from  government  inquiry  into  an  oversight  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  views?  Would  that  be  a  fair  statement? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  That  would  be  a  fair  statement, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy. 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Because  ­­ look,  do  we  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  sounds  to  me  from  the  way  you  began  your  argument 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  we  take  this  case  on  the  assumption  that,  if  he  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

picked  up  the  sign,  that  if  he  had  been  supporting  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

candidate  for  chief  of  police  who  was  challenging  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incumbent,  if  he  had  been  engaged  in  the  activity,  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  protected.  He  could  not  have  been  demoted. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If  ­­ you  want  us  to  take  the  case  on  that  ­­ do  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  accept  that  proposition  for  you  to  prevail  in  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case? 

            

MR.  FROST:  No,  you  do  not  have  to  accept 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  proposition.  Proposition  is  just  clearly  that,  as 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  public  employee,  he  has  a  right  to  either  associate  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonassociate,  and  he  doesn't  have  to  commit  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmative  act  in  support,  in  this  case,  of  the  mayor's

opponent,  which  was  Chief  Spagnola. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  but  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

First  Amendment  talks  about  abridging  freedom  of  speech, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  I  thought  the  case  came  to  us  on  the  proposition 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  wasn't  engaging  in  speech  at  all.  That  he  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  engaging  in  association,  he  was  not  engaging  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  convey  a  message,  he  was  just  picking  up  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sign  for  his  mother.  And  if  that's  the  basis  on  which 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case  comes  to  us,  I'm  not  sure  how  he  can  say  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

freedom  of  speech  has  been  abridged. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  In  this  case,  Mr.  Chief  Justice, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case  comes  to  us  with  respect  to  association.  With 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  speech,  speech  is  governed  by  a  different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine  than  association.  There  is  no  need  to  do  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pickering  analysis  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  He  wasn't  associating  with 

  

 

 

 

 

anybody  any  more  ­­ any  more  than  he  was  speaking.  He 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  doing  neither  one. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  Justice  Scalia  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  He  was  associate  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

associating  with  his  mother,  I  suppose,  in  picking  up 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  sign  for  her.  But  he  was  not  expressing  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political  view.  He  was  not  associating  with  a  political 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

party.

MR.  FROST:  Elrod  would  stand  for  that

MR.  FROST:  Elrod  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Elrod  says  you  have  a  First 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Amendment  right  to  favor  a  political  party  or  not  favor 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  political  party,  and  you  cannot  be  fired  for  doing  so. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  not  what  happened  here. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  But  he  was  not  favoring  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

political  party. 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Exactly.  He  was  not 

  

  

 

 

 

expressing  any  First  Amendment  view  whatever.  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

he  was  fired  for  the  wrong  reason,  but  there's  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  right  not  to  be  fired  for  the  wrong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason.  If  he  was  fired  because  his  ­­ his  ­­ his  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  government  employer  thought  he  had  committed  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

felony  and  he  hadn't,  he  might  ­­ he  might  have  a  cause 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  action  under  some  statute.  But  there  ­­ there  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  constitutional  right  not  to  be  fired  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong  reason,  and  that's  what  happened  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  There's  a  constitutional  right, 

   

  

 

 

Justice  Scalia,  to  be  able  to  be  free  from  patronage

grounds.  And  in  Elrod  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Where  do  we  say  that?  We 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

never  said  that.  Elrod  and  ­­ and  Branti  are  ­­ are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  decided  under  the  First  Amendment.  The  First 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  guarantees  the  right  to  freedom  of  speech  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

freedom  of  association.  Your  client  was  neither 

  

 

 

 

 

 

speaking  nor  associating.  So  how  could  he  possibly  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  cause  of  action  under  the  First  Amendment? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  He  doesn't  need  to  speak,  and  he 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  need  to  take  a  position.  The  Rutan  plaintiffs, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  didn't  take  a  position  with  respect  to  promotion  or

endorsed  by  the  Republican  party,  none  of  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individuals  would  have  been  promoted  or  transferred. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  didn't  take  any  affirmative  acts. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  I  don't  understand  ­­ I 

    

 

 

 

 

don't  understand  your  answer.  What  ­­ what  expressive

looked  at  the  motive  of  the  employer,  the  motive  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government.  If  government  perceives  that  you  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

engaging  in  a  political  activity  and  the  motive  is  to

facts  that  you  are  evaluating. 

 

 

 

 

            

Here  they  evaluated  the  facts  that  he  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engaged  in  campaigning. 

 

 

            

Officer  Heffernan  went  to  a  political 

   

 

 

 

gathering.  He  went  and  picked  up  a  sign.  What  was 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

misperceived  by  his  employer  was  the  fact  of  his  intent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He  said  that,  I'm  not  intending  to  support  Spagnola,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  is  doing  all  those  incidents  that  are  core  First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  activities. 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Well,  let  me  just  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  clarify  what  I  ­­ how  I  thought  the  case  was 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented.  Let's  say  the  employer  comes  in  to  Smith  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

says,  you  know,  Smith,  I  saw  you  getting  a  ­­ a  ­­ a 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

political  sign,  and  you're  ­­ and  you're  ­­ you're 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fired. 

            

And  Smith  says,  it  wasn't  me.  I  was  off, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  know,  in  a  different  town  then. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

In  other  words,  it's  a  pure  mistake  of  fact.

MR.  FROST:  Well,  there  are  Hatch  Acts. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

There  was  no  provision  here. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Can  the  government  insist 

  

 

 

 

 

on  neutrality? 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  I  think  the  government  can  have 

    

 

 

 

 

 

a  policy  after  balancing  the  interests  between  that  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employer  and  that  of  the  position. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Is  that  an  issue  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  FROST:  I  was  not  saying  ­­

    

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Is  that  an  issue  ­­ is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  an  issue  in  this  case?  Is  there  any  allegation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  was  such  a  policy  of  neutrality  that  no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  could  engage  in  political  activity? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  Okay.  Justice  Ginsburg,  there 

  

  

 

 

 

was  no  such  policy  in  this  case  involving  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  I  thought 

    

  

 

 

there  was  an  unwritten  policy. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  There  ­­ there  was  a  policy  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Chief  Wittig  said  that  existed  with  respect  to  members 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  his  staff  only.  However,  with  respect  to  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

policy,  there's  no  testimony  regarding  that  policy.  In 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  words,  the  people  that  worked  in  the  Chief's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office  ­­ there  were  four  individuals  who  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

officers  ­­ none  of  them  ever  heard  of  that  policy.

Also,  that  policy  was  never  raised  below  in  any  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motions  for  summary  judgment  or  the  motion  before  the

But  to  answer  your  question,  Your  Honor,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  no  one  knew  of  this  policy.  So  ­­ so  he

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Okay. 

  

 

 

MR.  FROST:  There  is  a  ­­ State  of 

   

  

 

 

 

 

New  Jersey  has  a  State  Civil  Rights  Act  which  mimics 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1983.  Just  because  there  is  a  ­­ such  a  right,  doesn't 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

mean  that  you  can  diminish  the  First  Amendment  and  give 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  your  First  Amendment  rights.  So  clearly,  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceeded  with  the  fact  that  there  was  a  violation  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  First  Amendment  just  because  it  was  created  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

State.  There  is  no  civil  service  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  What  ­­ what  is  the  New 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Jersey  Act?  That's  a  strange  act.  It  protects  State 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

employment  only  against  First  Amendment  violations? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FROST:  No,  it  ­­ it  mimics  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  can't  imagine  that.  It 

    

  

 

 

 

must  ­­ it  must  have  other  protections  for  State 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  ­­ employees. 

 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  With  respect  to  the  New  Jersey 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute,  it's  just  identical  to  a  1983  cause  of  action,

MR.  FROST:  New  Jersey  law,  the  statute  just 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

mimics  a  1983  cause  of  action. 

   

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  So  it  says  ­­ it  says  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  violate  ­­ you  can't  fire  a  State  employee  in

respect  to  this  matter,  he's  also  not  protected  by  civil 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service,  either. 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Well,  Mr.  Goldstein's  brief 

  

 

 

 

 

says  New  Jersey  law  provides  a  statutory  right  of  action 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  an  attempt  to  violate  an  individual's  civil  rights. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

            

Is  he  wrong? 

 

 

MR.  FROST:  An  attempt  to  violate? 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Yeah. 

  

 

MR.  FROST:  It  ­­ it  is  included  in  there, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  ­­ but  that  doesn't  give  you  an  exclusive  right. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  can't  diminish  his  First  Amendment  rights. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  No.  The  question  is  not 

  

  

 

 

 

 

whether  the  New  Jersey  law  somehow  abrogates  First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  rights.  The  question  is  whether  he  has  a  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  independent  remedy  under  State  law.  That's  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

question,  I  think,  that's  being  asked. 

   

 

 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  He  could  have  a  remedy  under 

   

  

 

 

 

 

State  law.  But  it  ­­ in  this  instance,  he  pursued  it, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  First  Amendment  rights.

there's  no  First  Amendment  right,  what  civil  right  has

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  if  we  say  it

you're  claiming.

claim  in  Federal  court  as  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  He  may  have  broader 

  

 

 

 

 

substantive  rights  under  New  Jersey  law.  I  would  be 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhat  surprised  if  that  were  not  the  case.  The  civil

And  ­­ and  therefore,  with  respect  to  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter,  it's  our  position  that  he  has  every  right  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

maintain  this  litigation  with  respect  to  violation  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  First  Amendment  right.  And  here,  he  is  alleging 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  has  the  right  not  to  associate.  And  that  right 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  stems  from  the  fact  that  we  have  ­­ that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  has  considered  in  Elrod  and  its  progeny. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

Furthermore,  the  Third  Circuit  makes  its 

 

 

 

 

mistake  in  requiring  Heffernan  to  actually  engage  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

some  type  of  political  activity,  campaigning.  That's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

not  necessary,  as  I've  indicated,  with  respect  to  Elrod 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  Rutan  plaintiffs. 

 

 

 

            

Additionally,  the  Third  Circuit's  decision 

 

 

 

 

in  this  case  is  actually  ­­ lacks  common  sense.  I  mean, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if  you  take  a  hypothetical  with  two  police  officers 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  pick  up  a  sign,  and  when  they  go  to  pick  up  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sign  they're  at  a  campaign  gathering,  and  one  police 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

officer  states  to  his  employer,  yeah,  I  was  supporting 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Spagnola,  and  Mr.  Heffernan  would  say,  no,  I'm  ­­ I'm 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  supporting  it.  I'm  doing  this  to  pick  up  a  sign  for 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  mother,  should  make  no  difference. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  outcome  is  still  the  same  in  the  sense 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they're  both  engaged  in  that  activity.  The  only

difference  is,  is  that  the  employer  perceived 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Mr.  Heffernan  as  engaging  in  protected  activity.  They 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

went  to  stifle  and  squash  his  rights  of  association  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nonassociation.  Their  motive  was  to  suppress  that.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

clearly,  that  has  a  chilling  effect  on  other  employees.

page  50,  what  is  very  telling  about  this  case  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  that  when  he  went  to  pick  up  the  sign,  there  was  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

councilman  there  who  was  a  chairperson  of  the  election. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  he  says  to  Heffernan,  says,  boy,  you  better  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

careful.  Maybe  you  should  come  back  later  while 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  ­­ because  we're  hanging  up  these  signs.  And  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clearly  shows  the  chilling  effect  that  it  would  have  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  in  this  police  department  or  in  the  City  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Paterson,  but  other  employees  in  different  jurisdictions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  different  areas  would  have  the  same  issues.  You 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  to  think  twice  before  you  did  something. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  you  went  to  a  political  gathering  or  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

campaign,  or  you  went  to  hear  a  speaker  speak  and  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

picked  up  a  pamphlet  and  put  it  on  your  desk,  the  ­­ if 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

your  employer  saw  that  and  they  didn't  like  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

candidate  and  they  took  action  against  you,  you  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

see  that  that  is  action  based  on  a  motive  to  suppress 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one's  rights.

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  All  of  those  things  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

be  true  if  the  mayor  gave  a  speech  saying  I  am  going  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fire  anybody  who's  not  a  Republican.  All  of  those 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

things  would  be  true.  Would  it  chill  people  ­­ blah 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

blah  blah  ­­ would  there  be  a  cause  of  action?  Would 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody  have  a  cause  of  action  because  of  that  speech? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FROST:  Because  of  the  speech  itself? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Yeah,  just  the  speech.  He 

  

  

 

 

 

 

hasn't  fired  anybody.  He's  just  said  I  am  going  to  fire 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody  who's  not  a  Republican,  or  anybody  who's  not  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Republican  will  not  get  promoted. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  FROST:  Justice  Scalia  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Does  anybody  have  a  cause 

   

  

 

 

 

of  action  for  that? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  There  would  be  no  claim,  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  action  was  taken.  So  ­­ so  part  ­­ you  have  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

perception  that  they  engaged  in  an  activity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Exactly.  So  ­­ so  what 

  

  

 

 

 

 

counts  is  whether  action  was  taken  for  a  particular 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason,  not  whether  you  chilled  ­­ whether  you  chilled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people,  which  you're  arguing  to  us  is  this  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional  because  it  chills  other  people. 

 

 

 

 

 

That  ­­ that  doesn't  ­­ that  just  doesn't  carry  water. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  Justice  Scalia,  what  carries 

  

 

 

 

 

water  is  the  fact  that  in  this  instance,  Heffernan  was

that  activity. 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Would  you  ­­ would  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

say  that  he  was  demoted  because  he  gave  the  appearance 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  exercising  his  First  Amendment  rights? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  FROST:  Yes.  Because  they  perceived  it 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  he  was  exercising  his  rights,  and  the  fact  that  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  was  not  engaged  in  any  political  activity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  make  no  difference  with  respect  to  the  motivation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outcome  of  what  took  place  with  Mr.  Heffernan.  The

I'd  like  to  start  with  Justice  Kennedy's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

question  about  how  we  define  the  right  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

We  think  that  Petitioner  has  a  First 

   

 

 

 

 

Amendment  right  not  to  have  adverse  action  taken  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

him  by  his  employer  for  the  unconstitutional  purpose  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suppressing  disfavored  political  beliefs.  He  was 

  

 

 

 

 

directly  injured  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  And  what's  your  best  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

for  that  proposition? 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  we  think  that  there  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ there  are  two  aspects  of  this  ­­ this  Court's  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

law  I  think  that  support  that,  and  then  I'd  like  to  get 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

back  to  your  concern  about  probing  of  beliefs.  But  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  that  the  way  that  the  Court  defined  the  right  at 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

issue  in  Branti  and  Rutan,  and  again  in  O'Hare, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstrates  that  an  employee  doesn't  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmatively  exercise  his  First  Amendment  rights  first. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

 

So  in  those  courts  ­­ in  ­­ in  those  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court  said  that  the  plaintiff  can  show  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutional  violation  of  the  First  Amendment  simply 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  showing  that  the  employer  acted  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional  purpose  of  suppressing  disfavored 

 

 

 

 

political  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  those  cases, 

  

 

 

 

Ms.  Anders  ­­ I  missed  what  you  said  those  cases  were.

O'Hare,  which  is  the  government  contract  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  You  say  in  all  of  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  no  First  Amendment  right  was  being  exercised, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right? 

            

            

            

MS.  ANDERS:  No. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Is  that  your  point? 

  

 

 

 

 

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  I  think  actually  in  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Rutan  case  there  were  ­­ there  were  three  plaintiffs, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  it  wasn't  clear,  actually,  whether  they  had  engaged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  any  affirmative  exercise  of  their  First  Amendment  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

hadn't? 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Was  it  clear  that  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  ANDERS:  So  what  the  court  said  was  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  had  ­­

 

 

            

hadn't? 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Was  it  clear  that  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MS.  ANDERS:  It  was  not  clear  whether  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  or  hadn't,  and  the  court  didn't  inquire  into  that. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  what  had  happened  there  was  that  the  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  had  been  ­­ had  adverse  action  taken  against 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  because  they  had  lacked  the  support  of  the  correct 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Republican  party  officials.  That's  all  the  court  says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  their  allegations.

There  are  any  number  of  reasons  they  could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  lacked  that  support.  They  could  have  affirmatively 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

refused,  obviously,  to  seek  the  support,  which  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  exercise  of  First  Amendment  rights.  But  on  the  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hand,  they  may  simply  have  not  had  the  time  to  seek  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  support,  or  they  may  have  been  ignorant  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  in  the  first  place.  Those  wouldn't  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

involved  an  affirmative  exercise. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Yeah.  I  thought  in  all  of 

    

  

 

 

 

 

these  cases  up  to  now,  whenever  anybody's  fired, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

demoted,  or  even  not  promoted,  it  hurts  and  ­­ and  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  bring  a  lawsuit  sometimes.  Up  to  now,  those 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuits  would  have  to  show  I  was  asserting  a  First 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  right,  and  it's  for  that  reason  that  I  was  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

promoted. 

            

But  what  you're  saying  is,  you  don't  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

show  that  at  all.  All  you  have  to  assert  is  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason  I  was  not  promoted  was  that  the  ­­ the  employer 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

believed  that  I  was  thus  and  so  or  not  thus  and  so.  You 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  have  to  show  any  assertion  of  a  First  Amendment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right.  You  just  show  that  the  ­­ the  employer  liked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Republicans,  and  that's  enough. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  I  think  in  the  employment 

   

  

 

 

 

 

context,  I  think  there's  no  question  that  the  plaintiff 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  directly  injured  by  the  unconstitutional  condition.

But  to  respond  directly  to  your  point,  I  think  ­­ I 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  think  there's  a  serious  concern  here  that  there 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  be  a  meritless  ­­ a  flood  of  meritless  lawsuits  or 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything  like  that,  and  that's  primarily  for  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasons. 

              

 

 

I  take  your  point  that  ­­ that,  you  know, 

 

 

 

 

 

this  will  expand  the  universe  of  ­­ of  litigation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

somewhat,  but  we  already  know  in  the  statutory  context, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  courts  have  recognized  suits  based  on  a  mistaken 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

perception,  and  ­­ and  in  that  context  we  haven't  seen 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  flood  of  meritless  lawsuits. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  with  respect  to  Elrod  claims 

 

 

 

 

 

specifically,  I  think  it's  always  been  fairly  easy  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

plaintiffs  to  allege  that  a  particular  affiliation  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

belief,  I  was  in  the  Republican  party  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  How  do  you  know  we 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

haven't  seen  a  flood  of  meritless  lawsuits  in  that

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  we  ­­ we  haven't  in  the

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  we  looked  at  this,  it  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  doesn't  come  up  very  much.  And  when  it  does,  it  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  looks  to  us  that  ­­ that  courts  have  been  able  to  use

the  standard  technique  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  You're  looking  at 

  

 

 

 

 

the  reported  decisions  rather  than  ­­ you  haven't  done 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  survey  to  see  how  many  complaints  have  been  filed  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ in  this  type  of  case? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  No.  But  when  you  looked  to 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

reported  decisions,  what  you  see  is  that  courts  are  able 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  use  Twombly  and  Iqbal  and  summary  judgment  in  order 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  rid  of  claims  where  the  allegations  aren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plausible  or  there's  no  evidence. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  also  think  if  the  plaintiffs  are  going 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  to  allege  that  ­­ that  they  actually  held  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beliefs  in  question,  this  is  going  to  raise  exactly  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern  that  Justice  Kennedy  mentioned  earlier  about 

 

 

 

 

 

 

oversight  of  beliefs,  probing  into  beliefs.  So  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  affect  all  Elrod  cases.  So  every  time  an  Elrod 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  is  brought,  the  defendant  will  have  the  incentive 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  say  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  are  you  saying  there's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  right  to  be  secure  from  government  oversight  of  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beliefs? 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  I  think  the  Court 

   

  

 

 

 

recognized  in  O'Hare  that  that  is  a  particular  concern 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  affiliation  context.  We  ­­ we  don't  want  courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  have  to  ­­ to  examine  the  nature  and  extent  of  the

plaintiff's  beliefs  or  associations. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  I  mean,  that's  a  good  idea, 

    

   

 

 

 

maybe.  And  maybe  ­­ maybe  it  should  be  in  some  civil 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service  act,  but  where  do  you  find  it  in  the  First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment? 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  I  think  the  right  ­­ the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

right  in  question  is  the  right  not  to  be  subject  to  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

test  of  political  affiliation  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  Is  ­­ is  that  because 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you're  concerned  with  a  chill,  or  is  there  some  other 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  that  is  ­­ is  somehow  affected  that's  a  First 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  right  of  the  individual? 

 

 

 

 

            

You  turn  around  and  you  say  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cannot  act  for  an  unconstitutional  purpose,  but  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

usually  ask  how  is  the  defendant  hurt?  What  is  his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right?  That's  still  a  little  unclear  to  me. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS: 

 

   

We  think  the  defendant  has 

 

 

 

 

been  hurt  in  the  constitutional  sense  because  the  way 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  court  has  defined  the  right  in  question  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  not  to  be  subject  to  a  test  of  political 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

affiliation  when  it's  not  a  reasonable  job  requirement. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

said  in  ­­

MS.  ANDERS:  And  I  do  think  what  the  Court

MS.  ANDERS:  What  the  Court  said  in  O'Hare, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially,  was  that  ­­ we're  not  necessarily  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  a  separate  right  not  to  be  subject  to  probing  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beliefs,  but  I  think  the  Court  was  suggesting  that  we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shouldn't  have  First  Amendment  tests,  if  we  can  help  it, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  lead  the  Court  to  have  to  probe  into  a  plaintiff's 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beliefs.  And  that  is  exactly  what  will  happen. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  I  don't  know  why  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

right  isn't  the  right  to  be  free  from  arbitrary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employment  action  based  on  a  mistake.  That's  his 

   

  

 

 

 

 

objection  here.  You  made  a  mistake;  you  thought  I  was, 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

you  know,  being  politically  active.  I  wasn't. 

    

 

 

 

 

              

I  mean,  isn't  ­­ is  there  such  a  right  under 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

New  Jersey  law,  you  can't  be  fired  for  an  arbitrary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reason,  or  you  can't  be  fired  for  a  mistaken  reason? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  I  think  with,  at  least  with 

    

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  some  job  actions,  there  ­­ there  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such  a  right  under  New  Jersey  law,  and  that's  ­­ I'm  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sure  whether  it  would  apply  here,  but  I  think  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gravamen  of  ­­ of  plaintiff's  complaint  here  is  not  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  was  fired  for  an  inaccurate  reason;  it's  that  he  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ he  was  demoted  because  ­­ for  an  improper  purpose, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  perception  that  he  was  engaging  in  protected  First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  activity.  And  ­­

brief,  I  think,  that  ­­ that  the  employer  might  have  had 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  contract­type  policy.  I  think  you  said  we  should 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

remand  to  determine  whether  this  employer  said  nobody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

engages  in  political  activity. 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  I  think  ­­ I  think  if  you 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

rule  for  the  Petitioner  here,  there  would  be  a  remand 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anyway  because  the  Court  hasn't  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Is  it  based  on  the  facts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  till  now  to  think  that  there  was  such  a  policy? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  ANDERS:  Well,  so  there  ­­ there  is,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  a  factual  dispute  about  this.  So  if  you  look  at 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  summary  judgment  filings,  this  is  document 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

No.  189  on  Pacer,  there  ­­ there  are,  in  ­­ in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondents'  statement  of  undisputed  facts,  some 

 

 

 

 

 

assertions  that  this  was  in  fact  a  neutrality  policy. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now  you  definitely  have  a  dispute  about  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

coming  back  from  the  other  side.  Petitioner  says  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nobody  knew  about  that  policy.  So  we  think  that  is  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing  that  potentially  the  lower  courts  would  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

look  at,  decide  whether  it  was  preserved  and  ­­ and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

resolve  the  dispute  in  that  sense. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I  do  want  to  get  back  to  another  concern 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  I  think  Respondents'  position  raises.  You  know,  we 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

do  think  that  ­­ that  Petitioner  has  his  own  First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  right  here.  That  was  violated.

We  do  think  that  when  an  employer  acts 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  an  employee  based  on  a  mistaken  perception  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  beliefs,  that  creates  exactly  the  same  chilling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

effect  with  which  the  Elrod  cases  are  concerned. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  other  employees  will  know  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  expects  political  orthodoxy  and  will  be  chilled 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  their  ­­ in  their  own  association  as  a  result. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  think  there's  another  concern  here 

   

 

 

 

 

that  deepens  the  chilling  effect,  and  that  is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

logic  of  Respondents'  position  applies  not  only  in  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  honest  mistake,  it  also  applies  in  cases  in  which  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  acts  to  exploit  a  loophole,  essentially. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

You  can  imagine  a  situation  in  which  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

employer  knows  that  some  people  have  engaged  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political  affiliation.  The  employer  wants  to  send  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

message,  and  it  does  that  by  acting  against  the  employee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  thinks  didn't  actually  engage  in  that  association. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

And  so  I  think  that  is  one  of  the  dangers  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respondents'  rule  here,  that  it  will  create  a  loophole. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  what  we  are  saying,  essentially,  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  it's  just  a  narrow  corollary  to  the  Elrod  right 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  Court  has  already  recognized.  When  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  acts  with  the  exact  same  intent  that  ­­ that  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already  impermissible  under  Elrod,  and  it  injures  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee  in  his  employment  as  a  result,  then  the

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Goldstein. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  THOMAS  C.  GOLDSTEIN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

            

The  doctrinal  fight  in  the  briefing  is  over 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  plaintiff  in  a  case  like  this  has  to  assert 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  constitutional  right.  And  I  think  the  questions  so 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

far  have  indicated  an  understanding  that  the  plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  to.  And  the  real  question,  then,  is,  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  actually  a  constitutional  right  here,  one  that  we 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

might  define  in  other  terms,  including  the  one  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy  identified  as  the  right  not  to  have  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political  views  inquired  in. 

 

 

 

            

And  this  is  actually  discussed  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  opinion  in  O'Hare  in  describing  Elrod  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Branti.  And  so  I  want  to  start  there  because  we  have  to 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognize  that  this  right  has  never  been  recognized  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  other  political  association  case  whatsoever.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there's  no  logical  reason  why  it  would  occur

specifically  in  the  public  employment  context,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  unconstitutional  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Can  you  explain, 

  

 

 

 

Mr.  Goldstein,  what  sense  it  would  make  to  say  there  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  people,  the  example  Mr.  Frost  gave.  One  of  them  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  big  supporter  of  Spagnola,  and  he  gets  demoted.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  is  politically  neutral,  and  he  gets  demoted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  employer  thinks  he's  a  supporter  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

rival  mayoral  candidate. 

 

 

            

What  ­­ how  could  you  make  sense  to  a  person 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  ordinary  reason  that  one  of  them,  the  one  who  was  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact  engaging  in  political  activity,  can't  be  demoted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  the  other  one,  who  just  was  innocent,  didn't  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anything? 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  I'm  sorry. 

  

 

 

              

I  have  to  focus  on,  really,  the  precise 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wording  of  your  hypothetical,  but  I  think  you  may 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  have  something  slightly  different  in  mind, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  you  identify  this,  the  second  employee,  one  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  politically  neutral.  And  the  Court  has  said,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  like  Elrod  and  Branti,  that  the  decision  to  remain 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

neutral  ­­ that  is,  I  see  this  candidate,  I  see  that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

candidate.  I'm  going  to  just  not  choose  between  them, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  I  ­­ you  know,  for  any  individual  reason,  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  protected.  That's  a  political  choice.  And  in

your  precise  hypothetical,  both  of  those  employees  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  claim. 

   

            

This  case  is  different,  and  critically 

 

 

 

 

 

different.  The  other  side  has  quite  consciously, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

throughout  the  case,  made  only  two  arguments.  The  first 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  that  he  was  a  supporter  of  Spagnola.  And  he's  given 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

up  on  that. 

 

 

            

And  the  second  is  that  he  had  no  association 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whatsoever.  He  didn't  have  any  more  association  than  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did.  He  was  politically  oblivious. 

  

 

 

 

            

And  so,  Justice  Ginsburg,  if  you  were  to  ask 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

me  that  question,  which  is  what  difference  ­­ what  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  sense  does  it  make?  The  sense  that  it  makes  is  one 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  exercising  a  constitutional  right,  and  one  doesn't  ­­

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  just  to  make  sure  I 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

understand  what  you're  saying,  suppose  there's  somebody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  comes  into  office,  and  it's  a  Democrat.  And  he  says 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  want  as  many  Democrats  as  possible  in  my  office,  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  what  jobs  they're  doing. 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  what  you're  saying  is  he  can't  demote 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  fire  Republicans.  He  can't  remove,  demote,  or  fire 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  who  have  other  political  views,  neither  Democrat 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  Republican.  But  what  he  can  do  is  he  can  get  rid  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

anybody  who  is  just  politically  apathetic. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Is  that  your  view?

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  If  that  was  actually  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

policy,  then  technically,  the  answer  to  your  question  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

yes  under  the  First  Amendment.  And  I'd  like  to  explain 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

why.  I  know  it  sounds  anomalous. 

    

 

 

 

            

The  reason  is  that  those  people  ­­ there  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nothing  in  the  First  Amendment  that  says  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  can't  encourage  people  to  be  politically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

active.  And  that  is  entirely  the  point  of  Elrod  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Branti. 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  So  you  ­­ you  encourage 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  person  to  be  politically  active  and  then  fire  him  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her  because  they're  politically  active  the  wrong  way? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  No,  sir.

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  My  point,  Justice  Kennedy, 

  

 

 

 

 

is  that  he  may  have  a  State  law  right;  he  does  have  a

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Sorry. 

  

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  The  ­­ the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

government  has  a  right  to  compel  him  to  declare  one  way 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  the  other? 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  No  ­­ Justice  Kennedy,  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ that  brings  us  back  to  your  question.  And  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  does  he  have  a  right  not  to  have  an  inquiry  into  his 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political  views.  And  that  is,  of  course,  not  a  right 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  been  recognized  in  any  other  political 

 

 

 

 

 

 

association  context. 

 

            

 

 

When  the  Court  discussed  it  in  O'Hare,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

did  it  in  a  very  specific  and  really  important  way,  and 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  is  it  looked  at  cases  like  Elrod  and  Branti,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  general  policies.  And  what  the  Court  has  said 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there,  is  that  when  it's  a  sweeping  policy,  it's  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary  into  ­­ to  inquire  into  individual  political 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beliefs. 

            

And  what  those  cases  ought  to  be  understood 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  is  applications  of  First  Amendment  overbreadth 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doctrine.

It  is  commonplace  in  First  Amendment  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  if  you  have  a  general  rule,  and  the  general  rule 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  be  unconstitutional  as  applied  to  some  people,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  people  involved  weren't  asserting  First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  rights,  the  policy  can  be  facially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional,  and  we  don't  inquire  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  standing  of  the  plaintiff. 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that's  what  happens  in  Elrod  and  Branti. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  not  necessary  to  inquire  into  the  ­­ each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  employee.  It  is  an  entirely  different  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  See,  I  had  always  thought 

   

  

 

 

 

that  the  ­­ the  idea  behind  those  cases  is  a  different 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one.  That  the  idea  has  to  do  with  why  the  government 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acted.  And  once  we  say  that  the  government  acted  for  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

impermissible  purpose,  which  is  to  ­­ let's  say  in  my 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hypothetical,  get  as  many  Democrats  as  possible  into  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government,  once  we  say  that's  an  impermissible  purpose, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  matters  not  at  all  whether  the  person  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Republican,  an  ­­ an  independent,  or  somebody  who  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

never  thought  about  politics  in  his  life,  because  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  is  acting  in  a  way  that's  wrongful, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

irrespective  of  that. 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  And  we  just  disagree.  It's 

  

  

 

 

 

 

called  an  individual  right,  not  a  government  wrong.  The 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

individual  has  to  be  engaging  in  ­­ whether  it's

expression  or  association,  I  actually  thinks  it's  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

contested,  Justice  Kagan,  any  more  on  the  free  speech 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

side,  that  with  cases  like  Waters,  an  employee  cannot 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bring  a  First  Amendment  free  speech  claim  that  says,  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  I  didn't  actually  engage  in  speech,  but  my 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

employer  thought  I  did.  There  is  no  First  Amendment 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

right  not  to  have  this  individual  inquiry. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  Justice  Kennedy,  remember  that  our 

 

 

 

 

 

position,  in  particular  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  So  does  that  mean  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  can  compel  speech  of  a  person  if  the  person 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

really  just  doesn't  care  one  way  or  the  other? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  No.  It's  a  very  important 

   

  

  

 

 

distinction.  So  let  me  give  a  hypothetical  that  ought 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  hard  for  us,  and  that  is  Heffernan  is  asked  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chief  of  police,  you  know,  do  you  support  the  mayor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He's  completely  agnostic,  and  he  refuses  to  support  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mayor,  and  he's  transferred. 

 

 

 

            

The  decision  not  to  support  or  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

subjected  to  your  hypothetical  is  a  political  choice. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

This  case  was  framed  by  the  plaintiff  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

very  specific  way  on  purpose,  and  that  is  he  disclaimed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any  such  influence,  any  such  pressure,  any  such  choice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  he  was  having  to  make.

question  of  inquiry  is  that  our  position  only  applies  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  party  that  doesn't  claim  anything  other  than  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

politically  apathetic.  So  Justice  Kennedy,  there  is  no 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiry. 

            

 

Justice  Kagan  is  quite  right  that  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  somebody  who  is  an  Independent  or  a  Democrat  or 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Republican,  the  First  Amendment  doesn't  care.  But  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  plaintiff  is  going  to  pursue  a  claim  that  says  I'm 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  engaged  in  association  or  speech,  there  is  nothing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  inquire  into  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Mr.  Goldstein,  let's  take 

  

 

 

 

 

a  Title  VII  case,  and  the  employer  fires  a  woman  because 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  thinks  she's  pregnant.  She  brings  a  sex 

   

  

 

 

 

 

discrimination  case  and  alleges,  well,  I  wasn't 

   

 

 

 

 

pregnant.  I  just  was  gaining  weight. 

    

 

 

 

            

So  she  has  no  sex  discrimination  claim, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then,  because  she  wasn't  pregnant? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Justice  Ginsburg,  the  courts 

  

 

 

 

 

are  divided.  The  position  of  the  EEOC  is  that  she  would 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  claim.  I  just  think  it's  a  good  point  for  us 

    

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

that  Congress  can  write  laws  that  recognize  such, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

regarded  as  claims. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Those  ­­ those  statutes 

  

 

 

 

 

focus  on  the  employer.  The  employer  cannot  discriminate

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  And  that  employer  was  doing 

  

 

 

 

 

 

The  First  Amendment  does  not  focus  on  the

government;  it  focuses  on  the  citizen.  The  citizen  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  right  to  free  speech  and  free  association. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  So  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  That's  the  difference 

  

 

 

 

between  the  two  cases. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Well,  it  will  not  surprise 

  

 

 

 

 

 

you  that  I  agree,  Justice  Scalia. 

   

 

 

 

            

The  ­­ Justice  Kagan,  if  ­­ if  we  could  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  this  outside  the  public  employment  context.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  reason  I  want  to  do  that  is  that  we  ought  to  be  able 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  agree  that  the  First  Amendment  rights  aren't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

greater  association  of  rights  there.  The  Court  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

pointed  out  that  there  is  a  greater  Federalism  interest 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  managing  the  public  employment  workforce,  and  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  this  is  an  unconstitutional  conditions  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  just  imagine  the  following  simple  ­­ you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

know,  hypotheticals  that  relate  just  to  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Imagine  that  the  chief  of  police,  with  the  same 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motivation,  went  up  to  Heffernan  as  he  went  to  pick  up

the  sign,  grabbed  the  sign,  and  tore  it  up.  Or  imagine 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  Heffernan  was  trying  ­­ was  stopped  from  entering  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parade  in  favor  of  Spagnola,  but  what  he  was  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

trying  to  do  was  just  cross  the  street.  Or  he  went  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  building  where  it  is  that  Spagnola  had  the  ­­ his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

headquarters,  and  the  chief  of  police  stopped  him  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  in,  but  he  was  actually  going  to  his  lawyer's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office. 

            

 

 

 

Those  are  all  the  exact  same  motivation. 

 

 

 

And  there  ­­ I  don't  think  there's  any  way  the  Court 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  recognize  such  a  claim. 

   

 

 

            

It's  a  very  sympathetic  claim.  Okay?  I  get 

    

   

  

 

 

the  fact  that  we  are  very  concerned  that  public 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees  not  be  transferred  or  demoted,  but  we  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  laws  and  other  regimes  that  are  ­­ that  fill  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gap. 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  What  is  ­­ what  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  law  here?  What  ­­ what  relief  does  he  have? 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  He  has  two  forms  of  relief. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  first  is  the  collective  bargaining 

 

 

 

 

 

agreement.  I  will  tell  you  that  it  is  not  in  the 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record,  but  it  is  judicially  noticeable.  It  is  a  public 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

document.  It's  available  on  the  government  Web  sites  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  State  of  New  Jersey,  and  it  is  exactly  what  you

interest,  Justice  Kennedy.  I'm  not  saying  that.  We  are 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

concerned  that  people  be  able  to  have  conscience,  that

context  in  which  there  is  a  real  concern  that  I  would 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

like  to  talk  about,  about  whether  it  will  interfere  with

Now  the  reason  you  ought  to  be  concerned, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy,  is  there  is  another  side  of  the  coin. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Take  it  from  the  perspective  of  the  supervisor.  If  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  is  recognized,  which  is  to  say  the  plaintiff  need 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  have  engaged  in  any  association,  then  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supervisor's  expression  of  political  views  may  well  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

chilled  because  he  has  to  worry  that  any  employee  can 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say,  look,  I  was  regarded  as  politically  active. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  I  could  just  give  you  this  case  again, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  that  is,  take  the  sign  out  of  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  plaintiff  says  he  was  well  known  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Spagnola  friend  and  supporter.  Okay?  Imagine  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that's  discussed  in  the  chief  of  police's  office,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  chief  of  police  thinks  that  ­­ that  Heffernan  really 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

should  be  transferred.  Okay?  The  chief  ­­ if  the

Petitioner  is  right,  he  really  has  to  worry  because  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  discussed,  then  there's  every  reason  that  Heffernan 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  just  bring  a  lawsuit  saying,  look,  I  wasn't  actually 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

involved  in  the  campaign,  but  you  did  it  because  he  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

my  friend.  And  that  is  a  very  significant  consequence 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

for  the  individual  rights. 

 

 

 

            

Now,  if  we  didn't  have  other  protections 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  get  to  the  concern  about  conscience,  I  could  see 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  case  being  even  stronger. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  We  know  that  you  can't  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

let's  assume  in  this  particular  position  you  can't  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fired  because  you're  a  Republican  or  a  Democrat  and 

   

   

 

 

 

 

that's  what  they  ­­ that's  what  ­­ what  they  do.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  ­­ the  person  did  not  engage  in  that  activity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

He's  still  ­­ he  still  is  in  the  position  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  ascribing  to  him  a  political  belief  that  he 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  have. 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Justice  Kennedy,  that's 

  

 

 

 

right.  The  government  thinks  a  lot  of  things  about  me, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

okay?  Some  of  them  are  not  very  nice,  I  imagine,  but  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  some  are  about  my  politics  and  that  sort  of  thing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But  there  is  not  a  constitutional  right  to  have  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  not  think  something  about  you.  Just  remember

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Or  to  act, 

  

  

 

 

 

Justice  Kennedy. 

 

            

            

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  It's  not  just  something. 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Oh. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  It's  ­­ the  government  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

taking  action  against  a  person  because  the  government 

   

 

 

 

 

 

thinks  that  that  person  is  exercising  First  Amendment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights. 

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Just  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  I  thought  ­­ and 

   

  

 

 

 

unlike  Justice  Scalia  ­­ that  the  thrust  of  the  First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  is  operating  on  government.  It  says 

  

 

 

 

 

 

government,  thou  shalt  not  ­­ thou  shalt  not  act  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  of  someone's  expression,  speech  or  belief. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Well,  essentially  all  of  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

rights,  individual  rights  in  the  Constitution,  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

than  the  antislavery  provision,  requires  State  action. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  all  talk  about  what  the  government  can't  do.  But 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Yes,  so  here,  the 

  

 

 

 

 

government  acted.  No  question  they  demoted  the  person. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  was  a  detective,  and  they  put  him  back  on  the  beat. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  the  government  acted.  Why  did  they  act?  Because 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  thought  that  this  person  was  engaging  in  political

activity. 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Well,  Justice  Ginsburg,  let 

  

 

 

 

 

me  just  say  that  I  don't  think  it's  ­­ it's  contested 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  the  Petitioner's  reply  brief.  You  described  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  First  Amendment  terms,  that  if  this  was  a  speech 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  which  it  used  to  be,  rather  than  an  association 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  he  would  lose.  It  is  well  settled  in  this  Court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

precedents  that  the  threshold  inquiry  under  Pickering  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

did  the  individual  engage  in  the  constitutionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

protected  activity? 

 

            

This  actually  is  at  issue,  I  should  say,  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court's  other  associational  case,  public  employment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

association  case,  this  sitting,  where  there  is  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant  issue  of  is  there  a  different  rule  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

applies  ­­ when  we're  talking  about  a  policy,  Justice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kennedy  ­­ that  applies  broadly  to  a  lot  of  employees 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

versus  an  individual,  one­off  employment  action  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  is  at  issue  here? 

 

 

 

 

            

We  think  that's  a  critically  important 

   

 

 

 

distinction,  whether  you  look  at  this  as  kind  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pickering  standard  case,  where  the  first  thing  that  has 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  happen  is  that  the  individual  has  to  assert  at  least 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  engaged  in  the  constitutionally  protected 

 

 

 

 

 

 

activity.  If  you  have  an  Elrod  and  Branti­type  case,

an  entirely  different  kettle  of  fish  because  there,  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

do  have  a  general  policy.  You  could  see  people  being 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

chilled.  You  could  see  the  government  taking  a  broad 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

view  of  its  employees. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  I  guess  I'm  not  sure  how 

    

 

 

 

 

 

that  works.  It  just  seems  to  break  down  very  easily,  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  can't  have  a  broad  rule  that  says  that  you  can  fire 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

everybody  but  Democrats.  But  you're  saying  that  you  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  allow  somebody  to  come  in  and  fire  people  one 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  a  time. 

   

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Justice  Kagan,  that's,  of 

  

 

 

 

 

course,  not  what  I'm  saying.  What  I'm  saying  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  First  Amendment  Overbreadth  Doctrine,  when  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  a  general  policy  ­­ and  this  is  what  we  think 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened  in  Elrod  and  Branti  ­­ the  fact  that  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

don't  ­­ you  do  not  inquire  into  the  individual  person's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political  views  because  the  policy  is  facially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

unconstitutional.  But  it  has  never  been  the  case  in  any 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

context. 

            

And  the  other  side  has  had  every  opportunity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  world.  We  cannot  find  any  First  Amendment  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  says,  you  know  what?  You  don't  have  to  engage  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutionally  protected  activity  so  long  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  thinks  you  did.  And  it's  really  a  problem  if 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  the  rule  because  it  is  the  threshold  thing  that

I  can  come  into  an  office  ­­ I'm  a  Democrat.  I  can  ­­ I 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

can  identify  every  person  without  a  well­known  political 

   

 

 

 

 

 

view,  every  couch  potato  out  there,  just  fire  one  after 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

another,  after  another,  after  another.  Replace  them  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  Democrats,  change  the  entire  character  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

office,  do  it  for  a  reason  that  I  prefer  one  political 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

view  to  any  other,  and  that  that  will  not  be  a  violation 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  First  Amendment. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  That  will  ­­ two  things. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

First,  I  think  it  is  practically  impossible  because  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  to  somehow  magically  pluck  out  the  people  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  politically  apathetic  from  those  that  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

politically  neutral.  I  just  don't  think  you  can  do  it. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  second  is  that's  right.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Constitution  doesn't  fix  everything. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KENNEDY:  You  want  this  Court  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

hold  that  the  government  of  the  United  States  has  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

right  to  ascribe  to  a  citizen  views  that  he  or  she  does

think  the  other  side  thinks  it's  a  First  Amendment 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

violation.  Remember  that  there's  the  materiality 

  

 

 

 

 

requirement. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  See,  I  had  always  thought 

   

  

 

 

 

that  the  First  Amendment  running  through  all  our  cases 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is  an  extremely  strong  strand.  That  part  of  the  reason 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  have  these  protections  is  because  we  worry  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  is  doing  things  for  impermissible  reasons. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

That  the  government  wants  to  create  a  world  of  speech  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  everybody  agrees  with  it  and  nobody  opposes  it. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that's  a  fundamental  tenet  of  what  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

First  Amendment  and  all  our  cases  are  about.  And  you're 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

saying,  oh,  no.  The  government's  motive  doesn't  really 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

matter  as  long  as  you  can't  point  to  somebody  who  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

holding  up  a  sign. 

   

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Justice  Kagan,  I  think  you 

   

  

 

 

 

are  right.  It  is  an  important  thread  of  this  Court's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decisions.  And  the  Court  has  said  that  it  is  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary  but  not  sufficient  condition.  Waters  makes 

  

 

 

 

 

 

very  clear,  which  is  a  First  Amendment  public  employee 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  that  the  individual  has  to  have  engaged  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

constitutionally  protected  activity.  Every  one  of  ­­

action,  and  the  law  never  takes  effect.  And  therefore, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  had  no  impact.  And  that  happens  every  day  of  the

That's  a  serious  question.  I'm  not  taking  a  point  of 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

view.  I  want  to  know  what  you  think. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Justice  Breyer,  the  reason

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Well,  I  just  want  to  know, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

is  it  yes  or  no?  Does  it  ­­ in  your  opinion,  does  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempt  to  ­­ a  clear  attempt  to  violate  the  First 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  in  a  statute?  It  has  general  application. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

Does  it  violate  the  First  Amendment?  Does  it  abridge 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  freedom  of  speech? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  If  it's  only  going  to  be  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attempt  and  it's  not  going  to  succeed,  no.  The  statute 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you  describe  is  unconstitutional. 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  is  unconstitutional. 

  

 

 

 

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  That's  right.  There  are  all 

  

  

 

 

 

 

kinds  of  times  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  It  will  have  a  lot  of  bad 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

effects.  It  will  have  all  kinds  of  chilling  effects  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

over  the  place. 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  If  it's  defined,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

 

Breyer,  as  not  going  to  succeed,  if  the  statute  doesn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

say  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  No,  no,  by  chance  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

happens  not  to  succeed.

JUSTICE  BREYER:  Of  course.  And  I'm  just

Congress  at  the  same  time  passed  a  law  that  said  no 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  funds  shall  be  used  to  implement  the  ban  on

unconstitutional. 

            

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Or  ­­ or  you  could  say  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  law  is  passed  by  Congress  but  vetoed  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

President,  is  there  a  violation  of  the  Constitution?

my  hypothetical  vote  in  which  ­­ or  Justice  Breyer's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  it  actually  goes  into  effect  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  We're  off  on  a  tangent 

   

  

 

 

 

because  there's  no  injury  in  this  situation  when  the  law 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  go  into  effect.  But  coming  back  to  what 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Breyer,  I  believe,  is  attempting  to  say  ­­

Mr.  Goldstein,  that  I  understand  either.  And  I  think 

   

   

  

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan  asked  you  this.  Why  does  it  matter  ­­ and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we  don't  care  whether  someone  is  a  Republican  or  not  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Elrod  and  Branti  and  those  cases  ­­ and  you  say  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  because  it's  a  policy.  The  intent  of  the 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

government  is  to  say  I'm  not  going  to  promote  anybody 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

who  is  not  a  Democrat  or  not  a  Republican.

exercise  their  constitutional  rights.

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah.

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  No.  No.  Common  sense  does

important  point  on  the  question  of  chilling  because 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Elrod  and  Branti  and  the  rules  that  also  ­­ and  O'Hare,

So  that  we  all  agree  that  if  the  plaintiff 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

here  was  a  supporter  of  Spagnola,  or  even  of  the  mayor,

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  No.  But  I  do  think  that 

   

  

  

 

 

 

there  is  a  concern  that  comes  into  play.  And  so  I  do 

   

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  mean  to  demean  the  concern  about  the  government 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having  a  sense  of  what  individuals'  political  views  are. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  I'm  saying  that  that  happens,  Your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honors,  in  all  kinds  of  cases,  whether  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

redistricting,  whether  it's  campaign  finance.  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

lots  that  we  do  to  ascribe  political  views  to  people  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  country.  And  adopting  that  doctrine  is  going  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  pretty  widespread  consequences  when  it's  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

necessary. 

              

I  do  think  that  it  should  be  common  ground 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  there  are  multiple  layers  of  protections  for  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees.  The  basic  rule  ­­ and  Justice  Kennedy, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

remember,  under  the  basic  rule,  the  plaintiff  has  always 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

come  in  and  said,  I'm  a  Democrat,  right?  The  Elrod 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Branti  rule  when  it's  involved,  one­off  cases.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

opinion  in  O'Hare  describes  the  political  views  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tow  truck  company  there.  And  it  has  never  been  regarded 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as  a  First  Amendment  problem  when  you  don't  actually 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise  any  First  Amendment  rights. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  But  that  is  a  First 

   

  

 

 

 

Amendment  problem  for  the  reason  that  lots  of  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

people  will  have  their  speech  chilled.  And  normally  in

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  Do  you  know  of  any  case  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  we  have  relied  on  chilling  effects  where  what  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  issue  was  a  one­off  like  this  one  as  opposed  to  a  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  general  policy  which  had  a  chilling  effect?  I  don't 

    

   

 

 

 

 

 

know  of  any  case. 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  To  the  contrary,  I  can  tell 

   

  

 

 

 

 

you  that  in  ­­ in  both  Waters  and  Garcetti  v.  Ceballos, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Court  said,  look,  we  recognize  the  rule  that's  being 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposed  to  us.  So  in  Waters  it  was  the  idea  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  ­­ the  employer's  views  wouldn't  matter;  it  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  be  whether  the  speech  was  protected. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

 

In  Garcetti  it  was  the  question  of  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  was  the  public  employer's  speech.  And  the  public 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employee's  argument  in  both  those  cases  is  that,  look, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  rules  are  going  to  chill  speech  because  they  are 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  uncertain  boundaries.  We  need  to  have  wide­ranging 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

expression.  If  I  have  to  bring  my  case,  there  will  be 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inquiries  into  my  speech  views  or  whatever,  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court  said  we  just  have  to  balance  things  here. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

There  is  a  real  concern  that  is  rooted  in  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

history  of  the  United  States  involving  political 

 

 

 

 

 

 

patronage.  We  have  ­­ the  Court  has  never  tried  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extinguish  politics  from  local  government.  And  if  you 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

try  to  do  that  in  New  Jersey,  we  are  going  to  be  here  a

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  And  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  And  the  question  in  this 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case  seems  to  me  to  be  highly  artificial.  It's  sort  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

­­ it's  like  a  law  school  hypothetical. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  I  agree. 

    

 

JUSTICE  ALITO:  How  often  will  it  be  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  that  an  employee  will  be  unable  to  allege  any 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expression  or  any  association  that  is  protected  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  ­­ the  First  Amendment?  It  seems  to  me  quite  rare. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  it  may  be  that  this  case  comes  to  us  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

way  it  does  because  the  plaintiff  was  dealing  with  two 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

things,  one  was  the  First  Amendment,  and  the  other  ­­ I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mean  one  was  the  issue  that's  ­­ the  question  of  his 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

motivation,  and  the  other  was  this  alleged  policy 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prohibiting  any  kind  of  political  activity. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Even  in  the  ­­ the  person  who  is  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apathetic,  is  there  not  a  ­­ a  First  Amendment  right  to 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  ­­ say,  I  don't  ­­ I  don't  like  politics,  I  don't 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

want  anything  to  do  with  politics,  I'm  not  going  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

register,  I'm  not  going  to  vote? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  All  right.  So  Justice 

  

  

 

 

 

Alito,  the  Third  Circuit  has  a  rule  discussed  in  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brief  ­­ brief  in  opposition  adopted  in  a  case  called 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ghaly  that  says  you  do  have  the  right  to  be  politically

apathetic.  The  reason  the  case  is  so  bizarre  is  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  other  side,  for  its  own  reasons,  decided  not  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assert  that  right. 

 

 

            

Now,  I  will  say  that  it  does  nonetheless 

   

 

 

 

 

 

matter  because  there  are  going  to  be  other  kinds  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases  where  you  have  a  public  employee  that  just  is  not 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

asserting  any  rights  at  all,  and  is  not  involved,  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  environmentalism  or  gun  rights  or  whatever.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

public  employer,  if  it's  thought  just  to  have  perceived 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  employee  as  having  been  involved  in  some 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

association,  then  is  subject  to  a  claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

            

            

And  our  real  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  sorry.  You  have 

  

  

 

 

 

to  ­­ you  have  to  show  some  facts  to  draw  that

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  mean,  you  just  can't 

    

 

 

 

 

say,  I'm  involved  in  this  and  the  employer  fired  me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  of  that. 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Well,  Justice  Sotomayor  ­­

between  the  firing  and  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  Right.

to  my  hypothetical  of  getting  rid  of  the  sign.  And  his 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political  view  ­­ his  support  of  Spagnola  is  discussed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ in  the  chief's  office,  right?  And  then  he  has  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  reassigned.  And  the  chief  has  to  really  worry  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he's  going  to  be  sued. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  ­­ my  point  is  this:  The  set  of  cases 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  you  have  to  be  concerned  with,  there  have  been  no 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  cases  we've  been  able  to  identify  like  this  one. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It's  very  small. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well  ­­

  

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  But  the  downside  risk  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

significant. 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Mr.  Goldstein,  I  mean,  if 

   

  

 

 

 

somebody  had  come  in  to  me  before  today's  argument  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  said,  does  the  First  Amendment  prevent  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  from  punishing  a  person  because  that  person 

   

 

 

 

 

 

does  not  share  the  government's  views,  I  would  have 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

said,  why,  yes,  of  course  the  First  Amendment  protects 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that.  That's  the  whole  point  of  the  First  Amendment. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  now  you're  telling  me,  no,  the  First 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Amendment  does  not  prevent  the  government  from  punishing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  person  because  that  person  doesn't  share  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  views,  unless  that  person  is  actively 

 

 

 

 

 

 

opposed  to  the  government's  views. 

 

 

 

 

            

But  if  that  person  just  really  could  not

care  less,  which  a  lot  of  people  in  this  country  could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  care  less;  they  don't  vote,  they  don't  pay 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attention,  they  wouldn't  know  who  was  running.  But  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government  can  punish  that  person  because  that  person 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doesn't  share  the  government's  views.  And  I  would  have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

said,  that  is  one  strange  doctrine. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  It  ­­ it  may  be  that  I  have 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  persuaded  you  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

(Laughter.) 

            

MR.  GOLDSTEIN:  The  ­­ the  ­­ I  will  say, 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Kagan,  what  you  ask  is,  can  the  government  do 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it?  The  government  cannot  because  there  are  lots  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  protections.  And  remember,  if  the  person  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

politically  neutral,  it  is  the  case  that  ­­ the  right  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

political  association  is  the  right  of  political 

 

 

 

 

 

 

association.  If  you  aren't  engaging  it,  you  aren't 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

actively  pursuing  the  right  in  any  way,  or  even  if  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

aren't  active  about  it.

If  Heffernan  was  engaged  in  political 

 

 

 

 

activity  and  said,  I'm  supporting  Spagnola,  of  course  he 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  protected  by  the  First  Amendment.  What  I'm 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

hearing  is  that  if  he  said,  I'm  neutral,  he  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

covered;  he  would  be  protected.  I  see  little  difference 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

between  being  a  neutral  and  being  agnostic  in  the  sense 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  I'm  not  taking  a  position. 

   

 

 

 

            

            

So  ­­ so  ­­

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  ­­ I'm  so  totally 

  

 

 

 

 

 

confused.  I  know  it's  the  way  it  was  presented  to  us, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  I  thought  he  testified  that  he  had  made  a  choice  not 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  get  involved  in  the  campaign  but  that  Spagnola  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  friend  and  he  supported  him.  So  he  wasn't  neutral; 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

he  just  wasn't  engaging  in  associational  conduct  by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

choice.  That's  what  I  thought. 

   

  

 

            

MR.  FROST:  That's  correct,  Justice 

  

 

 

 

Sotomayor.  And  the  point  that  I  was  trying  to  make  was 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  fact  that  in  this  case  he  was  not  going  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercising  his  right  to  vote  or  campaign  for  him,  but  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  clearly  he  engaged  in  what  we  would  consider  core 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

First  Amendment  activity  by  picking  up  that  sign. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  mistake  that  the  employer  made  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

actually  one  that  they  perceived  him  as  actually 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

campaigning  on  behalf  of  Spagnola.  And  that  should  make 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

no  difference  for  the  simple  reason  that  with  respect  to
