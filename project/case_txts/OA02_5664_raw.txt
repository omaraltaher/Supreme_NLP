CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in Number 02-5664, Charles Thomas Sell v. The United


States.


Mr. Short.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY A. SHORT


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. SHORT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


On Friday, this Court entered its order stating


that counsel should be prepared to discuss the


jurisdiction of this Court and of the court of appeals,


and cited the Cohen v. Beneficial case, and they --


QUESTION: 


Mr. Short, did that subject 

jurisdiction come up when you were in the court of


appeals?


MR. SHORT:  It did not come up in the court of


appeals, Justice O'Connor.


In the first --


QUESTION:  It is interlocutory?


MR. SHORT:  It's a decision from -- it's a final


decision under the collateral order doctrine.


QUESTION:  Well, that's the issue.  Is it?


MR. SHORT:  That's the issue, I believe, yes.

 QUESTION:  No trial has taken place?


MR. SHORT:  No trial has taken place, not at


all.


I -- I believe that this Court, of course, has


jurisdiction pursuant to section 1254 because it granted a


writ of certiorari to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. 


The court of appeals had jurisdiction pursuant to section


1291, providing for appeal of final decisions of the


district courts.  I believe this was a final decision


pursuant to the Cohen collateral final order doctrine.


Now, while this Court has not addressed the


collateral order doctrine under these set of facts, the


courts of appeals that have, have unanimously concluded


that an order approving the involuntary medication of a 


pretrial detainee constitutes an appealable order under 

Cohen, and these cases are set forth in footnote 5, page


10 of the Government's brief.


In order to fall within the collateral order


doctrine, the order must satisfy several requirements.  It


must conclusively determine the dispute question, it must


resolve an important issue completely and separate from


the merits of the underlying action, and it must be


effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final


judgment.


QUESTION:  Well, that's the question.  Would --

if it -- if we did not think there were jurisdiction, then


at the end of the day, if the defendant were tried, I


suppose that issue could be raised then.


MR. SHORT:  Except by that time, Justice


O'Connor, his rights will have already been infringed.  He


will not be able to become unmedicated.


QUESTION:  Well, but that's not the point.  The


point is whether the third requirement has been met, that


it is effectively nonreviewable unless it's reviewed this


way.  It seems to me it is reviewable.


QUESTION:  We held that in Riggins.


MR. SHORT:  Riggins -- Riggins was looking at a


post conviction case, however, and looking only to see if


his trial rights had been violated.


QUESTION: 


Perhaps it depends on whether we're 

talking about the right to avoid medication, as opposed to


the right to avoid medication for purposes of trial, and


the latter would give you maybe somewhat more difficulty


under prong 3, whereas the former, the right can only be


vindicated by treating this as a final order.  Would you


accept that, or would you say that it's final even if what


you're talking about is the right to avoid medication for


purposes of standing trial?


MR. SHORT:  I would say on all three it would. 


Certainly under -- under the First and the Fifth

Amendments, whatever rights he would have would have been


infringed irreparably once he's medicated.


QUESTION:  Well, are there -- are there no ways


to challenge that, except in the context of the criminal


prosecution?  I mean, if -- if you had objections to being


medicated, whether for purposes of, of making your client


capable of standing trial or not, if you had objections to


being medicated, why couldn't those objections be brought


under section 1983 or in some civil action?


MR. SHORT:  My reflections on that, Justice


Scalia, is, it would probably be too late.  By the time we


brought any type of other action, I believe the Government


would have proceeded in the criminal case and gone ahead


with the order and had him medicated.


I also see filing such an action with another 

district court, for example, having it defer to the court


in which the criminal action was pending, I think there's


some -- I think there's some procedural problems with, by


the time that was done, Dr. Sell may have already been


medicated, and of course -- we will address these issues


hopefully in our briefs that are due, that are due Friday.


QUESTION:  What concerns me is, you know, the


Cohen doctrine is over half a century old.


MR. SHORT:  Yes, sir.


QUESTION:  It has no rooting in the text.  The

text of Congress' statute is quite absolute.  We have made


in that half a century only three exceptions under the,


under the Cohen doctrine, and I'm truly concerned about,


about the extent to which this new exception would, would


be available to disrupt criminal trials considerably.  For


example, a defendant, instead of challenging the, the


order initially can, can half-way through trial decide he


does not want any medication, and then the trial has to be


postponed so that, so that the order to continue the


medication can be appealed.  I just see real difficulties


in running a criminal justice system when, when this kind


of an order is immediately appealable, rather than


reviewable at the end of the criminal case.


MR. SHORT:  Again, Justice Scalia, all I can say


is, I think by the time that would be reviewed, filed, and 

considered, I'm afraid Dr. Sell will have been medicated,


and again we've already, of course --


QUESTION:  Well, that's perfectly true, but I


think the hypothesis offered by Justice Scalia, at least


as I understand it, is that even if that's the case,


perhaps he has to wait till the end of the criminal trial


in order to appeal it because our policy against piecemeal


appeals in criminal cases has been so strict.


MR. SHORT:  I do -- I do understand that, but --


and again, I think this is unreviewable.

 QUESTION:  Do you -- do you equate it to bail,


bail pending trial?  If it's denied, and the trial goes


on, you can't get it back again once the trial is over.


Is -- is that your point, with respect to once -- once


he's drugged he can't be --


MR. SHORT:  Once --


QUESTION:  -- restored?


MR. SHORT:  It's a simple statement, but once


he's medicated he can't be unmedicated.


QUESTION:  I think you're confusing unreviewable


with irreversible.  To be sure, it can't be reversed, but


can it be reviewed?  In the case of bail, it can't be


reviewed, because once the trial is over, it's a moot


question.  It cannot be reviewed.  It's not just that it


can't be reversed, it cannot be reviewed.


But you're here asserting that this issue cannot


be reviewed.  It seems to me that's just patently false. 


It can be reviewed.  Your complaint is that it can't be


reversed, but that has never been the, the Cohen


criterion.


MR. SHORT:  My view, Justice Scalia, is it 


can't be effectively reviewed.  Once he's medicated with


these drugs, whatever changes take place, these drugs are


meant to cause changes to take place.  That's the purpose


of giving him these drugs.  In effect, the decision will

have been made, his mind will have been altered, in


whatever segment that is altered, and that cannot be


undone.


QUESTION:  That is his -- if that is his


objection, and if his objection is not that my criminal


trial will be distorted, he should bring a separate civil


action and perhaps the court would stay the criminal


action until that one is, until that civil action is


determined, but it's an entirely different procedure to


come in in the criminal case and seek an interlocutory


appeal from that order, and I just don't --


QUESTION:  May I ask a question about the


back -- about the background order?  Isn't it correct that


in this case the Bureau of Prisons got an order


authorizing them to medicate your, your client? 

MR. SHORT:  Justice Stevens, that is correct.


QUESTION:  And then you got a stay of that


order?


MR. SHORT:  Yeah.  There was appeal -- there was


an appeal of that order, and then we filed a motion with


the magistrate judge to have a hearing as to whether or


not, as to the propriety of whether or not he should be


medicated, yes.  That's -- that's the


procedural standpoint --


QUESTION:  But to pursue Justice Stevens'

question, that order was in the context of this criminal


case.


MR. SHORT:  Yes, it was.


QUESTION:  Yes.


QUESTION:  The Bureau of Prisons order was in


the context of this criminal case?  I -- I thought that


they ordered him to be medicated before -- before the


trial was -- was on the horizon.  Is that --


MR. SHORT:  He was -- he was sent to the


Springfield Medical Center after being found incompetent


under section 4241, in order to be treated to see if he


could be restored to competency.


QUESTION:  You're going to brief this issue, so


perhaps we ought to, since your time is running out, hear


something on the merits of your --


MR. SHORT:  Very well.


QUESTION:  -- case.


MR. SHORT:  Very well.


The individual, of course, we are talking about


today is Charles Thomas Sell.  He's a dentist.  He is a


pretrial detainee.  He has not been convicted of any


crime.  In his present setting, he is neither dangerous to


himself, nor is he dangerous to others.  The Government


wishes to medicate Dr. Sell.


QUESTION:  Is that a finding we have from the

lower courts, that he is not dangerous to himself or


others?


MR. SHORT:  Yes, it is, Justice O'Connor.  The


district court made that finding, and -- and --


essentially reversing the magistrate court, and the


appellate court affirmed the district court's finding that


he was not dangerous.


The Government wants to forcibly administer to


Dr. Sell antipsychotic drugs solely on the chance that it


can, that it can bring him to trial on insurance fraud


charges, nonviolent crimes.  Dr. Sell does not want to be


forcibly medicated.  In his own words, he said, I do not


want my chemistry altered.  My brain is working fine.


Now, Dr. Sell is legally incompetent.  He


suffers from a rare mental disorder called delusional 

disorder, persecutory type.  This is not schizophrenia. 


The main feature of this disorder is nonbizarre delusions. 


In other words, thoughts that are plausible, thoughts that


can conceivably come true, probably won't.  In Dr. Sell's


case, he believes the FBI is out to discredit or harm him. 


Excuse me.


QUESTION:  As I take it, that's try -- that is


tied into the competence to stand trial because he thinks


that's why he is being prosecuted, is that it, that the


FBI is behind this?

delusion.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. SHORT:  That's part of -- that's part of the


But another feature of this disorder is that


apart from the direct impact of the delusions,


psychosocial functioning is not markedly, markedly


impaired, nor is the behavior odd, which means that his


disorder only affects him in a narrow, a very narrow band,


but the rest -- most of his life he can perform as a


normal person would, function in a normal manner, and as a


matter of fact --


QUESTION:  Then he should be able to stand


trial.


MR. SHORT:  The problem --


QUESTION:  If he's so normal.


MR. SHORT:  The problem, Justice Scalia, is,


because of his delusion he can't focus on the trial --


QUESTION:  I see.


MR. SHORT:  -- on anything else other than the


FBI.


QUESTION:  Well, what is your solution for this


dilemma?  We cannot try him for the crime that he's


accused of, because his mind is not working properly.  He

is entitled to refuse, you say, drugs that would cause his


mind to work properly.  It's a vicious -- what -- what do


we do with him?  Do we continue to hold him with the


inability to stand trial, not treat him, because he


refuses treatment?  I -- it's just a crazy situation. 


What can be done about it?


MR. SHORT:  Your Honor, our -- because we feel


that he is a) medically competent -- no one has ever


contended that Dr. Sell is not medically competent.  Dr.


Sell is perfectly able to make his own health care


decisions, and make his own decisions about his mind and


his body, and he has made the decision --


QUESTION:  But he's legally incompetent, you


say --


MR. SHORT: 


He's legally incompetent --

QUESTION:  -- to stand trial.


MR. SHORT:  Yes, but he's not mentally


incompetent.


QUESTION:  And is there a finding below that


medication will -- there's a substantial probability he


would be restored to competence if there were medication?


MR. SHORT:  The standard's changed somewhat, but


the answer is essentially yes.


QUESTION:  And is there a finding that no less


intrusive alternative is available to restore him to

competence?


MR. SHORT:  Yes, there was such a finding.


QUESTION:  And that the medication is medically


appropriate?


MR. SHORT:  Yes, there was --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. SHORT:  There was --


QUESTION:  And even under those circumstances,


you assert that there can be no medication?


MR. SHORT:  Yes.  That is -- that is my


position.


QUESTION:  And what is your general principle of


law that justifies your position?


MR. SHORT:  First of all, since he is medically


competent, he can make decisions about his own person and 

body.


QUESTION:  I thought that you might have gone


further in your case, and to say the Government just has


no right to put needles into pretrial detainees?


MR. SHORT:  Well, on a -- at a basic level that


is, that is what -- we have a -- we have a nondangerous --


QUESTION:  I mean, they can make the defendant


wear a hat, put on clothes, give a voice exempt bar.  This


is somehow different.  It seems to me at least that

 MR. SHORT:  This is --


QUESTION:  You don't exactly argue that.


MR. SHORT:  This is very different, Your Honor. 


We are dealing with a person who has been merely accused


of a crime.  He is medically competent.  He is


nondangerous.


QUESTION:  Well, you say he's nondangerous.  He


was later charged with attempted murder, wasn't he?


MR. SHORT:  He was charged with that offense,


yes.


QUESTION:  He doesn't sound nondangerous.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  So what are we supposed to do, just


do this on the hypothetical basis that he isn't, although


maybe he is?


MR. SHORT:  No, Justice Breyer, not at all.  The


nondangerousness --


QUESTION:  He didn't -- he did --


MR. SHORT:  The only -- the only times -- as I


read the cases, pretrial detainees -- these are civilly


committed people -- can be medically administered


antipsychotic drugs is if they are in the prison setting


and they are dangerous to themselves --


QUESTION:  So a person who's in a mental


hospital, civilly committed, and he's dangerous, going to

commit suicide or possibly kill someone, that the doctors


in that civil setting are forbidden to administer


psychotic drugs?  That's not my understanding.  Is that --


MR. SHORT:  Maybe I -- maybe I --


QUESTION:  -- what you're saying?


MR. SHORT:  Maybe I misstated --


QUESTION:  All right, but -- so -- but my


question on this case is the following.  I take it you


say, to follow the psychological association's standards,


one, the court did consider whether any nondrug therapy


could restore him to competence, and it answered the


question, no.


The court did consider whether there was a


substantial likelihood of success in restoring the


defendant to competence, and they answered, yes. 

The court did consider whether the effectiveness


of the drugs clearly outweighed the risk from side


effects, and it said yes.


It also considered the effects of the Fifth and


Sixth Amendment rights to fair trial, and decided they


weren't enough to change the question, so it seems to me


that once you concede all that, they're following the


right standards. 


So is your claim that we should go and review


because they, although they purported to follow the right

standards they didn't really do it, in other words, going


to the facts of this case, or is your claim that those


standards that your side's amicus says are the right ones,


are not the right ones and, if so, what are?


MR. SHORT:  Our view is that, first of all we


have fundamental rights at stake here, and the Government


must show then, of course, a compelling interest in


overriding those fundamental interests.


QUESTION:  But I would appreciate a direct


answer to my question.


MR. SHORT:  I'm sorry.  Maybe I misunderstood --


QUESTION:  It seems to me, either you have to


say that the psychological association standards are


wrong, or you have to say they're right, and if you say


they're right, then you have to ask us to say they weren't 

applied correctly here, but I want to know if you think


they're the wrong ones, or if you think they're the right


ones.


MR. SHORT:  I'm not sure I understand the


requirements of --


QUESTION:  Well, if you read -- if you'd simply


read the table of contents, as I'm certain you have --


MR. SHORT:  Oh, I have.


QUESTION:  -- of the APA, the psychological


association's brief, filed on your side --

MR. SHORT:  I think essentially those are the


right standards.


QUESTION:  Okay.  If you think those are there


right standards, do you think they were applied here?


MR. SHORT:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Yes, all right.  Then is what you're


asking us to do, since you think they were applied, and


you don't like the answer the court came to, is what


you're asking us to do today is take those standards, look


to see how the court applied them, and come to the


conclusion that they applied them incorrectly, or are you


asking us to do something else?


MR. SHORT:  Essentially --


QUESTION:  I'm just trying to clarify --


MR. SHORT:  Essentially that's it.


QUESTION:  That's it. 


QUESTION:  And I -- I don't know why you concede


that the Government has this right at all.  What gives the


Government the authority to medicate a pretrial detainee


or someone pretrial -- supposing they're not even in, in


custody.  Can they essentially, out with a needle the day


before the trial and say, we're going to get you ready for

trial?


MR. SHORT:  Well, it's very possible then, of


course, I'm not understanding Justice Breyer's contention,


and it's my fault.  I don't concede that they can do this


at all.


QUESTION:  Well then, you think these standards


are wrong.  The standards -- can you come up in your


mind --


MR. SHORT:  I --


QUESTION:  I won't pursue this, but I'm just


trying to clarify what it is you want us to do.  Now, call


into your own mind the standards of the American


Psychological Association. I read that amicus with some


care, I'm very interested, and it seemed to me similar in


principle to the Government's point of view, and I want to 

know, in -- though they may not think they're applied


correctly here, but what -- what -- tell me about it.


MR. SHORT:  I'm sorry, I can't recall their


standards with such preciseness that I can answer that


question.


QUESTION:  Well, I thought, looking at your


brief, that you were asserting that the petitioner has a


right to be free from compelled medication by the


Government, period, per se.  That's the rule.


MR. SHORT:  That is my under -- that is my --

 QUESTION:  Page 26 of your brief.  So you


don't -- you don't go along with any other standards. 


You're saying there is an absolute right to be free from


compelled medication.


MR. SHORT:  That is our position.


QUESTION:  How about -- how about -- how about


vaccinating little children with a needle against


smallpox?  I guess there's no right to do that by the


Government?


MR. SHORT:  Yes, there is a right to do that.


QUESTION:  Oh.


MR. SHORT:  The intrusion there is very minimal,


and I think the Government -- the governmental interest is


obviously to protect it against the spread of whatever


dis --


QUESTION:  And I take it that's pursuant to the


statute, not because some prosecutor thinks it's a good


idea.


MR. SHORT:  That's --


QUESTION:  Then you don't even agree with the


dissenting judge in the court below who said there could


be forcible medication for a violent crime?


MR. SHORT:  I do not -- that's correct, Mr.


Chief Justice.  I do not --

 QUESTION:  Then I wish you'd go back to a


question I asked earlier that I don't think I got an


answer to.  What do you propose that we do with this man? 


He's been accused of a serious crime.  For purposes of


this case you're willing to assume it to be the same if he


had been accused of a violent crime.


MR. SHORT:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  He is -- his mental ability is such


that he cannot be tried.  The means are available to


straighten his mind out so that he is competent to stand


trial, but you say no, if he refuses that, we must respect


his wishes.  Then what do we do with him?  Do we let him


go?


MR. SHORT:  The direct answer to your question,


Justice Scalia, is --


QUESTION:  Is we let him go.


MR. SHORT:  -- is that you do not -- he will not


be let go.


QUESTION:  Why not?


QUESTION:  What happens to him?  You can't keep


him in prison indefinitely.  I had very much the same


question in mind.  As I understand it, and correct me if


I'm wrong, he could not be civilly committed, since he's


been found nondangerous.


MR. SHORT:  That's correct.

 QUESTION:  If he were found dangerous, he could


be civilly committed.  So here he is, nondangerous, but


incompetent to stand trial.  You -- you agree that civil


commitment was -- isn't -- isn't available under those


circumstances?


MR. SHORT:  No, I -- civil commitment is what's


going to happen to this individual under 4241.


QUESTION:  How?  How is he going to be committed


if he's not dangerous?


MR. SHORT:  Because 4241 provides that a person


who can't stand trial because they are legally incompetent


are referred to the sections of 4246.  The director at


that facility, under section 4246, will then have to make


a determination as to whether or not Dr. Sell is a


substantial risk to persons or property of others if --

QUESTION:  And -- and you are telling us -- and


you are telling us, are you not, that he is not a


substantial risk?  That -- that that may not be something


we accept in view of the murder charge, but I mean, on


your theory, you are saying he's not dangerous.


MR. SHORT:  Justice Souter, I'm saying there are


two different standards at --


QUESTION:  No, I realize there are two different


standards, but there's -- if I understand the


representations you have been making to the Court about

your client, under the standard for commitment, if he


cannot be tried, he would not be subject to commitment. 


Am I wrong?


MR. SHORT:  Yes, Your Honor.


QUESTION:  He would -- so are you -- are you --


MR. SHORT:  He would.  He would --


QUESTION:  He would be subject to commitment?


MR. SHORT:  He is subject to commitment under


4246.


QUESTION:  He satisfies the criteria for


commitment?


MR. SHORT:  Yes, he does.  He does, and --


QUESTION:  And I thought that the whole reason


why we're -- how you got to this stage is that a district


court made a finding that this man is not a danger to 

himself or others, and now you want to say for purposes of


the -- your being here on that question, could he be


medicated, because he's not a danger to himself or others,


that finding holds, but once he avoids the trial, then he


can say, ah, but for purposes of civil commitment I am


dangerous to myself or others?


MR. SHORT:  No, that -- that's not what will


happen to Dr. Sell.  He will then go from the 4241 to


4246, at which time the director of that facility will


have to make a determination whether he is a substantial

risk to others, or property to others, if he is released. 


He then has to make that certification.  It goes to the


district court.  They have to prove that by clear and


convincing evidence, and if they so show, he does remain


committed.


QUESTION:  Yes, but you keep saying, if they


show.  Are you conceding that, in fact, the evidence is


there to show it and that he will be in fact subject to --


that he will, in fact, be lawfully committed?


MR. SHORT:  No, I am not -- I am not --


QUESTION:  Then I don't see how you've answered


Justice Scalia's question.


MR. SHORT:  No, I will tell you, from my


experience in this case, I suspect that's precisely what's


going to happen, because of what the Government's view is 

of this individual.


QUESTION:  No, but you --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I hope that's what's going


to happen, but I -- but I don't know how it -- how it


comes about with the law as you've described it to us. 


That's -- that's my problem.


QUESTION:  I have a different problem.  Let me


explain to you what -- I imagine that the slogan, mind-


altering drugs, is not a very good slogan for present


purposes, because there are a lot of seriously ill people

whom these drugs do help a lot.


MR. SHORT:  That's correct.


QUESTION:  Now, if we're thinking of that class


of people, how are they any different from the class of


people with very, very high blood pressure whose lives are


at risk, and could be perhaps medicated with blood


pressure medicine.  These people could be medicated with


antidelusional medicine.  Now, is there a difference


between those two circumstances?


That doesn't answer the question, because what


I'm looking for are the right standards to use to separate


those genuinely ill people from others who may be more


borderline, or may be less obviously helped.


Now, you don't -- I realize now you don't have


much time, but I'm -- that's what I'm struggling with in 

this case.


MR. SHORT:  The standard, the standard, Your


Honor, is whether or not -- and this is very basic,


whether the person has the right to make the choice.  Our


position is that Dr. Sell has the right to make the choice


over his medical decisions.


He has had experience with antipsychotic drugs. 


He took Haldol in the 1980's.  He had an attack of acute


dystonia, which this Court has recognized as being a


serious side effect in at least three cases, Harper,

Riggins, and Mills.  He also has a psychiatrist that has


told him that antipsychotic drugs will not work on


delusional disorders, and Dr. Sell, with all due respect


to what he's charged with, is not a stupid person.  He


does not want to undergo the effects of antipsychotic


medication.  He is making that a free choice, and with all


due respect, I think he has a right to make that choice.


QUESTION:  Do you wish to reserve your remaining


time, Mr. Short?


MR. SHORT:  Thank you, Your Honor, I do.


QUESTION:  Very well.


Now, Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. DREEBEN: 


Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court:


I'd like to address the question of jurisdiction


first.  Dr. Sell's claim should be analyzed as having two


related but distinct components.  One component of his


claim is a Harper-style objection to forcible medication


by the Government in order to render him competent to


stand trial.  The second component of his claim is a


Riggins-style objection to the fairness of his trial if,


in fact, he is medicated and restored to competence and


tried.

 The Riggins-style claim is clearly not amenable


to review under the collateral order doctrine.  Dr. Sell


has not even been tried.  There is clearly no


determination yet whether he can be given a fair trial,


whether he will receive one, and he may raise an objection


to the fairness of his trial at the conclusion of the


criminal case and obtain reversal of his conviction at


that time, but the Harper-style claim is amenable to


review under the collateral order doctrine.  It deals with


a right that is effectively unreviewable if not reviewed


now, just as this Court's cases addressing double jeopardy


claims and qualified immunity claims are effectively


unreviewable if not reviewed --


QUESTION:  Well, it's not just they're


unreviewable, Mr. Dreeben, but it would -- I think we said 

in those cases there the claim was a right not to be


tried.


MR. DREEBEN:  Correct, and --


QUESTION:  Not to be tried at all.


MR. DREEBEN:  -- that right would be lost if the


trial occurs.  Here, one of his claims is a right not to


be medicated.  That right will be lost if, in fact, he is


medicated.


QUESTION:  Well, what if -- what if -- what if


someone says, I claim a right to be tried without this

evidence that I want suppressed but the court has ruled


otherwise?


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, that's right and that's


because the court has concluded that there is no right not


to be tried in the relevant sense without particular


evidence that will be suppressed.  What that reflects is a


right whose remedy would be a right not to have the


evidence used against them, which could include reversal


of a conviction, so that kind of a claim is reviewable at


the end of the case.


But taking Dr. Sell's claims at face value, he's


saying it will violate my First Amendment rights and my


substantive due process rights to be medicated, and those


claims are, in a sense, independent of the main criminal


action. 


Justice Scalia is correct that in a sense they 

could be viewed as claims that could be brought


independently, but I think under the statutory scheme that


exists they are better brought in the context of the


criminal case, rather than through an independent APA


action or some other form of action.


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I'd be less worried if, if


all that was before us here is the up or down question


whether you have an absolute right to refuse medication,


and once that is disposed of, the issue goes away, but


that's not what's before us here.  That is not the only

thing before us here.


The -- there is also the question, assuming that


you can be medicated, what are the criteria, and I assume


that any prisoner can make the claim, I have a right not


to be medicated unless these criteria are fulfilled, so in


every criminal case you're going to have a pre -- with


someone who has psychological difficulties, or who is


found to be not triable because of his mental state, you


have to have this preliminary appeal all the way up before


the trial can even start.  It -- it's not a one-time


thing.


MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Scalia, I'm a little bit


less concerned about the practical consequences, although


I share the view that the delay of the criminal case and,


more importantly, concretely here, the delay in starting 

the medication is a critical problem that results from


collateral order review, but there are two things that I


think reduce any of the costs associated with permitting


collateral order review.


First, if this Court does settle the fundamental


question in favor of the Government and determines that,


on an appropriate showing that this court defines,


medication for the purpose of restoring competence is


permissible, in the future, criminal defendants will not


be able to assert that broad, unsettled, and important

legal issue and obtain a stay of the medication order in


order to litigate it.


What they would have to show is that the actual


application of those standards to the particular facts of


the case is incorrect.  That will most likely be reviewed


under a more deferential standard.  Courts of appeals can


establish expedited calendars to dispose of frivolous


claims, and can weed out those claims that don't --


QUESTION:  But it would certainly be a new


exception to the collateral order doctrine, would it not?


MR. DREEBEN:  It would be a new exception as


applied to the particular facts of this case, but the


standards of the collateral order doctrine I think are


met, and there is --


QUESTION: 


Let me ask you, if we reach the 

question of what standards to apply, it doesn't fit


comfortably in any setting with which we're familiar,


strict scrutiny, rational basis test.  Do you see this as


somewhere in between some kind of heightened review, and


if so, what case do you think is closest?


MR. DREEBEN:  Justice O'Connor, I do think that


a heightened form of review is appropriate.  I don't have


any case that has precisely articulated the correct


standard of review, but in all of this Court's substantive


due process cases, what the Court has done is balanced the

interests of the individual in his liberty, or in this


case in the First Amendment concerns, against the


Government's interest in achieving the objectives that it


has.


QUESTION:  How -- how do you describe the


authority of the Government to make this order at all? 


Suppose this defendant were under a voluntary commitment


in a private institution.  Could you send your guy out


there with a needle the day before the trial?


MR. DREEBEN:  In order to render the defendant


competent to stand trial, Your Honor, the Government would


have to have some sort of a finding that would justify --


QUESTION:  Well, you have -- you have this --


this -- this case, let's assume it's this person, and only


with the hypothetical alteration that I've given.  It's


this person, he's in a private facility, voluntary


commitment --


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I don't think that that


makes any difference at all, Justice Kennedy.


QUESTION:  All right, so what is the authority


of the Government to go out and force him to be medicated


so that he behaves the way the Government wants him to at


trial?


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the Government's authority


here is the -- derives from the fact that Dr. Sell has

been indicted on serious criminal charges, and he has


been -- been found incompetent to stand trial on those


charges.  The Government will be completely unable to


achieve what this Court has recognized to be the


compelling interest in adjudicating serious criminal


charges.


QUESTION:  Could you inoculate a material


witness?  You have to have a prosecution witness.  He's


the key witness, but he's incompetent.  Could you force


him to be inoculated the day before the trial?


MR. DREEBEN:  It's the same due process question


as presented here, Justice Kennedy, with the possible


difference that our interests may be greater with respect


to a person who has been charged than with respect to a


person who has not. 


Material witnesses are held all the 

time without bail.


QUESTION:  I fully understand that, and I want


to know if they can be medicated and what your authority


is for doing it.


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the authority would be an


application of any principle that this Court adopts in


this case to permit us to medicate the defendant.  As I


indicated, there is a distinction between a witness and a


defendant, but here we deal with someone who has already


been placed under indictment, which is to an -- a certain

extent a significant restriction on liberty as well as an


indication of a paramount Government interest in


adjudicating the charges.


QUESTION:  Well, at -- at the very least it


seems to me that you should have statutory authority for


doing this.  Just the court thinks it's a good idea that


the witnesses behave a certain way and order medication --


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think maybe it's important


to back up and look at how this case came to be before the


Court.  Dr. Sell was found to be incompetent to stand


trial, and pursuant to statute section 4241(d) of title


18, he was committed to the Bureau of Prisons for


treatment to determine whether his competency could be


restored.


In the context of that confinement at a medical 

facility, pursuant to regulations of the Bureau of


Prisons, the Bureau of Prisons determined that


antipsychotic medication and nothing else was the means by


which the Government could restore him to competency.


QUESTION:  But that, that was competency for


trial.  That's -- that's -- that's the -- that's not the


standard in the regulations, as I understand them.


MR. DREEBEN:  No, the regulations do indeed


address the potential of medication for the purpose of


rendering competence to stand trial.  That's one of the

criteria that is given to the Bureau of Prisons when it


accepts a patient for treatment under section 4241(d), and


the bureau in fact made the finding that this was a


medically appropriate treatment for a person who has the


illness, the serious delusional disorder that Dr. Sell


has, and that this treatment had a substantial probability


of restoring him to competence.  The --


QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, can you back up just for


a minute, because there's a piece of this that I'm not


clear on.  I thought that before the issue of competence


to stand trial came up, the Bureau of Prisons had


determined this man to be dangerous to himself or others


without medication, and that the Bureau of Prisons was


going to medicate him under the danger standard.


MR. DREEBEN: 


The administrative order, and it's 

the same administrative order that I referred to in


answering Justice Kennedy's question, Justice Ginsburg,


does rest on both restoration of competency and to a


certain extent on concerns about danger.


What happened after the Bureau of Prisons


entered that order is not that it immediately implemented


it and began to medicate Dr. Sell.  Rather, it stayed the


order, and Dr. Sell then sought judicial review in the


very court that had ordered his commitment, which is why I


think that it was appropriate for the district court to

hear this in the criminal action rather than under some


separate APA action.  This is the district court that had


ordered Dr. Sell confined.


The magistrate judge determined that the


Government had not made a showing of dangerousness, which


would have permitted medication under Washington v.


Harper, but that it had adequately shown that medication


was necessary in order to restore Dr. Sell to be competent


for trial.


Dr. Sell then appealed that determination to the


district court, which entered its final decision saying


that the Bureau of Prisons could medicate, there was a


substantial probability of restoring competence, the


antipsychotic medication was medically appropriate


treatment for the psychotic illness that Dr. Sell had, and 

that there was a reasonable likelihood of a fair trial,


and any particularized fair trial concerns that Dr. Sell


was raising, involving effects on his demeanor, or his


effects to relate to counsel, should be determined after


the medication has been administered and it's been


determined whether, in fact, he was restored to


competence.


QUESTION:  Can we get your answer to the


question that Justice Scalia asked Mr. Short?  That is,


suppose it is determined that he can't be medicated for

the purpose of making him competent, what happens to him?


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, at that point, Mr. Short is


correct that under 4241 he would then be referred over to


the director of a medical facility where he would be held


for confinement to determine, pursuant to section 4246,


whether, if released, he would be dangerous to himself or


others.


QUESTION:  Well, all right, suppose he's not. 


Then he goes free.


MR. DREEBEN:  And --


QUESTION:  And the question I would like to know


is, suppose that you have a person who has very high blood


pressure, a defendant.  Is it permissible, or clearly


permissible under the law, to force him to take blood


pressure medication so that he can go to trial? 

MR. DREEBEN:  It is not something that courts of


appeals that I have seen have had to deal with, and this


Court --


QUESTION:  All right, so we have exactly the


same question.


MR. DREEBEN:  Correct.


QUESTION:  And so the question is not


necessarily about psychiatry.  It's about whether or not


you can force a person to take medicine that makes him


competent to stand trial.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I think it's a very particularized


inquiry under the sub --


QUESTION:  I don't know why it would be -- it


may or may not be --


MR. DREEBEN:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- different with psychiatry, but


then the question comes back to, assuming we have the


right standards, which are, I think you and the APA agree,


the psychological people, I don't see much of a difference


there between you, the lower courts, and the -- as to the


standards if you can medicate a comp -- if you can


medicate such a person at all, and so what we know is that


you can go to the person with high blood pressure or the


person who is seriously mentally ill, and you can medicate


him, because the Government has a good reason, where he is 

going to be tried for murder, assault, et cetera, all


right.


Here we have a property crime.  Is this still a


good reason?  Suppose it were a traffic ticket?  I mean, I


take it this is a person whom, in the absence of a


criminal proceeding, the Government could not compel to


take medication.  Am I right?


Now, I've given you a number of things.  I'm


trying to elicit your views on things that are of concern


to me.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer, the question of


what would happen if Dr. Sell were living safely in free


society is obviously distinct from this case.  There's no


authority --


QUESTION:  No, it's not obviously distinct,


because I am assuming a person who is not a danger to


himself or others is, in fact, in that position.


QUESTION:  And it's not distinct because you say


the Government has an interest in having him medicated for


trial.  I don't see the difference in somebody who is at


liberty and in custody.


MR. DREEBEN:  I had taken Justice Breyer's


question to involve somebody who's at liberty but not


charged with a criminal offense.


QUESTION: 


All right, now, if you want to make a 

difference, fine, do it.  I start out with the proposition


that a person who is wandering around a free person now


suddenly is charged.  Now he says, I have very high blood


pressure and I won't take my medicine, or he says, I'm


delusional and I won't take my medicine.


If -- can the Government compel person 1 or


person 2 to do it?


MR. DREEBEN:  Yes to both.


QUESTION:  Yes.  Where it's murder and assault,


if they're about to -- a traffic ticket?  No, all right.

QUESTION:  If that's -- if that's your --


MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. DREEBEN:  -- the question that you're asking


is, how serious need the offense be in order to justify an


intrusion on substantive due process interests, whether


they be through psychiatric medication or through blood


pressure --


QUESTION:  Oh, that's exactly right, that is my


question, because I thought that's what was at issue in


this case.


MR. DREEBEN:  And I entirely agree that it needs


to be a sufficiently serious offense to outweigh --

QUESTION:  What is -- what is the basis for the


Government ordering medication in the case of high blood


pressure, where -- where I would think it doesn't


necessarily interfere with your ability to make trial


decisions?


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, to the extent that a person


was making a claim that, I'm not medically competent to go


to trial because I have high blood pressure, and if I go


to trial, I may have a heart attack and die.  This


actually happens.  People will come into court and say,

you can't try me now because I'm too fragile, I have a


serious health condition, and courts then have to balance. 


It's essentially the same balancing test that's at issue


in this case.  They have to balance --


QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, can I ask you a question


that I've been trying to -- thinking about for quite a


while?  Is the amount of time he's already been in


custody, as compared to the potential sentence he might


receive, relevant to the analysis?


MR. DREEBEN:  It may be, Justice Stevens,


relevant to the analysis to the extent that courts have


held that the amount of time that a person can be held for


treatment under 4241(d) cannot exceed the ultimate


sentence that they would receive.


QUESTION: 


And is that not true in this case? 

MR. DREEBEN:  No, it's not true in this case for


a number of reasons.  First of all, even limiting


consideration to the medicaid fraud and money laundering


charges, the test is the maximum sentence that the


defendant could receive as a matter of statutory law, and


he could receive a sentence --


QUESTION:  It's the maximum sentence, rather


than what the sentencing guidelines would provide?


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, this Court obviously hasn't


addressed the question, and it would be free to weigh

in --


QUESTION:  But if you assumed it was the


sentencing guidelines rather than the maximum statutory


sentence, is it not true that his period of confinement


has already approached that, that time?


MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, it probably is.  Of course,


he's also charged with attempted murder and conspiracy to


murder charges.


QUESTION:  Yes, but that was not -- that was not


part of the analysis, as I understood it, in the court of


appeals decision.


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, to be --


QUESTION:  It relied entirely on the financial


crimes.


MR. DREEBEN: 


You're right, Justice Stevens, but 

to the extent that the question is, how long can the


Government hold him for treatment, he's clearly indicted


for attempted murder and conspiracy to murder charges, and


the length that the Government can hold --


QUESTION:  Well, is it critical to your position


in this case that we take into account the indictment


for -- for -- for attempted murder?


MR. DREEBEN:  No, because the Government's


position here is that any felony case is serious enough --


QUESTION:  Even if the time he's already been in

custody exceeds the time he would get under the sentencing


guidelines?


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, again, if-- if a court were


to hold -- it's not critical to my position, because my


position is, it's statutory maximum.  If the Court were to


hold that we're not going to look at the attempted murder


and conspiracy murder charges, we are only going to look


at the sentencing guidelines sentence, and we are going to


hold that he cannot be held for treatment longer than his


ultimate potential sentence, then the Court would have no


choice but to remand for treatment of Dr. Sell under 4246


to determine whether he should be civilly committed.


Those are questions that were never litigated in


any court, and are certainly not raised in the petition


for certiorari. 


What is raised in the petition for 

certiorari is whether treatment to render a defendant


competent to stand trial on a nonviolent offense is a


sufficient Government interest.


QUESTION:  May I ask this other question, just


to be sure I have your understanding on it?  Has he or has


he not been getting civil -- getting treatment during the


period of his detention?


MR. DREEBEN:  He has not been getting


antipsychotic medication.  He gets --

medicine -- I know he's not getting medical, medicine, but


has he been getting any other kind of treatment for his


ailment?


MR. DREEBEN:  Essentially, no, and the reason is


that there is no other form of treatment, standing alone,


that would have any likelihood of success with a person


with delusional disorder, persecutory type.  This is a


serious thought disorder, interfering with Dr. Sell's


ability to rationally understand what is going on in the


world, and it's well-established in the medical literature


that antipsychotic medication and nothing else is the only


thing that may hold promise of treating the -- the ailment


that he has.  Now, the -- the --


QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, may I ask you to comment


on this, on the question of medication? 


One of the 

arguments is that if you accept, for example, essentially


your standard or the psychological association's standard,


in applying it, you cannot apply it, as it were, in gross. 


You've got to apply it with reference to the specific


medication which is proposed, and that was not done in


this case.  I think the argument is, it's important


because the effects of the various possible antipsychotic


medications may vary tremendously.


Would you comment on that argument, that even if


we accept the standards, they -- they were not adequately

met here because the -- the order was not drug-specific?


MR. DREEBEN:  I -- Justice Souter, if a court


were to attempt to make an order drug-specific for a


patient it would be essentially ignoring the medical


reality of what this treatment will entail.


Now, Dr. Wolfson, the treating psychiatrist, or


consulting psychiatrist at the hearing, testified that in


his view there were two particular medications, quetiapine


and olanzapine, which were likely to be the most suitable


ones for Dr. Sell's case because of their very minimal


side effect profile, that they would have a much better


chance of not inducing sedation or other side effects that


he might claim would interfere with the fairness of his


trial.


But he explained that he did not want to be 

locked into a particular medication because one of his


hopes, as the psychiatrist on the case, is that Dr. Sell


would participate in choosing, if he had been told, he's


ordered to take medication, which medication he wanted to


take.


This is the kind of interactive process that


doctors and patients have all the time, and for a court to


superimpose some rigid rule up front that establishes this


and only this medication can be administered is --


QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, isn't there something

short of that, though?  I mean, we -- we are told that


there are the old kind of drugs that could be injected,


and the new drugs, which originally had to be taken


orally.  Isn't -- that distinction between the category of


drugs, not the particular drug within that category, or


even a decision between something that's injectable and


something that we'd have to force him to swallow, isn't --


isn't that kind of determination something that the --


shouldn't -- shouldn't there be some control over the


Government's discretion?


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I -- I think the Court


should be very cautious about superimposing a judicial


decision making process on a --


QUESTION:  But just asking the Government to


identify that general class of drugs, not the court making 

the decision in the first instance.


MR. DREEBEN:  The -- the problem with that,


Justice Ginsburg, is that the response that an individual


patient has to a drug is individual-specific.  Side


effects can be described in general categories, but nobody


knows what side effects will actually occur, or whether


the drugs will be effective until they've been


administered, and it is not uncommon for the treating


psychiatrist to discover that a drug that may have a


wildly, you know, significant side effect in one

individual has none in another, and a drug that's


anticipated to be entirely successful turns out not to be


successful.


One of the newer, new generation of drugs, the


atypical drugs that have the more favorable side effect


profiles in general may not turn out to be suitable for a


particular patient.


QUESTION:  But of course, one answer to that is,


this is sufficiently serious so that you ought to have to


come back.  In other words, in -- in -- in -- the -- the


premise of your argument is that there's kind of an


either-or choice that is made here, medicate or don't


medicate, but if the -- if the substan -- if a substantive


due process right is recognized, one question here is, how


serious is it, and maybe it ought to be regarded as so 

serious that the Government would have to come back.


MR. DREEBEN:  That would -- might be true,


Justice Souter, if the Government's alternatives were


antipsychotic medication and psychosurgery, so that the


difference was dramatic between the two forms of treatment


that are being proposed, but even looking at the, at the


classes of drugs that are at issue here, the atypical


drugs and the older generation of typical antipsychotic


drugs, there are very important and dramatic differences


between them, but they belong to a family of medications

that are used for treatment all the time, and the


psychiatrist's understanding of the various range of


effects that might be achieved is not likely to be


enhanced by subjecting that to judicial review, nor are


the potential side effects so dramatically different that


it calls for an entirely different substantive due process


analysis.


QUESTION:  May I ask you a different question


about seriousness, and I think it was raised originally by


a question from Justice Kennedy, and I'm not -- I'm not


sure of the facts or of your answer.


Should we treat this, assuming we are going to


recognize it, as sufficiently serious that the Government


should have no power in the absence of legislation, and if


that is so, is there any legislation that authorizes this? 

MR. DREEBEN:  There is legislation that


authorizes and requires the Bureau of Prisons to treat an


individual to attempt to restore him to competency once he


has been determined incompetent.  That's what section


4241(d) says.  Now, it does not --


QUESTION:  So it's treat for purposes of


competency?


MR. DREEBEN:  Correct, and it does not


specifically refer to antipsychotic medication, but in


1984, when this legislation was enacted, it was well known

that, for the kind of psychotic conditions that render a


defendant incompetent to stand trial, it's antipsychotic


medication or --


QUESTION:  But you say the Government can do


this even if the defendant is, is not in custody, and just


to follow this same point, suppose a defendant not in


custody, at home, is undergoing a hunger strike and he's


going to die before the trial.  Can the Government come


out and force feed him?


MR. DREEBEN:  You know, Justice Kennedy, I'll


answer that question yes, but I recognize that it involves


a very different set of considerations, because the


intrusion through force feeding of somebody who wants to


die might be considered to be a very different decision


than treating an ill person's illness with medication that 

is the norm that's used to treat people with these kinds


of disorders.


QUESTION:  But if -- but if your -- but if your


interest is in making the defendant stand trial, it


would -- it would seem to me that you could per -- suppose


it was for -- I don't -- I -- we could play with the


hypothetical, and your time has about run out.  I still


just don't understand your basic authority to do this at


all.


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, as a matter of the

organization of Government, this Court has recognized that


the ability to resolve criminal charges through the


mechanism of a trial is a compelling interest in


maintaining social order and peace, and in order to try


these criminal charges, the Government has no option but


to attempt to restore competency.


QUESTION:  What's the most intrusive thing that


it's clear the Government can do to get the defendant


inside the courthouse door?


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, it -- it's quite clear that


the Government may seize the person and hold them in


pretrial detention, which is a --


QUESTION:  All right, physically seizing him,


shackling him, I guess.  Anything else?


MR. DREEBEN: 


Not that this Court has 

considered, but this -- this kind of medication has to be


judged against the backdrop of the nature of the intrusion


and the efficacy of the treatment for those people who


have this kind of disorder.  Virtually everyone who is


committed to the Bureau of Prisons' care for incompetency


determinations has some form of psychotic disorder that


can be treated.


There are, of course, organic problems that


cannot be treatable at all, and there are other kinds of


mental illness that can create this, but the statistics

that the Bureau of Prisons furnished to us in considering


this case shows that 80 percent of the individuals who are


committed take these drugs voluntarily.


Of the remaining 20 percent who did not, there's


very little indication that any sort of judicial relief


has been sought through appellate review, and I think


that's because these drugs enable someone who has serious


psychotic orders to be restored to a point of rationality


where they can make decisions about what they want to do


with their life.


So instead of remaining incompetent and perhaps


being committed indefinitely to a Bureau of Prisons


facility, where they may be warehoused without any


treatment, or being released if they are not subject to


civil commitment, so that they don't stand trial on 

criminal charges and suffer essentially no consequences,


most individuals accept the fact, particularly after an


initial round of treatment has rendered them competent so


that thy can understand the benefits of this, that the


medication is the appropriate, medically sanctioned way to


deal with the disease that they have.


And when the Government has no mechanism to


achieve its essential interest in adjudicating criminal


charges but for using these medically appropriate means,


and it can show the, the items that have been laid out in

our brief of medical appropriateness, no less-restrictive


alternative, and that there's a reason to expect that a


fair trial will not be precluded, the Government should


appropriately have the authority to override the


substantive due process interest that the defendant has


asserted and medicate him.


QUESTION:  May I ask one last question before


your light goes off?  Under the statute that provides


credit for prior custody, would this defendant's custody


in the -- count?


MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, it would, Justice Stevens.


QUESTION:  It would, okay.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.


Mr. Short, you have 4 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY A. SHORT 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. SHORT:  I only have 2 minutes I need to use,


Your Honor.  I am going to essentially combine one of the


comments made by Mr. Dreeben with questions posed by


Justice Stevens.


Mr. Dreeben says there is a -- we are talking,


of course by a -- about an individual -- although I


understand there's an overall concern about what the


results of this case, case are, we are talking about


Dr. Sell specifically, and the Government's interest --


51 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005 

the Government states that they have a compelling interest


in prosecuting Dr. Sell.


Now, I do not believe the statutory maximum is


what -- is what guides here on the thought of how long has


Dr. Sell been in custody.  Dr. Sell has been in custody,


except for a 5-month period of time when he was out on


bond, since May of 1997.  Under any way you calculate the


guidelines, and I submit the guidelines is the only way


you can calculate it, he has served much more time than he


would have served had he been convicted and sentenced on


this crime, and under these circumstances, I do not see


any compelling interest whatsoever on the part of the


Government in prosecuting this defendant, Dr. Sell.


Thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: 


Thank you, Mr. Short. 

The case is submitted.
