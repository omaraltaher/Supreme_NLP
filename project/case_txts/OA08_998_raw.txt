 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-998, Hamilton, 

 (10:03 a.m.)

the Chapter 13 Trustee, v. Lanning.

 Mr. Hamilton.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAN HAMILTON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. HAMILTON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Tenth Circuit and Stephanie Lanning were 

wrong in ignoring the new Chapter 13 means test 

contained in the 2005 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code. 

The amendments to the 2005 Bankruptcy Code were intended 

to reduce judicial discretion by inserting a formula 

rather than the judicial discretion that had previously 

been accorded to judges and to the litigants.

 Stephanie Lanning fell afoul of the means 

test because during the first 2 months of a 6-month 

lookback period, which I will explain in a moment, she 

had more income than what she had in the rest of the 

6-month lookback period.  That income was from a buyout 

from her former employer, Payless, and distorted what 

her income appeared to be during that 6-month period of 

time.  Because of that, the amount which the means test

showed that she would be required to pay to her 

creditors was more than she could actually pay.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Which means -- which 

means what?  What is the consequence of that?  You 

concede that on the strict application of the 6 months 

she -- her income is much too high for her possibly to 

pay the creditors.  So what happens to her?

 MR. HAMILTON:  What happens to her and what 

could have happened to her may be two different 

propositions, Justice Ginsburg.  In the first place, 

there are two parts to that 6-month lookback period, 

which are found in 101(10A) of the United States 

Bankruptcy Code -- and the statutes, by the way here, 

are found at pages 83 through 96 of the petition 

appendix.

 101(10A) has a first part which defines the 

6-month lookback period as being 6 months prior to the 

filing of the date of the petition -- actually, the end 

of the month prior to the filing of the petition. 

Congress's thought was, it seems, that that would be 

more representative of what an individual's actual 

income would be.

 There is a second part to that 6-month 

lookback period which says essentially that the debtor 

can move that 6-month lookback period by not filing

certain papers with the court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's -- can you explain 

that?  It seems very odd.  It says she can do that if 

she doesn't do what the statute requires her to do.  I 

mean, she's supposed to file that schedule.  She's 

required, the statute says, to file it.  But she gets an 

advantage if she doesn't do what she's instructed to do?

 MR. HAMILTON:  The part of the statute that 

you are referring to is under 523, and it essentially 

says that debtor shall file -- 521, excuse me -- shall 

file certain schedules and that would include the income 

and expense schedules, Schedule I and Schedule J.  And 

certainly the court has the ability, under that statute, 

to extend the time or to excuse the performance of a 

debtor in that regard.  So there's nothing incongruous 

about that wording in the statute.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What do you -- what do 

you do with the contention that the court is bounded by 

other requirements such as the timing of the meeting of 

creditors and the plan confirmation, that that binds the 

district court from resetting it?

 MR. HAMILTON:  Certainly all of those time 

frames can be moved, Justice Sotomayor.  There is -­

again, the actual timing of the confirmation hearing in 

a Chapter 13 case may be fluid, although there are

certain time limits for the first meeting of creditors 

and for when the first -- when the confirmation hearing 

is held.  They can be extended, just as the confirmation 

hearing would be in a Chapter 12 or in a Chapter 11 

case.

 So the idea is the second part of 101(10A) 

allows the debtor to say:  Your Honor, my 6-month time 

frame immediately prior to the filing of the bankruptcy 

petition is not representative of my income; I would 

like to have that time frame moved.  And that time frame 

would appear to be moveable up to the confirmation 

hearing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Moveable to where?  What 

-- what would be -- you say -- this time period, the 

statutory -- the 6-month lookback, she has these 2 

extraordinary months.  So now she's going to say: 

Court, please change the period.  Change it to what? 

Anything she wants?

 MR. HAMILTON:  No, Your Honor.  That would 

be up to the court.  It would be discretionary with the 

court, as the language suggests in the second part of 

101(10A).

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But isn't it the case that 

before the 2005 amendments, bankruptcy courts were 

recognized as having discretion in calculating projected

disposable income to take into account changes in the 

debtor's income after the filing of the plan, and 

shouldn't we presume that -- that Congress intended to 

continue essentially the same regime, unless Congress 

provided some clear indication that they wanted to 

depart from it?

 MR. HAMILTON:  Certainly prior to the 2005 

amendments, your assessment is correct.  The court had 

the discretion to be able to assess the debtor's 

situation, use its discretion to determine what income 

and expenses should be calculated in determining whether 

or not a debtor was paying his or her best efforts under 

1325(b)(1).

 Here, there is a clear formula.  And if you 

read these -- there are three, three key statutes that 

form a triangle in order to give me the conclusion that 

I make and that I suggest to Your Honor.  And that is, 

we start with 1325(b)(1), which is the statute that 

brings into play the disposable income and projected 

disposable income requirements.  "Disposable income" is 

now defined as "current monthly income."

 JUSTICE ALITO:  It is odd that Congress 

provided this very detailed formula and -- and that they 

would provide such a detailed formula and then say:  But 

the bankruptcy court can modify that based on a

projection.

 But still we have the word "projection" -­

"projected."  And your interpretation leads to very 

strange, really absurd results; isn't that true?  And 

you have to devise some really elaborate escape 

strategies in order to allow a debtor to avoid those 

very strange results.

 MR. HAMILTON:  Respectfully, Justice Alito, 

I don't any agree with the assessment that -- of what 

you just stated.  Essentially, this formula allows the 

bankruptcy court to move that 6-month period of time, 

not to ignore the formula.  The formula's there.

 The formula defines "current monthly 

income."  From the current monthly income then is 

subtracted reasonable and necessary expenses.  And 

formerly, under the old law, the '78 code, those 

reasonable and necessary expenses contained a few 

specifics, but largely it was up to the court to 

determine them.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But you say that that can be 

done only if the debtor fails to file a form that the 

debtor is required to file; isn't that right?

 MR. HAMILTON:  In -- under 101(10A), the 

second part, yes.  But I think there are -- there are 

some other -- other avenues for the debtor that are

statutory.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What do you do with the 

situation in which the change that is projected to occur 

and in fact may be almost certain to occur is one that 

causes an increase in the debtor's income?  Let's say 

the debtor was unemployed through almost all of the 

lookback period and then just before the filing of the 

plan gets a job with a good salary.  You would say that 

the -- if you just look at the lookback period, the 

debtor would be required to pay practically nothing.

 MR. HAMILTON:  No, Your Honor, I would not 

agree with that.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What is a creditor to do in 

that situation?

 MR. HAMILTON:  Well, there -- there are a 

couple of avenues.  There is a new statutory provision 

under 1325(a)(7) that says the plan must be filed in 

good faith and -- I'm sorry, the petition must be filed 

in good faith.  1325(a)(3) provides that the petition 

must be filed in good faith.  So we still have the good 

faith analysis that the debtor's actions may be 

subjected to even after the plan is filed.  And that 

would be as trustee the avenue that I would approach is 

that, even though the schedule formula may have been 

complied with, that if there had been a drastic increase

in income post-petition, then that -- that should need 

to be accounted for.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, why -- what 

commends going through all these machinations, all of 

these alternative ways of avoiding absurd results? 

Isn't the answer simply that we just narrow the 

circumstances in which a court can deviate from the 

statutory formula?

 I mean, it's not -- even before this change, 

it wasn't that the district courts could at whim change 

the projected income.  They have to have a clear ground 

to do so.  Why is that inadequate to protect the 

interests that Congress had in creating this new formula 

for income and expenses?

 MR. HAMILTON:  My answer, Justice Sotomayor, 

is that Congress provided the formula, and it's not up 

to the courts, I suggest, to modify that formula.  Part 

of the -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There was a formula 

before.  It was somewhat ambiguous, and that's what led 

to the more defined terms for income and expense.  But 

that says nothing about changing the court's power to 

act in a situation where the formula's clearly not going 

to work.  That was the standard before.

 MR. HAMILTON:  Two points, Justice

Sotomayor.  One is that there was no formula before. 

There was some general guidance that was given in the 

statute.  It's much like the proposition of good faith. 

Good faith is almost incapable of definition, yet every 

circuit in the United States has a laundry list of 

factors that are taken into account for good faith.

 Here, reasonable and necessary expenses 

under the old law had a few suggestions as to what 

needed to be involved with them.  Now we have a portion 

of another part of the triangle, which is under 707(b).

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in a sense that cuts 

against you.  As I was -- when I was reading your 

opening brief, it seemed to me the tone was, well, if 

you accept the Respondent's position Congress did 

nothing at all.  Well, they did do something very 

important.  They had a formula for disposable income. 

The question is, does that formula apply to projected? 

Can that formula be modified altered or projected for 

projected?  So it's not as if Congress did nothing or 

it's not as if the amendment accomplishes nothing even 

under the Respondent's view.  It accomplished something 

very important.

 MR. HAMILTON:  My answer, Justice Kennedy, 

is that the definition of the word, quote, "projected," 

end of quote, has -- there's never has been one in the

code.  That was a term that was in the 1978 code and is 

carried over into the present code.

 How it was applied is vastly different.  The 

dispute under the prior law was over whether or not the 

court could take into account changes in circumstances 

which were likely to occur post-confirmation.  And so we 

had cases like the Anderson v. Satterlee case out of the 

Ninth Circuit and the Midkiff case out of the Tenth 

Circuit that disagreed as to how that ought to be 

applied.

 In the Anderson v. Satterlee case the 

Chapter 13 trustee requested that the debtor sign 

essentially a pledge that they would devote their excess 

income to the plan, and the Anderson court said:  Wait a 

minute; there is another statute at issue here and that 

is 1329.  1329 allows for the modification of the plan 

after the plan has been confirmed.  Prior to the 

confirmation of the plan, the debtor still has the 

ability -- and this ties in with some of the comments 

made by Justice Alito -- the debtor still has the 

ability to amend the plan under 1323.

 So all of these statutes need to be read 

together to show what the result is.  Now the question 

is not whether or not changes should be taken into 

account for post-confirmation that may be likely to

occur, but whether or not the court may deviate from the 

statute where Congress has said this is how we want you 

to determine current monthly income, therefore 

disposable income and consequently projected disposable 

income.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you already told us 

that there could be a deviation through this 

101(10A)(ii).  And why, if that was all that needed to 

be done, did the trustee recommend, did the trustee say, 

bankruptcy judge, let's move the period, let's use this 

provision and we will get another period that doesn't 

have those 2 months with the extraordinary income?

 MR. HAMILTON:  No, Justice Ginsburg, and the 

reason is, is that that privilege is accorded only to 

the debtor to move that 6-month period.  Neither the 

unsecured creditors nor the trustee have the ability to 

request that that 6-month period be moved.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, it could have been 

suggested to the debtor:  You can accomplish what you 

want by using this provision.

 MR. HAMILTON:  The record is silent as to 

whether or not that occurred.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- where can you move 

it?  I don't really -- this is the same line of inquiry 

as Justice Ginsburg.  What's the -- what has to be the

ending date if you move the -- you can't move it any -­

much beyond the date of what, the hearing?

 MR. HAMILTON:  It would be up to 

confirmation, but the confirmation hearing could be 

continued as the court saw fit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The review of the 

determination or the request to move the period is -- is 

what?  Up to the total discretion of the -- of the 

judge?

 MR. HAMILTON:  It appears to be so under the 

statute, Chief Justice Roberts.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So your objection to 

the fact that the judge has more discretion with respect 

to defining "projected disposable" -- you don't mind the 

discretion on the other side.

 MR. HAMILTON:  No, Your Honor, I don't 

believe the discretion is not in determining the income, 

only in determining the time period.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right, but the only 

purpose of moving the time period is to change the 

income.

 MR. HAMILTON:  That's true.  And there are 

other options that the debtor had available in addition 

to that, that we have referred to as the four options, 

which would be the debtor could have here just delayed

filing the case for a couple of months and these 

problems would not have occurred.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  There is another discretion 

that you don't seem to object to.  You say that one -­

one way the debtor can get out of the bind that he's put 

in by the fixing of the confirmed plan is simply to move 

for a revision of the confirmed plan.

 MR. HAMILTON:  Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What constrains the judge 

in allowing or not allowing the revision?  Doesn't he 

have the same kind of discretion with regard to the 

revision that you're objecting to with regard to his 

establishing the payments?

 MR. HAMILTON:  Justice Scalia, I don't think 

so.  1329 has been subject to quite a bit of litigation, 

but the argument that we make in our reply brief is that 

it would be simply necessary to plug in and plug out 

whatever the change in circumstance is.

 So the debtor would be able to say, my 

wife's income is now gone, so we want to take that out 

of the formula.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's the same thing 

that's being argued here, that -- that you start with 

the fixed calculation based on the 6 months before and 

then you have to show that there were some extraordinary

circumstances that justify a change.  I don't see that 

there's any difference.

 MR. HAMILTON:  There may not be, except that 

there is a statutory requirement as to how that is 

accomplished and that's where the 101(10A)(ii) comes 

into play.  It's not so much that there is a problem 

with -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What your case comes down 

to is the bankruptcy court can do this, but it has to do 

it by simply revising the plan, not by establishing the 

plan initially but by revising it.

 MR. HAMILTON:  Not necessarily, Your Honor. 

That certainly is one way.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe?

 MR. HAMILTON:  It may be, yes.  It depends 

on the facts of the case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's a good 

answer, isn't it, because your point would be the 

statute does not allow that exercise of discretion with 

respect to projected disposable income, but it does in 

the other areas.

 MR. HAMILTON:  Well, again I respectfully 

disagree, Chief Justice Roberts.  1329 -­

question.

MR. HAMILTON:  I'm sorry?  I'm sorry, I 

didn't hear.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, my -- my point 

and what I thought your point would be is that the fact 

that there is exercise of discretion in two different 

areas is not the problem.  The problem is that in one 

area the discretion is specifically permitted and in the 

other area, projected disposable income, it's not.

 MR. HAMILTON:  I agree.

 (Laughter. )

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But can the -- can the plan 

be modified based on -- can the plan be modified based 

on something that was known before the plan was 

confirmed?

 MR. HAMILTON:  That depends on which 

jurisdiction one would be in, Justice Alito.  The most 

current example -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if it can't, then how 

is this modification remedy going to work?

 MR. HAMILTON:  I think it should be.  For 

example, a good example of this would be debtor is 

expected 2 years from now to no longer have to repay a 

401(k) loan.  And so one view would be that you ought to 

take that into account as of that date and figure those 

calculations, which becomes extremely unwieldy.  You are

guessing at that point.  The debtor may say:  Well, I 

may be losing that, but I don't know what my actual 

circumstances are going to be 2 years from now.  Chapter 

13 is a fluid process.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Your argument is that the 

Court has to confirm a plan that is really not 

confirmable because the debtor can't possibly make the 

payments under the plan, but then can turn around 

immediately and modify the plan so that it does call for 

payments to be made.

 MR. HAMILTON:  No, Your Honor.  That is not 

my argument.

could never do that.  So you are not going to get that 

confirmed plan which could be amended later.

 MR. HAMILTON:  Well, I agreed with that.  I 

may have misunderstood the question that I was asked. 

But what I'm saying is that the statute needs to be 

followed and if the debtor had followed the statutes 

here then the debtor likely could have obtained a 

confirmed plan by moving that 6-month time frame.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what in addition to 

-- you brought up the 101 solution that she doesn't do 

what the statute tells her to do, so she's able to move 

it if the judge agrees.  And you said she has other 

options.

 MR. HAMILTON:  Yes.  Well, the other options 

-- and I referred to them as the four options and the 

101(10A)(ii) is one of those options.  As I said, she 

could have delayed filing the case.  There is nothing in 

the schedules that would indicate that she was filing 

this bankruptcy under exigent circumstances.  There is 

no foreclosure, there is no repossession, there's no 

garnishment, there's no lawsuit.  So delay would have 

been a possible, and a debtor is always able to 

determine the date of the filing of the petition.

 The second thing that she could have done is 

file a Chapter 7, and this is the anomaly between

Chapter 13 and Chapter 7, is that she would have 

qualified in all likelihood for a discharge under 

Chapter 7 because she would have met the special 

circumstances test in 707(b).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But then the creditors 

would have been a lot worse off, would they not have 

been?

 MR. HAMILTON:  That's very possible, but 

it's a formula that Congress thought to place into 

effect and it's not -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, why would -- why 

would the trustee be urging the possibility that it 

would be okay for her to file under Chapter 7, in which 

case the unsecured creditors would get very little, but 

it's not okay for her to use chapter 13 with a plan that 

would give the unsecured creditors substantial payments?

 MR. HAMILTON:  Here, Justice Ginsburg, the 

reason is plain and simple, and that was I sought to 

enforce the rule of law in order to have the courts 

determine how the rules were supposed to be interpreted. 

By my view, it seemed like that had she followed the 

rules maybe she would have gotten there, but the way she 

did it she can't.  It's kind of like driving a car.  You 

can't expect that a the car is going to perform well if 

you don't turn the engine on.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can I -­

MR. HAMILTON:  And here she didn't turn the 

engine on.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can I come back to 

Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there would 

ever be the opportunity to adjust the confirmed plan? 

Because as you say, the plan here would not have been 

confirmed, but that -- that isn't the case always.  I 

mean, in many cases a plan would be confirmed because 

the -- the bankrupt could -- could barely make the 

payments that it requires; and then when it -- it is 

clear that, because of the extraordinary event in the 

preceding 6 months, the bankrupt is -- is not going to 

have that -- that amount of money, there would be the 

opportunity to adjust.

 MR. HAMILTON:  Maybe not -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  In other words, is your 

response to Justice Ginsburg "always," that it will 

always be the case that where there would be an 

adjustment under this theory, there would not have been 

a confirmation in the first place?

 MR. HAMILTON:  If the plan is not 

confirmable by an analysis of Schedules I and J, which 

are the income and expenses statutes, I am not going to 

recommend confirmation, and nor do I think any trustee

would.  Any events that are in the equation before the 

date of confirmation would likely be then subject to 

1327, the res judicata provisions of chapter 13.  So if 

the plan is confirmed, say in Stephanie Lanning's case, 

with these facts known, then she would not be able to 

come in afterwards and ask for the court to modify under 

1329 because that's part of the confirmation order.

 The other options that were available -- we 

discussed briefly the ability to file this as a Chapter 

7.  She also could have converted this case to a Chapter 

7 post-petition with the same result, or she could have 

dismissed this case and refiled.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Isn't that -- wouldn't 

that amount to just a -- a waste of everybody's time, to 

dismiss it and then refile it, and then she gets a time 

period that doesn't -- why -- why not just drop out 

those 2 months that are not representative of her 

income?

 MR. HAMILTON:  Because, Justice Ginsburg, 

the statute does not permit that.  It's not within the 

formula, and that's the question:  Is the formula 

binding or is it not binding?  If it is binding then 

this -- obviously.  Congress intended a more rule-bound 

statute.  It got that.  It was obvious that it intended 

to reduce judicial discretion, and the statute seems to

accomplish that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the thing is -- but 

you have explained, your number one solution for her is 

this 101 route, which is -- gives lots of discretion in 

the court.

 MR. HAMILTON:  Only in moving the 6-month 

period, Justice Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.

 MR. HAMILTON:  That would be the only 

discretion that the statute would appear to accord to 

the court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where is that, by 

the way, the provision that allows it to move the 

6-month period?

 MR. HAMILTON:  It's in 101(10A) and it 

provides that the term "current monthly income" means 

the average monthly income from all sources that the 

debtor receives, or in a joint case the debtor and the 

debtor's spouse receive, without regard to whether such 

income is taxable income derived during the 6-month 

period ending on -- and then we come to subsections (i), 

little (i) -- or (ii).  And those are -- that's the 

disjuncture; it's the 6-month period prior or some other 

time frame, and the language is important.

in which moving the 6-month period can't solve the 

problem?  For example, if the debtor had good income for 

many years going back, but then slight -- shortly before 

the filing of the plan loses his or her job, and there 

is no prospect that the debtor is going to get another 

job?  Or it could be the converse, has very low income 

for a long period and then right before gets a job.  So 

you are not going to be able to cure those problems by 

moving the 6-month period.  What do you do then?

 MR. HAMILTON:  Well, Justice Alito, I think 

I would tie in 1323 with respect to the first 

proposition, and that is if the debtor's circumstances 

have markedly changed, then the debtor has the ability 

to file an amended plan; and that amended plan could ask 

the court to move that time frame forward to a 

confirmation hearing that would take into account the 

drop in income.

 With respect to the second part of your 

proposition, and that is an increase in income, then I 

as Chapter 13 trustee would have the ability to object 

to it on the basis of -- of good faith under either 

1325(a)(3) or 1325(a)(7), either the plan or the filing 

of the case itself.  And those -- the filing of the 

1325(a)(3) was the primary way in which all of these 

disputes were resolved before the 1984 amendments which

brought in subsection (b) to 1325 which introduced the 

concept of disposable income.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you file an 

amended plan and have the court restart the clock, when 

101(10A) says only if the debtor has not filed a 

schedule of current income?  If there's been a plan 

confirmed or a plan proposed, then the income schedule 

had to have been filed.

 MR. HAMILTON:  Those are -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You don't do one without 

the other.

 MR. HAMILTON:  Those are two different 

propositions, Your Honor.  One is if the plan is 

confirmed and one if it is not confirmed.  If it is not 

confirmed, then you are correct; at some point the 

trustee and the court are going to want to see a 

Schedule I and J to see what the actual income and 

expenses are.  If the plan has already been confirmed, 

then the ability to change the plan has to be done under 

1329, which is -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Forget about 1329.  I'm 

going to the situation where the plan has been proposed, 

let's say.  The courts -- if a schedule of income has 

been filed, then it's without any jurisdiction to change 

the 6-month lookback period, correct?

 MR. HAMILTON:  The debtor would certainly

it pretty much up to the judge?

 MR. HAMILTON:  No.  I believe again the 

court is bound, Justice Scalia, by the 101(10A) formula. 

It's obvious that Congress intended the formula.  It 

would not make much sense to read the statute to have 

some other formula.

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, then -- then -- okay. 

You are between a rock and a hard place.  Either 1323 

gets you out of that formula, which is what you've said, 

it's one way out, or it isn't.  Which is it?

 MR. HAMILTON:  I haven't said that it gets 

me out of the formula.  It gets me out of the time frame 

issue, because certainly the statute doesn't take into 

specific account what happens if the debtor loses a job, 

say, post-petition?  Obviously -- example, husband loses 

the job at Goodyear after the bankruptcy petition is 

filed.  And I think 1323 is broad enough to allow an 

amendment which would involve only moving the time 

frame.

amendment has to relate to a period -­

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The Court, I think, has the parties' 

arguments very well in hand.  I think the -- the one 

point that I can hopefully address, and it is I think 

the hardest part of our case, is to address the issue 

that Justice Alito raised, and that is, is there an 

anomaly in the fact that in BAPCPA Congress added the 

6-month period, which would suggest perhaps that 

Congress was trying to lock in a particular period that 

we would look at.

 And the answer to that question is no, and I 

want to take you to the relevant statutory provisions. 

Everything is going to be in the cert petition.  I am 

going to start in the petition appendix at 91, which is 

1325, which is the operative provision here.  And 

1325(b)(1) tells us that if the trustee or a creditor 

objects, then as of the effective date of the plan it's 

only going to be confirmed in subsection (b), which is 

the third full paragraph on page 91 is going to control.

 The plan has to provide that all of the 

debtor's projected disposable income to be received in 

the applicable commitment period beginning on the date 

the first payment is due under the plan will be applied 

to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan.

28

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

And the thing to note first about that 

provision is that it, too, sets a timetable.  It's not 

just projected disposable income, but it's projected 

disposable income of a very particular type, to be 

received in the applicable commitment period.  So unless 

there is something particularly strange about the 

definition of "disposable income," Congress specified a 

period that the income is going to be measured in, and 

that's over the course of the plan; the word "projected" 

tells us to get a realistic estimation of what that 

amount of money's going to be.

 Now, my friend makes the point that 

disposable income after BAPCPA is a defined term; the 

definition comes in the next paragraph; it's subsection 

(2), 1325(b)(2).  For purposes of this subsection the 

term "disposable income" means current monthly income 

received by the debtor subject to some deductions and 

then the expenses.  So then we have to go to the 

definition of "current monthly income."  Current monthly 

income is in 101; it's at page 83.

 That's where we get the 6-month period.  And 

it tells us that current monthly income is the average 

monthly income from all sources, so it's very 

encompassing, without regard to whether such income is 

taxable income derived during the 6-month period.

So, my friend's argument is that, well, 

Congress said 6 months.  The answer to that point is a 

couple fold.  First, as was suggested in the first 

half-hour, Congress was addressing a very specific 

problem there.  Before BAPCPA courts didn't know what 

the -- didn't agree on what the baseline was for 

determining someone's income.

 Some courts would say, all right, you are a 

Chapter 13 debtor, right away I'm going to look at the 

latest month.  Some courts said 6 months.  We have a 

court in our brief that said 4 years.  So, we have to 

have a starting point to project from.

 But the second point is that this term 

"current monthly income" isn't principally a Chapter 13 

term at all.  So, my friend's argument is that Congress 

stuck this 6-month period into Chapter 13, so it would 

be very anomalous if we could just -- in effect, he says 

we are throwing it out, we are giving the district 

judges discretion.  It's not quite right.

 The place to look is in section 707, which 

is two pages later.  707 is a Chapter 7 provision.  And 

my friend started out by saying the problem with our 

position is that we were not following the Chapter 7 

means test.  That's the key.  This term is really a -­

borrowed from Chapter 7.  So 707(b)(2)(A)(i) is at the

beginning of page 85 of the appendix.

 And, so, we are in a Chapter 7 case here. 

And this is the means test.  It tells us that:  "In 

considering under paragraph 1," so we are trying to 

figure out if there is a presumption of abuse under 

Chapter 7 -- "whether the granting of relief would be an 

abuse of the provisions of this chapter, the court shall 

presume abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly 

income, reduced by the amounts determined under clauses 

2, 3, and 4" -- those are expense clauses -- "and 

multiplied by 60 is not less than" a certain amount.

 So what happened is Congress in BAPCPA 

created this presumption of abuse in Chapter 7 and it 

then borrowed that concept, as my friend pointed out, in 

Chapter 13.  So that 6-month period has real force and 

effect in the Bankruptcy Code in Chapter 7.  So it's not 

like Congress in Chapter 13 fixed the 6-month period, 

which would give -- have a sort of a gravitational pull. 

You wouldn't want to throw that out too lightly.

 Justice Sotomayor, I do agree that we ought 

to be pretty -- we ought to stick to it.  It indicates 

Congress is concerned with the 6-month period.  But it's 

not like Congress added to Chapter 13 this 6-month 

concept.  It added it to Chapter 7, where it's in full 

force and effect.

Can I make one other point about that 

language, just to repeat it again?  That the courts

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you -- you have lost 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where is the 6-month -­

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.  It's back.  We have 

to go back two pages.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I got -- I got it 

there.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Sure.  I'm sorry. 

The term is "current monthly income."  So we are in 

Chapter 7, so four lines down".  "The court shall 

presume abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly 

income" -- that's the 6 months, current monthly income. 

That's the 6-month period of income.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I -- I see.  I see.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  See, that's mostly where it 

matters.  Then Congress borrowed it in Chapter 13.  But 

it didn't get rid of, as was pointed out before, the 

term -- "projected"; it didn't get rid of the period, 

the commitment period.

 But I do want to point out something very 

particular about this language.  Here's the phrase:

"Current monthly income, reduced by the amounts 

determined under clauses 2, 3, and 4" -- those are 

expenses -- "and multiplied by 60."  That's what my 

friend says the phrase "projected disposable income to 

be received over the applicable commitment period" is.

 Our point is that if Congress intended that 

mechanical formulation, it would have used the exact 

words that I have just read from you in Chapter 7, 

because that's mechanical.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Without the word 

"projected"?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Without the word 

"projected"?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  That's exactly.  They used 

"multiplied."  And Congress did that several times in 

BAPCPA and before BAPCPA.  When Congress wanted, look, 

we are going to have a mathematical formula, it used a 

mathematical formula.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why don't you follow 

his suggestion and just move the 6-month period, because 

the statute specifically grants that authority to the 

judge?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.  Let me make a few 

points about that, sir.  So I'll again read the language

again.  So we are on 83.  It says that -- little (ii) is 

going to be -- it's going to be "6 months ending on the 

date on which current income is determined by the court 

for purposes of this title if the debtor does not file 

the schedule of current income."

 A couple OF points about that. 

Justice Alito, you were right, this is a one-way pro­

debtor ratchet, right.  The creditor and the trustee, if 

the debtor a month before confirmation gets a new job or 

their expenses go down -- let's say you had a car, but 

you know that the car payments are going to be done. 

Under the trustee's view, then you still get to count 

the car payments which are totally pretend, or if you 

got a much higher paying job.

 In fact, in this case she did get a higher 

paying job.  Towards the end of the period, she got a 

raise.  And we say that has to be counted, too.  We have 

to have a debtor and creditor-neutral provision.  In a 

statute that's designed to make sure the debtor pays a 

much as possible to her creditors, it's very strange to 

put this entirely in the debtor's hands.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Can I ask you this.  There 

seems to be at least a subtle difference between your 

position and the government's position.  You say that 

the projected disposable income will be different from

the disposable income calculated during the lookback 

period when it is known or virtually certain that there 

will be differences in income or expenses.  And the 

government says that there is a difference when 

something is likely to occur in the future.

 Where do you -- where do you get from the 

statute your known or virtually certain differences?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  The contrast between 1325 

and 1329.  What I tried to do in my brief, and I have 

laid it out at the beginning of the argument section. 

That's where we try to articulate our rule.  What we 

have done is we have looked at the cases.  As you 

pointed out, this is pre-BAPCPA practice.  Courts have 

set a pretty high bar, both in terms of the level of 

certainty and the degree of deviation.

 And courts have said -- I will give you an 

example that will illustrate the difference perhaps. 

You have times when someone expects to get a raise. 

They don't know that they are going to get it, or they 

expect to get a promotion.  And courts will say, even if 

that's pretty likely, until you have actually got it we 

are not going to count it for purposes of 1325(b); come 

back under 1329.

 And we point out in our merits brief that in 

fact, it's not quite on point, but she got a settlement

post-confirmation here, and under 1329 that money was 

applied.

 So, Justice Scalia, there are 

post-confirmation events, but if you know ahead of 

time -- and this case is a perfect example, it -- we 

know she is not going to get another buyout from Payless 

Shoe Stores.  When it's known or virtually certain, we 

think that is sufficient -- akin to Justice Sotomayor's 

point about, you know, making it hard.

 Let me make one other point.  I wanted to 

finish off my answer to the Chief Justice about 101. 

This provision has taken on greater significance in the 

oral argument and the reply brief of the Petitioner.  I 

did want to point out to the Court a provision that is 

not reproduced in the parties' briefs, but if the Court 

were to go this route it would want to be aware of, and 

that's 521(i).

 And 521(i) tells us that you do have to file 

the forms at the beginning or you have to file them 

within 45 days, but upon request of the debtor made 

within 45 days after the date of filing the petition, 

the court may allow the debtor an additional period of 

not to exceed 45 days.  So it does seem to constrain the 

power of the bankruptcy court to shift this period all 

around.

So, I have made two points.  One is it's a 

one-way ratchet for the debtor; second, it's not 

unlimited.

 The third is it just doesn't make any sense. 

Why would Congress design a system that would have all 

of these machinations.  If we agree that Congress 

wants -- it seems my friend and I agree that Congress 

believes that she shouldn't have to make the payments 

that would be required under the trustee's reading of 

"projected disposable income."  The question is how we 

get there.  The trustee's answer is that you are 

required by the text; I'm sorry, Congress took this 

option away.

 And I think that, as I have explained, the 

term "projected disposable income to be received in the 

applicable commitment period" really is not language 

that you would ordinarily construe to ignore changes 

that -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I think -- I 

think that's exactly right when you look at term 

"projected disposable income."

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if you look as 

"disposable income" -­

MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- as a defined term 

and then add "projected," I think it's a different -­

different -- different argument, different kettle of 

fish.  I mean, because particularly in a statute 

intended to restrict discretion, it's a way to do it. 

You look at it in the abstract, "projected disposable 

income," it doesn't achieve that objective.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  And that is exactly, 

Mr. Chief Justice, why I started with the definition of 

"current monthly income in the 6-month period."  I agree 

that it is an important point.  It is their strongest 

argument.

 My only point is that I have explained, I 

think, why Congress put the 6-month period in for 

purposes of Chapter 7 and also to have the starting 

point.  If I -- to give you an example, take inflation. 

If we were to define inflation as the amount in the rise 

in prices over the previous 6 months, if Congress did 

that in a statute and then told us to look at projected 

inflation, we would still not ignore things that will 

tell us that there are going to be -- there has been an 

oil price spike or an increase in health care costs.  It 

would take a pretty firm, firm period that told us to 

only look into the past and not look into the future, 

particularly when the whole point of the statute is to

make sure that the money goes into the creditor's hands 

that the debtor is able to pay.

 On the point of discretion, I should also 

say BAPCPA as a whole was intended to reduce discretion. 

And, so, it's kind of odd to say that the answer to our 

position is to turn to all of these other discretionary 

provisions -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if you -- you 

wanted to achieve your friend's result and you had a 

definition of disposable income, and you wanted the 

court to -- you don't want to say project that forward, 

what -- what word would be more natural than saying 

projected?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I -- I -- I would use the 

language that Congress did in 707.  Remember, the 

current monthly income reduced by the amounts determined 

under clauses 2, 3, and 4 and multiplied by 60.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, that's altering 

disposable income -- the definition of disposable 

income.  I'm asking isn't the most natural word to 

achieve your friend's result to use projected.  What 

other word would you say when you say this is the period 

you look at and you want to take it forward?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Multiply.  And Congress did 

that a bunch of times.  Projected -- if we try to

project something, we try and make the -- and everybody 

agrees on the definition, so really, it's not an unusual 

term.  It is:  You make your best estimate of the future 

based on the data you have now.  My friend is right. 

One piece of data we have now is her previous 6 months' 

income.  Another piece of data is we know that she's not 

going to have the same income in the future.

 If there are no further questions.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH HARRINGTON

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 In bankruptcy, as in many areas of the law, 

Congress has tried to balance on the one hand, doing 

case-specific justice, and on the other hand, ensuring 

that the statutory scheme is administrable.  Now, 

Congress certainly could have chosen to elevate 

simplicity over accuracy by telling bankruptcy courts to 

take a debtor's current disposable income and multiply 

that number by the number of months in the plan in 

assessing whether the plan is confirmable.  But there 

are several strong signals in the code that that is

actually not what Congress intended courts to do.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But do you think bankruptcy 

courts are supposed to be economic forecasters?  For 

example, if you -- after calculating the debtor's income 

during the 6-month period, the 6-month lookback period, 

should the bankruptcy court said, well -- say:  Well, 

it's -- inflation is projected to be such-and-such over 

the term of this plan, so I am just going to increase it 

by the amount of inflation; or:  This person works in a 

particular industry where historically, over the last 

five years or ten years, there's been a 3 percent 

increase in salary per year, so I'm going to multiply it 

by -- multiply the disposable income figure like that?

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Certainly not, 

Justice Alito.  Bankruptcy -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why not?  You say that 

the bankruptcy courts should take into account things 

that are likely to occur in the future.

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, bankruptcy courts -­

we are not saying that bankruptcy courts should ever 

speculate about what might happen in the future.  What 

we are saying is that bankruptcy courts should take into 

account what they know, in this case, already has 

happened, but also what they know will happen.  And so

creditors, if as -- as I mentioned earlier, if a debtor 

has secured a higher-paying job just before or just 

after she filed her petition, a Court should be able to 

take into account the fact that her income going forward 

would be greater than would be reflected in the 

calculation of her current disposable income.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, "know will happen" is 

quite different from "likely to happen," and I thought 

your test was likely to happen.

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, likely to happen 

based on what you know now.  I think -- we haven't 

suggested a particular burden of proof.  I think -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not -- not likely, based on 

what you know.  Well, that's quite different from you 

know it will happen.

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Right.  So there is an 

example mentioned earlier:  If the debtor is repaying a 

loan to her 401(k) program, that is the type of loan 

that can't be extended time-wise.  And so she will keep 

making those payments, which will be deducted as an 

expense in the calculation of her current disposable 

income, but -- but you know at a certain point, she is 

likely to stop making those payments.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there a difference 

between your test and the Respondent's test?

MS. HARRINGTON:  Not according to what I 

heard Mr. Goldstein say at the argument.  Again, we do 

not mean to suggest that a court should use -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  His words were "known to 

a virtual certainty," which are -- likely to happen is 

different than likely to happen.

 MS. HARRINGTON:  I think, in part, it 

depends on what type of change you are talking about. 

Again, we would never say that a court should speculate 

about what should happen.  But, for instance, to take 

another example on the expense side, if a debtor when 

she proposes her plan owns a second home, a vacation 

home that is secured by a mortgage, then that secured 

debt payment is an expense that would be deducted from 

her income in the calculation of her current disposable 

income.  But if she proposes to surrender that property 

as a condition of her plan, she will no longer have that 

debt payment going forward.  And so that's the type 

of -- so it will no longer be an expense going forward. 

Under Petitioner's view, a court would not be able to 

take into account the fact that that current expense -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's -- that's "know will 

happen."  That is "know will happen."  But I don't know 

how you can, at one and the same time, say:  Courts 

shall not speculate, and then say that the test is

"likely to happen."

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, again, in this -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, to -- you know, to 

look forward and say:  Is it likely or not likely? 

That's speculation.  I don't know a better definition of 

speculation, to tell you the truth.

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Okay.  But then, we 

wouldn't -- we are not trying to advance that view of 

"likely."  And again, in this case the change had 

already occurred, so there is no uncertainty about what 

her situation is now and what we can project it to be 

going forward.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me that, 

particularly since you are adopting a fairly broad -­

well, depending on how broad a theory you are adopting 

of what's projected and what's not, that you are taking 

into account a lot of things that are more properly 

taken into account when it comes to whether the plan 

should be confirmed or not.

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, this is -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What's going to 

happen?  What's the situation going to be?  What should, 

you know, the creditors get?  What should the debtor 

get?  There is no reason to kind of shoehorn those into 

the projected disposable income.

MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, except that if the 

creditor or a trustee objects, then the calculation of 

projected disposable income is one of the conditions of 

confirmability of the plan.  The court can't confirm it 

unless it can -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, is that -- I 

mean, let's say your friend wins up to the point and 

somebody else, when it gets to confirmation, can say: 

Well, look, you know, there was this big payout before 

the filing.  So don't confirm it.  We know she has got 

all this -- all this other money.  That -- it could do 

it that way, couldn't it?

 MS. HARRINGTON:  I'm sorry, if she got a 

higher-paying job just before?  Is that what you're 

suggesting?

situation is, can't that be taken into account when it 

comes to confirmation?

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, it could affect the 

-- well, one thing that is important to note that hasn't 

been brought up is under Section 1325(a)(6), the court 

is actually -- which is the feasibility provision -- the 

Court is actually required to think about what is going 

to happen in the future, whether a debtor is going to be 

able to repay her creditors.  And so it doesn't make

very much sense to, on the one hand, require a court to 

consider what it knows will happen in the future in 

determining feasibility, and then on the other hand, if 

there's an objection by the creditor or the trustee and 

1325(b) comes into play, to prohibit a court from 

considering the same facts it knows about what is going 

to happen in the future -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the debtor is a 

waiter and during the last month of the 6-month period, 

because of some change of the economy the waiter's tips 

have gone up either way up or way down?  What's the 

court supposed to do then?

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, I think one purpose 

of having the 6-month lookback period in the calculation 

of current income is exactly to take into account those 

situations.  There are many people who are gainfully 

employed full time, but whose -- whose income fluctuates 

over time.  And so requiring that courts use the 6-month 

lookback period, I think, gives creditors a better sense 

of whether the current income figure provided by the 

debtor is accurate.  It reduces the chance for strategic 

filing because it sort of takes some of the significance 

away of the time of filing.

 And so it seems fairer in that case to 

consider that 6-month average in a case where income

fluctuates up and down as an accurate sense of what the 

-- what the debtor's current income is.  And again, in 

many -- in a significant number of cases the calculation 

of a current disposable income will be a good prediction 

of what the debtor's disposable income will be going 

forward.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do you deal with the 

Petitioner's -- the two arguments Petitioner makes?  One 

is that on the expense side, Congress provided for 

special circumstances, exceptions, and it didn't on the 

income side?

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, the special 

circumstances exception comes in, in the calculation of 

the debtor's current disposable income, but it doesn't 

tell you what to do in terms of projecting that 

disposable income.  And so you can adjust what you think 

the current disposable income is based on an expense 

that isn't accounted for in the standard expenses or an 

expense that is accounted for, but is higher than is 

accounted for in those expenses.  But again, it doesn't 

tell you what to do -- how to project that number going 

forward.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the argument 

that this is a simple thing; she didn't have to file the 

plan -- she didn't have to file the petition at a time

when those two months would be in the 6-month lookback. 

She could have waited.

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, that is certainly 

true of this debtor, of the Respondent in this case. 

That is not an option available to all debtors, many of 

whom are facing foreclosure proceedings or imminent 

foreclosure proceedings.  Delay is simply not an option.

 And if I could address Section 

101(10A)(A)(ii) option that the Petitioner offers -- I 

mean, one thing to note is it doesn't give the Court the 

discretion to set any other -- to just pick any other 

6-month lookback period.  They pick a date and go 6 

months back from whatever that date is.  So if a change 

occurs very soon before the filing of the petition, it 

makes it very hard for a court to use that provision to 

change the lookback period because you would have to 

wait 6 months, essentially, after the filing of the 

petition to set it back.

 But again, the biggest problem with using 

that section as a workaround is that that is an option 

that is available to debtors, but not to creditors.  If 

a debtor files a Chapter 13 petition along with all the 

Schedules that are required under Section 521 of the 

code, then the debtor has no option for -- excuse me, 

the creditor has no option and the trustee has no

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the creditor 

has the option of objecting the confirmation of the 

plan.

 MS. HARRINGTON:  They can object to 

confirmation of the plan, but on what -- what basis?  If 

the Petitioner argues that the calculation of projected 

disposable income is merely a mechanical multiplication 

of the current disposable income times 60 or 36, then 

they have no way of allowing the court to take account 

of a change that has happened just before or after the 

time of the petition that would inure to the creditor's 

benefit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They can't say:  I 

object because the 6-month period is unrepresentative 

because of this particular event?

 MS. HARRINGTON:  They could say that, but 

it's not clear in the code that that is a basis for 

refusing to confirm a plan.  I think they would have to 

make the argument that -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Does the government 

have a position on that?

 MS. HARRINGTON:  I think unless there were 

bad faith it's not clear how that can be a basis for not

my friend on Petitioner's counsel suggested.  But again, 

it's not clear how that would be bad faith, if a debtor 

proposes a plan that -- that commits all of her 

projected disposable income under the trustee's view of 

what that number is, it's hard to see how you could say 

that that was a plan that was proposed in bad faith.

 So again, I just want to -- just to respond 

to the -- the argument that the government in 

Respondent's view reads the 6-month period totally out 

of the code -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can finish the 

sentence.

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Okay.  The calculation of 

a -- a debtor's current disposable income will often be 

a reliable predictor of her future disposable income and 

when that's the case, then a reliable way of projecting 

is simply be multiplying.

First of all, I want to note that the plan 

is not confirmed in this case; this was an interlocutory 

appeal.  There is an amended order at the BAP level that 

allows it as an interlocutory appeal.  So the debtor 

still has preconfirmation options, rather than having to 

rely upon 1329 or something else in the record.

 Secondly I want to point out that 1325 as 

has been suggested by Justice Ginsburg only incorporates 

a part of 707(b), and the part it doesn't incorporate is 

the special circumstances on the income side.  It only 

incorporates special circumstances on the expense side. 

The significance of that is that what has been 

substituted for special circumstances on the income side 

is the 101(10A) formula minus certain expenses from 

707(b).

 The certain expenses from 707(b) are not a 

wild card.  They are IRS standards in certain other 

specially defined circumstances.  The idea that this 

would allow a phantom car payment -- no, we don't think 

so.  There is language in that section that says that 

the expenses have to be applicable and actual.

 And one case recently decided in the Ninth 

Circuit, the Ransom case, says that.  You have to look 

at the language in 707(b) in order to determine the 

propriety of the expenses, which has nothing to do with

Official - Subject to Final Review 

the applicability of the 6-month time frame.

 What the government and what the Respondent 

choose to do here is to basically gut the entire means 

test based upon one word, and that's "projected."  And 

they choose to use an undefined term "projected" over 

the statutory language that Congress chose to determine 

what debtors should pay to their creditors, and it's a 

congressional choice.  And as many commentators have 

suggested, if there is a remedy here, it is a 

congressional remedy and not a judicial remedy.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 10:55 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
