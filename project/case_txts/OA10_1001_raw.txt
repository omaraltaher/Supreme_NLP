12  raisable in the Arizona Court of Appeals on direct

object to the label "postconviction relief" as such.

23  counsel with respect to the postconviction first-tier 
24  review, portion of first-tier review, even though he did 
have a right to counsel in the appeal portion of direct

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if you --
MR. BARTELS:  -- happened in the direct 

appeal. 

the dictate of the State into two parts, that that 

1  review. 
2
 And our position is that that distinction 
3  between what are two portions of the first opportunity 
4  for review of a conviction, broken up sensibly but by 
5
6  distinction cannot stand, especially in a case in which 
7  the first postconviction proceeding started and ended 
8  before anything of substance --
9
10
11 
12
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If your main position is 
13  right, then wouldn't the same go for 2255 proceedings? 
14  I mean, this Court has said it makes sense to have the 
claims of ineffective assistance of counsel looked at by 
15
16  a trial judge first, not an appellate judge.  And yet in 
17  2255 proceedings, if you're urging ineffective 
18  assistance of counsel, you don't get an automatic right 
19  to counsel.  In 2255 proceedings, counsel will be 
20
21  interests of justice so require.  So, the proposition 
22  you're urging would have ramifications in the Federal 
23  system as well, wouldn't it? 
24
25

 MR. BARTELS:  That's correct, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And so, 2255 would no 

appointed only if the court determines that the 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company

file a 2255, that he would be entitled to appointed 
counsel but, as far as this case is concerned, only with 
respect to any claim of ineffective assistance of trial 
counsel. 

1  longer be the interests of justice so require because if 
2  it's your first opportunity to raise the point, the 
3  court must appoint counsel for you.  That's your view? 
 MR. BARTELS:  In a situation -- the Federal 
4
system is a little more complicated than Arizona, though 
5
6  not much, because of Massaro. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because of the what? 
7
 MR. BARTELS:  Our position would be, in the 
8
9  Federal system, if -- if a Federal defendant wished to 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  asserts a claim that could not have been asserted at an 
17  earlier point in the proceedings? 
18
19  caveat:  If the State allows that kind of proceeding. 
20
21  this context is, unlike the right to counsel at trial, 
22  the Sixth Amendment right, where I think they have to 
23  give him a trial, we're dealing in a context where this 
24  Court made clear well over 100 years ago that there 
doesn't have to be any review at all.  The State --
25

One of the things I have a hard time keeping track of in 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you want us to hold that 

there is a right to counsel whenever a petitioner 

 MR. BARTELS:  Yes, Your Honor, with the 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  That's a very far-reaching 

1
2  proposition that extends well beyond claims of 
3  ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, wouldn't it? 
4
 MR. BARTELS:  Yes.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  If many years after someone 
5
6  is convicted an allegation is made that the prosecution 
7  failed to turn over exculpatory evidence and that the 
8  information supporting the claim has just recently come 
9  to light and could not have been previously discovered, 
there would be a right to counsel there. 
10
11
 MR. BARTELS:  If the State --
12
 JUSTICE ALITO:  That would be the case? 
13
 MR. BARTELS:  If the State provided that 
14  proceeding, that -- and the State would not have to. 
The State could have statutes of limitation or rules 
15
16  against successive petitions that could be extremely 
17  strict if they're concerned about that. 
18
19  successive if it could not have been raised earlier?
 MR. BARTELS:  Your Honor, as I understand 
20
21  the situation, we've got newly discovered evidence of 
22  perhaps a Brady violation.  In that situation, if the 
23  State provides a proceeding for review of that, and it 
24  is the first opportunity for review, I think the 
25

implication of Douglas and Halbert is there would be a

stop this thing.  Right? 

 MR. BARTELS:  Well, but the Federal system 

straight to Federal habeas? 

 MR. BARTELS:  I think that's correct, Your 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if the State doesn't, 

1  right to counsel. 
2
3  but the Federal government does?  I mean, what if you 
4  say, you know, there's no State habeas available; you go 
5
6
7  Honor.  In the Federal system --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you haven't really given 
8
9  us a solution for the States.  They can't -- they can't 
10
11
12  itself has a statute of limitation, though I believe 
13  that the statute would probably begin to run, in Justice 
14  Alito's hypothetical, with the discovery of a Brady 
violation.  And so, the Federal courts have set up the 
15
16  statute of limitation to accommodate that claim.  And 
17  the States would be free to do that, too, if they 
18  wished. 
19
permitted this counsel to raise a claim that could not 
20
21  have been raised on the direct appeal, is the counsel 
22  limited to that point, or can the counsel representing 
23  the client bring up other things? 
24
25

 MR. BARTELS:  No, Your Honor.  The right to 
counsel would apply only to the first-tier review issue. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If -- if you are 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But could it be that the 

 MR. BARTELS:  The holding in this case will 

Halbert would imply that Brady would -- at least many 
Brady claims would be such that the 2255 or the State 
postconviction would be the first opportunity --

1  And so, for example, if counsel finds other issues and 
2  wants to pursue them, the State could say:  We're not 
3  going to pay you for those. 
4
counsel could also bring up a Brady claim, newly 
5
6  discovered evidence?  So wouldn't be limited to 
7  ineffective assistance of counsel. 
8
9  be so limited, but I would agree that Douglas and

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What if the --
14
 MR. BARTELS:  -- to present.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm sorry.  What if the 
15
16  ineffective assistance of counsel claim is closely 
17  related to other claims that petitioner wants to raise 
18  in an initial postconviction relief proceeding?  Counsel 
19  at trial was ineffective for failing to do A, B, C, and 
20
21  want to argue with new counsel in the first 
22  postconviction proceeding not only that counsel was 
23  ineffective at trial but also that all of these other 
24  claims are meritorious.
25

D, and all of those are bases for relief.  And now I 

 Are you saying that the counsel that -- to

 Now, the kind of situation you're talking 

 MR. BARTELS:  Your Honor, I think the 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  I don't 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's not a question of 
pay.  I think Justice Alito was asking, counsel says: 
I've got a duty to represent my client zealously.  So, I 
want to bring up not only ineffective assistance of 
counsel but these other matters.

1  whom the Petitioner has a right is limited to making 
2  only the ineffective assistance of counsel claim and 
3  cannot go on and represent the petitioner on these other 
4  claims?
 MR. BARTELS:  I'm saying, Your Honor, that 
5
6  the State does not have any duty to pay the lawyer in 
7  those circumstances. 
8
9  about I think is most likely to come up where --
10

13 
14 
15
16  appointment could be limited to the first-tier review 
17  issues. 
18
19  -- I don't understand how that works.  The claim is, 
20
21  didn't raise a Batson claim.  Surely, he gets to pursue 
22  the Batson claim once he establishes ineffectiveness --
23
24  in that example, pursuing the ineffective assistance 
25

say, for example, you were ineffective because you 

 MR. BARTELS:  Yes, Your Honor, and, in fact, 

claim requires pursuing the Batson claim.

 MR. BARTELS:  Well, Your Honor, in the

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But what --
 MR. BARTELS:  In my experience --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about other claims

2  lawyer -- the State would be required to provide counsel 
3  not simply to raise the threshold ineffectiveness 
4  argument, but to go ahead and raise the arguments as to 
5
6
7  situation in which the ineffectiveness of counsel is 
8  based on the failure to make a Batson claim, the failure 
9  to make an objection at trial, I would agree with you, 
10
11
12
13
14  that --
that don't follow on?  I mean, other -- other 
claimed errors in the trial.  You say the State doesn't

16  have to pay for that representation.  Does counsel keep 
17  time sheets on --
18

23  issues and not for other issues? 
24
25

 MR. BARTELS:  Yes, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the State pays for some 

 MR. BARTELS:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  That 

happens routinely in the State system.  The appointed

 MR. BARTELS:  Well, I think the States could

whether there is the potential for an IAC claim? 

1  counsel have to submit detailed billing statements --
2
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How does this work now, 
3  counsel?  How are you proposing this work?  Right now, 
4  in the Federal system, a pro se litigant comes in and 
says, I have an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. 
5
6  Most district courts say, ask the attorney to submit an 
7  affidavit, and then decides whether on the face of the 
8  claims there is reason to appoint counsel and hold a 
9  hearing.  Under your theory, every State would be 
10
11 
12
13  run this in different ways.  The way in which Arizona 
14  does it makes sense to me, which is that the -- there is 
15
16  doesn't require stating any substantive grounds.  It 
17  really just says, I would like to challenge my 
18  conviction through postconviction relief, in the very 
19  same way that notices of appeal.
20
21  essentially saying, every State is obligated to appoint 
22  an attorney on the first leg? 
 MR. BARTELS:  Every State is obligated to 
23
24  treat these, what are really parts of the appeal, the 
25

4  its progeny, and States don't routinely appoint

 MR. BARTELS:  Your Honor --
7
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What are we going to do 
8  about that reliance interest and the burdens on States? 
9
 MR. BARTELS:  Well, Your Honor, I -- I guess 
10
11  fair number of States that do appoint counsel routinely 
12  upon request. 
13
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I know --
14
 MR. BARTELS:  Arizona is one.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know for a fact that 
15
16  most do in capital cases.  But I don't know if that's 
17  the same figure for non-capital cases. 
 MR. BARTELS:  I don't know the percentage, 
18
19  Your Honor, but I know there are several States.  And --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't understand.  Could 
20
you answer the original question that Justice Sotomayor 
21 
22 
asked?  She said:  What happens in Arizona?  You said a 
prisoner, or defendant, he has been convicted, gone 
23 
24 
through his first round of appeal.  He is given a form, 
which you said is a simple form:  Do you want to proceed

we arguing about?  He had his lawyer. 

 MR. BARTELS:  He didn't have an effective 

 MR. BARTELS:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Then what are 

have a right to a lawyer when he wants to claim that the

24  what all the briefs are about, and I must be missing 
something, about whether they're all going to have to

 MR. BARTELS:  -- constitutes cause to

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. BARTELS:  Well, Your Honor, we're 

the claim that all 19 were ineffective he can't even 
raise.  That's the issue; is that it? 

1  appoint lawyers or not in these different States.  It 
2  seems to me that has nothing to do with this case. 
3
4  appoint lawyers, and the question is whether you, your 
client, should have from your point of view at least one 
5
6  full, effective chance to say:  Every lawyer I have been 
7  appointed, I've gotten 100, and they are all terrible. 
8  And -- or whether the State can block that from being 
9  heard in habeas, by saying, oh, no, we gave him 19, and 
10
11 
12
13  actually, once we take it past two, I -- I'm not on 
14  board with the hypothetical.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no.  But I'm not --
15
16  I'm not ridiculing as it sounded your claim.  I'm saying 
17  maybe that's right.  Maybe he's not going to win the 
18  claim, probably.  But the question is, if his claim is 
19  in Federal habeas, I have gotten 102 lawyers in 102 
20
21  ineffective, perhaps that habeas judge has to look at it 
22  and say, oh, I see, he's claiming he's never had one 
23  full effective chance to claim that his trial lawyer was 
24  ineffective because the other 19 were just as bad.  I

 Now, that's not a silly argument in my 

1
2  opinion; that could be a winning argument.  I just want 
3  to know is that basically your argument? 
 MR. BARTELS:  No, Your Honor.
4
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay. 
5
 MR. BARTELS:  That's not my argument. 
6
7
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now let's start at ground 
8  zero.  Sorry.  Everyone else --
 (Laughter.)
9
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why isn't that where your 
10
11  argument leads, to the proposition that you can never 
12  procedurally default irrevocably an ineffective 
13  assistance of counsel claim? 
14
theoretical level, I don't think this Court's decisions 
15
16  in Douglas and Ross and Halbert give us a clear answer 
17  about whether there's a right to effective assistance of 
18  second postconviction counsel. 
19
20
 MR. BARTELS:  I --
21
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We want to know why you're 
22
23  not advocating for what Justice Breyer and Justice Alito 
24  indicate is an endless right to claim that all previous 
counsel were ineffective.  You say, oh, no, you're not 
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But we want to know what 

 MR. BARTELS:  Well, Your Honor, on a 

rule you're advocating in this case. 

15
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. BARTELS:  Well, Your Honor, the -- the 

theory that you get counsel for first-tier review limits 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- I understand that. 
But what is it that prevents the Petitioner from saying 
that the first counsel in the collateral proceeding was 
ineffective and that so was the second? 

1  arguing that.  What is the rule that you are arguing 
2  for?  What limiting principle do you have so that we do 
3  not have an endless right of counsel? 
4
5
6  it to that first tier, because when you go after the 
7  effectiveness of this -- of the first postconviction 
8  counsel, that is necessarily going to involve review of 
9  the effectiveness of trial counsel --
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  to effective counsel in the second --
17
18  a -- you don't have to give him a counsel.  Look, the 
19  State did give him a counsel on first collateral review; 
20
21  the claim my trial counsel was no good. 
22
23  says:  I'm sorry, you are on your own here; we're not 
24  giving you a lawyer anymore.  Okay.  That may count.  He 
25

there's a right to a counsel and therefore not a right 

that counsel was supposed to, according to him, raise 

 Now we go to the next round.  The State 

now has to know he has to make the argument himself.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But you can -- you can have

 MR. BARTELS:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So, what --

1  And, therefore, he goes and makes the argument himself, 
2  and now he's in habeas and he can argue they got it all 
3  wrong.  He's not blocked. 
4
5
6  there isn't an issue in this case about giving people 
7  counsel, on that view.  There is an issue about if you 
8  do give them counsel, then they have to be able to have 
9  an argument later that you did it ineffectively.  That's 
a different matter; that's a question of whether you're 
10
11 
blocked in habeas and can't even make the claim. 
12
 All right, forget it.  I will ask the 
13  other --
14
15
16
17
18  claim --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But can I -- can I leave 
19
this argument with the -- with the judgment that you've 
20
21  offered me no limiting principle on how many proceedings 
22  there must be --
23
24
25

 MR. BARTELS:  Well --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- before there's an end 
to the argument that previous counsel were inadequate? 

 MR. BARTELS:  Well, Your Honor, I think I'm 

on the same page with that example. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, okay. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  But there can't be a

principle. 

 MR. BARTELS:  No, Your Honor, there should 

be.  And the merits -- the Petitioner's merits brief 

 MR. BARTELS:  Well, Your Honor --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if you want to say 

 I understand, this is the -- in this case, 
1
2  it was the first counsel in -- in the first collateral 
3  proceeding that we're talking about.  But why couldn't 
4  it be the second?  You don't give us a limiting

19  proceeding.

24  forth as to whether that line -- you know, what lies

 MR. BARTELS:  Yes. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  And the sensible place to 
draw the line, in your view, is after the first-tier 

1
2  theoretically.  And the State has the wherewithal, given 
3  McKane, to draw the line anywhere it pleases.  It could 
4  just say you get one postconviction.

12
 MR. BARTELS:  Yes, Your Honor, because I --

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But the problem with that is 
14  that you can answer that by saying, yes, we have to draw 
a line someplace; and the Court has already done it, and 
15
16  it did it in Douglas, and it said it was after the first 
17  tier of review on direct appeal.  It's exactly the same 
18  argument, except where the law stands now the line is 
19  drawn at a different place on the same principle.

11  change if ineffective assistance of counsel were part of 
12  the direct appeal. 
13
 And the other thing that would have to be 
14  done -- and this is done in some States -- is that you 
have to raise it in direct appeal, but most -- as this 
15
16  Court recognized in Massaro -- most ineffective 
17  assistance claims can't be dealt with on direct appeal 
18  because of a lack of evidence.  They need more evidence.

with on direct appeal, right?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- you could always claim 

1
2
3  that that counsel was ineffective in habeas, right? 
4
 MR. BARTELS:  Your Honor, I -- two things 
about that:  First of all, the State does not have to 
5
6  provide the review of the effectiveness of appellate 
7  counsel.  If it does so, I would still say that that's 
8  going to end up having to be second-opportunity review 
9  of the claims that appellate counsel failed to raise. 
10
11
12  counsel whenever someone asserts a claim that couldn't 
13  have been raised earlier, why does the State not have 
14  the obligation to provide counsel to contest the 
constitutionality of the representation that was 
15
16  provided on appeal? 
17
18  reason is that -- in terms of this first-tier, 
19  second-tier analysis from Douglas and Halbert, you're 
not going to be able to look at the effectiveness of 
20
21  appellate counsel without looking at the issue of 
22  prejudice.  And that's going to require what is 
23  second-opportunity review of the merits of the claim 
24  that the appellate lawyer didn't raise.  But that's the 
second opportunity for that review, because the direct

counsel's effectiveness, now it's the probability that 
the trial judge was wrong and that the appellate lawyer 
was wrong.  And so, it's exponentially lower and at 
least provides a basis for --

1  appeal was the first opportunity. 
2
3  v. Eldridge procedural due process analysis works 
4  better.  And the critical factor is what's the risk of

6
 Well, the first time around, the risk of

18  example of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. 
19

So, it's not necessarily unusual that an attorney 
reviewing the record might decide that there's some 
issue that could be raised in postconviction. 

1  issue that can only be raised on collateral review to 
2  think that it makes sense to raise that right away so 
3  that the appeal -- and then the appeal is delayed until 
4  that's resolved?
5
6  frequently, prior to the Spreitz decision.  And, 
7  historically, counsel was allowed -- counsel were 
8  allowed to raise claims of ineffective assistance and 
9  stay the appeal.  And that was the practice previously.

14  not -- we'll say this is my argument.  I don't want to

17  thinks trial counsel was inadequate.  Then there was a 
18  collateral review, and Arizona appoints a lawyer for 
19  that.  And after that, the Arizona courts thought, no, 
20
21  wants to say that that lawyer was inadequate, too.  In 
22  fact, it was the same one.  Hardly surprising.  All 
23  right?  That's his view. 
24
25

he was adequate at trial.  This particular defendant 

 Now, when he makes that argument in Federal 

court, I guess he's going to be met with the claim, 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  This is -- I'll 

make this your friend's argument. 

 In Arizona, there was a trial, and defendant

 MR. CATTANI:  Well, I -- I think it's better 

viewed through the lens of procedural due process.  If 

1  since Arizona didn't have to appoint the lawyer for 
2  collateral review, it doesn't matter what that lawyer 
3  does.  Is that right? 
4
5
6  -- we're looking at what are the procedures that are 
7  available to a defendant to raise a claim of ineffective 
8  assistance of trial counsel.  One of the ways that you 
9  can do that, that certainly goes a long way to 
10
11  counsel.  It could be accomplished without appointing

3  inadequate, you lose because we didn't have to give you 
4  one.

6

17  an adequate lawyer if you give him one.  If you give him 
18  one.  You don't have to give him one.  But if you give 
19  him one, it has to be adequate.  Now, what about that?
 MR. CATTANI:  Well, I think that goes well 
20
21  beyond this Court's previous jurisprudence. 
22
23  -- it does.  That's what I think we're at.  Now, why not

2  give him a lawyer at collateral review, but if it does, 
3  then that lawyer, he can say, couldn't make that claim 
4  because he was inadequate.  So, you say, fine, they can 
make that argument in habeas.  I bet they never win it. 
5
6  But somebody might.  He can make it. 
7
8  habeas judge in Federal habeas would read the piece of 
9  paper.  He'd say, what's the ground for thinking this? 
10
11
12  that view?  Is it absolutely blocked by precedent?  It 
13  seems to me it would relieve the concerns of the States 
14  about worrying about having to appoint a lot of lawyers,

17  precedent, certainly by Finley and Giarratano. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Because? 
18
 MR. CATTANI:  The problem with just shifting

 MR. CATTANI:  That's correct, but if you 
17  don't, then the problem is you shift over to Federal 
18  court, and on Federal habeas you're then -- you're then 
19  in the position of litigating claims that are untethered 
to any State court decision.  And when we talk about 
20
21  whether it's blocked by current precedent, certainly 
22  under Edwards v. Carpenter to allege ineffective

1
2  there's cause external to the petitioner to overcome the 
3  procedural default.  So, if you went down that road, 
4  would the petitioner representing himself or herself, 
not have to show that, I would have raised a claim of 
5
6  ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and I would 
7  have won on that, were it not for the fact that the 
8  State appointed counsel for me and led me astray and 
9  prevented me from raising this meritorious argument --
10
11
12  it's even more problematic here in that the procedure is 
13  that the attorney files a notice, gives notice to the 
14  defendant that she's been unable to find any colorable 
claims and gives the defendant an opportunity to file 
15
16  his own pleading.  So, it's -- it's somewhat illogical 
17  to think that if we just grant a second postconviction 
18  proceeding that the defendant is going to be in any 
19  better position than he's in, in this type of situation 
20
21  routinely the case, I'm unable to find colorable claims, 
22  and then the defendant is given an opportunity to file 
23  his own petition. 
24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And how much time.
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Cattani, have you --

where he's advised that the attorney says, as is 

36
 

Alderson Reporting Company

so on your own. 

 How much time would the defendant have?  How 

 MR. CATTANI:  I don't recall the specific 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How much time -- in the 
1
2  procedure you described, appointed counsel does inform 
3  Martinez:  I'm not bringing up any -- any claims for 
4  you.  So, if you want to pursue relief, you have to do 
5
6
7  much time remained? 
8
9  time.  I believe it is in the brief.  I'm sorry.  I 
don't recall the number of days that were remaining. 
10
11 
But, certainly, a defendant can request additional time 
if the period of time is very short at that point. 
12 
13 
Extensions are routinely granted in those circumstances. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Cattani, if you handled 
14
15
16  would receive the benefit of counsel.  Is that correct? 
17  Rather than shuttle this over to the postconviction 
18  review process?

22  your question is, would he be entitled to the effective 
23  assistance of the attorney developing that record --
24
25

 MR. CATTANI:  Well, the person -- here he 
receives the benefit of counsel because it's appointed 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, exactly right.
 MR. CATTANI:  And I don't think so 

this through the regular appeals process, the person 

37

distinction this Court has drawn between direct review 

could not raise -- pardon me -- in which you could raise 
the particular issue at hand.  But that's not this case. 

 MR. CATTANI:  Well, I don't think it's 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But those -- those were --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Try it this way.  Try --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- cases in which you 

1  necessarily.  I think that's a different -- I think the 
2  attack on the effectiveness of collateral review -- of 
3  trial counsel is itself a collateral attack.  And I 
4  think under Finley and Giarratano -- and I think the 
5
6  and collateral attacks is one that should be maintained. 
7  And in theory --
8

10

12 
13
14  ever --
15
16 
17 
18 
19
20
21  following is -- is something that was -- that was in 
22  play at the time of Finley and Giarratano.  What -- what 
23  Arizona does is not extraordinary; it really follows 
24  what has been recommended in Massaro, that -- that 
25

not the rationale of those cases, which you state 
correctly, is applicable to a different set of 
circumstances. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The question is whether or 

 MR. CATTANI:  Well, I'm -- I'm not sure I'm 
following, because I think the procedure that Arizona is 

claims relating to --

38
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but those were, 

Court noted that it would be rare for any -- for a 

1
2  correct me if I'm wrong, cases -- those were not cases 
3  in which the issue could only be raised on collateral. 
 MR. CATTANI:  Well, I think in Massaro this 
4
5
6  defendant to be entitled to relief on a claim that could 
7  be raised on direct appeal.  And --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Massaro, indeed, said 
8
9  that there are good reasons for withdrawing this issue 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
 MR. CATTANI:  That's -- it's a difficult 
18
19  question.  I -- I don't think they would, because I 
20
21  -- the effectiveness of trial counsel. 
22
23  the regular appeals process?  It's just the way the --
24  because of the issues that we recognized in Massaro, the 
25

and putting it in a different kind of process.  So, 
suppose the State does this, and some States do it: 
They say, on -- in the direct appeal process, we're 
going to remand this issue back to the trial court 
because the trial court is good with the facts and can 
make an evaluation.  But it is part of the direct appeal 
process, this -- this remand.  Would the person then be 
entitled to effective assistance of counsel? 

think it's still a collateral proceeding to address the 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Even though now it's part of 

State has decided to structure things in this way? 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

determines is appropriately raised as a collateral 
attack, even if there's been no first review of that 
question, there's no entitlement to counsel? 

 MR. CATTANI:  Well, I think more important 
1
2  than the -- than the label that's been put on it is the 
3  nature of the -- of the argument that's being advanced, 
4  and it's a collateral attack, whether it -- whether a 
State chooses to call it part of the appeal.  What 
5
6  happened -- what happened in Arizona previously was 
7  that it would be --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, now you're creating a 
8
9  different rule.  You're saying anything which somebody 
10
11 
12 
13
14  logical extension of what this Court announced in Finley 
15
16  distinction between --
17
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I don't think, as 
18  Justice Kennedy said, that we ever really considered 
19  that question in Finley and Giarratano because we were 
assuming there that all the things had been through the 
20
21  appeals process. 
 MR. CATTANI:  But I guess I'm not certain 
22
23  that the timing would make a difference of when -- of 
24  whether you had a direct appeal first or whether the 
25

collateral proceeding occurs first.  In either case, the 

 MR. CATTANI:  Well, I think that's the 

v. -- Finley and Giarratano, that we've drawn this 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, Justice Kagan's 

what's happening; it's a non-record based attack on the 

1  collateral proceeding is a non-record-based attack on 
2  the conviction, as opposed to the direct review, which 
3  is a record-based review of the conviction.  So, the 
4  timing I don't think is as important as the nature of 
5
6  conviction. 
7
8  question indicates that there are States, as you know, 
9  where on direct appeal they can allow for an evidentiary 
hearing on IAC.  And as I understand your answer, is if 
10
11 
that happens, the proceedings that precede the 
resolution of the issue on direct appeal, being probably 
12 
13 
conducted by the same counsel who is taking the direct 
appeal, can be conducted and he can be -- and the 
14 
counsel, he or she, can be inadequate in the conduct of 
15
16 
those further inquiries.  That seems to me very strange. 
17
18  suggesting that would be the desired outcome.  And it's 
19  simply that drawing the distinction between 
20
21
22  there's no constitutional right to effective assistance 
23  of counsel on direct, when he conducts some 
24  supplementary proceedings.  That's very strange.
25

 MR. CATTANI:  Well, I guess the suggestion 

 MR. CATTANI:  Well, I don't think we're 

collateral --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You're suggesting that 

41
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You mean -- it makes no 

1  is that it's a collateral -- that's a collateral 
2  proceeding.  If they -- if you stay the proceeding and 
3  go back and address ineffective assistance, that that 
4  would essentially be a collateral proceeding.
5
6  sense to me.  That happens quite frequently on direct 
7  appeal where a variety of issues are raised, and the 
8  court -- the circuit courts or the appellate courts send 
9  it back to trial counsel to develop the record further. 
Your position is every time there's a sending back, that 
10
11 
stops the need for effective counsel? 
12
13  for a new hearing, I think that's something different. 
14  I think you --
15
16 
17
18
19  for this case?
20
21  think it's clear that --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's another case.  It's --
22
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the reason I think 
23
24  it's relevant is that if you were to say that there 
25

 MR. CATTANI:  -- at that point. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do we have to decide this 

needed to be effective assistance of counsel there, then 

 MR. CATTANI:  If they've sent something back 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that involved in this 

case? 

 MR. CATTANI:  I don't think we need to.  I 

42
 

Alderson Reporting Company

inquiry, then it makes more sense, I think, to -- to 
couch it in terms of this is collateral review.  But, 
certainly, I think --

1  I would have asked you, what is the difference between 
2  this case and that case?  So, that's the reason it's 
3  relevant to this case, because the difference is really 
4  just one of just labels.
 MR. CATTANI:  Well, and that's why I think 
5
6  it's more important to -- to assess the inquiry that's 
7  being done, whether it's a collateral inquiry, as 
8  opposed to whether we're labeling it part of the -- the 
9  direct appeal or not.  And if it is a collateral 
10
11 
12 
13
14  rational line between collateral attack and attack in 
the same proceeding.  I don't see anything irrational 
15
16  about that.  Right? 
 MR. CATTANI:  No --
17
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes! 
18
 MR. CATTANI:  Yes, I agree.  Yes.
19
 (Laughter.) 
20
21
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would you explain to me, 
22  why don't we consider this adverse to your proceeding, 
23  because this postconviction proceeding -- it began and 
24  it began at the same time as the direct appeal, but it 
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  There seems to be a 

ended before this case became final. 

43
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 So, it was the first -- it was the first 
1
2  tier because it was decided before the direct appeal. 
 MR. CATTANI:  Well, it is a first-tier 
3
4  collateral attack.  I would agree that it's a first 
tier.  That's the first time that this issue is raised 
5
6  in a collateral attack.  But I don't -- I don't think 
7  that's determinative of the issue here. 
 This Court has never -- has never said that 
8
9  every claim that can only be raised for the first time 
entitles someone to -- to counsel.  And that exception, 
10
11 
that would -- that would swallow the rule.  In Arizona, 
in most States where the types of claims that can be 
12 
13 
raised in postconviction proceedings are generally 
limited to claims that could not have been raised 
14 
earlier. 
15
16
17  really would swallow -- the exception would swallow the 
18  rule that was announced in -- in Finley -- and 
19  Giarratano.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL 

 So, the rule that Petitioner is seeking 

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT 

44
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. WALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, I want to go 

discretion of the trial court or the public defender. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Forty-seven do and the 

1
2  please the Court: 
3
4  to your questions about the costs, because there are 
some very real costs here.  We live in a world that is 
5
6  settled and working.  Although this Court has drawn the 
7  line at the first direct appeal, 47 States, D.C., and 
8  the Federal Government provide counsel in a first 
9  postconviction proceeding, either as of right or in the 
10
11
12  Federal Government does? 
13
 MR. WALL:  That's right.  So, there are 18 
14  States that provide it as of right; 29 States and D.C. 
provide it in the discretion of the trial court or the 
15
16  public defender, and then the Federal Government, 
17  obviously, in the discretion of the district courts. 
18
19  constitutionalizing that area, is shifting resources to 
20
21
22  it's small comfort to the lawyer -- the client who 
23  doesn't get one that everybody else does. 
24
25

 MR. WALL:  Mr. Chief Justice, I understand, 
but I think this is an area where States are permitted 

a subset of ineffectiveness claims. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's pretty --

 And so, what Petitioner is doing, by 

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

either trial or appellate counsel, he's entitled to 

1  to draw different lines.  And what Petitioner is saying 
2  -- take the Federal system, for example.  Petitioner's 
3  rule would say a Federal prisoner can walk in under 
4  2255, and by making an allegation of ineffectiveness of 
5
6  appointed counsel without even, I take it, a showing of 
7  colorableness. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, not if you adopt the 
8
9  -- the one-proceeding rule that I think counsel for the 
Petitioner was suggesting.  He suggested Arizona is one 
10
11 
of those few States where you could only raise this 
issue on collateral, and, therefore, you are entitled to 
12 
13 
effective assistance of counsel on that collateral. 
Then he would stop there, for statistical and for --
14 
reasons, probability reasons, rather. 
15
16
 MR. WALL:  I think that's exactly where he 
17  would stop.  I think it's very difficult to explain why 
18  his rule doesn't require him to go further, because by 
19  saying the first tier is not a stage of a case, as this 
20
21  claim, and lawyers are going to represent you only on 
22  some claims, and you're -- pro se you'll file others, he 
23  ends up with two problems. 
24
25

reply brief and as he did in response to Justice Alito, 

Court has always meant it, but it applies claim by 

 One, he has to concede, as he does in his 

46
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

trial counsel was ineffective. 

1  that he's going to say the same thing with regard to a 
2  lot of other claims that are typically raised in habeas; 
3  and, second, he can't find a limiting principle. 
4  Because when you come in on your second or your third or 
your fourth postconviction proceeding, and you say all 
5
6  my previous counsel has been ineffective, that's also 
7  the first time that you've been able to say it, and 
8  you'll be making the same claim:  I'm entitled to have 
9  one constitutionally competent lawyer argue that my 
10
11
 JUSTICE BREYER:  What about not going that 
12  far?  What about saying:  In this case -- in this case, 
13  Arizona did give him a lawyer.  In this case, it was the 
14  same lawyer.  In this case, the proceeding was filed 
prior to the completion of the appeal and ended before 
15
16  the completion of the appeal.  So, for this case, this 
17  counts as the one round of proceedings, and, therefore, 
18  his client can in fact assert that that single 
19  individual who was his lawyer was incompetent in those 
20
21  termination of the appeal, ended first. 
22
23  problem with that, Justice Breyer:  This Court said in 
24  Coleman, and before that in Murray v. Carrier and in 
Wainwright v. Torna, that if you don't have a Federal 
25

proceedings that ended -- didn't end prior to the 

 MR. WALL:  Here's -- here's the primary 

47
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

process claim. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but it didn't face the 

1  constitutional right to counsel and the States or 
2  Congress go beyond what they're constitutionally 
3  required to do when they give you a lawyer, that 
4  lawyer's performance does not thereby give rise to a due 
5
6
7  issue of what about a claim that you have a 
8  constitutional right to bring up at least once?  And 
9  this is the first time he was able to bring it up.  So 
in other words, Coleman didn't face this problem.  It's 
10
11 
as if you couldn't bring up the claim that the judge was 
sleeping until you got to collateral proceedings.  A 
12 
13 
State could have such a rule.  I don't know why they 
would, but they could.  But if they did, it would be 
14 
your first chance ever to attack that trial process, and 
15
so isn't Coleman, in its effort to bar relitigation, 
16 
17 
actually rather beside the point? 
18
19  see the case in fundamentally different ways.  His first 
opportunity to raise his trial ineffectiveness claim was 
20
21  in his first postconviction proceeding, and he had the 
22  opportunity to raise it, and his lawyer didn't.  And 
23  what he's coming in and saying now is not I was deprived 
24  of an opportunity to raise it, as in your --
25

 MR. WALL:  Justice Breyer, I think we just 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No. 

48
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. WALL:  Justice Breyer, I think this case 

 MR. WALL:  -- hypothetical, but I had the 
1
2  opportunity and I didn't, and we should excuse that --
 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, we're saying it the 
3
4  same way, just as if his lawyer, when he could raise the 
fact that the judge was sleeping, didn't raise it 
5
6  because he was staring at the ceiling and had been 
7  drinking too much.  Just as he could raise that point in 
8  habeas, because it's his first chance to do it, so he 
9  could raise the point that the lawyer, the first time 
that he had the chance to raise the ineffectiveness of 
10
11 
trial counsel, was incompetent, et cetera. 
12
13  presents a much narrower question, which is, when he 
14  comes in, in his second postconviction proceeding, and 
15
16  cause to excuse that default because my lawyer was 
17  ineffective, this Court's been clear in three different 
18  cases that that's only cause if he had a constitutional 
19  right to counsel in the proceeding that he's pointed to 
20
21
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What you haven't told me 
22  is a reason why he shouldn't have had effective counsel 
23  in the first postconviction proceeding?  I mean, our 
24  entire line of cases under Douglas were premised on the 
fact that defendants would not be or couldn't be charged 
25

says although I didn't raise it last time around, I have 

and that he complains about.  So, the question --

49
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 But if your first chance as to present 

ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a 

have competent counsel below who would make the best 

1  with the ability to prosecute their claims through 
2  direct appeal.  Discretionary appeal, we said the 
3  likelihood is they could do it on discretionary appeal 
4  because they would have a record from below; they would 
5
6  arguments possible.  They could then pursue their 
7  discretionary appeals because they had something to work 
8  with. 
9
10
11  postconviction proceeding, you have no record to work 
12  with. 
13
14  I think this is a very different case from Douglas and 
15
16  equal protection concern, that indigent defendants would 
17  be denied a first look, maybe an only look, at their 
18  convictions and sentences. 
19
20
21  defendants are getting looks at their convictions and 
22  sentences, as Petitioner did.  They're providing 
23  postconviction review. 
24
25

Halbert, which were grounded in a fairly fundamental 

 Here, we're facing something very different. 

States like Arizona are giving direct appeals; 

 MR. WALL:  That's right.  Justice Sotomayor, 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but it is the first 

look --

50
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

right? 

Official 

 MR. WALL:  They're even providing lawyers in 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- only look at the 

Mr. Wall, if a State did the following:  If it said 

1
2  postconviction review. 
3
4  effective assistance claims.  So, what would you say, 
5
6  we're going to take out all Fourth Amendment exclusion 
7  claims, and we're going to put that in a postconviction 
8  review system, and, you know what, there you're not 
9  entitled to an effective lawyer -- would that be all 
10
11
 MR. WALL:  Justice Kagan, I think there are 
12  any number of claims that if a State tried to pull them 
13  out of direct appeal and locate them in collateral 
14  review, we might be able to say it's end-running its 
15
16  claims based on a trial record that ought to be -- and 
17  always have belonged to direct appeal.  The question is, 
18  does a State act arbitrarily when it takes an 
19  ineffectiveness claim, which is the only type of claim 
20
21  review --
22
23  would not say it was acting arbitrarily in my example. 
24  The State would say there's a good reason for it: 
25

obligation under Douglas, because those are the types of 

Fourth Amendment exclusion claims are disfavored; they 

that a State has tried to relocate into collateral 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I'm sure the State 

51
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. WALL:  Justice Kagan, I just -- I think 

 So, I think that the State would have many 
good reasons, but, you know, it's also true that there 

1  have nothing to do with innocence; they involve a kind 
2  of fact-intensive inquiry that is better done in a 
3  different proceeding. 
4
5
6  you don't get a lawyer. 
7
8  that the Court's case law would -- I mean, I think it 
9  would be a difficult question, the Court having said 
that under Stone, at least in the Federal system, the 
10
11 
Fourth Amendment -- Fourth Amendment claims can't be 
raised on habeas.  I think it would be difficult for a 
12 
13 
State to come in and say they have to be raised in 
habeas.
14 
15
16  are best suited to resolution in habeas, and they're 
17  claims that are traditionally brought in habeas.  And at 
18  least for that type of claim, which is the -- I mean, 
19  the State's not trying to hide the ball here.  All the 
State has done is take a claim that this Court has said 
20
21  belongs at habeas and say we're putting it in habeas, 
22  not as in the Federal system where, although people can 
23  raise it as a practical matter, they're all decided on 
24  collateral review, or virtually all of them.  It says 
25

 Here, the Court said in Massaro these claims 

we're just going to save people the trouble of briefing 

52
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

channel them to collateral review.  But I -- all Arizona 

1  and raising it, and we'll locate it to collateral 
2  review, not for an invidious or arbitrary reason, but 
3  for all the reasons that this Court gave in Massaro. 
4
 So, at least for that type of claim, I think 
it's permissible under the Fourteenth Amendment, leaving 
5
6  for another day whether it could do it with other types 
7  of claims that I do think probably belong to a direct 
8  appeal.  And that would present very different 
9  constitutional problems if a State started trying to 
10
11  has done is pick up on Massaro and say, absolutely 
12  right, these claims belong in habeas, and that's where 
13  we're going to put them.

17 
18 
19
20
21  promise if what you're giving is incompetent counsel? 
22
23
24  Strickland is a very high standard.
25

the vast majority of States -- 47, I think, is the 
number you gave -- put this into postconviction -- give

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY ROBERT D. BARTELS 

1  States have found under their own constitutions or 
2  statutes a right to effective assistance of counsel. 
3  But it's a very different matter to say that when States 
4  go beyond what the Constitution requires in providing 
counsel, that counsel's performance thereby gives rise 
5
6  to a due process claim.  And, again, the Court's 
7  rejected that in at least three cases, and I think 
8  saying that it's cause to excuse a procedural default 
9  here without saying that there's some underlying right 
10
11
12
13
14
15
16  straighten out one thing about -- it's not only about 
17  the record -- about the facts.  This is not in the 
18  record, and I'm really doing this for my friend's 
19  benefit.  Harriette Levitt was initially appointed to 
represent Mr. Martinez on appeal.  She then moved to 
20
21  have herself appointed for purposes of the 
22  postconviction review, and it was at a later date, not 
23  too much later, that she filed the notice.  So that at 
24  the time the notice was filed, she was officially 
appointed counsel for purposes of postconviction 
25

 The other point that I wanted to get to was 

the questions about other States where this -- these 

 All these claims, almost all of them, 

1  proceedings, and the Arizona Court of Appeals stayed 
2  their proceedings, which were ongoing.  There was a 
3  notice of appeal to allow this to continue.

6  claims are handled on direct appeal illustrate a couple 
7  of things about our argument:  One is it would be --
8  seem very peculiar to say you have a right to appointed 
9  and effective counsel in Wisconsin or Utah on these 
issues, but not in Arizona, where the label -- the 
10
11  difference is purely label. 
12
13  require additional evidence, and that fact makes counsel 
14  even more important.  Respondents want to say you have a
