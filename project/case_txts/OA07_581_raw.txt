 (11:00 a.m.)
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

next in Case 07-581, 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett.

 Mr. Salvatore.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL SALVATORE
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 MR. SALVATORE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 There are three reasons why this Court 
should reverse the Second Circuit's blanket ban on 
collectively bargained, arbitral forum -- forum 
selection clauses.

 First, the Second Circuit ignored section 

(a) of the National Labor Relations Act, by which 
Congress empowered unions to bargain on behalf of their 
employees over anything germane to the working 
environment, including methods of workplace dispute 
resolution.

 The forum in which an ADEA claim is heard 
falls squarely in that authority.  Indeed, forbidding 
unions from bargaining about the procedural right to an 
arbitral forum will carve a judicial exception into the 
labor law permitting employers to bypass the union and 
deal directly with their employees, defeating Congress's

national labor policy.

 Second, the Second Circuit failed to 

consider Congress's strong endorsement of workplace 
arbitration contained in both the FAA and section 301.
 Third, the Second Circuit erroneously and 
exclusively relied on Alexander versus Gardner-Denver. 
Gardner-Denver is a case about claim preclusion, not 
about enforcing an agreement to arbitrate a statutory 
claim.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Salvatore, you take the 

position that the only thing that is at stake here is 
simply, in effect, a selection of the arbitral forum.

 What do you -- what do you say to the 
argument that, in fact, the -- under -- under the 
collective bargaining agreement the employee is subject 
not merely to the right of the union to choose the 
arbitral forum, but, in fact, to -- to assert any claim 
at all?  What -- what is your answer to that?

 MR. SALVATORE:  Your Honor, in -- in our 

collective bargaining agreement, the collective 
bargaining agreement here, the -- the union -- the 
employee tenders the claim to the union.  And in the 
majority of cases the -- the employee and the union's 
interests will be aligned, and the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But here it wasn't.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  What -- what --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Here we are dealing with 
claims that the union said:  Sorry, we are not going to 
process these claims because we have some tension since 
the younger workers that replaced you, we also represent 
them.

 So you are proposing, as far as I understand 

it, a situation where these workers would have no 
individual right at all if the union says:  We -- we 
won't represent you.

 MR. SALVATORE:  No, Your Honor.  The -- the 

clause requires all claims to be arbitrated, and "all 
claims" means that the individuals then have to go to 
arbitration with their private counsel in this case and 
-- and have their claims heard in the arbitral forum. 
So that no one is denying --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where does -- where does 

the contract say anything about the -- the individual 
succeeding to whatever arrangement there is between the 
union and the employer?

 MR. SALVATORE:  Your Honor, I'm looking at 

the petition appendix.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that only --

only the union can invoke the arbitration clause, not an 
individual.

MR. SALVATORE:  No, Your Honor.  That's --

that's not the -- the way the contract reads.  I'm 
looking at the petition appendix page 48a, which is the 
"no discrimination" clause.

 And just -- just as a quick prelude to --

before I -- I go through that language, I just want to 
-- to note that this argument that these employees were 
not bound to go individually to arbitration was never 
raised below.

 The Second Circuit did not consider it. 

Indeed, the Second Circuit found that the clause covered 
these employees, and -- and this only came up in the 
Respondents' brief in this Court after cert was granted, 
the red brief.

 So that this -- this argument is one that 

the factual premises for were never considered below in 
the district court or in -- in the court of appeals.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just so I'm clear --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't -- I don't wish to 

delay your reading, but -- but as -- as part of the 
decision we have to make, don't we have to have in the 
background the consideration of the -- that the -- the 
potentiality that the union might do just what it did 
here, and that would help, it seems to me, inform our 
decision on the question that you are presenting.

Now, whether or not it's properly raised 
here, I do agree with you it comes rather late.  But 
isn't it a factor that we must necessarily consider?
 MR. SALVATORE:  Yes, Your Honor.  And --

and, indeed, the collective bargaining agreements --and 
we'll look at the language in one second -- are -- are, 
as this Court has recognized, a little more complicated 
to understand than -- than average contracts.  You have 
to look at the practice and the custom.

 The practice here for this union has been to 

turn over claims to the individuals.  We've had this 
clause in place for nine years.  The New York courts 
have enforced it repeatedly and -- and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is this included in the 

question presented anyway?

 MR. SALVATORE:  It was -- it was not, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does it have anything to do 

with the way the Second Circuit resolved this case?
 MR. SALVATORE:  It does not, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The Second Circuit simply 

said you could not deprive an individual of the right to 
a court trial.

 MR. SALVATORE:  Absolutely, Justice Scalia.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the issue is whether --

now, if -- if we held that you can require the 
individual to go to arbitration, in some later case we 
could confront the question of whether, if the union is 
in exclusive control of the arbitration and the -- the 
individual will -- will not get a fair arbitrated deal, 
that would invalidate it.

 But it has nothing to do with the question 
presented:  Is an arbitration clause which clearly and 
unmistakably waives the union member's right to a 
judicial forum enforceable.

 MR. SALVATORE:  Absolutely, Justice Scalia. 

That is my argument with respect to why this does not 
need to be taken up now.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I hate to get into 

this, you know, 9 years history of dealings between the 
union and -- and the employees.

 MR. SALVATORE:  There is no factual record, 

Your Honor, for it in the record at all.  And --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, there is at least 

some.  The collective bargaining agreement is in here. 
And if we are deciding anything at all, we are going to 
decide whether in this case the -- the Second Circuit 
was correct.

 The question is posed in generalities, but 

we are not going to decide the general question in total

ignorance of this case.  And in this case we've got the 
particular collective bargaining agreement in front of 
us, and you started to answer the question that -- that 
I and Justice Ginsburg posed by referring to the "no 
discrimination" clause.

 MR. SALVATORE:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And will -- will you go on 

to that?

 MR. SALVATORE:  I will.  The clause is -- I 

am looking at petition appendix 48a, the "no 
discrimination" clause.  This is the -- the clause at 
issue in this case.  It covers any present or future 
employee.  It goes on to state the -- the types of 
protected characteristics that are covered by this 
clause as well as the -- the relevant statutes 
incorporating statutory law, public law, in the -- in 
the clause.

 And then in the second-to-last sentence five 

lines up from the bottom it states:  "All such claims 
shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration 
procedure, Articles 5 and 6, as the sole and exclusive 
remedy for violations."

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What does that mean?  Does 
that mean that they must go to arbitration even if the 
union decides that, you know, this claim is -- is so

insignificant we don't want to take it to arbitration?
 MR. SALVATORE:  What this means, Justice 
Scalia, is that these individuals cannot go to court. 
They have to go either through the union, as has been 
the practice here, or the union will turn the claim over 
to them and let them go by themselves.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Where did we get this 

phrase -- where do we get the language "or the union 
will turn over to them"?  The only thing that I can see 
in here that addresses that is on page 46a.  And the --
the clause there reads:  "All union claims are brought 
by the union alone, and no individual shall have the 
right to compromise or settle any claim without the 
written permission of the union."

 There is -- there is a lot of gray area in 

that, but the one thing that seems clear is that the 
union has total control over any claim, including an 
arbitration claim.

 And that seems to lend some substance to the 
-- to the point made by the other side that if we accept 
your position here, we are accepting a position not 
nearly as far -- that the designation -- a procedural 
designation of a forum should be enforced but that, in 
fact, total control over the assertion of a statutory 
Federal right is also being ceded.  Now, why doesn't

that language from section 46 support that?

 MR. SALVATORE:  Your Honor, it does not 

support it for the -- for the following reason.  The --
the section 30 clause on page 48a.  The "no 
discrimination" clause, was added in 1999.  It was added 
after the Court's decision in Wright.  It was added to 
comply with Wright.  That's an undisputed fact.

 It -- it was added as a separate section 

with a separate arbitration promise because "all claims" 
is broader than "union claims."  "Union claims" was 
something that goes back for 75 years, but before we put 
in section 30 --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, then, "all such 

claims" -- "such claims" refers among other things to 
the statutory right.

 MR. SALVATORE:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And if the statutory right 
is the appropriate section of an arbitration agreement 
and the union has ultimate control of the arbitration 
agreement, then it follows that the union has got 
ultimate control over the assertion of the statutory 
right.

 MR. SALVATORE:  No, Your Honor, not unless 

-- not if the union turns that over.  The employee's 
reading --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Where -- where is the 

guarantee that the -- if the union says, we don't want 
to touch this, as in this case, that the employee has 
the right either to arbitrate or, for that matter, to 
sue?  Where do you find that?

 MR. SALVATORE:  Your Honor, that -- that 

right is -- is described from this language, "all such 
claims."  There is another route.  What Articles 4, 5, 
and 6 describe is that -- that the -- you must go to the 
office of the contract arbitrator, and it doesn't 
specify whether you go with the union or you go by 
yourself.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Has any court decided this 

issue of the interpretation of the collective bargaining 
agreement in this particular.

 MR. SALVATORE:  No court has decided this 
very issue like this, Justice Alito.  But what the New 
York courts have said is in interpreting this clause 
over the last nine years, that they compel the 
individual union member to go to arbitration when they 
have brought claims in court in violation of this 
clause.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Salvatore, I -- I 

didn't think we took this case to -- to determine the 
specific meaning as to this issue of this -- of this

particular contract, which is not an issue of national 
importance.  Why -- why must we decide the case here?

 Could we not simply decide that the Second 

Circuit was either correct, in which case the case would 
be over, or incorrect to say that you -- that you -- you 
cannot -- you cannot in a collective bargaining 
agreement have the union responsible for arbitration of 
Title VII claims?  Why couldn't we just decide that?

 And then if there is any issue of whether 
such concession to the union deprives an individual of 
even the right to arbitration, that can -- that can be 
decided on remand by the Second Circuit, couldn't it?

 MR. SALVATORE:  Absolutely, Justice Scalia.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the Second Circuit 

could look into all of these details.

 MR. SALVATORE:  Absolutely.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And inquire into the New 

York law that you're talking about now and that I don't 
recall being in any of the briefing.

 MR. SALVATORE:  Justice Scalia, as cited in 

our briefing, there is a long footnote listing the 
cases.  But -- but you're right, the -- the issue here 
really is can the union agree to this?  And that goes to 
Congress's giving the union the power under section 9(a) 
of the National Labor Relations Act to be the exclusive

bargaining representative --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I ask you -- let me ask you 

a naive question possibly that may -- may reflect a 
misunderstanding.  But my understanding is that suppose 
you are -- you are an employee.  You believe your 
employer discriminated against you, say, on gender 
grounds.  You have to go to the EEOC.

 Now, the EEOC looks into it and very often 

what they do is they don't really resolve it.  They just 
give you a letter that gives you a right to sue.

 So here Congress was so worried about this 

kind of thing that they said our specialized agency, you 
know, won't be the bottom line.  People will go there 
and then they have a right to sue later.

 Now, that's how Congress felt about this 

particular statute.  Why would they want the union to be 
the bottom line when, in fact, the employee himself 
hasn't agreed?  I mean, the employee might agree in the 
first place.  He might say I'm going to take that 
letter, I'm not going to bring my suit.  That's up to 
him or her.  But here the employee wants to bring her 
suit, just like the EEOC letter.

 MR. SALVATORE:  Well, Justice Breyer, the 

ADEA provides not only a right to go to court after 
you've gotten your right-to-sue letter or waited 60

days, but -- but it also provides multiple, as this 
court recognized in Gilmer, multiple avenues that 
Congress wants to use:  Conciliation, persuasion, 
conference --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Exactly.  That's my point, 
is that the statute as a whole reflects a considerable 
effort not to let this employee get cut off at the pass 
and an employee who is reasonably determined to get to 
court probably can do it.  It's not definite.  The EEOC 
doesn't have to give them a letter giving them a right 
to sue, but probably can do it.

 And if that's a situation where you have 

this whole expert thing cut in, it seems to me there is 
a parallel here that Congress then wouldn't want the 
union and the employer together to be able to cut that 
right to sue off, at least not very easily.

 MR. SALVATORE:  Justice Breyer, you have 

competing policies here because you have the policies of 
the labor laws which say that unions should have a -- a 
broad portfolio of -- of topics to bargain about.  This 
Court has said that anything germane to the working 
environment, dispute resolution mechanisms --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the union could not 
bargain about these anti-discrimination rights.  These 
are rights given to individuals by Congress.  The union

couldn't bargain about them the way it bargains about 
collective rights, the way it bargains about wages and 
hours and -- and other things.  This is, this is not a 
bargainable right.  This is a right Congress says you as 
an individual have a right not to be discriminated 
against.  This is nothing that the union can bargain 
about.

 MR. SALVATORE:  Justice Ginsburg, I agree to 

the degree we're talking about -- you're talking about 
substantive rights.  What we are talking about here is a 
procedural switch.  As this Court has approved in 
Gilmer, what we are talking about is moving the forum 
from the judicial one to the -- to the arbitral one. 
And here in the -- the scheme of a collective bargaining 
agreement where arbitration is the preferred remedy and 
has been used for many, many years very successfully in 
the -- in the -- by those parties.

 It's -- it's taking employment arbitration 

and putting it in the collective bargaining context. 
And -- and there is, unions do this in many different 
ways.  Unions bargain about substantive rights.  We are 
not talking about substantive rights here, though.  We 
are talking about procedural rights.  And the policies 
of the labor laws are served and the policies of the 
ADEA and the anti-discrimination statutes are not

disserved in any way.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Salvatore, would you --
would you object to or oppose a ruling that said -- that 
says yes, the -- the right can be subjected to union 
arbitration, but if the union chooses not to arbitrate 
it the individual must have the right to arbitrate it on 
his own?

 MR. SALVATORE:  That's -- that's the 

practice under this agreement, Your Honor.  We would --
we would wholeheartedly endorse that -- that rule 
because, that's the practice here.  And there is -- when 
you're talking about statutory rights, why would the 
union want to interfere with the ability of the employee 
to get a forum if their interests are not aligned?  This 
goes to the tension that this Court has -- has 
recognized in its prior cases.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that -- that means 

that if there is z totally frivolous claim and the 
employer -- pardon me, the union says we are not going 
to arbitrate, the -- the employee still has the right to 
then proceed?  The employer hasn't gotten very much.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  He has got an arbitration 

instead of a lawsuit.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you would -- if you 

would answer the question.  The employer hasn't gotten

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- very much for the

bargain.

 MR. SALVATORE:  Justice Kennedy, the 

employer has gotten arbitration and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In the hard cases.
 MR. SALVATORE:  Well, in --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it hasn't got the 

ability to have the union help them weed out frivolous 
claims.

 MR. SALVATORE:  Well that's true.  The 

union -- the union wouldn't play that function, except 
that we have in this industry, the real estate industry 
in New York City, a longstanding relationship that --
that goes back decades.  And -- and -- so it's a mature 
collective bargaining arrange -- arrangement.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'm -- I'm -- I'm 

not sure that employers nationwide would -- would --
would accept -- would accept that view.

 MR. SALVATORE:  Well, I think that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And again, maybe that's --

that's a reason for us not to reach it in this case.
 MR. SALVATORE:  Well, one of the issues 

that -- that Congress allows the bargaining parties to

figure out is what the scope of their collective 
bargaining arrangement should be.  That's one of the 
hallmarks of the NRLA.  So, yes, some collective 
bargaining parties may make that choice, Justice 
Kennedy; others may make a different choice.

 What is the alternative here?  The 

alternative is that employers can bypass the union. 
They can just go around the union and -- and have 
individual Gilmer agreements signed up.  That's what the 
D.C. Circuit said en banc in -- in -- in the ALPA Pilots 
case.

 And indeed, the -- the union in that case 

was arguing the position that we are arguing here, that 
this is a mandatory subject of bargaining, and this is 
right in the union's portfolio of -- of what they should 
be using to -- to bargain with the employer because it's 
a procedural right and there are no substantive outcomes 
that are diminished in any way whatsoever.

 Unions are deemed trustworthy enough to 

bring lawsuits in the federal courts on behalf of their 
members.  Under principles of associational standing, 
associational standing, the members are bound by 
their -- their union's actions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And nonmembers, too? 

What about the people who -- who are not members of the

union, but they have to pay an equivalent amount for the 
union's services in collective bargaining?  They would 
be bound as well?  They couldn't --

MR. SALVATORE:  Absolutely, Justice 

Ginsburg.  The -- the -- the -- and this type of service 
is one of the core functions that an agency payer would 
have to pay for.  The LM2 that 32B, the local, filed 
here on behalf of 80,000 employees has two agency fee 
payers out of 80,000.  So it's not really an issue in 
this case.

 But that's what unions are for.  When 

Congress makes them the exclusive bargaining 
representative you're -- you're in for it one way or the 
other.  You're -- you're -- either you're in or you're 
out.  And if you're in, then you have to go along with 
the -- the -- the entire collective bargaining deal that 
is made --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said -- the -- fine.
 I -- I grasp your answer to that.  But you 
said that the employee would have the absolute right if 
the union says, "sorry, for whatever reason we can't 
represent you," absolute right to that arbitral forum. 
What -- who pays then?

 I mean, if the union is in it, then the 

union and the employer are going to split -- split the

cost.  But what happens when the union drops out and you 
have the individual and the employer in this arbitral 
forum?

 MR. SALVATORE:  In -- in this situation the 

employer pays.  That's the only -- the Office of the 
Contract Arbitrator is an -- essentially a mini-
American Arbitration Association that these parties have 
set up, and the -- the RAB, which is the multi- employer 
organization that represents all the real estate 
employers in -- in New York, they pay for the 
arbitration, because the union in this case has said we 
are not going to pay.

 As you point out rightly, if the union is 
not involved, they -- they shouldn't pay.  So there is 
no cost to the employee for that arbitration and -- and 
as Justice Edwards said in the D.C. Circuit Kohl case, 
that -- that that procedure is -- is a fair one, to have 
the employer pick up the -- the costs given -- given the 
-- the balance between the -- the two of them.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Salvatore, are you 
going to get to your explanation about Gardner-Denver 
before you're all through?

 MR. SALVATORE:  Yes -- yes, Your Honor, 
Justice Stevens.  Gardner-Denver is -- is a case, as 
this Court has described, that -- that didn't involve

the enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate.  The 
Gardner-Denver line of cases, McDonald and Barrentine 
and Gardner-Denver, had the quite different issue as 
this Court said in Gilmer, of whether a contract-based 
claim precludes subsequent judicial resolution of a 
statutory claim; and so that distinguishes the rule. 
But factually these cases are very different as -- as 
well.

 Mr. Alexander in Alexander v. 

Gardner-Denver, the contract there, the collective 
bargaining agreement, had a plain vanilla arbitration 
clause.  It didn't have a clause like the one we looked 
at page, petition appendix 48a, that incorporated all 
the -- the statutes and gave the arbitrator the power to 
sit and -- and to apply those statutes and apply the law 
under those statutes and apply the remedies that derive 
from those statutes.  In that case, the arbitrator sat 
as the proctor of the bargain between the collective 
bargaining parties, and didn't have that broad 
authority, as this Court has -- has recognized.

 And -- and we agree that arbitration that --

that resolves just a collective bargaining agreement 
claim should not be dispositive of a statutory claim. 
They're fish and fowl.  So that Gardner-Denver is 
correctly decided.  Gardner-Denver puts out the rule for

-- for that situation.  This is a different situation 
that we are talking about.

 And -- and here, unlike in Gardner-Denver, 
where Mr. Alexander would have had no access to the --
to have his Title VII claim heard if this Court had 
affirmed the Tenth Circuit, he -- the door to the 
courthouse would have been shut in that case for 
Mr. Alexander -- here we are trying to move to compel 
arbitration so that there is a forum, and -- and that 
these individuals -- these employees --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But not a judicial -- not 

a judicial forum.

 MR. SALVATORE:  An arbitral forum, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Salvatore, would you 
just clarify something for me?  I thought that the union 
ceded its rights to the employees and said that they 
could use this collective bargaining agreement's 
arbitral regime so long as they paid for it.  But you 
tell me they don't have to pay anything; the employer 
pays everything.

 MR. SALVATORE:  That's -- that's correct. 

That's the union counsel's affidavit.  He was saying he 
doesn't -- the union doesn't want to pick up the costs, 
Justice Ginsburg, but the collective bargaining

agreement says there is two payers in the Office of the 
Contract Arbitrator, the RAB and the union.  If the 
union is not paying, then the RAB has to pay.

 Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 Mr. Frederick.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The Second Circuit's judgment should be 

affirmed for three reasons.  First, a collective 
bargaining agreement gives the union exclusive control 
over workers' grievances.  Second, unions have inherent 
conflicts of interest with respect to individual 
statutory anti-discrimination rights; and third, unions 
lack authority to serve as gatekeepers of individual 
workers' substantive ADEA rights.

 With respect to the first point, a 

collective bargaining agreement generally gives the 
union exclusive control over whether to bring grievances 
on behalf of workers and how such grievances are 
pursued.  In such circumstances -- which is this case, 
the workers have not advanced the requisite agreement to

arbitrate, and control over the arbitral forum to 
satisfy this Court's standards in Gilmer for effectively 
vindicating the workers' statutory anti-discrimination 
rights.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Under your first point, are 
you saying it's impossible for there to be a collective 
bargaining agreement that reads the way Mr. Salvatore 
reads this collective bargaining agreement; a collective 
bargaining agreement which says that the union's -- that 
the grievance must be arbitrated, and it will be done 
either by the union, or if the union declines to pursue 
it, by the individual employee?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Alito, I've looked 
comprehensively through the cases.  We've never found a 
collective bargaining agreement that gives the kind of 
interpretation that Mr. Salvatore offered in this case. 
Now, is it theoretically possible that a collective 
bargaining agreement would confer on individuals the 
rights this Court said in Gilmer are necessary to 
vindicate that?  I would acknowledge it's theoretically 
possible, but it has to be done within the confines of 
whether there is actual consent by the individual to the 
arbitration, whether the individual has control over the 
mechanisms of arbitration, and whether or not the 
structure of the arbitral forum effectively vindicates

the individual's substantive rights.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But there is nothing in 

Federal labor law that would preclude the negotiation of 
a collective bargaining agreement like that.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Nothing except this Court's 
case in Magnavox where the Court said that the union may 
not bargain away an individual's rights where there 
would be a conflict between the union's interests and 
the individual's.  Here, because this is a 
discrimination claim, unions are often brought as 
defendants in such claims, particularly in circumstances 
as here, where the union agreed to the conditions that 
gave rise to the discrimination on the basis of age by 
these workers.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Even in a case in which you 

don't have -- assume -- just assume for the sake of 
argument that we don't have the discrimination issue or 
the conflict issue.  I understood you elsewhere to be 
arguing that there had to be the kind of knowing, 
intelligent and individual waiver, which I would suppose 
a collective bargaining agreement will never include. 
So I thought it was the -- ultimately the implication of 
your argument that in any -- in any case in which 
arbitration is claimed, there would have to be -- or a 
right to go to arbitration is claimed by the employer --

there would have to be, not merely the collective 
bargaining agreement, but a specific waiver by the 
employee to -- to go ahead and do that.  Is that right?

 MR. FREDERICK:  That -- that's correct.  And 

that's why I think the Gilmer point is -- is essential 
here, Justice Souter and Justice Alito.  Because in 
Gilmer there was individual consent; there needs to be 
such individual consent under the ADEA waiver itself, 
and knowing and individual waiver is necessary before 
the person can waive the substantive ADEA rights.  That 
would need to be part of the hypothetical collective 
bargaining agreement that I was positing with Justice 
Alito.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Right.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Would that mean --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Go ahead.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Would that mean that the 
employer could not unilaterally impose an arbitration 
requirement on employees?

 MR. FREDERICK:  I think that would follow, 
as that would be a condition of employment that could 
not be imposed.  The airline --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It wouldn't be 

unilaterally imposing, right?  He would say if you're 
going to work for me, you've got to arbitrate, and that

could be negotiated theoretically, and with individual 
employee.  And -- I mean, the whole point, the whole 
benefit of collective bargaining is that that doesn't 
happen.  You say, well, the employer has a lot of 
leverage if he wants to insist upon that, but it would 
not -- it would be a matter for negotiation between the 
individual and the company.

 MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct, Mr. Chief 

Justice, but there are two different points at which the 
condition of employment arose.  I understood the 
questions on this side to be after the agreement had 
taken place and the worker was already on the work site. 
Under your hypothetical, if an employee gains entrance 
to the work force and is asked, "will you sign this," 
there is individual consent in that circumstance.  That 
is the fact situation in the Air Line Pilots case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But the one thing that's 

uniform throughout in your answer is that the collective 
bargaining agreement alone can never subject the 
employee to -- to mandatory arbitration?

 MR. FREDERICK:  That's -- that's how we read 

this Court's statutory --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is also true -- is that 
also true with an ordinary tort or any other kind of 
suit?

MR. FREDERICK:  Sorry.  With an ordinary --
JUSTICE BREYER:  A tort suit.  It says, some 

-- the union -- the same thing here, but we are not 
concerned with discrimination; we are concerned with 
workplace safety.  Somebody is hurt as a result of 
machine improperly functioning, or there isn't adequate 
notice or so forth.  Is your view the same there?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, I think that those 

category of cases do stand in a different position 
because there is less of an inherent conflict of 
interest.  The union there --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?
 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, the union is not going 

to be the Defendant typically in a tort case where the 
employer is responsible.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Doesn't this allow 

discrimination -- doesn't this refer to discrimination 
by the employer?

 MR. FREDERICK:  It refers to discrimination, 

and as we cite on page 27 of our brief, there are 
provisions in the anti-discrimination laws that are 
specifically directed at union discrimination.  The 
legislative history of these statutes indicates that 
discrimination by unions was one of the concerns 
animating Congress --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, you say section 30 

doesn't say anything about union discrimination 
particularly; it just talks about discrimination.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.  In fact --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine.  So you think 

sometimes unions do discriminate?

 MR. FREDERICK:  And that's why --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  And sometimes 

unions also would rather have the more effective machine 
or sometimes unions feel their workers are stupid not to 
read the machine label properly or -- I mean, I can 
replicate anything you might think.  We can think of 
tort suits, the two of us, which could put unions and 
employees on opposite shores, just as we can think of 
discrimination suits.  Most unions don't want 
discrimination.  I mean, most of the time.  And most 
unions don't want dangerous machines most of the time.
 So if I decide for you in this case, am I 

also saying that they can't arbitrate ordinary tort 
suits or contract suits or just whether or not the 
workplace which is made of wood is filled with termites? 
I mean, you know?

 MR. FREDERICK:  I think, Justice Breyer, 
that the discrimination cases do stand in a different

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's the only reason? 

Because, in other words, if I think I see no more reason 
why a union today, whatever was true 40 years ago, that 
I see no more reason today why a union would like 
discrimination, then I can see a reason why they would 
like a dangerous machine?

 MR. FREDERICK:  I don't think Congress --
JUSTICE BREYER:  If I think that, then I 

should decide against you?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, no, because there are 

two other reasons:  The exclusive control over the 
machinery and the union serving as the gatekeeper.

 I'm not aware of tort suits being subjects 

of collective bargaining, Justice Breyer.  Nor am I 
aware of cases in which the unions have given up 
individuals' tort claims in situations, principally 
because unions are not the persons against whom such 
tort suits are brought.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, but those -- I'm 

sorry.

 Those examples are examples.  You're getting 
down to individual cases.  I thought you drew the global 
line in answer -- which would answer Justice Breyer's

a specific individual right and that individual right 
cannot in effect be compromised except in -- except in 
violation of that statute, and that's where we draw the 
global line so that when you got to torts, you'd look at 
the individual situation rather than draw a categorical 
line.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes, you would, but the 
principles this Court has applied in looking at that 
broad line, I'm trying to suggest that there might be 
situations in which those principles, where the union is 
serving as the gatekeeper, thereby not allowing a person 
to vindicate his individual rights in the tort context, 
to be not --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I agree with you, but I 

think -- I don't want to put words in Justice Breyer's 
mouth --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Very helpful of you.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But I thought what he was 

getting at is, if I hold for you here, am I going to 
have to hold for you in every case in which somebody has 
in effect a tort claim which is subject to an

question because what I'm thinking is simply that there 
are thousands, maybe tens of thousands, kinds of claims 
that people go to arbitration over.  And what I'm 
wondering here is if you win here, what is the set of 
such claims that I have now said that a union, through a 
collective bargaining contract, can force the employee 
against his will to go to arbitration over?  I don't 
have a feeling for that from the briefs.  I don't have a 
feeling that you want to say that discrimination claims 
are special in that regard, that there's no line in that 
regard, or that there's some other line.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, Justice Breyer, I 

think that your question really is getting at the theory 
behind collective bargaining agreements and what extent 
the union can exercise control over the individual 
rights and circumstances of employment.  That question 
is a very complex question over which many, many --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, can you give me a 

hint as to the principle?

 (Laughter.)
 MR. FREDERICK:  I -- well, I think that 

there are limits, of course, on the union's authority 
that have been recognized in this Court's decisions, and 
I don't think that ruling in the workers' favor in this 
circumstance opens up any kind of Pandora's box at all,

because all we are arguing for is that the 
Gardner-Denver line, which was written by this Court 
unanimously more 30 years ago, continue to be the law of 
the land, as the Court has reaffirmed --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What if a collective 
bargaining agreement requires the arbitration of 
discrimination claims that are not based on Federal law? 
Maybe they are based on -- they are based on State law 
that goes further than Federal law, or maybe they are 
based on a type of discrimination that's prohibited 
neither by Federal or State law.  Maybe it's 
discrimination against young people under 40.  Could 
those be -- those would still be discrimination claims 
with the same potential for -- with a potential for a 
conflict of interest.  Could they be subjected to 
mandatory arbitration?

 MR. FREDERICK:  I -- I think that is a 

harder case, Justice Alito, but I think that the answer 
under this Court's decisions in Gardner-Denver points 
the way here, in footnote 19 of the decision.  Where the 
union controls that process and where the union is a 
potential defendant in that circumstance, the workers' 
individual rights cannot be subordinated --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  --

if it's not a 

statutory right; it's just a wrongful discharge?  One 
practical problem is so often these are overlapping 
claims.  You can say, "I was discriminated against 
before because of my age.  I was arbitrarily 
discriminated against.  It was a wrongful discharge.  It 
was a discharge without just cause."  Usually, there's 
multiple claims that can be made, and some of them would 
be bargainable, I mean, would come under the union -- I 
mean if it was just a question of the worker says, "I 
was discharged without just cause," no Title 7 or 
anything else, that would come under the arbitration 
clause, wouldn't it?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes, and I think that there 

have been conditions of employment and discharge that 
have been arbitrable, and I don't see that there is a --
an issue there where -- except where that intersection 
with the statutory discrimination rights occurs.  And 
Congress has made a different policy judgment with 
respect to individual waivers of such rights in --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why has it?  Why has it?  I 

mean, let's assume that my gripe with my employer is 
that he hasn't paid me my salary for the last two

something totally apart from a mere economic right. 
Ninety-nine percent of the time, you're talking about 
economics.  "I was fired because of discrimination."  "I 
wasn't promoted because of discrimination and therefore 
I lost this -- this amount of money or that amount of 
money."

 Why is it unthinkable that the -- that the 
employee would have to go through the union-prescribed 
arbitration for the fact that he wasn't paid for the 
last three months but does not have to do it for an 
economic injury that occurs because of discrimination?

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, I'm not sure actually 

in answering your hypothetical that they would 
necessarily have to go through the union on the 
nonpayment because of the Fair Labor Standards Act case. 
This Court in Barrentine said that, where an FSLA claim 
is at issue, the worker does not -- is not confined or 
precluded after arbitrating at the union grievance 
process from bringing an FLSA suit in court.

 So I want to reserve, accepting all of your 
hypothetical, Justice Scalia, but in further answer to 
the point, I think it's important to keep in mind that

in the discrimination context, you're talking about more 
than just money.  Here my clients are older workers who 
are forced into more physically strenuous positions that 
they had gotten away from by virtue of their growth in 
seniority at the building.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, isn't that 

kind of conflict always present whenever you have 
collective action?  I mean, you may be a particularly 
good worker and could demand a higher wage than the 
union has negotiated, but you're still bound by the 
collective bargaining agreement.  That happens in every 
situation where you have collective action.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Certainly, Mr. Chief 

Justice, but where Congress has made a choice that 
individual claims for individual anti-discrimination 
rights need to be vindicated in particular ways, and 
where this Court's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, they don't 

have to be vindicated in particular ways.  The 
individuals can agree to arbitrate these claims, and 
they would be -- the arbitration would be binding.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Certainly, but there is 

individual consent in that circumstance.  I would like 
to make a couple of other points before closing. 
One is that on pages 4 to 5 in the brief in opposition

to cert we specifically raise the issue that the union 
controls the arbitration, and there is no opportunity 
for individual arbitration under this collective 
bargaining agreement.

 There is nothing in the provision set out in 
the petition appendix that gives individual rights, the 
individuals the right to arbitrate under this collective 
bargaining agreement.  The payment provision calls for 
50 percent by the employer and 50 percent by the 
employee with the employer having the sole right to 
terminate the arbitrator for any or no reason at all.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You did raise that issue, 
but you didn't say that the consequence of that issue 
was that you win.  You said the consequence of the fact 
that that issue was involved in this case was a good 
reason not to -- for us to accept cert.  And we didn't 
take your advice on that.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it's a totally 

different issue whether because of that question you --
you should -- you should win the case.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Certainly, the 

interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is 
fairly included within the question presented.  And as 
this Court found in Wright in a situation where it

granted certiorari on the very same question here but 
then looked at the specific provisions of the collective 
bargaining agreement to determine that, in fact, under 
the facts there a different rule applied for a clear and 
unambiguous waiver.

 All we are saying here is that under this 

provision there is no opportunity for the individual to 
arbitrate, and that raises a -- a problem analogous to 
the one that is in Wright.  We think that is fairly 
included within the question presented, and that the 
Court can affirm on that basis, certainly where the 
Second Circuit had relied on precedent that said that 
where the individual doesn't have a right, that it is 
union control of arbitration.  That is consistent with 
Gardner-Denver.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't have to be 

within the question presented.  You -- you can sustain 
the judgment below on any ground.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, I think that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The only question is 

whether we will -- we will agree that we should inquire 
into new ground.  That's all.

 MR. FREDERICK:  My only point is that this 

is one of these fuzzy areas where we are not making 
independent, alternate ground of affirmance.  I think

our argument is fairly included within the question 
presented and can be affirmed on the basis of that 
argument.

 If the court has no further questions --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the argument 

that you are -- if you win this case, you are subjecting 
the employee to a worse situation because the employer 
will simply say:  Fine, I don't have to bargain anything 
with the union.  If you want to work in this workplace, 
you sign an arbitration agreement that says you have no 
access to the court, and you have to -- just like in 
Gilmer, just like in Circuit City.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

guess I would answer that question by saying we will pay 
our money and take our chances in the sense that the 
unions here are supporting the workers where the unions 
are acknowledging that there is this kind of conflict of 
interest, and the question of whether or not imposing 
arbitration on the individual workers would be a 
condition of employment.  That is a question that you 
can safely leave for another day.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, they may go 
the other way.  They may say:  Look, we don't like to 
arbitrate.  In fact, the arbitration is of great benefit 
to workers, but it is very expensive to bring these

claims, even with the prospect of recovering fees.

 Most of them like the idea that the union is 

going to stand up for them and take it to management, 
but they could say:  Look, we don't want it.  If -- if 
you are discriminated against, you know, sue us.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Mr. Chief Justice, in fact, 
empirically that is not correct.  There is a study that 
is cited in a footnote in one of the amicus briefs that 
arbitration is more expensive than bringing civil 
litigation.  And it is because the -- under -- under 
their provision if you pay 50 percent of the 
arbitrator's costs, you can run up quite a big tab that 
you would not have to pay --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But under my 
scenario, the employer wouldn't have to pay for 
arbitration.  There would be -- there would be no 
arbitration at all.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, under your scenario, I 

think where the employer would control the arbitral 
process, the arbitrator knows who is buttering his 
bread.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  There is no 

arbitration.  The employer says:  Look, I don't think I 
discriminate.  I've got a good record.  I'm not going to 
agree to arbitrate claims.  I'm going to make people go

to court because there will be fewer claims brought.

 MR. FREDERICK:  And -- and that has been the 
law for 30 years, and we think it should continue to be 
the law, Mr. Chief Justice.

 If the marketplace is going to help weed out 

those claims, that's certainly the province of lawyers 
taking these cases and clients deciding whether or not 
to tell everybody to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the point is 
there are benefits to employees from arbitration as 
well.

 MR. FREDERICK:  Certainly --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The employer may not 

agree to it.  If he doesn't have any protection, if it 
doesn't buy him anything, if employees can still go to 
court, what's the -- what's the point?

 MR. FREDERICK:  That's why this Court has 
always said that individual consent and agreement is a 
fundamental precept of arbitration.  Where that 
agreement is absent, a worker should not be forced. 
Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, 

Mr. Frederick.

 Mr. Gannon.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. GANNON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 
please the Court:  Respondents' fundamental right to a 
workplace free of invidious, class-based discrimination 
is something their union has no power to barter away in 
collective bargaining, and the union --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I -- I just want to be sure 
that at some point you answer this question, if you can.
 I -- I -- the -- the issue in front of us, 
as I see it, is just what you said:  When can a union 
require the worker to accept arbitration rather than a 
court case in an instance where the union member has not 
signed a special waiver?  That's the question, right? 
Okay.

 And what I think some of us were struggling 
for here is:  If we say yes to you they can force them, 
or no to you they can't, what's the principle?

 Now, the easiest kind of case where you tend 

to think they can force the worker into arbitration is 
where the right grows out of the collective bargaining 
agreement, period.

 Then we have what we were talking about with 
Justice Souter, a common law tort claim.  Then we might 

43

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

have a State law giving a claim.  Then we might have a 
Federal law like this one giving a claim.

 And we just heard -- I would assume if 

Justice Scalia thought of such a case, then the response 
was, which was the FSLA:  Oh, well, maybe we can't, you 
know, force the worker to give that one up either.

 So what is the line here that we are drawing 

with this case?  Is it a line that says discrimination 
laws, Federal or special?  Federal laws are special? 
State laws are special?  Common law is special? 
Collective bargaining, too?  What is the principle?
 MR. GANNON:  Yes, Justice Breyer.  This 

Court's cases have not yet described a specific law, and 
--

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's why I am asking you 

for the principle.

 MR. GANNON:  I think that the -- the best 

line that we have is -- is stated in both Gardner-Denver 
and Barrentine as contrasting statutory rights that are 
related to collective activity, and especially economic 
activity, are the kinds of things that are normally 
delegated to the union.  Those are the sorts of things 
that the union can actually engage in collective 
bargaining about.  And when the union negotiates the 
underlying right, then it makes perfect sense that the

labor arbitration framework that's set forth here would 
continue to resolve disputes that are arising under --
out of that specific right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why doesn't this 

come within that?

 MR. GANNON:  Because --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why don't many of these 

cases, if not most of them, come within that?  The union 
negotiates the salaries for various levels, and then the 
person says:  I should be at this level.  The only 
reason I didn't get it was that I was discriminated 
against.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I -- I think, Justice 

Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you call it a 

non-economic theory.  Phooey, it's an economic case.

 MR. GANNON:  But I think what's important, 

Justice Scalia, is -- is, though -- is the line that the 
Court stated in Barrentine:  That if a statute is 
designed to give specific, minimum protection to 
individual workers, then that's the sort of thing that 
the union doesn't have the power to engage in collective 
bargaining over.

 And so your salary may well be something 

that the union can normally bargain about.  But if you

want to assert that the -- that the employer or the 
union -- because both are the types -- the types of 
entities that can be charged with discrimination under 
Title VII or the ADA or these other statutes -- the 
reason that they gave you a lower salary was on the 
basis of something for which you had a Federal statutory 
protection, then -- then you have an independent 
statutory right that the union's majoritarian 
decisionmaking processes should not be in the process of 
controlling --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It is not taking away the 
right.  The -- the union is not taking away the right. 
It's just saying to vindicate it, you have to go to 
arbitration instead of to the courts.

 MR. GANNON:  Yes.  And the difference is 
that the union is making the decision about where the 
claim will be vindicated.  And in this case in 
particular, the union is going to control whether the 
claim will actually be able to be officially vindicated.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You have -- you have 

focused on the fact that Congress has given individual 
rights.  But for the many matters that you say are the 
subject of collective bargaining, you don't need a 
statute.  I don't need a statute to negotiate with 
someone whether I get paid $20 an hour or $15 an hour

for a particular job.  And, yet, that is something that 
you give up when you join the union, and you are subject 
to collective bargaining.

 MR. GANNON:  Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, why isn't it 
-- why isn't it the same with these statutory rights? 
Why aren't they subject to collective bargaining as 
well?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, I -- even the employer 

here is not claiming that the underlying statutory right 
is subject to collective bargaining.  They are just 
saying --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  No.  I am --

the -- the forum for asserting the right.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, in this instance Congress 

gave individual employees the right to bring a civil 
action in a judicial forum as a means of enforcing their 
antidiscrimination claims.  And although arbitration may 
always provide an alternative forum for that, this Court 
has repeatedly made clear that arbitration is always a 
matter of contract.  And it does not impose on the 
employer any more than on the employee a requirement 
that they arbitrate a claim when they --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why would any 

employer want to agree to arbitration under this system?

He gets nothing from it.  You said you get the ben -- to 
arbitrate except when you don't arbitrate.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

don't think that that's true.  Since 1974, this has been 
the law of the land, and it's been even after Gilmer in 
every circuit --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That just begs the 
question that your interpretation of Gardner-Denver is 
correct.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, it -- it is the 

prevailing interpretation in every circuit that has 
considered the question since Gilmer except the Fourth 
Circuit.  And if you look at the empirical data that's 
mentioned in some of amicus briefs, including the 
particular amicus brief of the National Academy of 
Arbitrators, it is true that even when there is just a 
labor arbitration machinery that was invalid under the 
terms of Gardner-Denver and would not be binding on the 
employee if the employee happens to lose in that 
arbitration, in most of those cases when the employee 
loses that arbitration, he does not go on to file an 
independent case in federal court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your position -- so 
their position is going to hurt most employees, because 
assuming that the employer wants to arbitrate, the union

gets something in return for agreeing to that.  I don't 
know what it is, another 50 cents an hour, if you agree 
to arbitrate all these claims.  Well, you don't get that 
anymore, because and employer is not going to agree to 
arbitrate if it -- if the employees don't have to 
arbitrate.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, we don't think that there 
is any reason why the employees will not be able to make 
a grievance with the employers, as was made possible in 
Gilmer.  And so that the point is that it just can't be 
a vicarious agreement to arbitration on behalf of the 
individual.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, the employees 

have no -- no leverage.  I mean, if the -- if the 
employer wants to say, look, if you want to work here, 
look, you got to arbitrate -- I mean, the employees 
don't have bargaining leverage.  That's the whole reason 
you have a union.

 MR. GANNON:  Well, there was an argument in 
Gilmer that they didn't have leverage, either.  And the 
Court stressed that as long as the employee has actually 
agreed to it, that -- and -- and as long as the arbitral 
forum is going to be adequate to provide for effective 
vindication of the underlying statutory rights, then --
then the arbitral forum would be adequate.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the employer did 
have the practice that the Chief Justice suggested, it 
tells each employee you have to sign an arbitration 
form, could the union in its collective bargaining 
negotiations say that you will withdraw this forum and 
that you shall not impose this obligation?

 MR. GANNON:  Well, that's -- as 

Mr. Frederick mentioned and is as discussed in several 
of the briefs, that's an undecided question of labor 
law.  The National Labor Relations Board --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm asking in your view if 

it came up to it, how would that be decided --

MR. GANNON:  Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because I'm concerned it's 

the same thing as the Chief Justice mentioned, I just 
don't think the employer is going to get very much under 
this interpretation.  And that may, ultimately, hurt the 
employee.

 MR. GANNON:  We think that as long as the 

employee have been -- have been able to indicate exactly 
the same level of individual agreements that was upheld 
in Gilmer and that the arbitral forum itself is going to 
be adequate, that that takes care of that half of the 
question.

has -- which would be entitled to deference on this 
question and which has never spoken to the labor law 
question of what role the unions might be able to play 
in helping facilitate the agreements negotiated between 
the employers and the individual employees, it could 
come out in at least three different ways.

 One of them is the arrangement outlined in 

the Abbott D.C. Circuit decision that -- that 
Petitioners rely upon.  But, of course, that's an 
instance where there were two completely separate 
agreements that the employment arbitration was agreed to 
by the employees before they are even represented by the 
union.  It was at the outset of the establishment of the 
employment relationship, which Mr. Frederick discusses.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But doesn't it boil down --

doesn't your argument really boil down to this:  That 
the only case in which it's really going to matter is 
the case in which the arbitration agreement contains a 
clause that gives the union plenary authority over the 
disposition of the claim?  And I say that for this 
reason.  If -- if this is outside the subject of 
mandatory bargaining, then the employer can impose it; 
in effect, as a matter of individual contract.

 If it's within the subject of mandatory 

bargaining but it's not effective unless the employee

also signs at the time of the incident or at the time he 
is hired an individual waiver, then, in fact, the only 
case in which it's going to make any difference as to 
whether you win or he wins is the case in which the 
agreement has got a clause in there that gives the union 
plenary authority to dispose of the claim.

 Isn't that correct?
 MR. GANNON:  Well, not necessarily, Justice 
Souter, because there are all sorts of other attributes 
of the arbitral forum that might -- might well be 
relevant to the question of whether it's sufficient to 
effectively been -- rights.  In Gilmer itself, the Court 
specifically considered whether the employee, 
Mr. Gilmer, would have an opportunity to play a role in 
selecting the arbitrator.

 In this instance, even under Petitioner's 
view of the CBA, which we don't think is supported by 
the text of the CBA, this -- these employees are still 
stuck with an arbitrator who has been chosen by the 
employer and by the union.  And those are the two 
entities that have already decided that their claim is 
meritless.

 MR. GANNON:  We think that there needs to be 

individual agreement in order to comply with Gilmer 
because of the underlying inherent tension between the 
collective interest of the union and the individual 
interests of the employees, especially in 
anti-discrimination statutes.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL SALVATORE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SALVATORE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.  A couple of quick points in response.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Salvatore, would you 

straighten out this business it seems about who pays? 
Mr. Frederick said that 50 percent would have to be paid 
by the employee.  If the union bows out and there is 
just the employer and the employee in the arbitration, 
that employee would have to pick up 50 percent.  I think 
I understood him to say that.

MR. SALVATORE:  And I refer you, Justice 
Ginsburg, to page 47a of the joint -- of the petition 
appendix, which contains the main frame arbitration 
Article 6 of this collective bargaining agreement, the 
last paragraph --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What page did you -- did 

you reference?

 MR. SALVATORE:  47a of the petition 

appendix, the last paragraph on that page.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Article 7, no.
 MR. SALVATORE:  I'm sorry?
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You said Article 6.  Isn't 

it Article 7, if it's on 47a?

 MR. SALVATORE:  Article 6 starts on 43a.  It 

goes all the way over to 47a of the petition appendix, 
right after the ellipses at the bottom of the page.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, I see.  Okay, so you 

are on 6.  I got you.

 MR. SALVATORE:  The cost of the office of 
the contract arbitrator shall be shared equally in a 
manner determined by the union and the RAB.  The way 
that the parties -- the bargaining parties have 
determined that these costs be shared is that if -- if 
the union is not involved in a case, the employer pays. 
And -- and so, that's -- I mean, that's right from the

somewhere?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where does that appear?
 MR. SALVATORE:  That's -- that's the -- the 

agreement between the collective bargaining parties. 
It's not -- it's not written down beyond that -- that --
that place.  The office -- that place in the contract. 
The office of the contract arbitrator is -- is -- is a 
place.  It's an arbitration forum.  It's like going to 
the American Arbitration Association.

 It has hearing rooms.  It -- it -- there --
it has administrators who assign the arbitrators.  The 
arbitrators aren't picked out of -- you know, by one 
side or the other.  Yes, they are put on the panel by --
by the bargaining parties, but they are picked by a case 
administrator.

 There's 700 arbitrations that go on in this 
industry every year and that's why instead of going to 
the American Arbitration Association, these parties a 
long time ago set up their own.  A couple --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If the -- if the idea is 

that the union sees this right to the worker, then 
doesn't have to -- doesn't the burden go with the right

as well?  I mean, the -- if the union would pay, you're 
saying that the employer will just accept that the 
employer picks up the entire tab?

 MR. SALVATORE:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  And 

there are -- are several points.  First, there is no 
conflict here in this case.  The union did the right 
thing.  It turned the claim over to the individual 
employees with their private counsel and let them go 
arbitrate it themselves.  They refused.  This isn't a 
Magnavox situation.  The union is not --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  I mean, they didn't turn it 
over, did they, until the action had been brought in the 
Federal court?  I mean, they didn't -- maybe I'm wrong 
in this, but I didn't think that on day one they -- they 
said, oh, well, because the union doesn't want to 
proceed with this, you're welcome to chug ahead by 
yourself.

 MR. SALVATORE:  Let me explain that time 

frame, Justice Souter.  What happened here was the claim 
was originally tendered by these employees to the union 
to bring an arbitration.  The union decided after the 
first hearing day with the arbitrator that they couldn't 
go forward for whatever reasons -- it's not in the 
record -- and then they, several months went by, these 
employees filed with their counsel at the EEOC under

Waffle House, we did nothing and waited and the --
representing the employers, and then the -- the lawsuit 
was filed.

 At that point the record is clear that 

demand was made on -- on the employee's counsel, 
Mr. Kreisberg -- it's in his affidavit -- that -- that 
he returned to Arbitrator Pfeiffer to the pending 
arbitration and continue in that forum, and he refused 
to.  That was the basis of the motion to compel.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 MR. SALVATORE:  Thank you.
 (Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
