 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

argument next in Case 11-338, Decker v. Northwest 

Environmental Defense Center and Georgia-Pacific v. The 

Northwest Environmental Defense -- Defense Center.

 Mr. Bishop.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BISHOP:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 There is a straightforward ground for 

reversal here that rests on a standard application of 

deference principles to EPA's treatment of stormwater.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Before -- before we 

get into that, congratulations to your clients -­

MR. BISHOP:  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- getting almost 

all the relief they're looking for under -- under the 

new rule issued on Friday.

 MR. BISHOP:  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And thank you for 

calling it to our attention.

 MR. BISHOP:  Thank you.

 The problem with that rule is that it puts

into place something that EPA has been telling the 

courts throughout this litigation, that in the 

stormwater rule, where EPA refers to Standard Industrial 

Classification 2411, that what it is referring to is 

solely the four identified point sources in the 

silvicultural -- rock crushing and so on.

 In this case, NEDC Respondent argues that 

the statute -- the language of the statute, which is 

that discharges that are associated with industrial 

activity must have NPDES permits, prevents EPA from 

doing that -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there was no ruling 

in the court of appeals.  The court of appeals did not 

rule on the statute -- whether the statute mandates that 

these logging roads be governed.

 MR. BISHOP:  No.  It did not.  It did not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So is -­

MR. BISHOP:  That is an argument that 

Respondents have made in this Court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And so that's not a point 

that this Court could resolve in the first instance.

 MR. BISHOP:  Well, I don't think that's -- I 

don't think that's right.  The -- the Respondent can 

defend its judgment on grounds other than those that 

were -- that were the basis of the Ninth Circuit

decision.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, you can do that; but 

this Court is a court of review, not first view, and we 

don't take questions that haven't been aired below.

 MR. BISHOP:  Well, there -- there is an 

additional reason why we don't think that the rule here 

moots -- moots the issue.  Let -- let's assume that 

there is a petition for review.

 I think that's a fairly safe -- safe 

assumption, that some environmental groups argue that 

the new rule is impermissible because it's at odds with 

the language of the -- language of the statute, an 

argument that I think is -- is near frivolous, but that 

I think will be -- predictably will be made.

 The rule is prospective.  What we have is a 

judgment from the Ninth Circuit that says that we were 

in violation for decades by not having permits.  And -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it's -­

it's an unusual situation for us to rule in a case -­

MR. BISHOP:  Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- where the issue 

has ongoing significance and that's taken away.  And 

what we would be doing is, when there is a new rule, we 

would be considering quite a lot of difficult issues to 

determine what the old rule was, so that you can unravel

what the Ninth Circuit has upheld.

 MR. BISHOP:  Well, let me argue -- let me -­

maybe -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought the case law 

was fairly clear that, when the EPA changes its rules in 

your favor, that they can't -- the court can't impose 

penalties for a past violation.

 MR. BISHOP:  Well, I wish it were so clear. 

Certainly, we think that that is the case.

 What they've asked for below is penalties, 

attorneys' fees, and remediation of environmental harm. 

Now -- now, we think that, under Laidlaw, they shouldn't 

be able to get any of those three things.

 Now, this only happened on Friday, so I 

can't claim that I've done complete research on -- on 

the point.  But it -- you know, I do think that -- there 

doesn't appear to be any law on the application of 

Laidlaw to a claim for remediation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is this a -- is this 

a new rule that they -- I too haven't had much of a 

chance to look at it.  But is this a new rule?  Or is it 

an amendment of the existing rule?

 MR. BISHOP:  It's an amendment of the 

existing rule.  But what it does is to put into place 

against the rule exactly what EPA has been saying

throughout this litigation.  There is nothing new in the 

rule.

 So this is something that EPA has been 

saying in the litigation and that we think is entitled 

to Auer deference as a result of that.  Now, it's in the 

rule, so it gets -- it gets Chevron deference.  But 

we -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are you sure you 

want what you're asking for?  What if we go ahead and 

decide this case and rule against you?

 MR. BISHOP:  Well, we are -- we are hoping 

that you rule -- you'll rule with us.  And certainly, on 

the basis of this rule -­

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's usually the 

objective.

 MR. BISHOP:  On the basis of this rule, you 

have to understand that the challenge to this rule is 

the claim that the -- the words "associated with 

industrial activity" must be interpreted by EPA to 

include harvesting activities and the -- the moving of 

the logs out of the harvest area.  Now, that's -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, I suppose that 

your clients and others similarly situated -- or I -- I 

guess it would be the Respondents -- can challenge the

new rule, right?

 MR. BISHOP:  Yes.  So -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you would have, 

simultaneously pending, a case involving the 

interpretation of the old rule and a challenge to the 

new rule.

 MR. BISHOP:  Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Each of which would 

have the same issue.

 MR. BISHOP:  And this Court can cut through 

all of that by deciding this case, which the simplest 

way to decide this case is under the stormwater rule. 

If the Court decides this case in our favor under the 

stormwater rule, then that will preclude a large part of 

the basis for the challenge to the new rule.

 It's squarely in front of this Court. 

Mr. Fisher has made the argument here.  The stormwater 

rule is squarely here.  Congress completely revamped the 

Clean Water Act's approach to stormwater in 1987, and it 

made clear that, as a default, point-source stormwater 

is regulated by the State, with NPDES permits required 

only for discharges that are associated with industrial 

activity and a few other categories.

 And those statutory terms, "industrial 

activity" and "associated with," are both ambiguous.

And with those words, Congress left EPA with discretion 

to determine what activities count as industrial.  And 

it's in keeping with dictionary definitions for EPA to 

have categorized activities like law, banking, retail, 

agriculture, and silviculture as not industrial.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Bishop, as -- as 

Justice Ginsburg said, that question was not decided 

below, and in the context of this case, which, of 

course, was very different when it was briefed, 

Mr. Fisher spent a grand total of 2 pages and rightly 

so.  It wasn't -- it was -- it was not the main issue in 

the case then.

 So would we really be doing something -- you 

know, a good practice to decide this issue, without 

really any briefing on it and without a decision below?

 MR. BISHOP:  Well, I think there is briefing 

on it.  I mean, both parties have briefed it.  It gets 2 

pages because it's a -- a near-frivolous argument under 

the -- under the caselaw, I think.  But the fact is, if 

you don't -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that isn't really 

quite fair.  It is 2 pages because it wasn't decided 

below and because -- and because the -- the question in 

the case was very different, with a different 

regulation.

MR. BISHOP:  Now, the issue is before this 

Court.  If the Court doesn't decide the issue, then we 

go back.  We have to fight for years about remedies -­

about the appropriateness of remedies for this 

adjudicated past violation under Laidlaw.  And Laidlaw 

has some very complex law that's developed under it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You wouldn't have to do 

anything if the Court vacated the decision below.  Then 

you wouldn't be facing anything.

 MR. BISHOP:  Well, obviously, if the Court 

held the case was moot, then we'd like the -- the 

vacatur.  But in addition -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So -- so if you're right, 

that you're entitled to it and we agree with you, then 

there is nothing.  You don't have anything hanging over 

your head as a result -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- of the prior decision.

 MR. BISHOP:  -- what's left at that point is 

another 5 or 6 years of litigation under the new rule on 

an issue that is briefed in this Court, before this 

Court, and I think relatively easy to decide under the 

stormwater rule.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are you -- which 

issue are you talking about?  The industrial activities 

issue or the silvicultural?

 MR. BISHOP:  The industrial activities 

issue.  I mean, the -- the rest of this case has become 

very complex, I think, because of -- of the -- you know, 

the government has raised the Seminole Rock argument 

that -- that no one's ever heard of before.  Mr. Fisher 

has introduced an argument about whether the 1375(b) 

categories -- this case falls within those categories.

 But there is a simple way to decide this 

case, and that is, under the stormwater rule, EPA had 

the discretion to determine what activities are 

industrial, and it determined that timber harvesting is 

not industrial.  It defined "immediate access roads" in 

a way that does not cover these -- these roads, even if 

it were industrial.

 And these are terms -- the term "industrial" 

is one that is ambiguous.  The term "associated with

industrial activity" is one that admits of degree.  It's 

like the word "minimized" -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do we -- how do we 

avoid, under your reading -- assuming we agreed with you 

what the rule says, that there is a difference between 

logging roads and access roads?  The other side raises a 

lot of question about whether these, in fact, are access 

roads or not.  So do -- do we need to -­

MR. BISHOP:  The public -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do we have to reach that 

issue then?

 MR. BISHOP:  The public -- no, you don't 

have to reach that issue because the EPA has decided 

that the timber harvesting activity is not industrial. 

In the rule -- implementing this rule with a -- a 

multisectored general permit for industrial activity, 

EPA said, quote, "Harvesting activities, including 

loading and initial transport from an active harvest 

site, are not required to be covered under the 

stormwater permits."

 You know, it's been perfectly clear in -­

when it promulgated the rule, it said that the reference 

to SIC 24 was a reference to sawmills, planing mills, 

and other mills.  When, in the briefs in this case, 

it -- it explained the reference to SIC 2411, it said,

"By not excluding SIC 2411, EPA intended to reference 

only the four categories of silvicultural activities 

already defined as point sources."  So it's -- EPA has 

been -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do we -­

MR. BISHOP:  -- absolutely clear that timber 

harvesting is not industrial activity -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It may not -­

MR. BISHOP:  -- and, therefore, it does not 

get to the "associated."

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It may not be, but these 

are pipes, ditches, and channels which the CWA 

explicitly defines as point sources -­

MR. BISHOP:  Well, you can -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that are not part of 

the harvesting.  By definition, they are not. 

They're -- you're saying public roads and not access 

roads.

 MR. BISHOP:  Well, remember that the 

stormwater rule applies to point sources.  The default 

position under the stormwater rule is that point sources 

do not require NPDES permits.  And then Congress said 

there are certain categories that do, and one of those 

is discharges that are associated with industrial 

activity.

EPA has said that, under these terms, 

"associated with industrial activity," "in industrial 

activity," neither the timber harvest nor the roads, 

"The initial loading and initial transport from an 

active harvest site are not required to be covered by 

stormwater permits."

 It says, in the rule, that immediate access 

roads are the only things that are covered.  It 

explains, in the preamble to the 1976 rule, that that 

means on-plant roads that are dedicated for use by an 

industrial facility, not public roads.  These are public 

roads.

 These are used by hunters, fishermen, 

off-road vehicle enthusiasts, bird watchers.  These are 

fairly heavily trafficked public roads that are used for 

a few weeks, every few decades, for logging activities. 

And so these are not, EPA has been very clear, the sort 

of -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Am I correct or incorrect 

that a considerable number of these roads are -- a 

significant number of these roads were built initially 

by the logging industry?

 MR. BISHOP:  Yes, some -- some of them 

surely -- surely were.

you to say that, when these were built by the logging 

industry and presumably maintained to some respect by 

the logging industry, to say, oh, well, these are used 

by hunters and so forth.  I -­

MR. BISHOP:  But -- but they are public 

roads.  They are owned by the counties, or they're owned 

by the State.  These two particular roads that we are 

talking about here have been there between 50 and 75 

years.  They run by the river.  There is a school bus 

pull-off on one of them because there are houses by the 

side of this road.

 There -- these are -- these are 

quintessential public roads that are used by loggers 

from time-to-time.  Are they -- are they built there? 

Are there other roads that are built by us?  Yes.  But 

they are public roads maintained by us under contracts 

with the State, only during the period when we are using 

them for -- for logging activity, and otherwise 

maintained by the -- by the State.

 So the -- and we think -- to come back to 

your -- your initial question, Chief Justice, about 

whether this can be decided without getting into these 

other complex issues -- that you don't have to -- if you 

decide this case under the stormwater rule, it's -- and 

taking at face value what the Ninth Circuit said, which

is the rule itself is not clear, we see the Ninth 

Circuit set a reference here to SIC 2411, which is 

logging.

 We see this reference to immediate access 

roads.  So at -- at that point, we -- you look at what 

EPA has said.  And EPA's explanation, in its 1976 

preamble, in its briefs and in -- in this case, are -­

are absolutely clear, that there was no intention on 

EPA's part to cover the channelled runoff alongside 

these roads.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Bishop, could I -- I'm 

sorry that I don't understand this well enough yet.  But 

can I understand what's still at stake for you in -- in 

the case?  Put aside the question of whether the new 

rule is valid or not, all right?  And what -- what do 

you have riding on whether the Ninth Circuit's decision 

is correct at this point?

 MR. BISHOP:  Well, if there is -- if there 

is a vacatur, so that we don't have to worry about 

remedies below -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  So which remedies are you 

worried about?

 MR. BISHOP:  Well, the remedies that we -­

we are obviously not worried about injunctive relief. 

We are worried about the relief that they have asked

for, for past -- supposed past violations, which is 

penalties, attorneys' fees, and I think the more complex 

one under the case law is remediation for environmental 

harm, which the case law just doesn't seem to address 

under -- under Laidlaw.

 So we are worried about those.  And 

principally, what we would like to do is to get sorted 

out, once and for all here, an argument that otherwise 

would drag through the courts for the next five or six 

years under this rule, putting the whole industry into a 

good deal of uncertainty that we think is unwarranted.

 If I can reserve the remainder of my time?

 Mr. Stewart.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS

 MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 On Friday, the EPA administrator signed a 

new rule that amends EPA's existing regulatory 

definition of the term "stormwater discharge associated

 The new rulemaking specifically disapproves

explicitly that the only facilities under SIC Code 2411 

that are industrial are rock crushing, gravel washing, 

log sorting, and log storing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Were you as 

surprised, as we were, to learn about that final rule?

 MR. STEWART:  No, we were not.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When did you learn 

that the final rule would be issued on Friday?

 MR. STEWART:  I learned on Friday morning 

that the final rule would be issued.  I learned on 

Friday afternoon that the final rule had been issued. 

Within five minutes of that time, I alerted counsel for 

both the Petitioners and -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You had no idea 

before Friday that this was coming out?

 MR. STEWART:  I knew that it was a strong 

possibility -- I knew that it was a strong possibility 

that it would come out.  The EPA had issued a notice in 

September of proposed rulemaking.  There was a notation 

on OMB's website in early November, to the effect that 

the rule had been transmitted for final approval by OMB.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In early November?

 MR. STEWART:  In early November.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe in the future, 

you could let us know when something as definite as that

comes.

 There were 875 pages on the merits briefing 

in this case, and if we knew that the final rule was 

imminent, we could have rescheduled the case for April 

or-- or something along those lines.

 MR. STEWART:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  We -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, I know, that 

there was a proposed rule.  Is it your experience that 

proposed EPA rules become final within a couple of 

months, particularly?

 MR. STEWART:  No, I think that -- well, I 

think this happened more quickly than it usually does, 

but I think we intended respect for the Court's 

processes, rather than disrespect.

 Obviously, it's suboptimal for the new rule 

to be issued the Friday before oral argument; but it 

would have been even worse, I think, from the standpoint 

of the parties and the Court's decision-making processes 

if the rule had been issued a week or two after the 

Court heard oral argument.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, maybe.  And it 

would have been best if we had known about this in early 

November.

MR. STEWART:  With -- with respect to the 

impact of the rule on this case, the new rule was not 

intended to change the meaning of the preexisting 

definition, and in our view, it renders the case moot.

 And, really, the point of issuing the new -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you deal with his 

points about the ex-fact remedies of attorneys' fees and 

remediation?  Why are -- why are those moot?

 MR. STEWART:  Well, I think the question of 

attorneys' fees, if the Ninth Circuit's decision was 

vacated on the ground that the case would become moot, 

attorneys' fee are available under the Clean Water Act 

and citizen suits only to prevailing or substantially 

prevailing parties.  And I don't see any way that 

Respondent could make a claim to be a prevailing or 

substantially prevailing party when, at the end of the 

day, it got no relief.

 Now, with respect to questions of 

remediation and, particularly, of civil penalties, the 

Court, in Steel Company and Laidlaw, addressed the 

circumstances under which civil penalties would -- could 

and could not be awarded in citizen suits.  And the 

Court in Steel Company said that, in citizen suits, a 

citizen plaintiff lacks standing to seek civil penalties 

as a remedy for past violations because the citizen

derives no benefit from payment of the penalties into 

the treasury.

 In Laidlaw, the Court held that, where there 

is a prospect of recurring violations or ongoing 

violations, the citizen plaintiff does have standing to 

seek civil penalties as a deterrent to future 

illegality.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you -- are you 

saying that the private companies would not be liable 

for civil penalties, even though the alleged violation 

was ongoing at the time of the district court 

litigation?

 MR. STEWART:  That's correct.  That even 

if -- if, by the time the -- the suit was wound up, 

there was no prospect of an ongoing or future violation 

because EPA had amended the rule to make clear that the 

conduct was lawful, there would be no future illegally 

to deter.  And then there -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, can I stop you 

just for a moment?  EPA made clear that the conduct was 

not unlawful.  We have a new regulation.  The fact that 

they have issued a new regulation doesn't mean that the 

reading -- doesn't mean that that's a demonstration that 

the prior conduct under the old regulation was lawful.

 Now, I know you've taken the position that

it was not, but you've got a court of appeals decision 

saying it was.

 MR. STEWART:  That's correct.  And if we 

actually had a civil penalty award issued by the 

district court in the first instance, it might be a more 

complicated question whether that award should be 

vacated.  But the district court ruled in the 

petitioner's favor.  There was never any civil penalty 

award.

 And so if -- if the question is can the 

district court, at some future stage of this case, enter 

a civil penalty award, under Laidlaw, the only 

justification for that in a citizen suit would be to 

deter illegal conduct that might be thought to be 

possible after the civil penalty award was issued and -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That -- that would 

have to be based on the assumption that the Ninth 

Circuit decision was wrong.

 MR. STEWART:  It would not have to be based 

on the assumption that the Ninth Circuit decision was 

wrong at the time that it was entered; that is, even if 

EPA had done something that was explicitly characterized 

as a change in the law, if EPA had issued a rule-making 

that said, what Petitioners had been doing was unlawful 

up to this point, but we've decided that it shouldn't be

unlawful, and, therefore, we're amending the rule to 

make it legal, if EPA had done that, there would still 

be no prospect of future illegality, assuming that the 

rule is taken to be valid.

 And, therefore, although in an EPA 

enforcement action, there might be a possibility of 

getting monetary awards for past misconduct because 

that's something the government can do, the citizen's 

only stake in the matter would be to deter future 

illegalities.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if -- what if the rule 

is held invalid?  I mean, we don't know the answer to 

that question until this rule is challenged, and there 

is ultimately a -- I'm sure it will be challenged 

because their position is that the -- this rule 

contradicts the statute.  So how does that factor in to 

your analysis?

 MR. STEWART:  It certainly is possible that 

the rule will be challenged, but, as -- as Petitioners 

have emphasized in their brief, and we agree, the proper 

forum for adjudicating challenges to the validity of an 

EPA regulation is through a suit brought against EPA 

based on the administrative record; that is, a citizen 

suit against the petitioners -­

point is, until that suit is -- is concluded, you don't 

know whether there is a possibility of future violation 

or not, do you?

 MR. STEWART:  You don't know.  But I think, 

at this point, the prospect that the EPA rule would be 

both challenged and vacated is sufficiently speculative 

that it would be out of keeping with general principles 

of mootness for the Court to go on to decide the 

question of what the old rule meant.

 And really -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is what you said true also 

of the remediation piece of this?  You said that, at 

this point, even if we understand this as a change in 

the law, the Plaintiffs would not be entitled to fines. 

Would they also not be entitled to any kind of 

remediation?

 MR. STEWART:  I -- I think we would want to 

study that a little further.  The general rule, 

certainly, is that injunctive -- the propriety of 

injunctive relief is determined on the basis of the law 

in effect at the time of the Court's decision.

 And under the -- the newly promulgated rule, 

once the rule took effect, that -- that would be to the 

effect that the discharges from stormwater runoff are 

not covered, and an order requiring remediation would be

a form of prospective injunctive relief.  It would 

address -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it your submission that 

we should issue an order vacating this moot or issue an 

order for the court of appeals to consider whether it's 

moot?

 MR. STEWART:  I think either one would be -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is your submission?

 MR. STEWART:  Our preference would be that 

the Court issue an order vacating as moot; but it would 

also be an appropriate decision to -- to leave that to 

the court of appeals in the first instance.

 And, again, EPA's objective in this was to 

obviate the need to decide vex questions concerning the 

meaning of the old rule.  That is, EPA has said for 

nearly 40 years that it doesn't believe that NPDES 

permits are the appropriate way of addressing the -- the 

dangers to water quality that are posed by these sorts 

of discharges and -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I -- I'm having 

trouble seeing how we can dismiss it as moot when there 

would remain pending claims for civil penalties and 

injunctive relief, which you've already said you want to 

take a closer look at, and attorneys' fees.

 Now, you seem fairly confident that they'll

lose on those, but you felt pretty confident that you'd 

win on this.

 MR. STEWART:  Well, I think the one piece 

that we would want to take a closer look at is the 

specific question of remediation for past harm; that is, 

concrete steps on the ground to undo the results of past 

discharges.  The -- the other two pieces of it -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:  It seems strange that you 

would -- that there would be an order of remediation to 

undo the results of past discharges when, at this point, 

the law going forward is, go ahead and discharge.

 MR. STEWART:  I think that's correct, that, 

as I say, we haven't -- we haven't specifically focused 

on this question; but my instinct is that an order of 

remediation would be an aspect of prospective injunctive 

relief that would be governed by the general rule that 

injunctive relief is to be determined under the law at 

the time of the Court's decisions.

 But with respect to the other two elements 

of relief, I think those can be easily dealt with as a 

matter of law; that is, to the extent that they are 

seeking an injunction ordering that no further 

discharges occur without a permit, then clearly, the 

propriety of that sort of injunction would be determined 

under the new rule, and it wouldn't be available.

And I think Laidlaw is clear that the only 

basis that a citizen has for seeking civil penalties is 

to deter future violations, not to punish prior 

violations.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is this something 

that -- in terms of mootness, we should evaluate under 

the voluntary cessation doctrine?

 MR. STEWART:  No, I don't believe so 

because, here, the basis for mootness is not that the -­

the defendants in the suit have promised to change their 

ways; it is that the EPA has issued a new regulation to 

make clear -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The EPA has changed 

its ways.

 MR. STEWART:  Well, EPA is -- EPA is not the 

defendant in the case; so, even if this were viewed as a 

change in ways, it wouldn't be voluntary cessation.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 It seems to me, in light of the recent 

events, that the most appropriate course for this Court

is to just simply dismiss this case as improvidently 

granted.

 If this Court had reached its -- had gotten 

a cert petition under the circumstances present right 

now, it seems to me there'd be three very strong reasons 

simply just to deny the petition.

 First of all, because EPA, in its rulemaking 

on Friday afternoon, itself says that the Ninth Circuit 

decision has -- cancels out any impact of the Ninth 

Circuit decision on the ground, moving forward.

 Second of all, the case is interlocutory in 

posture.  Remember, we are just on a reversal of a 

motion to dismiss.  So every argument that's left in the 

case, in addition to whatever mootness arguments anyone 

wants to make -- which I'll explain why in a moment we 

would disagree with -- can all be made on remand to the 

Ninth Circuit.

 And if people are unhappy -- or not on 

remand, but just simply when the case returns -- if 

people are unhappy with those results, they can bring 

the case back up to this Court.  And -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if we do that -­

if we dismiss as improvidently granted, you still go 

back and you -- you get your attorneys' fees, you get 

the civil penalties, you get remediation because the law

And -- but I want to make one thing very clear.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but, in other 

words, it goes -- under your view, it would go back to 

the district court; the district court would try all 

this.  And, as the Chief Justice says, we know what the 

law of the case is, if -- if the opinion stands.

 MR. FISHER:  Well, the law of the case would 

be -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and so isn't -­

isn't it fairly clear, well, we know that the district 

court must do under the court of appeals' decision?

MR. FISHER:  All the district court must do 

under the Ninth Circuit decision is consider this to be 

a point source, for the reason that Justice Sotomayor 

mentioned, and that -- the other side has virtually 

walked away from that argument, anyway.

 It is pipe, ditch, or channel; it's 

perfectly obvious we're dealing with point sources here. 

The only question is whether you have this covered by 

the stormwater rules, to the extent they are valid.  And 

that -- the district court or the Ninth Circuit or 

whoever would consider in the first instance, and that 

could come back to this Court.

 But if I might just explain to this Court, I 

think it will help the conversation if I explain exactly 

what our case looks like, going forward, because we have 

and will maintain a claim for forward-looking relief for 

two reasons.

 One is, for the reason that was mentioned a 

couple of times in the -- in the beginning part of the 

argument, because we contend that the new rule simply 

violates the statute.  And we have a right to bring a 

citizen suit for a violation of the Clean Water Act 

itself, which is to say the language that requires EPA 

to regulate -­

with industrial activity.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you're disclaiming 

that you have to go to the court of appeals; you think 

you can bring a citizen suit to challenge the validity 

of the regulation?

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I wouldn't put it exactly 

that way, Justice Sotomayor.  What I would say is that 

we have the power to bring -- or we have the right to 

bring a citizen suit to enforce the Act.  And if there 

is a regulation that the other side brings up that says, 

we are -- supposedly says, we are exempt from having to 

get permits, our position is that regulation just simply 

doesn't fall under 1369(b)(1), for the reasons Judge 

Pryor just found for the Eleventh Circuit.

 I sent that up as supplemental authority.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that -- that is the 

question, the question of what the statute requires, was

Ginsburg.  The Ninth Circuit had no -- no reason to 

reach it because the regulations on stormwater, as then 

written, were absolutely clear, that logging

activities -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you -- you're not 

urging that we reach it?

 MR. FISHER:  I think the most prudent thing, 

as I've said, is for this Court not to reach that, and 

to let -- as you described, to let a lower court look at 

it first and to bring it back.

 But if I can finish my question -- or my 

answer to Justice Sotomayor, the reason why that 

regulation doesn't require us to go to court of appeals 

in the first instance and actually lets us proceed on a 

citizen suit is because the only two subsections of 

1369(b)(1) that they have mentioned are subsections (E) 

and (F).

 Subsection (F) deals with EPA decisions, 

quote, "issuing or denying a permit."  Well, this 

decision does neither of those things.

 Secondly, it covers EPA actions that set 

effluent levels or effluent limitations.  And, again, 

for the reasons the Eleventh Circuit just held and other 

courts have held, this doesn't do that either.

 So there is nothing in 1369(b)(1) that 

stands in our way of bringing a citizen suit to enforce 

the statute on those terms.  So -­

proceed that way?  It's at least arguable that you're 

wrong on that.  I mean, it's a -- it's a question as to 

what 1369 does.  And you obviously do have the route of 

direct review.  Why don't you proceed that way with 

respect to the new regulation?

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I think that what -- what 

we'll do is proceed whatever way we can because our -­

you know, either -- either we are supposed to go 

directly to the Ninth Circuit -- or any court of 

appeals, or we are not.  And if we are, then we will; 

and if we're not supposed to go to the court of appeals, 

as we believe a fair reading of the law -- I don't think 

there is any plain text meaning of the law that could go 

otherwise -- then we have -- the only way we can do this 

is through a citizen suit.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think that, on your 

view of 1369, you can't go to the Ninth Circuit?

 MR. FISHER:  Exactly.  And that's what the 

Eleventh Circuit just held in a case just like this, 

where there was a regulation at issue that exempted 

certain discharges from the permitting program.  And the 

Eleventh Circuit said, case dismissed.  You can't bring 

this directly to us.

 So we have an -- an ongoing claim for a 

violation of the statute, which I can't imagine this

Court would want to address in the first instance.

 We also, it's important to understand, have 

a second claim.  And before I describe that second 

claim, let me describe overall -- just remind the Court 

what exactly the case is about.  The case isn't about, 

as the other side has -- has portrayed many times, all 

logging roads, all logging roads that may exist in the 

world -- or the United States.

 What the case is about are two very specific 

kinds of logging roads:  One, logging roads that drain 

themselves by way of pipes, ditches, and channels, only 

the small subset of logging roads that do that; and 

second of all, only logging roads used -- being used for 

active timber harvesting and hauling, not roads that 

just happen to be sitting in the forest not being used, 

but only the small subset of logging roads being used 

for active timber cutting and harvesting.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you mean, "active"? 

What does that mean?

 MR. FISHER:  It means under -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  They -- they cut maybe, 

what, every -- every 10 years?  Is that active?

weeks out of whatever, we would like to have a record on 

that because we don't think that's the reality.

 But what -- what the case -- what we say in 

our complaint is that they have a contract with the 

State of Oregon to harvest particular areas and use 

particular roads to access that timber and to take it 

out.  And the -- and the contract actually requires them 

to use those roads and to maintain their drainage 

systems.

 And so our claim -- again, just to remind 

you what our claim is under the statute -- is that that 

harvesting activity can't be thought of in any other way 

than industrial in nature and that these roads are 

associated with that activity.  They are designed for 

that purpose, and they're indispensable to the activity.

 Now, we have a second argument.  Even if the 

Court thought that we couldn't win -- or a -- whatever 

court looks at this -- thought we couldn't win on the 

statute, we have a Chevron Step II argument that we will 

make and have every right to make because if -- and I'll 

beg this Court's indulgence -- if -- this rule that they 

have just announced on Friday afternoon is not as clear

as you might think.

 So if you start with the language of the 

rule, which is on page 18, what they have done is they 

have amended -- they have amended the stormwater rules 

to -- to provide that the only industrial activities 

associated with logging are sawmills, which are covered 

elsewhere, and then these four categories of things: 

Rock crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, and log 

storage.  All -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Excuse me.  This is 

page 18.  That's -- that's the last page?

 MR. FISHER:  It's page 18, the last page 

of -- at least, I'm -- I hope your copy is the same as 

mine, but on the PDF that -- that was sent up to the 

Court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- and so I'm reading 

under where it says, "stormwater discharges"?

 MR. FISHER:  Yes.  And if you go all the way 

to the bottom, sub 2, "facilities classified under 

SIC 24."

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Thank you.

 MR. FISHER:  And they list those four 

things.  And -- and then industry -- industry group 242 

is the sawmills.

 So they are saying those are the only

industrial activities that are associated with logging. 

But that doesn't answer our claim.  Our claim isn't that 

logging roads themselves are industrial activities.  Our 

claim is that logging roads are associated with 

industrial activities.

 And so we still have a claim that, under 

that -- even if those are the only four industrial 

activities -- or, sorry, five, those four things plus 

sawmills -- we still have a claim that logging roads 

are, quote, "immediate access roads" to those 

activities.

 And the definition of "immediate access 

roads," which is unchanged by the new regulation, is at 

Pet. App. 40a -- the Ninth Circuit quoted it, and I 

think it was described earlier by my friend -- "Roads 

which are exclusively or primarily dedicated for the use 

by the industrial facility."

 So it's still a mystery to us how logging 

roads are not primarily for use by even sawmills or 

these other four things.  And, indeed, if you look very 

carefully at EPA's new regulation in the preamble, on 

page 6, about two-thirds of the way down the middle of 

the page, the only sentence here that EPA gives us, that 

even suggests a possible response to the argument I just 

described is the one that begins with the word "unlike."

They say, "Unlike immediate access roads 

associated with industrial activities, many logging 

roads" -- "many logging roads have multiple uses, 

including recreation and general transportation, and 

commonly extend over long distance, i.e., may not 

provide immediate access to an industrial site."

 So EPA is leaving open our argument.  EPA is 

saying, well, logging roads that are just generally 

recreational, et cetera, are not immediate access roads. 

But our claim -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought -- I 

thought -- I'm sorry.  I thought they said that their 

rules mooted this case.

 MR. FISHER:  Well, that's what they are 

standing here today saying.  But I'm telling you, on the 

language that they gave us on Friday, it doesn't moot 

the case.  And I can't imagine an argument being made on 

Monday, that hasn't been prepared in any written form, 

based on a written thing that we got on Friday, that we 

have an argument under, would moot our case.

 And particularly, Mr. Chief Justice -- and 

this is my point about going through all this -- I can't 

imagine why this Court would want to touch all this in 

the first instance, particularly without supplemental 

briefing, but it seems to me to make every sense to let

the Ninth Circuit address our arguments first.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if we -- if we 

dismiss as improvidently granted, are you suggesting 

that the Ninth Circuit would then be the -- be a court 

to consider this?

 MR. FISHER:  Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm -- I'm just 

thinking if we vacate, perhaps another court will 

consider it, but if we dismiss as improvidently granted, 

the Ninth Circuit will, quite reasonably, think they are 

done.

 MR. FISHER:  No, because we have a forward 

look at the -- the first thing we'll tell the Ninth 

Circuit is -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I mean, 

they're done -- they are done in terms of their 

interpretation of the regulation and the applicable law.

 MR. FISHER:  I think only as to the 

backward-looking regulation, but now, we have -- our 

complaint -- you know, as a citizen suit does -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But then -- but then 

why -- why isn't your -- aren't your concerns met if we 

vacate for the court of appeals to consider, in the 

first instance, the extent to which this regulation may 

bear on its opinion?

MR. FISHER:  Well, I -- I think that gets 

you very close to the same place, Justice Kennedy.  I'm 

just saying there is no reason to vacate because the 

Ninth Circuit's point-source holding is so 

self-evidently right, that I don't know why you'd go to 

the trouble to do that.  It makes the case simpler going 

forward.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I think the -­

the Ninth Circuit had the -- of course, EPA's views 

before it.  I don't know, if I'm the Ninth Circuit, why 

I would reconsider my ruling, in light of this new 

regulation.

backward-looking ruling?

event going forward is the new rule because the citizen 

suit seeks cessation of ongoing violations of the Act,

and that remains the core of our lawsuit, which is 

still seeking damages -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's the -- but 

that's the whole point, which is if you go back what's 

the value of the backward-looking construction, if what 

you're seeking is injunctive relief that has to be based 

on the new rule?

 MR. FISHER:  It doesn't matter very much, 

Justice Sotomayor.  There is two ways in which it might 

matter a little bit.  One is, if we want to press a 

claim for any kind of civil penalties or remediation, 

the backward-looking thing would matter.  We have to 

decide whether we want to do that.

 The second way it would matter would be it 

would provide a helpful baseline for judging the new 

rule in the totality of EPA action, which brings me to 

my -- which brings me back to the argument I was 

describing, which would be our Chevron Step II argument, 

that EPA has simply either left this argument open -- I 

still -- it is still a mystery to us what EPA thinks 

about our real argument, which is that active hauling 

logging roads, when they are being used for active 

harvesting and hauling, are subject to the Act because 

they are plainly associated with industrial activity.

 And if EPA later on came out and said, no,

no, no, we mean to exclude that, too, then we 

respectfully submit, EPA would still have a lot of 

explaining to do.

 First of all, we would very much wonder why 

log sorting, log storage, gravel washing, and rock 

crushing are industrial activities, but mechanized 

timber harvesting with 20-ton pieces of machinery is 

not.

 We'd also wonder why this stuff isn't 

industrial activity, where construction activity, 

landfill operations, surface mining operations that have 

all the same attributes of being done out in the field, 

extraction of resources, heavy machinery, et cetera, 

are, as the EPA itself admits, industrial activity; but, 

somehow -- somehow, logging, which has all the same 

attributes, isn't.

 And so that's what our claim is going 

forward.  Now, I'm not asking this Court to address that 

because I'm not sure this Court wants to get into all of 

this stuff yet; but what I am telling this Court is, 

there is no basis whatsoever to find this case is 

moot -- or I don't think this Court would want to touch 

any of the arguments being made here without further 

briefing, at least as to the new rule.

 We do think it's absolutely clear we are

dealing with point sources.  We do think it's absolutely 

clear, based on the language of -- of 1369(b)(1), that 

there just can't be any way that there is a 

jurisdictional, or whatever other kind of problem you 

want to label it, with us bringing a claim based on the 

statute itself.  The new regulation just simply doesn't 

fall into those.

 So if this Court dismisses the case, we'll 

go to the Ninth Circuit and tell them, we want to go 

forward for -- for the following reasons.  And if 

anybody is unhappy with what happens in the Ninth 

Circuit, obviously, we can file or they can file 

petitions for -- for cert in this Court.

 Let me just say one last thing to this Court 

about what we view as really the arbitrary and 

capricious nature of EPA's new rule and why you 

shouldn't touch it.

 Remember, I said -- and this is in EPA's 

regulations themselves -- that construction activity -­

any construction activity in a site five acres or more 

is industrial activity.

 So if a developer buys a parcel of forested 

land and wants to build a subdivision there and the 

first thing the developer does is punch in some roads 

and drainage systems and cut some trees down to make

room for the houses, that is covered by the EPA's 

stormwater rules; but, if a logging company does 

precisely the same thing, EPA's position seems to be 

it's not covered.

 And not only is it not covered if it happens 

on public land, but I think at least the implication of 

my friend's position is that, for logging companies, of 

which there are many in the northwest, that own their 

own land -- own their own giant pieces of forest land, 

and that are not open to the public, that are not open 

to hunters, that are not open to recreation, but they 

have their own logging roads on their own private lands 

that nobody can use, but them, I still think his 

position is that's not covered by the Act.

 And finally, EPA has one other thing that I 

want to point out to the Court about this new rule.  And 

it's, again, got our heads -- it gets our heads 

scratching as to what EPA is really doing here.

 EPA says twice in the preamble to their new 

rule, once on page 7 and also on page 12, that it, 

quote, "retains the authority to designate at least some 

logging roads as covered by its so-called point -- Phase 

II system."

 What the Phase II system is, is under 

Section 1342(p), which is the stormwater amendments to

the Act, it's the category of point source discharges 

that EPA says are not a covered -- are not industrial 

activity -- associated industrial activity, but we, 

nonetheless, are going to require certain things of 

them.

 This is the critical point.  EPA says this 

twice.  Well, the only authority EPA would have to 

regulate any logging roads -- discharges from logging 

roads, is if they are point sources because you don't 

get into the Phase II program, you don't get into the 

stormwater amendments, unless you have a point source.

 If it's a non-point source, then, as my 

friend has pointed out quite at length in his brief, 

it's entirely up to the States, and EPA has -- has 

nothing to say about it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm looking at page 7, and 

it doesn't say the authority to designate additional 

roads.  It says additional stormwater discharges.

 MR. FISHER:  Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That could be stormwater 

discharges that have nothing to do with logging.

 MR. FISHER:  I think if that's all we had, 

Justice Scalia, it might be a little bit ambiguous, 

although, of course, this is in the context of logging 

the roads.

But look at page 12.  And this is the 

final -- this is the very end of -- of the preamble. 

The last sentence, "EPA believes that stormwater 

discharges from forest roads, including logging roads, 

should be evaluated under Section 402(p)(6)."

 The only authority EPA has for -- for doing 

that is if they -- if they are point sources; whereas 

EPA has filed a brief in this case that says that they 

are, at least some of them, are not.  I don't know if 

it's walking away from that or is planning on walking 

away from that.

 But, again, there is a variety of questions, 

I think, that EPA should have to address and answer --

Did you have one?  I'm sorry -- that EPA should have to 

address and answer before any court does anything based 

on this new rule.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But if you were 

challenging the new rule, you would have EPA as your 

adversary.  The format of this case now is we have -- we 

have Decker on one side and you on the other, and the 

EPA is not in the lawsuit.

 MR. FISHER:  Well, EPA, of course, is an 

amicus, Justice Ginsburg, and EPA has an ongoing right 

to intervene in any citizen suit.  That's a statutory 

right.  And there's a statutory notice that any

plaintiff in a citizen suit is required to provide to 

EPA, which we did provide to EPA.  And so EPA has every 

right to intervene in the case at any point as a party.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does that include a 

right to intervene and dismiss the action?

 MR. FISHER:  Well, I think that EPA has a 

right to intervene and make an argument that the case is 

moot or any other substantive argument they would like 

to make back in the Ninth Circuit.  And of course, 

mootness, if it's genuinely moot, which, for all of 

these reasons, we think, of course, it's not, but 

mootness is an Article III principle that an amicus 

could raise, and a court would be bound to consider on 

its own.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, they -- they are just 

intervening.  It's -- it's not like what happens in 

the -- in the suits for fraud against the government, 

where they take over the litigation.

 MR. FISHER:  Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  They don't take it over. 

They just intervene.

 MR. FISHER:  I think that's what would 

happen.  You could ask them how they would like to 

proceed, but I assume that's how it would happen, and I 

assume the defendants in the case would remain the same.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BISHOP:  Thank you.

 We are not asking you to adjudicate the new 

rule.  I'm not sure why we are hearing all of this about 

the -- the details of the new rule.  What we are asking 

you to do is to get rid of this case.  In getting rid of 

this case on the basis of the stormwater rule, it will

simplify that challenge.

 What it will do is to get rid of this case 

and get rid of a Ninth Circuit opinion that really put 

the court in a -- the position of overriding what EPA 

has been saying consistently since 1976, consistent 

position that collected forest road runoff is not point 

source and, since 1980, that logging is not industrial 

activity, and these roads are not associated with 

industrial activity.
