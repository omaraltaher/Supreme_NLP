          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument

first this morning in No. 02-811, Jeff Groh v. John -

Joseph R. Ramirez.

          Mr. Cordray.

            ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. CORDRAY

                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

          MR. CORDRAY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

          I'd like to reserve 2 minutes of my time for

rebuttal.  This case concerns a mistaken description on

the face of a judicial warrant that the court of appeals

held deprived Agent Groh of qualified immunity, subjecting

him to personal liability for damages in this Bivens

action.  The Ninth Circuit reached this result despite the

fact that the record here shows Agent Groh's manifest good

faith and reasonable course of conduct, including three

key points.

          First, the record shows that the affidavit and

application submitted to the magistrate were sufficient

and comprehensive.  Second, the magistrate personally

reviewed and approved the application and expressly

referenced the affidavit in the warrant he issued.  And

third, the search as executed conformed to the limits set

out in the affidavit and -

          QUESTION: Mr. Cordray, what does the

Constitution provide specifically about this?

          MR. CORDRAY: The Constitution provides that

individuals will not be subject to unreasonable searches

and seizures and that warrants will not issue except upon

probable cause, and stating with particularity the items

to - place to be searched, items to be seized.

          QUESTION: With regard to that last phrase, why

don't we just apply it?

          MR. CORDRAY: I think you do apply it in this

case and this warrant here -

          QUESTION: But the warrant refers to the house.

          MR. CORDRAY: Yes.

          QUESTION: It doesn't list anything that they

were searching for.

          MR. CORDRAY: The warrant itself - and if we turn

to the petition for certiorari appendix, page 26a,

specifically references the affidavit.  The affidavit,

application, and draft warrant form were submitted to the

magistrate as one package.  They were reviewed by the

magistrate and resulted in an issuance of authority to

search -

          QUESTION: Who prepared the warrant?

          MR. CORDRAY: The draft of the warrant form

itself was done initially by Agent Groh.  It was then

signed and executed by the magistrate who approved it.

          QUESTION: Well, but on its face it referred to

the house, not the items being looked for.

          MR. CORDRAY: It did, and that's the mistaken

description on the face of the warrant.  If you look at

the application and -

          QUESTION: Well, you know, why not just apply the

constitutional provision?  I mean, why couldn't the agent

be responsible for checking the warrant?

          MR. CORDRAY: Well, I - I think there's two

questions there.  I think if you - if you apply the

constitutional provision here, the warrant here

specifically references the affidavit.  The magistrate

says, I am satisfied, page 26a -

          QUESTION: But the affidavit was not attached to

the warrant.

          MR. CORDRAY: It was attached to the warrant,

accompanied the warrant when - when the materials went to

the magistrate for approval - it was -

          QUESTION: Yeah, but not - not when it was taken

to be executed.

          MR. CORDRAY: It - it also accompanied the

warrant when the officers were briefed on the nature of

the search.  It did not accompany the warrant at the scene

because it was placed under seal by the court, which is

done routinely in many cases for - for a variety of

important law enforcement purposes.  But here -

          QUESTION: It - it - it seems to me that at - at

some point in this analysis of - and specifically on the

point that you're addressing with Justice O'Connor - that

you have to confront the language in - in Leon in which

the Court said, depending on the circumstances of the

particular case, a warrant may be facially - so facially

deficient that it cannot comply with the Leon rule.  I was

reading your - your brief and kind of waiting with

suspense for you to address this point and it only comes

up at the last few pages of the reply brief and you say

it's a dictum.  I think you have answers to the - to the

point, but it seems to me rather central for what you're

discussing right here.  This was in one sense of the word

facially deficient, no - no question about that.  

          MR. CORDRAY: Yes, although this Court has -

          QUESTION: And it might be that the Sheppard case

is what helps you, but -

          MR. CORDRAY: I think it does, Your Honor.  The

Sheppard case makes clear - footnote 7, the Court says

that if the warrant says, has some sort of suitable words

of reference, see attached affidavit or see affidavit,

that you then can move beyond the four corners of the

paper itself and look to the materials that are part of

the document or your record in front of the magistrate

that are subject to subsequent judicial review, and the

contents of the affidavit can inform the contents of the

warrant.

          QUESTION: Mr. Cordray -

          QUESTION: Well, did - did the warrant here and

the warrant in Sheppard, were they on all fours insofar as

a cross-reference?

          MR. CORDRAY: They were on all fours in two

respects.  First of all, the warrant in Sheppard was

facially defective.  It said that you would search for

controlled substances.  In fact, they were searching for

evidence of homicide investigation.

          QUESTION: Right, almost as bad as the mistake

here.

          MR. CORDRAY: Yeah, in - in some ways worse,

because it specified the search for different evidence. 

Here at least on the face of the warrant it's clear that

there's some sort of discrepancy, and you can inform that

by looking at the affidavit -

          QUESTION: But did the Massachusetts case have a

cross-reference to an affidavit even though the affidavit

wasn't appended?

          MR. CORDRAY: It did not, in fact, and the Court

said that if it had contained some sort of cross-

reference, then you could inform the contents of the

warrant from the contents of the affidavit.  That's what

we believe -

          QUESTION: But doesn't it make sense to assume

that the cross-reference has to be capable of informing of

what is left out?  And in this case, number one, there is

nothing attached to the warrant.  No one reading the

warrant could possibly figure out what within this house

was - was being searched for.

          MR. CORDRAY: I think that's -

          QUESTION: And once again I guess I go back to

Justice O'Connor's question.  Why don't we apply the - the

Fourth Amendment the way it's written, and it says that

the warrant shall particularly describe, not some other

document under seal.

          MR. CORDRAY: I - I think that that's not true in

the important respects under the Fourth Amendment.  The

affidavit was part of the documents given to the

magistrate for prior judicial approval -

          QUESTION: The Fourth Amendment says it's the

warrant that is supposed to particularly describe, not

documents given to a magistrate.

          MR. CORDRAY: What I'm saying is there are three

different potential times that matter here.  One is prior

judicial approval of the search.  The warrant and

application and affidavit were all together to the

magistrate.  Second, in informing the officers of how to

conduct the search, which they did here in accordance with

the constraints, the - the material was provided to the

officers.  The third question is whether the homeowner at

the scene has some independent constitutional right to see

the warrant and the supporting materials before a search

can proceed.  This Court has never held that that's a

constitutional requirement and would be flatly

inconsistent with criminal -

          QUESTION: Whether - whether the homeowner has

the right or whether the point is to make sure that the

officers executing the warrant can check what's in front

of them and find out how far to go, the fact remains that

the Fourth Amendment says the warrant is supposed to

particularly describe.  This didn't, it had no document

appended to it that did.

          MR. CORDRAY: That's not correct, Your Honor. 

This warrant specifically references the affidavit and the

affidavit accompanied to the magistrate and to the

officers before they searched -

          QUESTION: It may refer to it, but if it's not

there, nobody can figure out what it says.

          MR. CORDRAY: Well, they can, in fact, because

the documented record before the magistrate allows

posterior judicial oversight of how the search -

          QUESTION: Not when the police are at the scene

they can't.

          MR. CORDRAY: That is correct.  At the scene -

the Ninth Circuit made a fundamental flaw in its opinion. 

It assumed that the Fourth Amendment is about allowing

homeowners at the scene to -

          QUESTION: It doesn't have to make that

assumption in - in order to apply the Fourth Amendment as

written.  It could perfectly well make the assumption that

the point of the Fourth Amendment description was to make

sure that the officers at the scene knew how far they

could go.

          MR. CORDRAY: Correct.  And they had the warrant,

affidavit, and application -

          QUESTION: But there's some might not - some

might not have been like the officer here, like Officer

Groh, might not have even seen the attached affidavit.  On

the face of this, this does look like the hated general

warrant.  It says, here's a house and there's no bounds at

all, so it looks like this is exactly what the Fourth

Amendment was getting at.  And with respect to Sheppard, I

had a question, maybe you can straighten me out on that. 

Sheppard said the good-faith exception applies, but to

apply - apply an exception, wouldn't you need to have a

Fourth Amendment violation in the first place?

          MR. CORDRAY: This was a subject of discussion in

Sheppard.  The separate opinion by Justice Stevens states

specifically, and presents an argument for why the Fourth

Amendment was not violated in that case.  The majority was

willing to assume a violation on the record before it,

didn't specifically decide the Fourth Amendment question

but assumed such a violation and went on to apply the good

faith -

          QUESTION: So that - that case doesn't answer the

question, was there a Fourth Amendment violation?

          MR. CORDRAY: I would agree with you that -

          QUESTION: And why do you have to ask that

question?

          MR. CORDRAY: Beg your pardon?

          QUESTION: Why do you have to ask that question? 

Why do you have to establish, as you seem to be trying to

establish, that this complied with the Fourth Amendment,

which, if you read the Fourth Amendment, it clearly

didn't.  But what we're discussing here is what is the

remedy for its failure to comply with the Fourth

Amendment, aren't we?

          MR. CORDRAY: Well -

          QUESTION: If - if I disagree with you that there

- that there is a Fourth Amendment violation, do I have to

find that it was proper as a remedy for that violation to

hold - to hold this agent liable?

          MR. CORDRAY: Certainly not, Your Honor, and I do

agree with Justice Ginsburg's point that Sheppard is

probably more germane to the qualified immunity inquiry

here than perhaps to the Fourth Amendment inquiry, given

that the Court did not explicitly decide the Fourth

Amendment issue in Sheppard.  But here, we would say that

qualified immunity applies on two distinct grounds. 

First, the Court has adverted in Malley v. Briggs, it

wasn't a specific holding, that if in fact the conduct of

the officers is such that the good-faith Leon exception

would apply in a criminal suppression hearing then, in

parallel, qualified immunity should apply in a civil

action against the officer.  That would be one ground for

finding qualified immunity here and a sufficient ground.

          In addition, if the law was not clearly

established at the time that - a number of points that the

Ninth Circuit decided for the first time in this case -

that the warrant cannot, by suitable words of reference,

incorporate the contents of the affidavit.  Number two,

that the officers are obliged constitutionally after a

warrant issues to double check the magistrate's handiwork

and correct any errors that they find.  And number three,

that they cannot at the scene, as Agent Groh attempted

reasonably to do here, inform the homeowner of exactly

what the nature of the search was.  It was done verbally

in person with the wife and over the telephone with the

husband, and -

          QUESTION: Well, you - you say, the Ninth Circuit

said they couldn't inform the homeowner?

          MR. CORDRAY: Said that that would not be

sufficient to - to correct -

          QUESTION: Yeah, it didn't say that they couldn't

have, but it's - it's - the Ninth Circuit said that the

homeowner had a right to be shown the warrant, I take it,

did it not?

          MR. CORDRAY: Didn't specifically hold that, but

certainly seemed to presume it, that the - not only the

warrant but all the supporting materials so that the

homeowner could exercise some self-help right at the

scene, block the officers, and attempt to interfere with

their execution of -

          QUESTION: The Ninth -

          QUESTION: What do the Federal rules say about

the - what the police or the officers have to do with the

warrant in the search of a house?

          MR. CORDRAY: Criminal Rule 41, which this Court

has said incorporates or is certainly consistent with

Fourth Amendment principles, says that a warrant needs to

be left at the scene after a search is completed if

property is taken along with an inventory of the property. 

There's no suggestion the rule does not require the

warrant be given to the homeowners at the outset as long

as they're reasonably informed -

          QUESTION: Doesn't it talk - or correct me if I'm

wrong - about serving the warrant?

          MR. CORDRAY: It - it talks about a number of

things.  It talks about obtaining a warrant, keeping a

documentary record in front of the magistrate so that

subsequent judicial review is available.  It also talks

about executing the warrant at the - at the scene.  If the

Court wishes to refer to Criminal Rule 41, it's been

amended a couple of times, I believe the current version

is 41(f) -

          QUESTION: Where is that in the papers?

          MR. CORDRAY: It's not in the documents here.  I

apologize, Your Honor.  But 41(f)(3), it's referred to in

the Solicitor General's brief and in our brief, is that

they must give a copy of the warrant, receipt for the

property taken, after the search is completed, but not

before the search begins, and that makes a great deal of

sense.  The Fourth Amendment is about making sure that

there is - there is prior judicial authority to proceed

with a search and that there is documentation available

later to check the search and make sure it did not exceed

the authority -

          QUESTION: You mentioned the later documentation,

but isn't there an interest in letting the homeowner know

that the man has authority to make the search?

          MR. CORDRAY: Yes, which Agent Groh -

          QUESTION: So, shouldn't - shouldn't he have to

display it if - if requested?

          MR. CORDRAY: I believe that if - if he's asked

for the warrant before he can enter, what would be

reasonable in the circumstances would be to show the

warrant.

          QUESTION: And he'd have a duty to do that?

          MR. CORDRAY: I - I believe that in many cases

that would be the most reasonable thing, and therefore

perhaps the Constitution would have required it.

          QUESTION: That's not my question.  Would he have

a duty to do that?

          MR. CORDRAY: I'm not certain of that, but I

think it would be better practice and reasonable conduct.

          QUESTION: Go back -

          QUESTION: It doesn't say it in the rule at all.

          QUESTION: Could you go back to Justice Scalia's

question?

          MR. CORDRAY: Sure.

          QUESTION: I thought that this was a very simple

case.  Somebody really mucked up the warrant, okay?  They

made a technical mistake.  Instead of saying, seize - look

for and seize some guns, they said, look for and seize a

house, all right?  Now, nobody could think that that made

any sense.

          MR. CORDRAY: Yeah, except that before printing

the affidavit -

          QUESTION: Nobody.  No - you don't think it does,

I don't think it does.  So you can say one of three

things: A, that the warrant is constitutional, which is

what you're arguing, which is a little tough, because I

guess if we said this was constitutional, we'd have to say

a warrant is constitutional.  If it says seize and then it

says I'm not going to tell you, look in vault three of the

Kremlin, you know, to see what we're supposed to seize.  I

mean, that's a tough route that you're taking.

          The second route is what Justice Scalia

suggested, which is to say, well, it isn't really his

fault, the search team leader, because he was in good

faith.  For me, that's tough because I - if you cast his

eye on this piece of paper and just glanced at it, he

would have seen it was faulty.  Route three is to say,

they're right in their lawsuit, let them bring it,

damages, by the way, are going to be pretty low, okay? 

Now you explain to me why it should be route two, which is

Justice Scalia's question, rather than just route three.

          MR. CORDRAY: Sure.  This Court said in Malley

that if in fact the officers make a mistake of fact in

good faith that, if in fact Leon would apply to avoid

suppressing that evidence in a criminal prosecution, the

parallel should apply and qualified immunity would be

appropriate in a civil action.  I think that that is what

makes the most sense of the objective -

          QUESTION: Now - now tell me why, because as I've

made my point, it sounds to me that this man did not

behave sensibly, because if he just looked at the piece of

paper he would have seen in 3 seconds it says, seize the

house, and we're not out here to seize the house, we're

out to seize some guns.

          MR. CORDRAY: The magistrate -

          QUESTION: So it wasn't like a minor, common

mistake -

          MR. CORDRAY: The magistrate -

          QUESTION: - so why was that reasonable?

          MR. CORDRAY: The magistrate also looked at this

piece of paper and failed to notice the error.  The

materials were made -

          QUESTION: So two people -

          QUESTION: How do we know that the magistrate did

look at the piece of paper?  

          MR. CORDRAY: Because he signed the piece of

paper.

          QUESTION: Any magistrate who looked at that

piece of paper would say your warrant - your warrant

application or the form you've given me does not indicate

what you're searching for, unless you really are going to

put the house up on a flatbed truck and take it away,

which we know you're not.  It's - it's - the obvious, I

think the obvious probability is that the - the agent did

not read what his secretary had typed in and the

magistrate did not read what the agent presented to him,

and this sometimes happens.  I've had it happen to me. 

You hand the magistrate the application and he says, where

do you want me to sign?  Isn't that probably what

happened?

          MR. CORDRAY: It's hard for me to know exactly

what happened subject with the magistrate.  We do know

that he signed the warrant.  We also know that he signed

the application, which was presented to him, that had the

particular description of the items to be seized.  That's

at page 28a of the appendix.

          QUESTION: Maybe he should be liable too.  I

mean, except for judicial absolute immunity, I - I don't

know, you say, you know, the magistrate's just as bad. 

What does that prove?  It doesn't prove anything.

          MR. CORDRAY: Let me bore in on the qualified

immunity issue, if I may, on both counts.  First -

          QUESTION: Before you do that, just one

preliminary question.  Justice Scalia suggested earlier

you could go right to qualified immunity to get all the

rest, but I thought the - that this Court's precedent said

you have to make a ruling, did it violate the Fourth

Amendment, before you get to qualified immunity.

          MR. CORDRAY: That's how we read the Court's

cases, at least to the last 6 or 7 years.  It's been a

pretty consistent approach.

          QUESTION: That may well be, but you don't have

to argue it.  My point was that you -

          MR. CORDRAY: That's fine. 

          QUESTION: - didn't have to argue it -

          MR. CORDRAY: That's fine.

          QUESTION: - not that we don't have to decide it.

          MR. CORDRAY: That's fine.  Let me - let me say,

under Massachusetts v. Sheppard, this is clearly in good

faith here.  Qualified immunity should apply.  Why? 

Because this agent prepared all the materials, submitted

it all to the magistrate, is the one who personally had

the interchange with the magistrate back and forth,

whereupon the magistrate approves the search and executes

a warrant.  He did not catch the error, that's true. 

          QUESTION: He didn't have a bad motive?

          MR. CORDRAY: No, I mean that he - he acted in

good faith, objectively, reasonably on the course of the

record.  He - he knew what search he was asking for.  He

submitted those materials.  There's a particular list of

the items to be seized in the application and in the

affidavit.  It was omitted from the warrant.  That's why

we're here.  Nonetheless, this is exactly the kind of

case, and many court of appeals have held this, in which

Leon would apply in a criminal suppression hearing.

          Also, the Ninth Circuit here reached this result

by announcing a new rule.  They said an officer has a duty

to proofread a warrant even after it's issued by a

magistrate.  They had rejected that rule in Marks v.

Clarke just a year earlier, and now they reversed ground

and they announce a new rule.  That is classically the

basis for qualified immunity under this Court's strong

precedents that the - the officer cannot be held to

predict the future course of constitutional law.  Should -

 do they know there's a Fourth Amendment?  Do they know it

contains a particularity requirement?  Presumably they do. 

But do they know how that applies in all circumstances and

that they have a duty to proofread a warrant even though

they've made out the materials, they've submitted to the

magistrate, they've been there with the magistrate and

gotten the approval as they assumed that they saw it?

          Massachusetts v. Sheppard very strongly says

that - that we do not hold the officers to have a further

duty in that instance.  If you hold it in this case for

the first time and anew, the qualified immunity at a

minimum should be appropriate for the officer here.

          If I may reserve the balance of my time.

          QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Cordray. 

          Mr. Schlick, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

          MR. SCHLICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

          This Court has rejected a technical perfection

standard in construing a warrant.  In Steele v. United

States, the warrant authorized a search of 611 West 46th

Street.  This Court determined, in light of the

circumstances of the case, including the affidavit that

was submitted to the magistrate in that case, that the

search properly was conducted for 609 West 46th Street, as

well as 611, and the rules - the rules stated in Steele v.

United States is that a warrant satisfies the

particularity requirement of the warrant clause if an

officer executing a search could determine with reasonable

effort what the magistrate authorized.

          QUESTION: So do you say this is just a technical

mistake?  If it said, go to the Empire State Building and

seize the Empire State Building, that's just a technical

mistake?  I mean, they may have made it for a technical

reason, but you'd have no idea what they're supposed to

look for.

          MR. SCHLICK: And it - the question in that case,

Your Honor, would be, is it clear what the magistrate

authorized?  In this case -

          QUESTION: No, it isn't clear.  How is it clear?

          MR. SCHLICK: In - in that case, if it is not

clear, then there is a violation of the particularity

requirement -

          QUESTION: But you're saying here it's clear

because the affidavit said it, but the affidavit's locked

away somewhere and nobody can look at it.

          MR. SCHLICK: No, it's - it - is - in fact it was

unsealed, and typically when warrants are put - when

applications are placed under seal, there's a provision

for unsealing the application upon the indictment or after

a period of time, or a motion to unseal can be brought,

which could have been done in this case, but in fact, the

motion was brought by the Government in the - in the first

place.

          QUESTION: So, in fact, what a homeowner's

supposed to do is if the warrant - he looks at it, by the

way, it's blank, it's blank.  And the officer says, don't

worry, I'm not going to tell you what I'm looking for, but

just go somewhere to a court house and make a motion to

unseal an affidavit and that will solve the problem.  Is -

 is that what the Fourth Amendment is about?

          MR. SCHLICK: The Fourth Amendment does not

protect, contrary to the Ninth Circuit's belief, the

Fourth Amendment does not protect the - a supposed

interest in reviewing the warrant during the search.  As

Mr. Cordray explained, that's inconsistent with Rule 41. 

It also would render impossible electronic surveillance. 

The - there also would be a serious safety concern.  We

simply do not want citizens contesting at the scene of the

search whether the scope - whether the scope of the search

is lawful.  It is safer for everyone -

          QUESTION: Well, I don't want - the - the court

of appeals seemed to envision some sort of a collaborative

proceeding where there's a conversation between the

officers executing the warrant and the homeowner and - and

that - that seemed to me without foundation.  On the other

hand, I suppose the homeowner has a right to look at the

warrant and to comment - to comment on it.

          MR. SCHLICK: Under Rule 41, the right attaches

when property is seized, as part of the receipt for the

property that's seized.  There may, as with -

          QUESTION: Well, I - I know, but there's a knock

on the door and the policeman says, I have a warrant.  And

I say, may I see it?  He says, well, oh no, you can't see

it until I leave.  Is that - is that your position?

          MR. SCHLICK: No, again that would be analyzed

under the law of knock and announce, and it may be

reasonable under the circumstances -

          QUESTION: If they have a warrant, do I have a

right to read the warrant?

          MR. SCHLICK: And the question would be -

          QUESTION: The homeowner.

          MR. SCHLICK: If - if the homeowner denied entry

until a copy of the warrant is provided, the officer would

be faced with the question, is this a constructive denial

of entry?  Is there some exigency for getting into the

property?  And it may be reasonable under the

circumstances -

          QUESTION: No, there - no, there - there's no

exigency because there's only one person there and he's at

the door and that person says, I'd like to read this

warrant.  Does he have the right to do that before the

officer enters?

          MR. SCHLICK: If there were no exigencies, then

ordinarily the reasonableness principle probably would

require that, but the purpose of the particularity

requirement, it's very clear, is to ensure that the search

is conducted in accordance with what the magistrate

authorized.

          QUESTION: Why isn't that in our rule if - if

you're willing to concede that that's a constitutional

requirement?

          MR. SCHLICK: We - we are not conceding it's a

constitutional requirement.  We're saying that under

certain circumstances -

          QUESTION: Well, that - you say - you say it's

part of the reasonableness requirement to show it to the

homeowner if he demands it.

          MR. SCHLICK: Under - under circumstances where

there is no exigency where the request to see the warrant

-

          QUESTION: Under normal circumstances, when there

is no exigency.  Under normal circumstances, if the

homeowner demands to see the warrant, you think it is

constitutionally required that you show the homeowner the

warrant?

          MR. SCHLICK: If - if the choice - if the

homeowner denies entry, there's no exigency, and the

officer's faced with the choice of break down the door or

show the warrant, then reasonableness may require showing

the warrant.  But - but no, there is no general - there is

no general reasonableness requirement, and as I've said,

this Court's cases, cases such as Dalia and electronic

surveillance contexts make clear -

          QUESTION: Your - your point about electronic

surveillance seems to me quite - quite forceful.  You do -

 you do not have to give - give the person who's being

electronically surveilled a - a warrant beforehand.  He

has no opportunity to see what's - what's being done.  I

don't see why the constitutional principle would differ

with regard to a - to a physical search.

          MR. SCHLICK: Our position, Your Honor, is there

is no general requirement of providing a copy of the

warrant, and the Ninth Circuit asserted an interest in

reviewing the warrant during the search is simply not

protected by the particularity requirement -

          QUESTION: But you - but you are saying that in -

 in circumstances, you gave an example, the reasonableness

requirement would result in an obligation to show the

warrant.

          MR. SCHLICK: It - it may under circumstances,

but not as a general rule.

          QUESTION: Well, let's - let's take - let's -

the homeowner comes to the door and says, I'd like to see

homeowner says, I - I'd like to read it, and the police

say, no, you can't read it.  And the homeowner says, look,

I'll give you whatever you've got a right to seize under

this warrant.  You don't have to tear the house apart,

just let me see what it is you want.  The police answer,

no, we're not going to tell you, we're going to go through

the house ourselves.  Do you think that would be

reasonable execution of the warrant?

          MR. SCHLICK: Yes, I - I think it - it - in most

circumstances would be reasonable, yes, that the -

          QUESTION: They would have a right to - to - to

tear the house apart when the homeowner stands at the

threshold and says, tell me what you've got a right to

          MR. SCHLICK: The - the question - the question

in that case would be whether the search was conducted

within the scope of the warrant.  If so, it would be a

valid search and -

          QUESTION: The question is whether it's a

reasonable search, and that includes an - an issue about

the manner in which the warrant is executed.

          MR. SCHLICK: A - a search would not be rendered

unreasonable by virtue of a discussion between the

officers and the citizen.  The question would be how the

search was conducted.  I would like to discuss the law -

          QUESTION: Well, I - I suppose that the officer

doesn't have to take the word of the homeowner either that

I'm getting you exactly what you want, you know, if the

guy's charged with some sort of fraud, maybe he's going to

continue.

          MR. SCHLICK: That - that's true and, of course,

the things that are seized may not conform to the warrant

because of the plain view rule that the officer may seize

things that aren't covered in the rest of the warrant.

          QUESTION: But -

          MR. SCHLICK: Now, under the law of qualified

immunity -

          QUESTION: Mr. Schlick, as far as the rule is

concerned, the rule - the heading is receipt, so the rule

- rule doesn't address this problem.  It goes to what you

do in inventory and then you give a receipt, if you're

going to take away property give a receipt, and by the

way, give the warrant with it.  So I don't think we can

read this rule as saying you don't have to give the

warrant if the homeowner requests it.  It just says if

you're taking away property then you give a receipt, and

part of the receipt is the warrant.

          MR. SCHLICK: The only requirement to providing

the warrant is if property is taken away.  Agent Groh also

is protected from suit under the law of qualified

immunity.  There was - there's no clearly established law

that requires an officer to undertake particular

procedures in the preparation of a warrant.  The Ninth's

Circuit novel proofreading requirement had not even been

conceived at the time of this search.  In addition, the

law is in disarray concerning the circumstances under

which an affidavit or an application may be considered in

construing the warrant.  Off - Agent Groh also was

operating under a reasonable mistake of fact.

          QUESTION: But if he had been on the way to the

residence and 3 minutes before he got there, the residents

say, oh, this is a terrible mistake here, would he have

the obligation to turn around and go back or have somebody

bring him the affidavit out?

          MR. SCHLICK: Under Steele, the question would be

whether it was sufficiently clear what the magistrate

authorized.  We believe under these circumstances it was

clear, so he would not have had that obligation.  But as a

practical matter, and this is very important, officers are

not going to conduct searches when there is a question

about the scope -

          QUESTION: So - so that - so that even if he sees

the mistake before he makes the entry on the premises, he

can - he can proceed?

          MR. SCHLICK: If it's sufficiently clear under

Steele, yes.

          QUESTION: And under these facts?

          MR. SCHLICK: Yes, yes.  And - and if - and

again, this goes to the purpose of the particularity

requirement, which is ensuring that the search is

conducted in accordance with what the magistrate

authorized.  If that is - if that is satisfied, then there

is no constitute - then there is no constitutional

violation and there's no constitutional interest in having

the officer delay the search.  But again, as a practical

matter, the officer is going to want to be sure that

suppression remedy -

saying this warrant is sufficient?

          MR. SCHLICK: Yes.  The -

          QUESTION: So - so - you want us to write an

opinion to say that we can have warrants like this all the

time and there's no problem.

          MR. SCHLICK: Again, that's the constitutional

rule, but as a practical matter, officers are not going to

take risks when they're - when they don't face an exigent

          QUESTION: Talking about a constitutional minimum

- you say that a constitutional minimum - this warrant

would - is - is adequate under the Fourth Amendment in all

circumstances?

          MR. SCHLICK: Under these circumstances, which

include particularly the references in the warrant, Agent

Groh's application and affidavit, which include the clear

lift - list - in his application and the magistrate's

signature on the warrant without making any edits.

          This is not in the typed version that we have,

but if you look at the actual warrant form, which is

document number five in the district court, you can see

that the - that the magistrate signed the warrant form and

it's a typed form on which there are handwritten notes, so

- so -

          QUESTION: I did see it.  I did look at that and

it occurred to me at that moment that all you're asking

people to do is just glance at the document quickly to

catch obvious mistakes, which this is.

          MR. SCHLICK: And - and in this case, if Agent

Groh had glanced -

          QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Schlick.

          Mr. Kozakiewicz, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VINCENT J. KOZAKIEWICZ

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

          The Ramirez home was searched pursuant to a

nonsensical warrant.  They were deprived of the

protections of the essential function of the warrant,

which this Court has said is to assure the individual

whose property is being searched and seized of the lawful

authority of the executing officer, his need to search,

and the limits of his power to search.  The particularity

requirement has -

          QUESTION: Where - where do - where do we say

that?  Did we say that in a case that -

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, Your Honor, you say that

in - it was actually quoted in the McGrew case.  It was

stated in Illinois v. Gates and in citing Chadwick at page

9 in California v. Acevedo.  

          QUESTION: If - if - if that is indeed the

purpose of the warrant, isn't it passing strange that the

rules relating to warrants do not require that the warrant

be served, be presented to the individual, unless and

until something is taken, at which point the warrant has

to be left plus a list of the things taken?  I mean, I

just find it remarkable that our rules of criminal

procedure would not require the service of a warrant, and

indeed, if that is the purpose of a warrant, what do you

do about warrants for electronic surveillance, for

wiretaps?  Does - do - do you have to serve the object of

the wiretap with a warrant saying, we're going to be

tapping your phone, so he'll say, oh, thank you very much,

you know, I'll use another phone.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: With - with respect to a

wiretap, you have some exigent circumstances there.  What

the - what the Ramirezes were facing were the search of

their home -

          QUESTION: It's not - what's exigent - what's

exigent about it?  Not necessarily, I -

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: There's no necessarily -

there's - with a wiretap there's no invasion, a physical

invasion of the home and the rummaging through their

personal belongings.

          QUESTION: Counsel, I suppose you don't have to

take the position that there's some right of the homeowner

to examine the warrant before the officer is admitted to

the home to win this case, do you?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's true, Your -

          QUESTION: Why are you taking that position then? 

That gets you into a lot of hot water, because it hasn't

been clearly defined.  I mean, the Ninth Circuit seemed to

place a lot of weight on the point, but I'm not sure it is

necessary for you to prevail in this case.  I'd like to

hear your views.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Your - Your Honor, that - that

is correct.  The - the warrant was - was facially invalid,

it was plain to see, but the - the Ninth Circuit has

established a very - clearly established rule to say that

the warrant requires a particular description.  We are

willing to - if it's not contained within the four corners

of that document - to go be - to look at documents outside

the four corners, provided it meets certain criteria, that

being it is specifically referenced into the - into - in

the warrant itself and somehow accompanies or is attached

to the warrant.

          Under those circumstances it would become part

of the warrant and they would recognize that, and the

court went on to say that that has - was the rule in the

Ninth Circuit for a long period of time.  Agent Groh

should have known about that, and it was - it was the

clear law and therefore a constitutional violation took

place and he did not - could not have good faith in his

belief that he complied with that requirement of the

warrant.

          QUESTION: Why, when McGrew didn't issue until 6

months after the conduct in question?  McGrew set the

circuit law for the - at least for the Ninth.  It said

that the executing officer has to read the warrant, but

that wasn't on the books when this search occurred.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Your Honor, McGrew was decided

6 months after the search in this case.  However, the

events that took place in McGrew happened before this

case.  If McGrew had never occurred, this would have been

-

          QUESTION: But what made the law clear in the

Ninth Circuit was not the timing of the McGrew search, but

the ruling of the Ninth Circuit.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: The - the McGrew decision said

that it was clearly established at - through their - their

prior decisions of the requirement that the warrant refer

to and either have attached to or accompany the affidavit

if you wanted to - to use it as a basis to meet the

particularity requirement, and it - it looked at other

cases besides just that one.  This has been the law in

this circuit for over - over a decade.

          QUESTION: I see that there is a serious

question, I think, underlying what you're saying.  You're

saying that this is really a question of cross-reference. 

The Constitution requires the warrant to describe the

things to be seized.  Now, what the Government says is

this - we have permitted in cases that requirement to be

fulfilled where the warrant piece of paper is perhaps

blank or erroneous, but it cross-references another

document.  And you've said, it can do that where that

other document is physically attached or, let's say, at

least in the car.  There was one case that said in the

car, but not where it's in a vault someplace.  And Justice

Scalia, I think, asked why - why is that?  Because if the

purpose of the Fourth Amendment is not to alert the

homeowner, but simply to be certain there is a check on

the searcher, why have the cases come out the way you've

just described them?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Because it's a - not to have

that warrant or the supporting documentation to the

warrant present to meet the particularity requirement is

an opportunity for abuse.

          QUESTION: What kind of abuse?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: To be abuse to - to the - that

the officer can come to the home, say I'm planning - I'm

planning to search for - for something, ransack the house,

find nothing, leave no warrant, and the person has no idea

of the legal authority of - of why the officer was there,

what he was doing there.  He could have the opportunity to

decide he wants to go in and rummage through the personal

papers and -

          QUESTION: But he didn't, and that goes back to a

question that Justice Scalia raised earlier.  Assuming

there is a violation of the Fourth Amendment, you're

bringing a Bivens action, and if we recall the facts in

Bivens that - the police acted as rough as can be, they

manacled the man, they told him they were going to arrest

his wife and children, they hauled him off to jail and

they strip-searched him.  Nothing like that happened here.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's correct, Your Honor. 

However, Bivens 19 - in 1983 action, depending upon

whether the actor is State or Federal agent, follow the

same - same line of reasoning of whether - was the action

a violation of constitutional right and was it objectively

reasonable.

          QUESTION: But the damages here, nothing happened

here that would not have happened if the right portion of

the application had been copied into the warrant.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: The - the - the damages was to

- to the - the homeowner's ability to be assured of the

authority of the officer to be here.

          QUESTION: Well, I'm not sure about that.  Does

the homeowner say, well, I'd like to - this is a long

warrant, I have to sit down and read this, and they sit

down by the fire and read the warrant and discuss it? 

That's not the way it works.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Under the circumstances of this

case, there was no opportunity ever for the - the

homeowner to - to know what - 

          QUESTION: Well, but we're asking what the

general requirement is.  Once - once the homeowner finds

that the police have the authority to enter, then don't

the cases teach us that the purpose of the warrant is to

control the discretion of the officer, not the knowledge

of the homeowner, and incidentally, I think you might be

able to read Rule 41 as saying that when an officer leaves

he has to give a copy of the warrant whether he takes

anything or not.  I'm - I'm not quite sure that that's the

right interpretation.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Well, you're -

          QUESTION: Let's assume that that's done.  I

don't think the homeowner has the right to monitor the

search.  There's - there's no authority for that.  The

Ninth Circuit seemed to say - think that. 

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, Your Honor, the Ninth

Circuit said that and, in fact, in the Gant case, which

was cited in - in McGrew, they said that there's a - a

duty of the officer under the rule to provide the

homeowner with the warrant prior to leaving the scene.

          QUESTION: Under the rule, they said?  Under the

rule?  Well.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, Your Honor.

          QUESTION: That's not true, is it?  I mean, you -

 you can create such a duty -

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: No.

          QUESTION: - but it doesn't appear in the rule at

all, does it?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: The - the Gant decision that

referred to the - to the rule was looking at the - the

argument was made in that case by the Government that the

rule only required it, and said that since the - the Katz

decision says that it - the rule does not invariably

require it to - the Government to serve the warrant, that

it must usually require that it be done.

          QUESTION: Doesn't say anything at all about

warrant when no property is taken.  As far as - I have the

text of Rule 41 in front of me.  It talks about leaving

the warrant when you've taken property.  There's not one

word in this that I can see about leaving the warrant when

you haven't taken property.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's correct, Your Honor, and

that's the - the real problem in this - in this case, when

if - if there is no duty to leave a warrant, as suggested

by the - the United States in their - their brief when no

property is taken, then it's the invitation to abuse that

I - I talked about earlier.

          QUESTION: Well, but do you - do you have to - do

you have to maintain that position to win your case?  I

mean, do you have to get us to accept your - that - that

proposition in order to win your case?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: No.  I think the plain language

of the particularity requirement is all that is needed and

this does not meet the particularity requirement.

          QUESTION: Can we get back to the question I

think that you hadn't completed your answer to before? 

So, assuming that there is a violation of the Fourth

Amendment, what harm to this family - I mean, the contrast

with Bivens in that regard is stark, because the - the -

what you recited, the same thing would happen if the

warrant had copied the right paragraph of the application. 

There was no rough stuff.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: The damage is the fact that

their constitutional right to have a - a properly executed

and a properly written warrant prior to the invasion of

the home.

          QUESTION: So -

          QUESTION: Of course, that's really not what the

Fourth Amendment says, is it?  It just - it doesn't say

you need - you need - I mean, surely there's some play in

the joints, isn't there?  It's - it categorically

prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, right?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Correct.

          QUESTION:  And then it goes on to say, and any

warrants, you know, where you need a warrant shall

particularly describe the - the person or place to be

searched and the items to be seized.  But it doesn't say

categorically that you can't - you need a warrant all the

time, so there's some play in the joints.  Why couldn't we

say that at least in this case where there was a good-

faith attempt to get a warrant and where the affidavit

would have justified a warrant, it is not the one thing

that the Fourth Amendment prohibits, an unreasonable

search and seizure, to go ahead with this defective

warrant?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Because there was no effort on

the part of Agent Groh to comply with that particular

requirement, and that leads to the opportunity for abuse

because he - there is no evidence in the - in the record

to show that he had any - did anything to comply - to see

that he had a warrant that met the particularity

requirement.

          QUESTION: But - but there's nothing in the

Fourth Amendment that requires a warrant, even for the

entry into a home, and as you know of, many entries into

homes are done without a warrant when there are exigent

circumstances.  Now, if - if you can say that that is not

an unreasonable search and seizure, why can you not say it

is not an unreasonable search and seizure to proceed on

the basis of a warrant that has a - a technical - clear

technical defect, but nonetheless was sought and - and

would have issued in perfect conformity with

constitutional requirements.  Why does that make it an

unreasonable search and seizure?  I can see that it makes

it a search and seizure without a proper warrant as

defined in Article IV - in the Fourth Amendment - but the

Fourth Amendment does not require a warrant all the time.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: It does not require a warrant

all the time if there are exigent circumstances.  There

were no exigent circumstances in this case.

          QUESTION: Well, that's not the only exception. 

I mean, that's one exception that - that we've developed. 

Why can't we say another exception is where you've done

everything that is necessary to get a warrant, and the

warrant you've gotten, yeah, it doesn't really comply with

the description of the warrant there, but still to proceed

that way is not unreasonable search and seizure?  It's

mistaken but it's not an unreasonable search and seizure.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Because I think the - that

would trivialize the - the requirement of the

particularity clause, because particularity as well as

probable cause weigh into the - the general warrant

situation and -

          QUESTION: Are you - you suggesting that maybe it

was unreasonable?  Since there were no exigent

circumstances this warrant could have been executed the

next day for as far as we know from this record, to go

back and say, oh my goodness, look at this, it's a general

warrant, I better get it particularized.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That - that's correct, and he -

 he should have done that, because the - the problem here

is that there was - it was plain for everyone to see. 

This was the - the Leon - the warrant that was envisioned

in Leon that was so facially valid that no reasonable

officer could rely on it -

          QUESTION: With respect to Leon, Mr. Cordray

urged that if you would meet the good-faith exception, in

any case where the good-faith exception would apply so the

evidence isn't suppressed, the officer would have

qualified immunity.  Do you agree that that's a - a proper

equation?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Only if there is good faith

that the officer attempted to comply with the

particularity requirement, because if there was good faith

that there was probable cause, that does not supply the

particularity any more than the oath and affirmation to

say that this was oath and affirmation.  To have a valid

warrant you need all legs of the stool, and the

particularity requirement is one of those.

          QUESTION: May I ask you a question about the -

          QUESTION: So what you are saying is not because

the - the same reason it's not a qualified immunity is the

same reason it isn't an unreasonable search.  It isn't a

reasonable search, isn't a reasonable search, and there is

no qualified immunity because he didn't even glance at the

document, and for the head man not to glance at the

document is not good faith and is unreasonable.  If that's

your argument - as I guess you're going to accept this now

-

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes.

          QUESTION: All right, fine.  I'd like to go back

for one second to Justice Ginsburg's - one of her initial

questions, is, what is it you are seeking here?  A dollar

in damages and an apology?  Because, after all, if you

accept my argument, they would have just gone back and

gotten a better warrant and it would have taken them a

couple of hours and all the same thing would have

happened.  So - so what - what is it you're seeking in

this lawsuit?  An apology and a dollar or something else?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: We're seeking money damages

that a - a jury would -

          QUESTION: Well, is there any way it could be

more than a dollar?

a dollar?  I mean, you must have thought this through,

because, after all, you have filed a complaint and they

hired you and -

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, it is - yes, it is, Your

Honor, because the trauma - the traumatization that Mrs.

Ramirez went through by agents coming into her home and

saying, we have a warrant to search for explosives -

          QUESTION: Is different from what it would have

happened an hour later?  Different from what -

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, yes.

          QUESTION: - would have happened if they'd

corrected the error and gone back and done the same thing

-

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That - that's correct -

          QUESTION: - because?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Because there was that time

frame, and in this case it was a continue of a time frame

that she was under - under the fright of people being in

her home, searching it, ransacking it, going - going

through it.  There was - we've alleged in the complaint

damage to personal property.  All this was done without

her knowing and whether they had the right to be there,

what they were looking for other than -

          QUESTION: But I - I thought the facts say that

they correctly - at least in the petitioner's brief - they

say that they correctly notified the homeowner about the

purpose and objects of the search.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That would be an oral

notification, and there is no assurance given to the -

through oral notification, he could make up anything he

wants.

          QUESTION: You think when the Fourth Amendment

was adopted or when the English tradition that underlaid

the Fourth Amendment was - was formed, most people could

read a warrant?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: I don't know, Your Honor.

          QUESTION: Then - then do you think the

homeowners would have the right to exclude the constable

until he could get somebody who was literate to read the

warrant that the constable presented to him?  Maybe call

his attorney and say, you know, there's a warrant here I

can't read, can you come over and read it for me?

          QUESTION: They didn't have telephones.

          QUESTION: His attorney lived - lived across the

street actually.  I mean, this - this notion that this is

part of the - of the warrant requirement, it seems to me,

is based on a real misunderstanding of - people couldn't

read, most of them.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Well, that makes an assumption

of what took place there.  In today's society most people

can read and Mrs. Ramirez can -

          QUESTION: Well, we might - we - maybe we should

add that requirement to the Fourth Amendment.  I assume we

could amend the Fourth Amendment to say, in addition to

what it used to mean, you have to present the warrant at

least to people who are literate.

          QUESTION: Counsel, if we conclude that there is,

in fact, no requirement, as the Ninth Circuit seemed to

think there was, that the warrant be shown to the

homeowner in advance, assume that's not a requirement. 

What are the damages left other than attorneys fees?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: If the - the -

about attorneys' fees because it's taken so long to get up

here?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: No, Your Honor.

          QUESTION: No?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: No.  There's - there's - that

hasn't even come up.

          QUESTION: I assume it will.

          (Laughter.)

          QUESTION: May I ask you another question about

the warrant?  Everybody's been assuming that there's only

one particularity requirement in the Constitution.  There

are two.  There's the - particularly describing the place

to be searched and also the items to be seized, and I was

wondering if one couldn't read this warrant as just

satisfying the particularity requirement with regard to

what was to be searched, because as I understand it, it

was - the ranch was a very big ranch and they only wanted

to search this one house with a couple of - the garage

next to it, and they didn't search the entire ranch, did

they?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, they did go to search the

entire ranch.

          QUESTION: Oh, they did?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: And they did look in various

other buildings.  There was a statement in the affidavits

- in the complaint, which has not been denied that they -

 in some ways secured - they - there was admissions in -

in answers -

          QUESTION: I see.  I thought one might read the

warrant as describing this particular blue - blue house

and so forth as the particular part of the ranch that was

to be searched for the guns and so forth, but that's not

the case?  They searched everything?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, that's -

          QUESTION: I see.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's correct.  But if you

were to - if you were to read it that it was the - to

search the ranch for the blue house, then -

          QUESTION: This would be - no, I wouldn't - you

wouldn't obviously be searching for the blue house, but

you might read this as having confined the search to the

blue house as opposed to the entire ranch, which is

described - but you - but that - that wasn't done.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: No.

          QUESTION: So then it is really nonsensical on

its face.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's the position that we've

taken all along.

          QUESTION: Well, so far as damages are concerned,

I suppose your claim is analogous to a common law

trespass, that someone has come on the - come on your

property without any right to do so, and so you - you

could analogize that to whatever damages you could get for

a trespass.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That would be correct, Your

Honor.  We - we haven't thought about damages in - in your

- since the - the motion to dismiss was - was granted and

we've been arguing the - the points of law.  

          QUESTION: But I thought you did make some kind

of enumeration.  You mentioned Mr. Ramirez's drafting

table was broken and you said she was frightened, and I

think one other thing you alleged.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, that's correct.  There

were - there were damages -

          QUESTION: Oh, yes, the reputation to the - the

reputation in the neighborhood, but that would have been

affected just the same if the police came there with an

entirely proper warrant.

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's - that damage would have

been the - been the same.  The - the damage to them is the

fact that the search was done and there was no - since the

search was under a illegal warrant, we contend that the

search was illegal and any damages coming through from the

illegal search are compensable, but that's to be decided

down - down the road.  

          The - the Marks v. Clarke case that was referred

to earlier about - saying that there was no duty to read

the warrant by the officers is not entirely correct.  In

the - in the Marks case, in the - the Ninth Circuit said

that there was no duty for the officers executing the

warrant to read it, as long as they be - they fulfilled

their duty to become familiar with it before they went out

there.  However, the - the court did say that the officers

who applied for the warrant had a duty to make sure that

they had the valid warrant.

          If there are no further questions -

          QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Kozakiewicz.

          Mr. Cordray, you have 2 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. CORDRAY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

          MR. CORDRAY: Your Honor, on the qualified

immunity point, there is plain language in the

Constitution as to what the Fourth Amendment says, but

this Court said in Anderson v. Creighton, that is not the

correct approach.  It's not at the level of what the

Constitution says in the abstract.  It's how it's applied

in particular circumstances.  And here, the Ninth Circuit

did move the law in specific respects, and this Court is

being asked to move the law and to answer questions that

we either open, and in fact are controverted in the lower

courts as we speak.

          Sheppard had established that you can go beyond

the four corners of the page of the warrant to look at

supporting materials when there's any kind of suitable

words of reference.  The Ninth Circuit itself has

clarified since this case, in U.S. v. Vesikuru, 314 F.3d

1116, suitable words of reference can be that we're

relying on the sworn complaint to supply probable cause,

very similar, in fact indistinguishable, from the words of

reference in this warrant in this case.  You're being

asked to retreat from Sheppard and to clarify when a

warrant can or cannot incorporate accompanying affidavit

materials and that's a question you're being asked to

answer in this case and then apply against this officer

retrospectively to give damages and deny qualified

immunity.  That's inappropriate under this Court's settled

case law.

          Second, you're being asked in this case to say

specifically an officer has a constitutional duty to

proofread and re-check a warrant after it has been issued

by the magistrate, which this Court has never held, and

this Court has said in prior cases, including Illinois v.

Gates, that the officers' sole duty once they apply for an

order of authority is to execute the warrant faithfully in

accordance with the constraints imposed upon them.  

          McGrew moved the law in this case.  It was

decided 6 months after this search occurred.  This

decision below in this Ramirez case moved the law further,

and yet the Court is being asked to deny qualified

immunity to this officer here.

          As for the Leon dictum, Justice Kennedy, you

asked, we believe that if in fact Agent Groh had noticed

this error, if anyone had called it to his attention

during proceeding to execute the search, the more

reasonable course of conduct would be to stop and seek

clarification from the court, as the officers did in

Maryland v. Garrison.  Having not noticed the error,

having gone ahead and executed the warrant in good faith,

having executed the search in compliance with the request

made to the court, that is good faith and -

          QUESTION: Would they have had a duty to turn

around if they'd noticed the error 5 minutes before they'd

come to the property?

          MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That is a debatable question. 

I think that the better approach would have been to stop

at that moment and seek clarification from the court since

there were no exigent circumstances.  But here, the

officer had not noticed the error, the magistrate had not

noticed the error, no one on the team had noticed the

error.  The next day, a lawyer sitting in his office

reading the page in the cold light of day noticed the

53

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC  20005

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

error.  Immediately Agent Groh responded, faxed him the

face page of the application.  His conduct here was

clearly in good faith and - and to impose qualified

immunity here would be wrong and would be in total

violation of this Court's cases and clearly established

law.

          CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Cordray. 

The case is submitted.

          (Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
