CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 

next in Case 10-9995, Wood v. Milyard. 

Ms. Lord. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN A. LORD 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. LORD:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The Tenth Circuit, after finding that 

Mr. Wood's petition presented two substantial 
constitutional claims, denied him habeas relief solely 
on the ground that his petition was untimely.  It did 
this even though the State had done three things that 
should have precluded this result:  First, the State 
deliberately relinquished a known statute of limitations 
defense. 

Second, in doing so, the State acted 

strategically, not inadvertently. 

And, third, in doing so, the State induced 
the district court to expend substantial resources in 
deciding claims of exhaustion and -- and deciding claims 
on the merits. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, we asked for 
two questions presented.  The first was:  Do court of

appeals have the power sua sponte to raise issues?  And 
in your reply brief, you appear to say, yes, they do in 
some circumstances.  So, are you conceding that that 
power exists or that there is no power whatsoever? 

MS. LORD:  I'm proposing a clear line that 
would divide situations in which the court of appeals 
would have power and those in which it absolutely has no 
power. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that a question of 

power or a question of exercise of discretion? 

MS. LORD:  I would say it's a question of 

power, and this is why:  I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That seems sort of 

strange.  Both rely on a factual situation.  Either you 
can do something or you can't.  That's power.  If you 
can do it sometimes, that's still power, and then the 
question is, did you do it when you couldn't do it? 

MS. LORD:  Well, what I'm proposing is that 
there are situations when it is never a proper exercise 
of the appellate court's jurisdiction to consider sua 
sponte a statute of limitations defense even in the 
habeas context.  And now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And that's what we 

said in Day, isn't it? 

MS. LORD:  Correct, that in Day the Court

said that courts -- "courts" -- it wasn't directed at 
appellate courts, but no court would be free to 
disregard a deliberate waiver of a statute of 
limitations defense. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, all this fight is 
about is whether there was a deliberate waiver or not? 

MS. LORD:  Well, that's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  As opposed to power? 
MS. LORD:  That's our primary -- our primary 

argument is that there was a deliberate waiver in this 
case, and, given what this Court said in Day, the case 
could be resolved on that narrow ground. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, it is -- it is what 
the -- swords are crossed over here because you say this 
is a deliberate waiver, and the government says, no, 
it's -- it's a forfeiture, and forfeiture -- if it's 
forfeiture, then the court of appeals has discretion to 
take it up.  If it's a waiver, then Day makes clear --
so, it's a question of which box this case fits into: 
Is it forfeiture or is it waiver?  And your position is 
it's waiver. 

MS. LORD:  That's correct, and my position 

also is that there is an overlap between those boxes and 
that when the statute of limitations defense is 
forfeited in the sense of not being preserved in a

timely manner because of a deliberate choice, I mean --
and in this instance --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are there a lot of cases 
raising the -- you know, the ambiguity that exists in 
this case?  I mean, if you tell me that's all this case 
is about, I think we ought to dismiss this -- dismiss it 
as improvidently granted. 

MS. LORD:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  We don't sit here to decide 

whether when the government says, you know, we do not 
concede it but we're not arguing it, or whatever the 
language was -- we don't sit to decide factual questions 
like that, that come up in a particular case. 

I thought we took this case to decide the 

more significant issue, on which there is a division in 
the lower courts, as to whether there is, as you say, 
power of the court to disregard the fact that a statute 
of limitations defense has not been raised.  We all 
agree it wasn't raised.  Now, whether it was forfeited 
or not is another question.  If that's all you want us 
to decide, I don't want to decide that. 

MS. LORD:  Well, I clearly want a decision 

that would favor my client.  This --

(Laughter.) 
MS. LORD:  This Court granted cert on two 

Alderson Reporting Company

issues, and certainly this case presents the first 
issue, which is whether a court of appeals, once the 
State has had an opportunity to raise the statute of 
limitations defense and chooses not to, whether the 
court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Only the opportunity or 
when it acknowledges -- in Day, we faulted the district 
court for not telling the State, essentially, which we may --
not telling the State that it had a potential statute of 
limitations defense. 

Is it your position that if the State had 

just been silent about the statute of limitations 
defense and not raised it, that the court of appeals 
wouldn't have power?  Or is it your position that 
because they knew they had the defense and didn't raise 
it that the court of appeals didn't have power to sua 
sponte raise it. 

MS. LORD:  Well, both -- the district court 

ordered the State to announce --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're not answering my 

question. 

MS. LORD:  I'm sorry. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Does the court of 

appeals have the power to sua sponte raise it if the 
State -- neither the court or the State addressed the

issue? 

MS. LORD:  Probably yes.  Probably yes. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So, it 

doesn't have the power if the issue has been raised?  Is 
that your position? 

MS. LORD:  That's correct.  If the stage of 
the proceedings is after it was in Day, because in Day 
when the issue arose under the Rules of Civil Procedure 
and under traditional treatment of statute of 
limitations defense, there was still time for the State 
to announce we -- there was still time for the State to 
change or to raise the statute of limitations defense. 
Here --

JUSTICE ALITO:  It sounds to me that what 

you're -- what you're arguing is that the court of 
appeals abused its discretion in viewing this as a plain 
forfeiture, which you've just said would permit the 
court of appeals to raise the issue sua sponte, instead 
of a deliberate waiver.  Is that what it comes down to? 

MS. LORD:  Or a purposeful forfeiture.  I 

mean, there are forfeitures by --

JUSTICE ALITO:  They put it in the wrong --
they -- they abused their discretion by putting it in 
the wrong box.  They didn't put it in the forfeiture 
box; they put it in the deliberate waiver box.

MS. LORD:  Well, the way the court of 

appeals handled it will create problems if it's approved 
by this Court because --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, this is what -- this 
is what troubles me about your argument that the court 
of appeals abused its discretion.  Is it correct that 
you did not raise the issue of the court of appeals' 
lack of authority to raise this sua sponte until 
rehearing? 

MS. LORD:  What happened, Your Honor, is 

that we were appointed at the certificate of 
appealability stage, and we were ordered to brief 
timeliness.  Perhaps I took the order too literally.  I 
briefed timeliness, but I also set out exactly what 
happened, which is in the briefs and which sets forth 
the State's position. 

The court itself raised Day and raised its 

limited authority under Day to consider a statute of 
limitations defense.  They found, rather than a 
deliberate waiver, which I believe the record supports, 
that the State's comments were cryptic, and I will 
stress --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But you’re -- but you're arguing 

that the court of appeals abused its discretion by 
failing to rule in your favor on an argument that you

didn't make? 

MS. LORD:  No.  I -- the court was aware of 
Day, and the court analyzed what it was doing under Day, 
and it determined whether there was a deliberate waiver. 
Once the court found there was a deliberate waiver, I 
definitely challenged that finding.  I -- there's a very 
strong argument not included within the -- the -- the 
questions presented, that this is a totally timely 
petition.  And it's only a -- it's a very difficult 
argument, which is one of the reasons why it shows how 
much the State's actions in the district court were 
strategic. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you had two 

opportunities at least to make the argument based on the 
original postconviction motion, the 1995 postconviction 
motion.  You -- you did not raise that.  You were silent 
twice. 

MS. LORD:  Silent on the impact of the 19 --

we were not silent on the impact of the 1995 motion. 
We've always said, and in fact the State has never 
disputed, that that was a properly filed motion, and the 
only issue was whether it was tolled -- whether it 
tolled the statute of limitations period until 2004. 
And the State realized that that issue -- if they were 
to prevail on the timeliness issue, it was a very, very

difficult issue. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, then, I'm confused 
because I thought that there was -- it was conceded that 
the question was asked, did you file another 
postconviction motion?  Answer:  No. 

MS. LORD:  I understand your question now. 
When Mr. Wood was pro se, he filled out pro se motions, 
and in those pro se motions, he did say that there --
and I'm talking about the 2004 motion -- he said there 
was no prior postconviction motion. 

And I believe he was confused because if you 
look at the forms, both the Federal forms and the State 
forms that show what a -- a defendant should check, it 
makes it sound like a motion has to have been ruled on. 
And Mr. Wood was pro se and simply confused.  And no one 
else was confused once the State entered their 
appearance.  They knew that the 1995 motion was still 
pending.  All they had to do was sit at a computer and 
bring up the minute orders from the State, and they 
could learn that. 

So, the courts in making their rulings 
always from the time -- and, you know, one of the 
reasons why what happened was so strategic and so clear 
is that the district court had initially dismissed 
Mr. Wood's petition as untimely.  And --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Lord, could I ask you 

about the first question presented? 

MS. LORD:  Yes. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  As I understand the opposing 

argument, it goes sort of like this:  It says, in Day, 
we said it's fine to do this in the district court. 
Even if the party hasn't raised it, the court can raise 
it on this exact issue.  In Granberry, we said with 
respect to a different issue that the appellate court 
could raise it.  And, in Day, we said that those two 
issues were really the same. 

So, that seems sort of like a logical 

argument that just gets you to a place where you lose on 
the first question, unless perhaps there's a difference 
between a court raising a question sua sponte and a 
court allowing a party to raise it later than the party 
ought to have raised it.  Are you relying on that 
distinction, or are you questioning the logic of the 
basic argument that Granberry and Day decided this? 

MS. LORD:  Both.  And with respect to the 

first argument about there being a difference between a 
party presenting an issue and a court sua sponte raising 
the issue, there is a difference.  And the courts -- the 
circuit courts do not always make that distinction and 
do not always focus on that.  For example, in Granberry,

it actually was a case where the party presented -- the 
State presented on appeal the exhaustion issue, and the 
court agreed to hear it even though the State hadn't 
raised it below. 

Here, you know, at least five times in our 
joint appendix, you'll see the court saying that they 
can't act as an advocate for Petitioner.  And in, 
fact, when the Petitioner, Mr. Wood, tried to raise an 
-- the exhaustion issue again, the Tenth Circuit in its 
certificate of appealability said he is bound by his 
decision to dismiss these unexhausted claims, 
notwithstanding his pro se status.  And in the same 
breath, the court of appeals resurrected the at least 
concededly forfeited statute of limitations defense on 
behalf of the State. 

But I'd also like to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm a little confused. 

You seem to be arguing that because the court of appeals 
raised it before the party did, that that's worse than a 
party raising it first.  Is that your position?  That 
that -- that the court of appeals has more power after a 
party who has forfeited below or waived below now tries 
to come up on appeal and assert a defense that they 
didn't assert below?  Now the court of appeals has more 
power?

MS. LORD:  It raises different concerns.  My 

concern is not the relative power.  It's that when a 
court is raising something sua sponte, it defeats the 
party presentation principle.  That's one concern. 

When the court is -- when the party raises 
it after having forfeited, everyone concedes here that 
they wouldn't be allowed to.  So, in essence, what 
happens is the court is acting as a super-advocate 
for --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But those arguments were 

rejected in Granberry and Day. 

MS. LORD:  Well, that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why should they win now? 
MS. LORD:  Well, and that was -- I was going 
to -- I had a second part of my answer to Justice Kagan, 
which is there's something really different going on in 
Granberry and in Day, and you can't add the two and come 
up with a neat package such as what's suggested by the 
State. 

And, in Granberry, of course, as the Court 

all knows, the Court was dealing with exhaustion, and it 
was dealing with exhaustion, which goes to the heart of 
habeas and comity and all those concerns, at a time when 
dismissing a case to exhaust claims -- all that would do 
is delay Federal relief.  It wouldn't eliminate Federal

relief. 

And this Court in Rhines v. Weber recognizes 
that when AEDPA -- AEDPA was passed, it transformed the 
landscape, and it really made some changes.  And whether 
the -- the notion in Granberry that exhaustion can be 
raised for the first time on appeal transfers to the 
statute of limitations -- I think there's real doubt 
about that, and I think that goes to an important 
question and the question that the Court granted cert 
on. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But didn't Day say that 

those two issues were functionally identical for this 
purpose? 

MS. LORD:  Not for this purpose.  And by 

"this purpose" I mean the court of appeals' authority to 
raise sua sponte the defense.  In Day, this Court --
there were two prongs to Day.  In the context of Day, 
which was, you know, where the State had filed a Rule 5 
response and patently erroneously calculated the -- the 
limitations period, and the court noticed it, and 
there's no law that required, as this Court held, the 
court to muzzle itself and not mention you've 
miscalculated these days. 

We're in a totally different situation.  And 

the Rules of Civil Procedure allowed what happened in

Day.  They don't allow what happened in our case. 
And --

JUSTICE ALITO:  What Rule of Civil Procedure 
applies here?  You're talking about appellate procedure 
here.  Is there a rule of appellate procedure that 
governs this? 

MS. LORD:  I'm referring to Civil Rule of 

Procedure 8(b) and 12. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, they refer to what 

happens in the district court, and Day dealt with that. 
Now you're in the court of appeals.  What rule is there 
that addresses the situation in the court of appeals? 
MS. LORD:  Well, there's the traditional 

rule that if you don't raise it, you lose it, when we're 
talking about a statute of limitations defense.  And 
it's really key here because when AEDPA engrafted this 
1-year statute of limitations into the habeas 
proceedings, it knew how 1-year statute of limitations 
were treated.  And, yes, in Day, quite correctly the 
Court held that in that context you're going to treat 
those defenses the same, especially with respect to Rule 
4, which would allow a court to dismiss a petition just 
on its face. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  You made an argument in your 

brief that I found a little difficult to follow, but --

so, maybe you can explain it.  You seemed to suggest 
that the State's position on timeliness in the district 
court somehow induced your client to dismiss the claims 
that were arguably not exhausted.  And I found it 
difficult to understand why the -- why your client's 
strategy as to whether he wanted to dismiss those claims 
or not would be affected by the State's position on 
timeliness. 

MS. LORD:  Well, if the State had challenged 

timeliness at the stage that AEDPA contemplates it 
would, it would have created a real complicated issue on 
abandonment, and I think the briefs suggest just how 
complicated that is under Colorado law.  And if that had 
happened, the court very well could have, district 
court, could have appointed counsel for Mr. Wood, I 
mean, if there had been an evidentiary hearing, if, as 
the Tenth Circuit found, the issue was so complex that 
counsel was necessary. 

So, once you had counsel, in the State's 

reply or in its answer, they indicated that several of 
Mr. Wood's claims were not exhausted.  And some of those 
claims were in that 1995 motion that was pending.  With 
counsel, there could have been a request for a stay and 
abey.  There could have been so much that was done. 
Mr. -- but because the State chose to simplify the 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

18 

proceedings -- that's what they did, and it was not 
inadvertent; and it wasn't a mistake.  They chose to make it 
simple and to focus on exhaustion.  So, they got four 
claims dismissed on exhaustion grounds, and then they 
dealt with the other two claims on the merits. 

They also had a procedural default issue 

which was totally unconstitutional.  They were relying 
on a procedural default that didn't exist at the time 
you had to raise it. 

But that simplified the proceedings, made it 

more a question of law.  Mr. --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, what's wrong with 

that?  Why should we be penalizing the State for trying 
to simplify an action and make it move more 
expeditiously? 

MS. LORD:  Absolutely we should not.  But we 
also should hold them to that strategic choice, which is 
what Day says you do.  And we have to hold them to that 
choice because there were consequences, and there were 
changes of positions.  And they got the benefit of going 
forward and just looking at exhaustion.  They eliminated 
the risk of an evidentiary hearing.  They eliminated the 
risk of a lawyer.  They induced Mr. -- and I -- they 
induced Mr. Wood to dismiss four claims because -- oh, 
sorry.  Because -- I'm sorry.  I didn't see you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  Keep going

with your --

MS. LORD:  No -- because he was assured that 

he could go forward on two substantial constitutional 
claims without worrying about time bar, because the 
State said that.  They said twice we are not 
challenging, we will not challenge, timeliness. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  That's what I don't 

understand.  I -- why -- you have two situations.  One 
situation, the State's raising timeliness.  So, he says, 
okay, they're raising timeliness; I'm not going to 
dismiss my -- the claims that they say are not 
exhausted.  The other situation, they -- they don't say 
anything about timeliness.  And he said now I'm going to 
dismiss the claims that are -- that they say are 
unexhausted. 

I don't understand the connection. 
MS. LORD:  Well, the connection is the State 
guaranteed that they would not challenge timeliness, and 
that allowed Mr. Wood to go forward on two 
constitutional claims without ever having to worry that 
they would be subject to time bar. 

And when the court --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes, I understand why that's 

a benefit to him, but what is the connection between 
that and the dismissal of the unexhausted claims?

MS. LORD:  Oh.  Because if they had -- if 
they had challenged timeliness, they would have raised 
this very complicated issue, because the only way they 
can win on timeliness is to win on this newfangled 
notion of abandonment under Colorado law, which under 
Colorado law requires a hearing and requires factual 
development. 

And once they pursued in the district court 

that claim of abandonment, it was very likely that a 
lawyer would be appointed.  That lawyer could see that 
there were claims still pending in the 1995 motion and 
could possibly have sought a stay and abey, could have 
gone and tried to exhaust those claims, serious 
constitutional claims that were in the 1995 motion. 

And -- and maybe a better way of putting it 
is if they had raised timeliness in the district court, 
abandonment would have been front and center.  And even 
though the court of appeals ultimately resolved this 
issue without an evidentiary hearing, that was an abuse 
of discretion itself, too.  It was totally contrary to 
Colorado law, analyzing that issue. 

It is no small thing that the position that 
they took in the district court allowed Mr. Wood to go 
forward on two claims, two constitutional claims that 
are substantial that the court has granted a certificate

of appealability on. 

This is -- this case is so unlike Day in the 
sense -- if an appellate court can raise sua sponte the 
statute of limitations in a case like this, it can raise 
it in any case.  It invites the State to take a position 
in the district court which would be totally contrary to 
AEDPA's desire for streamlined proceedings.  It would --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Lord, an amicus brief 
filed on behalf of 15 States contends that the Civil --
the Rules of Civil Procedure are not what should be 
consulted here, because they govern only to the extent 
that they're not inconsistent with habeas rules, and 
asserts that the -- the habeas rules should rather apply 
and that they -- that they cut against your case. 

Do you have a response to that?  Was it --

was it in your reply brief or --

MS. LORD:  It may be.  I believe in some of 
the briefs what I've said is there is no inconsistency 
between Rule 5's requirement that the defense be set 
forth and the traditional recognition that statute of 
limitations is lost if not raised.  And I cited the 
Court to Jones v. Bock, which stresses that, for mere 
policy reasons, we shouldn't deviate from the rules that 
would otherwise apply.  And I think --

JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't the screening function

that the -- that a district court performs in the habeas 
case inconsistent with the traditional rule about 
raising affirmative defenses? 

MS. LORD:  Well, that's the district court, 

and that's one of the key differences between the 
district court and the appellate court.  The appellate 
court can issue a certificate of appealability.  The 
district court has that prescreening function, which is 
just like the prescreening function in the PLRA, where 
this Court looked at a circuit's attempt to create rules 
that would address policy concerns and deviated and put 
an enhanced pleading requirement on prisoners and said, 
I believe unanimously, that that shouldn't be done. 

There's a real virtue in having a 

predictable rule.  There's a real virtue in letting the 
States or -- letting the States know in the context of 
this Court's Federal timing rules that they have to 
raise it, the statute of limitations defense, when 
they're ordered to and when Rule 5 requires them to. 
You should not adopt the State's position 
when it will just invite the sort of sandbagging that 
this Court has taken care to avoid.  You don't want 
straddling by the State on something as important to 
judicial efficiency as asserting the statute of 
limitations in a timely manner.

I'll reserve the rest of my time. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
Mr. Domenico. 
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL D. DOMENICO 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. DOMENICO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

In contrast to the new and fairly 

complicated set of doctrines my friend asked the Court 
to adopt today, this Court can resolve this case by 
applying two straightforward longstanding rules. 

First, in Granberry v. Greer, the Court 

recognized that courts are not bound by a State's 
failure to properly argue and preserve a procedural bar 
to a habeas claim. 

And, second, to the extent there is an 

exception to that rule for deliberate waivers, the Court 
should apply the common rule that a waiver must be 
unequivocal. 

By applying --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Where --
MR. DOMENICO:  Please. 
JUSTICE BREYER:  Where?  What's the case 

that supports you the most on that? 

MR. DOMENICO:  On the -- on the second 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

question?  Well, that's a common rule.  From 
statutory rights such as in Olano --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, just give me a citation. 
MR. DOMENICO:  College Savings Bank is one, 

probably the clearest case. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  Has to -- has to be what? 

What's the word?  "Unequivocal"? 

MR. DOMENICO:  Unequivocal is a common --

for waiver of everything --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Because I'll look at the statute. 

Now, I did look at Black's Law Dictionary, and Black's 
Law Dictionary, looking up forfeiture and waiver, it 
seems like you lose. 

My analysis would be this:  Forfeiture is 

the "loss of a right" -- that's what's at issue --
"because of a crime."  That doesn't apply.  "Because of 
a breach of obligation."  That doesn't apply.  "Neglect 
of duty."  Now, that does because you didn't file the 
answer.  Okay?  So, that's forfeited. 

Now you look over to waiver and, as you say, 

it says "voluntary relinquishment of a legal right." 
Okay, what's the legal right?  The legal right is to get 
the case dismissed. 

So, I'm the judge.  I say, State, do you 

want to get the case dismissed?  I just gave your

answer.  Okay.  I say you voluntarily relinquish your 
legal right.  Your legal right was to get the case 
dismissed, and you relinquished it.  You didn't assert 
it. 

That said, that would be the difference. 

And she's saying that.  She's saying that makes a lot of 
sense.  When you read Day, they're worried about the 
State doing something inadvertently, making a mistake. 
So, what the judge says is:  State, you know you have a 
pretty good claim here on statute of limitations, 
but you didn't assert it.  So, I'm going to give you the 
right to assert it.  Go ahead, assert it even though 
it's late.  You overcome the forfeiture. 

Now you say:  I assert it, Your Honor. 
Okay, you haven't waived it.  Now you say:  I don't 
really care. 

MR. DOMENICO:  Justice Breyer, what the 

State was doing here was not strategically trying to --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, no.  I assume they 

didn't do anything mean -- strategic; it wasn't a trick. 
It was just what is it that they did?  And what they did 
is they were given the opportunity to overcome the 
forfeiture, to assert the statute of limitations claim, 
and they didn't do it.  They didn't want to do it.  I 
don't know why they didn't want to do it, because there

was a lot of trouble raising other issues, dah, dah, 
dah.  But that's their business.  The fact is they 
didn't do it. 

MR. DOMENICO:  Justice Breyer, the -- the 

Court has been clear that a State's failure -- normally, 
that's true.  The normal rule under the Rules of Civil 
Procedure is a forfeiture of that sort, failure to raise 
an argument, is deemed essentially to be a waiver under 
those definitions. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this wasn't failure 

to raise an argument; this was representing to the court 
we will not challenge timeliness.  That was the 
representation made to the court.  That was not 
negligent oversight in not raising the question.  It was 
an affirmative representation to the court that, 
although we might have done it, we will not challenge 
timeliness. 

MR. DOMENICO:  Justice Ginsburg, there --

there was an element of mistake, of negligence, as you 
say, but -- but it also was --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Didn't the State adhere to 

that? 

it? 

MR. DOMENICO:  That's right, Justice Scalia.

MR. DOMENICO:  What the State was trying to 
do, I think, is slightly different than would make sense 
in any other context.  Because of the special procedures 
we're under in a habeas -- a pre-answer response, what 
we were telling the court was we will not assert this 
argument unless there's further inquiry from the court. 
Now, normally in court there would be --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Wait, wait, wait.  When you 

say "further," I want to be very precise about the 
distinction.  You have to put it in your answer.  You 
didn't.  Okay.  So, that's a forfeiture.  So, now the 
judge says you didn't put it in your answer, but I'll 
raise it.  So, now you have the right to have the case 
dismissed for statute of limitations.  Do you want to 
exercise that right?  The answer to that question was 
you didn't. 

MR. DOMENICO:  That is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You said you didn't care. 
MR. DOMENICO:  That's -- I don't think 

that's quite an accurate characterization of what the 
State --

JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Well, but, one, 

do the characterization, but please don't forget my 
first question, because so far I'm just stuck on Black's 
Law Dictionary.  And I would like you to have better

authorities for your -- you know, the supporting --

MR. DOMENICO:  Well, the Black's Law 

Dictionary, of course, applies a usual rule.  This Court 
has made clear in Granberry and Day that the usual rule 
that a forfeiture of a legal right means that it's not 
to be brought up again, that it doesn't apply to bind 
the court's hands.  Granberry and Day make that quite 
clear.  What happened in Granberry would have been a 
forfeiture --

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Domenico, you're 

saying something considerably more.  You're saying that 
when a State gets up -- after inquiry by the district 
court, when a State gets up and says we do not want to 
press this argument; now we're not saying the 
argument is wrong, because after all we're a repeat 
player and we're going to hear that argument again, and 
we are not saying that argument is wrong, but in this 
case we do not want to press that argument.  That's --
that's unequivocal to me. 

MR. DOMENICO:  It's unequivocal that we were 

not going to press it again, though I think the 
implication -- there would have been no reason to have 
raised it initially.  There would have been no reason to 
include this caveat about refusing to concede, if that 
was all we were trying to say.  There are easy ways for

a State to take the issue off the table. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I -- can I ask you, 

do you mean to tell me that, using your own words in 
your brief, that a waiver is the intentional abandonment 
of a known right?  I think you're equating intentional 
abandonment of a known right to be I have to admit I 
could win and I'm giving up that argument. 

MR. DOMENICO:  Well, in this case --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that what you're 

saying -- deliberate? 

MR. DOMENICO:  Well, you have to know what 

it is you're giving up. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, you knew you had a 

defense under the statute of limitations. 

MR. DOMENICO:  Sure. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You thought, because you 

conceded, that you weren't conceding that it was 
untimely.  So, you were conceding you thought it was 
untimely, and despite admitting that you knew you had a 
defense, that you knew it could win, you were choosing 
not to assert it.  So, tell me why that's not either an 
intentional waiver, a deliberate waiver, or an 
abandonment of a known right? 

MR. DOMENICO:  The -- what we were 

abandoning, to the extent we were abandoning anything,

it was our ability to force the court to address the 
issue.  In any other context, I agree that maybe --
there may be a distinction with no difference, but in 
this case because there is discrete --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You were protecting the 

court's right to do whatever it wanted. 

MR. DOMENICO:  There was a screening --
there is a screening function.  We were raising the 
issue precisely to put it on the court's table for 
consideration.  In a habeas --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, why isn't it an 

abuse of discretion for an appellate court, when there 
has been an intentional abandonment of a known right, to 
sua sponte raise that defense? 

MR. DOMENICO:  Well, we did not take off the 

table the court's right to consider the issue. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say you didn't abandon 

the right.  Isn't that your position?  You did not 
abandon it?  You just --

MR. DOMENICO:  We did not abandon --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You just gave up the -- the 

opportunity to raise it yourself. 

MR. DOMENICO:  I think it's confusion 

between what we are calling a right or the issue or the 
defense.  We, that's right, gave up our right in the

district court, unless asked, to argue the issue. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me give you this 
example of -- of a regular civil case:  There -- there 
are two defendants and the same claim against two 
defendants.  One defendant files an answer and raises a 
statute of limitations defense; the other one doesn't. 
The judge asks the second defendant, are you going to 
amend your complaint?  And the defendant says no.  Now, 
is that a waiver or is that a forfeiture? 

MR. DOMENICO:  Well, I think in your typical 

case, it doesn't matter because forfeitures generally 
are deemed to be waivers, I think, in your typical case. 
That's not true under Granberry and Day.  The court has 
made clear that a forfeiture is different than a 
deliberate waiver. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, under the terminology 

that we're using, wouldn't that be a forfeiture? 

MR. DOMENICO:  I think it's better 

understood as a forfeiture.  Simply you're not going to 
argue the issue, but the issue doesn't necessarily need 
to be taken off the --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's why your 

colleague on the other side -- why she made this point 
the way she made it.  I think there's no disagreement, 
at least as far as I hear Justice Scalia.  Look, he did

abandon his right, the State, to push the matter. 
That's abandonment.  He didn't abandon the right to get 
the case dismissed if the judge pursues it. 

So, your colleague says -- or as she says, a 

court of appeals does have the power on its own to 
overcome a forfeiture.  That's Day.  But they don't have 
the power on its own to overcome the waiver.  And that's 
what they're doing.  They don't have the power, in other 
words, to decide it themselves.  They only have the 
power to overcome a forfeiture. 

MR. DOMENICO:  Well, if the Court looks at 

the -- where this deliberate waiver exception to the 
Granberry and Day rule comes from, it comes from Day, 
and the concern there is with a court overriding a 
State's decision to waive, to take the issue off the 
table.  There are examples of States doing that.  And 
when they do it, they are clear about it, and you can 
tell when it would be overridden. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the consequence of 
that was the district court then had to deal with the 
case on the merits, had to take up the two exhausted 
claims and rule on them, after having told the district 
court you don't need -- we're not raising the statute of 
limitations, we will not challenge timeliness.  So, you 
put the district court to the necessity of deciding the

case on the merits.  It does.  It takes up the two 
unexhausted claims and deals with them on the merits. 

In -- in Day, absolutely nothing transpired 

between the State saying the claim was timely and the 
magistrate's detection of the computation error.  The 
district court wasn't put to what was unnecessary work. 
If the -- it was the consequence of saying we won't 
challenge it that forced the district judge to deal with 
them on the merits. 

In Day, the counsel didn't bring up the 

question because counsel thought that it was timely.  He 
had miscalculated and made a mathematical error.  And 
the judge then said, you know, I see that the number of 
days that's required by statute, they have run.  And as 
Day pointed out, at that point, the trial judge could 
have said:  Now, you know, you miscalculated; wouldn't 
you like to amend your complaint and put it in a 
defense? 

So, the two cases, the two situations are --
are so different.  The district judge wasn't -- nobody 
was made to do anything extra.  But in -- here, because 
the attorney said we won't challenge it, the judge had 
to deal with the case on the merits. 

MR. DOMENICO:  That's right, Justice 

Ginsburg.  We failed in our -- in our duty and our

obligation to protect the district court from having to 
engage in what, had we properly argued this, would have 
been unnecessary effort. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Those are sunk costs, 

aren't they, Mr. Domenico? 

MR. DOMENICO:  They are, Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's water over the dam, 

and the issue is whether the court of appeals will then 
have to repeat the district court's excursus into the 
merits. 

MR. DOMENICO:  That's exact --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right? 
MR. DOMENICO:  That's exactly right.  The --

we have already spent that time.  The question now is 
if -- if Mr. Wood prevails now, the court of appeals 
will have to proceed to resolving the case on the 
merits.  Instead, in this case, they applied the very 
common principle that a court of appeals will affirm for 
any basis supported by the record in order precisely to 
avoid -- that happens fairly often.  They avoid having 
to address a constitutional problem.  They save having 
to engage in those efforts again. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's a matter of 

discretion with the court of appeals?

that this is in that middle ground where the court of 
appeals was certainly under no obligation to do this. 
Had the court of appeals refused to do it, we wouldn't 
be here demanding that they be forced to consider this 
issue. 

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the court of appeals 

could have gotten mad at the fact that the district 
court was compelled to go through the merits, right? 

MR. DOMENICO:  Absolutely. 
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And for that reason could 

have denied it.  But it didn't get mad, I guess.  I 
don't know why. 

MR. DOMENICO:  Well, it didn't get mad 

partly, I think, perhaps because Mr. Wood never argued 
that the issue was forfeited or waived at all until 
after -- after the court of appeals had already resolved 
the question. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, why do you say that 
the position that the State took in the district court 
prevented the district court from considering the 
timeliness issue?  If it wasn't a deliberate waiver, 
then the district court under Day wasn't prohibited from 
-- from deciding the case untimely. 

MR. DOMENICO:  Absolutely.  I do not think 
that the district court was prohibited from considering

it.  The only reason for us to have raised this sort of 
skeletal outline of the argument was precisely so the 
court of appeals would have the opportunity to consider 
it. 

Remember, this was raised initially in the 

pre-answer response stage where the -- which is 
specifically part of the district court's preliminary 
consideration of the issue.  So, it was certainly ex 
ante quite possible that the response of the district 
court would not be to simply ignore the issue as it did 
but to either ask for additional briefing, as happens 
with some regularity, to issue a show-cause order as it 
had already done, or perhaps to dismiss the case again 
as it had already done so. 

So, the issue was not off the table.  The 

district court very much could have addressed the 
question. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Domenico, do I 

understand your argument correctly to think that if you 
had not said, or if the lawyer for the State had not 
said we're not conceding, if all that the lawyer for the 
State had said is we're not challenging this, Your 
Honor, would that count as a deliberate waiver under 
Day? 

MR. DOMENICO:  I think that's a harder case.

The lead-up to that, I think, undermines the -- at 
least, the unequivocal nature of -- of that statement 
because there would have been no reason to have laid out 
the potential argument if what we were really trying to 
do was waive the -- waive the entire issue as Day uses 
that language.  If that's what we were trying to do, 
there would have been no reason to do that either. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The new --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But this is --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  The new case 

law is what I said.  When you say I won't raise this 
defense, I waive it, everything you said except saying I 
don't admit it, today, before a circuit court abuses its 
discretion, you also have to say I am waiving the right 
of the court of appeals to raise this sua sponte. 
That's -- that's -- you want that to be what you need to 
do for us to find a waiver. 

MR. DOMENICO:  I don't think you need to say 

that.  I don't think there necessarily need to be any 
magic words at all, but it needs to be unequivocal and 
clear, not ambiguous language that we're going to spend 
an hour here today trying to debate what it was that we 
meant.  That's the only rule we're asking for today. 

And the contrary rule really provides some 
perverse incentives to States.  I mean, here the State

was trying to be candid with the court.  It discovered 
this 1995 motion on its own.  Mr. Wood had never 
mentioned it in his filings.  He had already briefed the 
timeliness issue twice in the district court without 
mentioning it, let alone raising it in any of his 
petitions. 

The State found this and tried to be candid, 

that we weren't entirely clear about how the argument 
played out.  The alternative is that States will be 
forced into something more than scorched earth, throw 
everything at the court, see what sticks, and that's not 
in anybody's interest, let alone the Federal courts' or 
habeas petitioners'. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There is something about 
the principle of party presentation.  The party raises 
the issue.  The court of appeals is the court of review, 
not first view.  Here -- in Day, the -- the lawyer did 
not know that he had a statute of limitations defense, 
that -- did not know because he had miscalculated the 
time.  Here the State knew very well that it did have a 
statute of limitations argument, but it says we're not 
challenging it. 

And then the ordinary thing is that a court 

of appeals reviews decisions of the district court; 
doesn't decide questions in the first instance.  But

here you are saying the attorney can tell district judge 
don't decide this; go on to the merits.  Then the court 
of appeals, which is supposed to be reviewing what the 
district court does, instead deals with that question in 
the first instance.  That seems like an odd inversion of 
the role of the -- of the district court and court of 
appeals. 

MR. DOMENICO:  Justice Ginsburg, again, I 

don't think it's quite accurate to say that we told the 
district court not to address the issue.  We told the 
district court there was an issue that we were going to 
refrain from presenting our full argument on it. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You didn't say we're 
going to refrain from it.  You said, District Judge, 
Your Honor, we will not challenge timeliness. 

MR. DOMENICO:  Right. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Didn't have any 

qualifications. 

MR. DOMENICO:  Well, I -- I do think we 

qualified it.  The only reason to include the language 
about not conceding was to qualify that.  The only 
reason to lay out the argument was to make sure that the 
court was able to consider it in its screening 
procedures and --

language really going to a different point?  The 
concession language is going to the point of why it is 
that you're not raising it, that you're not challenging 
it. 

MR. DOMENICO:  I don't think it is. 
If I may, Mr. Chief Justice, finish. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Please. 
MR. DOMENICO:  I don't think that there is 

any reason for us to have been concerned about how -- if 
we had simply stated we are not challenging it, there 
would have been no concern about this affecting any 
other case whatsoever.  The only case in which to be 
concerned that what we said would be misconstrued as a 
waiver was this case.

We will hear from Ms. Sherry first.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

This Court's decisions in Granberry and Day 
answer the first question presented.  I think Petitioner

no longer contests that, and the Court can simply 
decide the first question presented on that basis and 
reaffirm what it said in Granberry. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Sherry, there is one 

difference.  If you put Granberry and Day together, it 
gets you most of the way there.  The one difference is 
that here there was a sua sponte decision by the court; 
whereas, in even the combination of Granberry and Day, 
it was a party that raised it, although the party raised 
it late. 

So, why should that difference not matter? 

If you think that party presentation has some 
consequence in this area, you might think that that 
difference does matter, that once you get to the court 
of appeals and even then the party doesn't raise it, 
sort of enough is enough. 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  A couple of responses to 

that.  Number one, I think it's significant that Day 
itself was a case in which the court raised it.  It 
raised it on its own. 

JUSTICE KAGAN:  But at the trial court 

level. 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  At the trial level. 
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Of course, the habeas court 

has a significant screening function.

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  No, that's certainly 

true.  I think the procedural default cases are another 
good example.  This Court in Day cited a number of them, 
a number of them of which were cases in which the court 
of appeals was raising the issue sua sponte. 

On page 12 of our brief, we cite a number of 
procedural default cases.  A lot of them come up in the 
sua sponte context.  And the courts of appeals have not 
made a distinction between the two. 

I think they certainly implicate different 

concerns.  For example, to the extent this Court has 
been worried about sandbagging or strategic behavior, I 
think that's largely absent in circumstances where the 
court is raising it on its own motions as opposed to the 
party belatedly raising the issue on appeal. 

So, I do think if you look at Granberry, you 

look at Day, you look at Caspari, you look at Schiro, 
and you look at the procedural default cases, I think 
that really does resolve the first question presented. 
And, again, I don't think Petitioner really argues 
otherwise at this point. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I may have forgotten 

the procedural complications of this case, but here, did 
the State have any opportunity before the court of 
appeals to raise the timeliness issue prior to the time

when the court of appeals issued its certificate of 
appealability?  And if the court of appeals had not 
issued a certificate of appealability on the issue of 
timeliness, would the issue have come up at all? 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  The State did have an 

opportunity in the court of appeals because, after the 
application for a certificate of appealability was 
filed, the court did order the State to file a response, 
and the State didn't argue timeliness in that response. 
But when the court of appeals did ask for briefing on 
this issue in the certificate of appealability process, 
the State, of course, did have an opportunity to respond 
there, and it did argue that the petition was untimely, 
and it strongly argued that. 

And so, I guess, turning to the second 

question presented, of deliberate waiver, I don't think 
there has been a deliberate waiver in the way that Day 
spoke about that term here for two primary reasons. 
Number one, when Day spoke of deliberate waiver, it 
spoke of overriding a State's deliberate waiver, and I 
think if you look, when the court of appeals decided the 
timeliness question, there's no way to look at that as 
the State -- as a court, rather, actually overriding the 
State's deliberate waiver.  At that point, the State had 
argued that the petition was untimely.

Petitioner never argued that the court 

shouldn't decide the issue, never argued that that --
that the State had waived that issue below.  And I think 
at that time, it's really difficult to characterize that 
as overriding the State's deliberate waiver. 

The other point I would make is in the 

district court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the difference is 

that in Day counsel didn't know that he had a statute of 
limitations defense.  So -- but the court suggested it. 
In this case, the defendant -- I mean, the -- the 
attorney knew, the State's attorney knew, they had a 
statute of limitations defense and nonetheless told the 
court we won't challenge timeliness. 

It seems a big difference between the 

factual background of Day, where the lawyer didn't know 
there was a statute of limitations defense, and this 
one, where the lawyer knew very well there was and 
decided to tell the district court not to -- not to deal 
with that issue. 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  I -- I think that 
certainly is true, but I think it's important, in 
deciding whether or not this should be treated as a 
deliberate waiver, to look at what the consequences of 
treating it as such would be.  The consequences of

treating it as a deliberate waiver under the language of 
Day is that the court's hands would be bound; the court 
would be unable to decide the timeliness question.  And 
it's not just the court of appeals; it's the district 
court as well.  So, if this were a clear deliberate 
waiver in district court when the State filed its 
pre-answer response, the district court would have been 
without any authority to consider --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So, why is that -- why is 
that a bad result?  The -- I -- imagine the facts are 
these:  The State forgets to waive the issue, to raise 
the issue in the defense.  All right?  Forgets. 

Judge:  State you haven't raised a statute 

of limitations. 

State -- one possible answer -- thank you, 
Your Honor.  We overlooked our forfeiture.  We want to 
raise it. 

That's one. 
Number two:  They say we don't care. 
Number three:  We don't want to.  Okay? 
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, in two and three, you 
can say this:  You could say the reason that we depart 
from the normal rule that you have to actually assert it 
in your defense is we're trying to protect the State

because of habeas.  So, we protect the State at least by 
giving them a chance to make the argument when they 
forget or some other reason.  Now we gave them the 
chance.  Now they say:  Huh?  Who cares? 

All right?  If that's their attitude, why is 
it the habeas court's business to protect the State from 
themselves? 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Because it's not just 

about the State.  Because it's -- because of the 
institutional interests that are at stake.  And that's 
why Granberry and Schiro and Caspari and Day allowed 
there to be consideration of these issues despite 
forfeiture.  It's because of the institutional 
interest --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Despite forfeiture? 
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Despite forfeiture. 

Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER:  And --
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  And -- and that's the 
very question here, whether it should be treated like 
forfeiture or whether it would be treated like waiver. 
And the reason why I think it would be a bad result to 
treat it as waiver here and why it would be bad to have 
bound the district court's hands in this case, if you 
look at what happened here, the district court on its

own motion initially dismissed this as untimely.  It 
came back and it went to the State and said, you know, I 
need more information.  And the State provided that 
additional information. 

It would be a somewhat odd system for --
when the district court now had this information in 
front of it, now knew about the 1995 motion, for it not 
to have been able to do anything further with respect to 
timeliness on -- on that point.  The fact that the State 
for whatever reason decided to press other issues 
shouldn't bind the district court's hands except in the 
rarest of circumstances. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Except we have a system 

where the court doesn't raise issue on its own.  The 
ordinary rule is the party presents it, and when the 
party says to the court we will not challenge 
timeliness, it seems to me that's quite a different 
thing from just having an answer that doesn't raise the 
defense.  It's affirmatively representing to the court 
that we -- we are not making this an issue. 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  And -- and to be clear, I 
think that's certainly a factor that the courts can and 
do consider in deciding whether to exercise their 
discretion to consider a timeliness issue.  The question 
here is whether or not the court should lose any

discretion to consider that issue. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But Day did say that 

if -- if a party knowingly waives a limitations defense, 
then no court can bring it up.  The party has made the 
choice. 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  That's -- that's what 
this Court said in Day, and I guess the question is --
is how strictly that should be construed.  And our 
position would be that it should be strictly construed 
because of the consequences of that waiver.  And, again, 
I think it's significant that the Court in Day did talk 
about overriding a State's deliberate waiver. 

In the dissent, Justice Scalia, you 

mentioned the example of a court amending a party's 
pleading over that party's objections.  And I think that 
really is a narrow circumstance in which the waiver rule 
should operate. 

It's not that the State's behavior is 
irrelevant to the question before the court as to 
whether the court should exercise its discretion; it's 
actually quite relevant, and it's something that courts 
of appeals can and do look at.  The question is whether 
or not the courts lack any authority to consider a 
limitations defense or other procedural defense --

that if the court of -- court says, you know, you have a 
good state -- limitations defense, you would clearly win 
on that, but I'm going to ignore it, even though you 
didn't raise it? 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  I'm sorry, Your Honor. 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would it be an abuse 

of discretion for the court not to accept a valid, 
evident statute of limitations defense on the ground 
that the State didn't raise it? 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  I think under Day -- the 

question is whether it's a deliberate waiver, and I 
think, under Day, the Court said quite plainly that it 
would be an abuse of discretion in those circumstances. 
And I think there are a limited number of circumstances 
where -- where that makes sense, and I think the Court 
has seen examples of that recently this term, for 
example. 

The Court denied cert in a case, Buck v. 

Thaler, earlier this term, where -- a predecessor case 
that is an example of the State expressly waiving a 
procedural default defense because it wanted the court 
to reach the merits.  In that case, the State said quite 
plainly -- in the predecessor case, I should say, the 
State said quite plainly because the use of race in the 
punishment phase seriously undermined the fairness and

integrity of the judicial process, the director 
expressly waives any procedural bar with respect to that 
claim. 

Now, that is the quintessential deliberate 
waiver.  And it took it off table, unlike what happened 
in this case. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
Ms. Lord, you have 3 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN A. LORD 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. LORD:  The problems with the rulings 
urged by the amicus and by the State are severalfold. 
One, it's not contemplated at all by AEDPA that the 
1-year Federal timing statute of limitations would be 
subject to such a wide latitude in the court of appeals 
to resurrect defenses. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  If a State knows that it has 

a potential statute of limitations defense and says 
nothing, is that a forfeiture or a waiver? 

MS. LORD:  It would be a violation of 

Rule 5, which requires them to assert a time bar if they 
are required to file a response.  In our case, it also 
would have been a violation of the court's order. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  So, simply saying nothing 

can be a waiver, in your view.

MS. LORD:  Probably not.  But if you are --
JUSTICE ALITO:  If the answer to that is 

not, then what is the difference between saying nothing, 
knowing that you have a defense, and saying we're not 
challenging but we're not conceding? 
What is the difference? 
MS. LORD:  Well, by not conceding, that 

doesn't undercut the deliberateness of the waiver.  It 
actually establishes it.  It establishes that they know 
that there's a defense, and they're not agreeing that 
the petition is timely, but they're deliberately 
choosing not to assert the statute of limitations. 

JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me just ask it one 

more way, and then I'll --

MS. LORD:  I'm sorry. 
JUSTICE ALITO:  Back in the office, they're 

considering -- in the State's office, they're 
considering what they're going to do.  And they say, 
well, what we're going to do is we're not going to 
challenge it, but we're not going to concede it.  And, 
therefore, they say nothing. 

MS. LORD:  In the face of Rule 5's 

requirement, it could very well be a waiver.  And I'd 
cite the court to Hill v. New York, which also addresses 
one of the State's lawyers' points, which was a

waiver -- for the State to waive a statute of 
limitations defense, its waiver has to be unequivocal 
and clear.  I don't know if they're suggesting that 
there also has to be an advisement by the court.  I 
don't think they're going that far. 

But the fact is, you look at the nature of 
the waiver or the right being waived.  And this Court 
recognized in Hill v. New York and other cases that if 
the right being waived is, for example, the right to be 
tried in a timely fashion under IAD, it can be waived 
just by a lawyer accepting a date. 

And the statute of limitations issue here is 

a typical strategic decision.  And when AEDPA brought 
this in, it didn't bring it in as it brought in comity. 
It is something to move the case along from the Federal 
point of view.  And for this Court to adopt what --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Finish your 

sentence, please. 

MS. LORD:  -- the State is suggesting will 
just take away all the efficiencies that -- that that 1 
year brought to bear. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
The case is submitted. 
(Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
