 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear 


argument now on 03-334, Shafiq Rasul vs. George W. 


Bush and a companion case.  Mr. Gibbons. 


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. GIBBONS 


 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS 


 MR. GIBBONS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 


9 

it please the Court: 


10

 What is at stake in this case is the 


11 

authority of the Federal courts to uphold the rule of 


12 

law.  Respondents assert that their actions are 


13 

absolutely immune from judicial examination whenever 


14 

they elect to detain foreign nationals outside our 


15 

borders.  Under this theory, neither the length of 


16 

the detention, the conditions of their confinement, 


17 

nor the fact that they have been wrongfully detained 


18 

makes the slightest difference. 


19

 Respondents would create a lawless enclave 


20 

insulating the executive branch from any judicial 


21 

scrutiny now or in the future. 


22

 QUESTION:  Mr. Gibbons, I understand that 


23 

your clients have been detained approximately two 


24 

years? 


25

 MR. GIBBONS:  That's correct, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  Supposing they had only been 


detained six months, how much would that weaken your 


case? 


 MR. GIBBONS:  It wouldn't weaken it at all 


because as I'll get into in the argument, the case 


depends on compliance with provisions of a binding 


treaty, which requires a prompt determination of 


their status. 


 QUESTION:  So they would have had a habeas 


10 

corpus entitlement, in your view, within weeks after 


11 

their, after their detention? 


12

 MR. GIBBONS:  They would have had 


13 

entitlement to the process specified in the Geneva 


14 

Convention, and if they had that process --


15

 QUESTION:  Did they have that right when 


16 

they were in Afghanistan? 


17

 MR. GIBBONS:  They allege not, and on this 


18 

record, you have to assume that, as did the Court of 


19 

Appeals. 


20

 QUESTION:  But now in Johnson vs. 


21 

Eisentrager, we said that the Geneva Convention did 


22 

not confer a private right of action. 


23

 MR. GIBBONS:  Your Honor, the question of 


24 

the private right of action really is not presented 


25 

in this case.  We are not asking to imply a private 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

11

right of action from the Geneva Convention or any 


other treaty.  What we are saying is that the cause 


of action is created by the Habeas Corpus Statute and 


by the Administrative Procedure Act.  The treaty 


provides a rule of decision, not a cause of action. 


 QUESTION:  Well, I guess, at least the 


question presented is just whether the Federal court 


has jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute, Section 


2241, is that right? 


 MR. GIBBONS:  That's correct. 


 QUESTION:  And you don't raise the issue 


12 

of any potential jurisdiction on the basis of the 


13 

Constitution alone.  We are here debating the 


14 

jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute, is that right? 


15

 MR. GIBBONS:  That's correct, Justice 


16 

O'Connor.  As a matter of fact --


17

18

 QUESTION:  1331.  I thought --


 MR. GIBBONS:  It doesn't depend on Section 


19 

1331, although the Administrative Procedure Act claim 


20 

does depend on Section 1331. 


21

 QUESTION:  That's what I'm asking.  Is 


22 

that here or not?  You mentioned the APA claim. 


23

24

 MR. GIBBONS:  Yes. 


 QUESTION:  I thought you were still 


25 

asserting that, are you not? 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

5 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1

2

 MR. GIBBONS:  Yes.  I'm asserting that. 

 QUESTION:  So it isn't just habeas then, 

3 

it's also --

4

5

6

 MR. GIBBONS:  That does --

 QUESTION:  It's also 13 --

 MR. GIBBONS:  Your Honor, Justice Scalia, 

7 

it does depend on Section 1331. 

8

 QUESTION:  So we have two things, the 

9 

Habeas Statute and 1331? 

10

11

12

13

 MR. GIBBONS:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  But you still win. 

 MR. GIBBONS:  Now --

 QUESTION:  If you win under the Habeas 

14 

Statute? 

15

16

17

 MR. GIBBONS:  Oh, absolutely. 

 QUESTION:  Yes.  You don't need both. 

 MR. GIBBONS:  No.  We don't.  Now, if you 

18 

look at the Court of Appeals ruling in this case, the 

19 

Court of Appeals assumed that these people were 

20 

friendly aliens, assumed that they had never been 

21 

members of any armed forces, and had never carried 

22 

out any belligerent activity against the United 

23 

States.  Assumed that they had never had the hearing 

24 

required by the Geneva Convention to determine 

25 

whether or not in fact they were civilians who should 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

have been repatriated.

 What the Court of Appeals held was, and 


it's on page 1141 of the court's opinion, if the 


Constitution does not entitle detainees to due 


process, and it does not, they cannot invoke the 


jurisdiction of our courts to test the 


constitutionality or legality of restraints on their 


liberty. 


 Thus the Court of Appeals assumed that 


10 

the -- that the result turned on the absence of a 


11 

constitutional right, and that simply misreads the 


12 

Habeas Corpus Statute.  Section 2241(c)(1), which is 


13 

carried forward in virtually identical language from 


14 

Section 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, antedated 


15 

the Bill of Rights.  All it required, all it has ever 


16 

required is Federal custody simpliciter, and that 


17 

gives habeas corpus jurisdiction. 


18

 QUESTION:  Well, but other than producing 


19 

the person before the court so that the system is 


20 

satisfied that we know where the person is, surely 


21 

you have to go beyond that and assert some sort of 


22 

right.  And you -- you say that --


23

24

 MR. GIBBONS:  Of course. 


 QUESTION:  -- the Geneva Convention is 


25 

really not the basis for the cause of action, which I 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

agree, so where do we go after that?  So he is here 


in front of the court.  Now what? 


 MR. GIBBONS:  Your Honor, the Geneva 


Convention is the supreme law of the land.  That's 


what the Constitution says about habeas. 


 QUESTION:  But it may not be 


self-executing.  That's the problem, I guess.  The 


indications are it's not. 


 MR. GIBBONS:  Your Honor, Your Honor --


10

 QUESTION:  Forgetting the Geneva 


11 

Convention, what happens when the person comes before 


12 

the court?  You prevail and there is a writ of habeas 


13 

corpus, it comes here, and the judge says, now what 


14 

am I supposed to do. 


15

 MR. GIBBONS:  What the judge is supposed 


16 

to do is determine first whether or not the 


17 

government's response that the detention is legal is 


18 

in fact an adequate response.  Now, the government in 


19 

this case probably will respond, we don't have to 


20 

give the hearings required by the Geneva Convention. 


21 

But if you're going to treat a binding United States 


22 

treaty as the supreme law of the land, that is not an 


23 

adequate answer. 


24

 Now, this question of, is the treaty 


25 

self-executing or not self-executing, I suggest is a 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

straw man.  Since 1813, if a treaty provides a rule 


of decision and something else provides a cause of 


action, the treaty nevertheless provides the rule of 


decision.  That was several --


 QUESTION:  But Johnson said quite 


specifically that the Geneva Convention was not 


available to the Petitioners in that case because it 


did not confer any right of action. 


 MR. GIBBONS:  Well, Your Honor, I think 


10 

the latter part of your sentence is probably an 


11 

overreading of Johnson.  In Johnson, which I suggest 


12 

is clearly distinguishable from this case, there were 


13 

three critical facts.  One was that they were 


14 

admitted enemy aliens.  Our Petitioners plead that 


15 

they are not. 


16

 The other was that they had a hearing 


17 

before a military tribunal which comported with 


18 

Federal legislation and with the extant rules of 


19 

international law, and our Petitioners have had no 


20 

such hearing. 


21

22

23

 QUESTION:  Well --


 QUESTION:  But I take it you are --


 QUESTION:  -- if you, if you, if your 


24 

clients here had been given the review that has been 


25 

described to us in the government's brief, by 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

9 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

military authorities to determine whether these 


people are indeed being held as enemy combatants, 


would you be here if you knew that that review had 


been provided? 


 MR. GIBBONS:  We would not be.  What we 


6 

are seeking is the review provided --


7

8

 QUESTION:  Well, I don't see how that --


 QUESTION:  Wouldn't that depend on what 


9 

the review showed?  And I thought you have alleged that


10 

your 


11 

clients were not enemy aliens.  If it showed they 


12 

were tourists, they were just picked up by mistake, 


13 

would you be here or would you not be here? 


14

 MR. GIBBONS:  If they were detained after 


15 

a hearing determined that they were civilian 


16 

detainees who under Article IV of the Geneva 


17 

Convention should be repatriated, we would be here. 


18

 QUESTION:  I don't see how those merits 


19 

question go to the issue of jurisdiction of the 


20 

Court.  It may well be that if those factors you 


21 

mentioned were changed, you'd be entitled to judgment 


22 

here, even though the plaintiffs in Eisentrager were 


23 

not entitled to judgment, but we are not talking 


24 

about the merits right now.  We are talking about 


25 

jurisdiction.  Certainly jurisdiction doesn't turn on 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

10 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

the merits whether you were an enemy alien or not.

5

7 

8 

9 

 MR. GIBBONS:  Well, I suggest that a fair 


reading of Eisentrager is that that did turn on the 


merits. 


 QUESTION:  No, but I thought your -- may 


I, may I ask you this, because I'm having the trouble 


Justice Scalia is having.  I thought your principal 


argument on the basis of Eisentrager was that it 


cannot stand for the proposition that there is no 


10 

jurisdiction because in fact, in Eisentrager, there 


11 

was enough mention of matters on the merits so that 


12 

it was clear that's what was driving the ultimate 


13 

resolution in Eisentrager. 


14

 And it cannot stand for the proposition 


15 

that a court cannot even inquire, and the only issue 


16 

we have got is whether under the Habeas Statute the 


17 

court can even inquire.  Do I misunderstand your 


18 

position? 


19

 MR. GIBBONS:  No, you do not, Justice 


20 

Souter. 


21

22

 QUESTION:  Okay. 


 MR. GIBBONS:  It's our position that 


23 

Eisentrager was a decision on the merits as a matter 


24 

of fact.  The Court says that they -- Petitioners 


25 

were extended the same preliminary hearing as the 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

sufficiency application that was extended in Quirin, 


Yamashita and Hirota versus McArthur, all of which 


were decisions on the merits. 


 QUESTION:  But in several different 


places, Mr. Gibbons, in Eisentrager, the Court says 


that we are talking about the Habeas Statute, and we 


are saying these Petitioners are not entitled to 


habeas. 


 MR. GIBBONS:  Well, they are not as a 


10 

matter -- let me be clear about that.  The result on 


11 

the merits in Eisentrager is perfectly correct.  What 


12 

the Court did in Eisentrager was apply the scope of 


13 

review on habeas corpus, which was standard at that 


14 

time.  If the military tribunal had lawful 


15 

jurisdiction, that ended the habeas inquiry. 


16

 QUESTION:  Well, there is another problem. 


17 

At that time, that case was decided when Ahrens 


18 

against Clark was the statement of the law, so there 


19 

is no statutory basis for jurisdiction there, and the 


20 

issue is whether the Constitution by itself provided 


21 

jurisdiction.  And of course, all that's changed now. 


22

 MR. GIBBONS:  Well, Your Honor, in 


23 

Eisentrager, both the Court of Appeals and the 


24 

Supreme Court made it clear that they disapproved, 


25 

they were not adopting the ruling of the District 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

12 

Alderson Reporting Company

1

9 

Court based on Ahrens v. Clark.  Of course, in any 


event, that does not go to subject matter 


jurisdiction.  That's a Rule 12(b)(2) issue of in 


personam jurisdiction, whether a proper Respondent is 


before the Court.  In Eisentrager, the Court assumed 


--


 QUESTION:  Well, you didn't raise the question 


of whether the territorial jurisdiction provision 


10 

covered it.  There was no territorial jurisdiction if 


11 

they were outside the district under the ruling in 


12 

Ahrens against Clark, which means they had to rely on 


13 

the Constitution to support jurisdiction, which in 


14 

turn means that once they have overruled Ahrens 


15 

against Clark, which they did, there is now a 


16 

statutory basis for jurisdiction that did not then 


17 

exist. 


18

 MR. GIBBONS:  Your Honor, respectfully, I 


19 

don't think you can fairly read Justice Jackson's 


20 

opinion as adopting the Ahrens v. Clark position. 


21

 QUESTION:  No.  But Ahrens v. Clark was 


22 

the law at the time of that decision, and it was 


23 

subsequently overruled.  So that -- that case was 


24 

decided when the legal climate was different than it 


25 

has been since Ahrens against Clark was overruled.

 MR. GIBBONS:  Well -- in any event --


 QUESTION:  Let me help you. 


 MR. GIBBONS:  In any event, there is no 


question that the Ahrens v. Clark rule does not apply 


today.  These Respondents are the proper Respondents. 


 QUESTION:  Of course, it's a question of 


how much it doesn't apply, whether it doesn't apply 


only when there is at least clear statutory 


jurisdiction in one, in one Federal court so it's 


10 

almost a venue call.  It isn't clear that it's been 


11 

overruled when there is no statutory jurisdiction in 


12 

any Federal court. That's certainly an open question. 


13

 MR. GIBBONS:  Well, Your Honor, as to the 


14 

absence of jurisdiction, 2241(c)(1) could not be 


15 

plainer.  It's been plain for 215 years.  If there is 


16 

Federal detention and there is a proper Respondent 


17 

before the Court as there is, there is habeas corpus 


18 

jurisdiction.  I don't see any, even ambiguity in 


19 

that statute. 


20

 QUESTION:  What do you do if you have a 


21 

lawful combatant in a declared war, and the 


22 

combatant, an enemy of the United States is captured 


23 

and detained, habeas? 


24

 MR. GIBBONS:  Habeas, you mean on the 


25 

battlefield?  Absolutely not.

 QUESTION:  We'll take it from the 

2  battlefield, and a week later, 10 miles away, then 

3  six months later, a thousand miles away. 

4

 MR. GIBBONS:  In the zone of active 

5  military operations or in an occupied area under 

6  martial law, habeas corpus jurisdiction has never 

7  extended.  It is the common law. 

8

9 

10

11

 QUESTION:  Suppose it's Guantanamo. 

 MR. GIBBONS:  Well, the --

 QUESTION:  A declared war and a lawful 

12  combatant. 

13

 MR. GIBBONS:  A declared war and someone 

14  who has been determined to be a combatant in 

15  accordance with Article V of the Geneva Convention, 

16  an application for a writ of habeas corpus in those 

17  circumstances would, under Rule 12(b)(6), be 

18  summarily dismissed. 

19

20

 QUESTION:  You are close to the merits. 

 QUESTION:  You are back to the Geneva 

21  Convention again, so I just have to assume your case 

22  depends on the Geneva Convention. 

23

24

25

 MR. GIBBONS:  Well, it --

 QUESTION:  It's not self-executing. 

 MR. GIBBONS:  It depends on the Geneva 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

Convention and on the military regulations duly 

adopted and binding on the military forces of the 

United States. 

 QUESTION:  But isn't that the merits case 

that you are talking about?  I mean, your 

jurisdictional argument doesn't depend, as I 

understand it, on military regulations or the Geneva 

Convention.  It depends on this statute. 

 MR. GIBBONS:  No.  It does not. 

10

 QUESTION:  If you get into court, your 

11 

clients may raise Geneva Convention and all sorts of 

12 

things, but that's not what your case here depends 

13 

on. 

14

 MR. GIBBONS:  No.  Our position is that 

15 

the Habeas Corpus Statute has meant what it said 

16 

since 1789. 

17

 QUESTION:  I mean, you have to think down 

18 

the road, is there an alternative to the Geneva 

19 

Convention that is on the substantive claim.  I was 

20 

also thinking, and here I want your view on it, that 

21 

if you have, if they get in the door, and now they 

22 

have a claim that they are being held without a 

23 

competent tribunal assessing it, you get to your 

24 

route as well by saying that the part about the Fifth 

25 

Amendment in Eisentrager is, in effect, overruled by

Reid v. Covert.  And in fact, if you follow Harlan 

and by following Harlan, you apply some kind of due 

process, and the Geneva Convention comes in to inform 

the content of that due process. 

 Now, is there an argument there or not? 

 MR. GIBBONS:  There certainly is, Your 

7 

Honor, but since --

8

 QUESTION:  You're not simply being polite? 

9 

I want to --                                            

10

11

12

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. GIBBONS:  I have more to say about it. 

 QUESTION:  But you do have the impediment, 

13 

Mr. Gibbons, that the D.C. Circuit said it decided 

14 

the merits as well as jurisdiction, so I think 

15 

Justice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy were asking you 

16 

before, well, if you prevail on jurisdiction under 

17 

that opinion, don't you go out the door immediately 

18 

because the D.C. Circuit said, at least as far as the 

19 

Constitution is concerned, nonresident aliens have no 

20 

due process rights. 

21

 MR. GIBBONS:  As far as the Constitution 

22 

is concerned, that's what the District of Columbia 

23

 MR. GIBBONS:  First of all --


 QUESTION:  Whether -- as I take it we ask 


3 

you to address only the bare jurisdictional question. 


4

5 

6 

7 

8

 MR. GIBBONS:  The bare jurisdictional 


question depends on Federal custody simpliciter, and 


then the Court goes on to decide, is there any legal 


basis for the government's response to the writ. 


 QUESTION:  Can I ask this, Mr. Gibbons. 


9 

If the jurisdictional question rests on Habeas 


10 

Statute simpliciter, without reference to the Geneva 


11 

Convention or any of the other merits points that 


12 

you've been raising, how then do you answer Justice 


13 

Kennedy's question if the merits are out and it 


14 

doesn't matter whether you are a combatant or 


15 

noncombatant, is there jurisdiction when somebody is 


16 

captured on the field of battle and held immediately 


17 

on the field of battle, why wouldn't there be 


18 

jurisdiction there?  The only answers you give are 


19 

merits answers, not jurisdictional answers. 


20

 MR. GIBBONS:  Your Honor, what I'm 


21 

suggesting is that whether you call it jurisdiction 


22 

or whether you call it the merits, in the battlefield 


23 

situation, it's going to go out under Rule 12, in any 


24 

event. 


25

 QUESTION:  But that's, that's quite 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

different.  I mean, all we are theoretically talking 


about here is jurisdiction.  And the idea that, you 


know, you have Justice Kennedy's example, a lawful 


combatant, a declared war, detained at Guantanamo 


maybe two months after he is captured, and an 


action's brought here in the District of Columbia for 


habeas corpus and what does a -- what does a judge 


say when he considers that sort of petition? 


 MR. GIBBONS:  When he sees that petition, 


10 

he should dismiss it summarily, whether he dismisses 


11 

it under 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6), it won't take him any 


12 

more time.  Habeas corpus, as the historians' brief, 


13 

and others among the amici point out, has never run 


14 

to the battlefield, as a matter of habeas corpus 


15 

common law.  And it is, after all, a common law writ. 


16 

It has never run to any place except where the 


17 

sovereign issuing the writ has some undisputed 


18 

control. 


19

 QUESTION:  Well, suppose at Guantanamo, 


20 

you still have to summarily dismiss under the 


21 

hypothetical, right? 


22

 MR. GIBBONS:  Yes, Justice Kennedy --


23 

Kennedy, and the Court of Appeals did rely on some 


24 

mystical ultimate sovereignty of Cuba over, as we 


25 

Navy types call it, Gitmo, treating the Navy base 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

there as a no law zone.  Now, Guantanamo Navy base, 

as I can attest from a year of personal experience, 

is under complete United States control and has been 

for a century. 

 QUESTION:  We don't need your personal 

experience.  That's what it says in the treaty.  It 

says complete jurisdiction. 

 MR. GIBBONS:  That's exactly what it says. 

 QUESTION:  Complete jurisdictional control. 

 MR. GIBBONS:  That's exactly what it says 

12 

-- yes. 

13

 QUESTION:  Now, it also says Cuba retains 

14 

sovereignty. 

15

 MR. GIBBONS:  It does not say that.  It 

16 

says that if the United States decides to surrender 

17 

the perpetual lease, Cuba has ultimate sovereignty, 

18 

whatever that means.  Now, for lawyers and judges 

19 

dealing with the word sovereignty, it doesn't 

20 

self-define. 

21

 QUESTION:  Excuse me.  Does it say that, 

22 

Cuba has ultimate sovereignty only if the United 

23 

States decides to surrender? 

24

25

 MR. GIBBONS:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  Where would that text be?  I 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

20 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

did not realize that was there. 


2

 MR. GIBBONS:  Perhaps one of my colleagues 


3 

can find the language in the appendix. 


4

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

 QUESTION:  Why don't you go ahead. 


 MR. GIBBONS:  But, for example, if one of 


the detainees here assaulted another detainee in 


Guantanamo, there is no question they would be 


prosecuted under American law because no other law 


applies there.  Cuban law doesn't apply there. 


10

 Now, if the test is sovereignty, that term 


11 

must be given some rational meaning by judges. 


12 

Respondents concede that habeas corpus would extend 


13 

to citizens detained in Guantanamo.  That would be no 


14 

interference with Cuban sovereignty, and extending 


15 

habeas corpus to noncitizens there is no more an 


16 

interference with Cuban sovereignty. 


17

 If there isn't -- if there isn't 


18 

sovereignty over that base where no law applies, 


19 

legislative, judicial or otherwise, the term has no 


20 

meaning.  Sovereignty for legal purposes must at 


21 

least mean that some political organization has a 


22 

monopoly on sanction in that defined geographic area. 


23

 QUESTION:  Mr. Gibbons, I'm quoting from 


24 

page 8 of the government's brief, which I assume is 


25 

an accurate quote of the treaty.  It doesn't just say 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

2

that Cuba has sovereignty if we give up the lease. 


It says the United States -- this is the treaty, 


recognizes the continuance of the ultimate 


sovereignty of the Republic of Cuba over the leased 


area.  Now I take that to mean that they are 


sovereign even during the term of the lease.  You may 


say it's artificial, but there it is. 


 MR. GIBBONS:  I --


 QUESTION:  It's the law of the land, as 


10 

you say. 


11

 MR. GIBBONS:  I misspoke, Justice Scalia, 


12 

by omitting the reference to continuing.  But it 


13 

doesn't make any difference.  That continuing 


14 

sovereignty -- Queen Elizabeth is the nominal 


15 

sovereign of Canada.  That doesn't determine whether 


16 

or not Canadian courts can grant a writ of habeas 


17 

corpus.  She's also the nominal sovereign of 


18 

Australia. 


19

 QUESTION:  I don't think sovereignty is 


20 

being used in the same sense.  I mean, it would be a 


21 

good point if you --


22

23

 MR. GIBBONS:  Well, that's the point. 


 QUESTION:  If you said that England was 


24 

sovereign over Canada, and I don't think anybody 


25 

would say that.

 MR. GIBBONS:  But if the reference in the 


lease meant that Cuban law somehow applied in the 


United States Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, that would 


be one thing.  But Cuban law has never had any 


application inside that base.  A stamp with Fidel 


Castro's picture on it wouldn't get a letter off the 


base. 


 QUESTION:  But you couldn't sublease --


 QUESTION:  Mr. Gibbons --


10

 QUESTION:  -- could we -- we couldn't 


11 

sublease Gitmo and we couldn't sell any of Gitmo to a 


12 

foreign country, could we?  Why not?  Because Cuba is 


13 

sovereign. 


14

 MR. GIBBONS:  Well, there are all sorts of 


15 

treaties in which the United States, or perhaps 


16 

leases in other respects, in which the United States 


17 

knew its own authority, but that doesn't mean that 


18 

the United States has surrendered its sovereignty. 


19

 QUESTION:  Is it like a Federal enclave 


20 

within a State?  I was trying to think of anything 


21 

that might be -- resemble this relationship of the 


22 

United States to a territory inside another 


23 

territory? 


24

 MR. GIBBONS:  Well, Guantanamo is to some 


25 

extent unique.  One of the amicus briefs that surveyed 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

23 

Alderson Reporting Company

1

9 

a United States Navy base elsewhere points out that     


this is the only base, for example, where the United 


States has not entered into a status of forces --


forces agreement. 


 It's not at all clear that we have 


exclusive jurisdiction, civil jurisdiction in any of 


our other enclaves in foreign countries.  But we have 


exclusive jurisdiction and control over civil law in 


Guantanamo, and have had for a century.  So it's --


10 

so it's so totally artificial to say that because of 


11 

this provision in the lease, the executive branch can 


12 

create a no law zone where it is not accountable to 


13 

any judiciary, anywhere. 


14

 Now, in some other places where the United 


15 

States has a base, there may be other civil authority 


16 

that can demand an accounting.  But what the 


17 

executive branch is saying here is we don't have to 


18 

account to anyone, anywhere. 


19

 Justice Breyer, you asked me a question 


20 

before, and someone else, that's not unusual, 


21 

interrupted before I answered you.  And to tell you 


22 

the truth, I don't remember your question at this 


23 

point. 


24

 QUESTION:  I can explore it with the 


25 

Solicitor General possibly.

 MR. GIBBONS:  Well, Your Honor, I was also 


asked a question about whether or not aliens had any 


constitutional rights.  In Verdugo, speaking for four 


members of the Court at least, Mr. Chief Justice, you 


said that Eisentrager stood for the proposition that 


--


 QUESTION:  I think I was speaking for 


8 

five.  I think Justice Kennedy joined the opinion. 


9

 MR. GIBBONS:  Well, he did.  But he wrote 


10 

separately, I think, and at least cast some doubt on 


11 

whether or not he agreed with your position that 


12 

there is no Fifth Amendment right for an alien 


13 

outside the United States. 


14

 Now, of course, that reading of 


15 

Eisentrager assumes that it was a decision on the 


16 

merits and not a jurisdictional decision.  But be 


17 

that as it may, our position, and again, it's not 


18 

necessary for reversal in this case, and perhaps 


19 

should not even be addressed because you could avoid 


20 

a constitutional decision by making a statutory 


21 

decision, but our position is that that statement in 


22 

Verdugo is overbroad.

 QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Gibbons.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SOLICITOR GENERAL THEODORE B. OLSON

Alderson Reporting Company

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS 

 GENERAL OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

3 

it please the Court: 

4

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

 The United States is at war.  Over 10,000 

American troops are in Afghanistan today in response 

to a virtually unanimous Congressional declaration of 

an unusual and extraordinarily -- extraordinary 

threat to our national security, and an authorization 

to the President to use all necessary and appropriate 

10 

force to deter and prevent acts of terrorism against 

11 

the United States. 

12

 It's in that context that Petitioners ask 

13 

this Court to assert jurisdiction that is not 

14 

authorized by Congress, does not arise from the 

15 

Constitution, has never been exercised by this Court 

16 

--                                                      

17

 QUESTION:  Mr. Olson, supposing the war 

18 

had ended, could you continue to detain these people 

19 

on Guantanamo?  Would there then be jurisdiction? 

20

 GENERAL OLSON:  We believe that there 

21 

would not be jurisdiction, just --

22

 QUESTION:  So the existence of the war is 

23 

really irrelevant to the legal issue? 

24

 GENERAL OLSON:  It is not irrelevant, 

25 

because it is in this context that that question is

26

raised, and I would -- the question, the case of 

Johnson vs. Eisentrager, which we have discussed 

here, even the dissent in that case said that it 

would be fantastic to assume that habeas corpus 

jurisdiction would exist in the time of war.  So that 

that case is not --

 QUESTION:  No, but your position does not 

8 

depend on the existence of a war? 

9

 GENERAL OLSON:  It doesn't depend upon 

10 

that, Justice Stevens, but it's even more forceful. 

11 

And more compelling.  Because all of the Justices in 

12 

the Eisentrager case would have held that there was 

13 

no jurisdiction under these circumstances. 

14

 QUESTION:  What if one of the Plaintiffs 

15 

were an American citizen here, but being held in 

16 

17 

Guantanamo.

 GENERAL OLSON:  We have not --

 QUESTION:  Jurisdiction under Habeas

Statute?

 GENERAL OLSON:  We would acknowledge

jurisdiction.  The Court has never --

 QUESTION:  Excuse me.

25 

there would be jurisdiction --

 QUESTION:  Why? 


 GENERAL OLSON:  -- under the Habeas Corpus 


Statute for the reasons that are explained in 


Eisentrager itself, that citizenship is a foundation 


for a relationship between the nation and the 


individual and a foundation for --


 QUESTION:  Is that sufficient to give us 


jurisdiction over Guantanamo, which is another 


sovereign? 


10

 GENERAL OLSON:  With respect to the 


11 

individual.  We would, we would still argue --


12

 QUESTION:  What if the American citizen 


13 

was in the middle of the battlefield in Iraq? 


14

 GENERAL OLSON:  We would still argue that 


15 

the jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute would not 


16 

extend under these circumstances to a wartime 


17 

situation, Justice Stevens, but that the -- what the 


18 

Eisentrager Court said, that there is enhanced 


19 

respect with respect to the power of the Court under 


20 

the habeas corpus jurisdiction with respect to 


21 

questions involving citizenship. 


22

 But what was unquestionable with respect 


23 

to that case is that an alien who had never had any 


24 

relationship to the United States and who was being 


25 

held as a result of a combat situation or a war 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

situation in a foreign jurisdiction, there was no 


jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute. 


 QUESTION:  Well, it's clear that there was 


no relief.  What do you say to Mr. Gibbons' position 


that because in fact they did discuss the merits, 


that case cannot really be taken as authority for 


the -- leaving Ahrens and Braden aside, that the case 


cannot be taken as authority for the proposition that 


there is no jurisdiction in the sense of allowing the 


10 

person through the door to make whatever claim the 


11 

person wants to make.  What is your response to that? 


12

 GENERAL OLSON:  Our response to that is 


13 

throughout the decision in Eisentrager, the Court 


14 

referred to the question of jurisdiction. 


15

16

17

 QUESTION:  Oh, it did. 


 GENERAL OLSON:  It starts --


 QUESTION:  I'm really not asking a 


18 

question about, frankly, about the Court's 


19 

terminology.  I'm asking about the holding in the 


20 

case. 


21

22

 GENERAL OLSON:  The holding --


 QUESTION:  The mere argument is you can't 


23 

say it held anything more than that there was no 


24 

relief at the end of the road. 


25

 GENERAL OLSON:  It held that there was no 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6

7 

8 

9 

relief at the end of the road, because the ultimate 


question, to use the words of the Court, the ultimate 


question is jurisdiction.  The Court over and over 


again said that we are deciding how far the Habeas 


Statute reaches. 


 QUESTION:  General Olson, would you look 


at page 777 of the Johnson v. Eisentrager opinion, 


and it says -- this is a hard opinion to fathom, but 


it does say we are here confronted with, and there is 


10 

a whole list of things.  And one of them is, is an 


11 

enemy alien, and another is, was tried and convicted 


12 

by a military commission sitting outside the United 


13 

States. 


14

 Why would the Court think it necessary to 


15 

say this is what we confronted in this case which 


16 

makes it worlds different from our case, where there 


17 

has been no trial and conviction, where these people 


18 

are saying, and we must accept for the moment that 


19 

it's true, that they are innocents.  That they are 


20 

not combatants of any kind. 


21

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, those were 


22 

unquestionably facts that related to the case, that 


23 

related to the facts that came to the Court, but in 


24 

the very next paragraph, the Court goes on to say 


25 

that we have pointed out that the privilege of 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

2 

3

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

litigation has been extended to aliens whether 


friendly or enemy, that specifically addresses one of 


the points you mentioned, only because permitting 


their presence in the country implied protection. 


 And the Court went on to say, no such 


basis can be invoked here for these prisoners at no 


relevant time were within any territory over which 


the United States is sovereign, and the scenes of 


their offense, their capture, their trial and their 


10 

punishment were all beyond the territorial 


11 

jurisdiction of the United States. 


12

13

 And earlier in that --


 QUESTION:  Their trial and their 


14 

punishment.  This is a completed episode.  This is a 


15 

very difficult decision to understand.  I would say 


16 

it's at least ambiguous. 


17

 GENERAL OLSON:  It seems to me -- it seems 


18 

to me that those statements all have to be read in 


19 

the context -- context of the Court saying the 


20 

ultimate question is jurisdiction. 


21

 QUESTION:  But it was so unnecessary to 


22 

say, to give that list that appears on page 777. 


23

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I suspect that there 


24 

are many decisions of this Court where, when the 


25 

Court is dealing with the facts of a specific case, 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

especially in the context of a Court of Appeals 


decision, if the Court were to turn to the briefs 


that were written before to present the issue in this 


Court, the only -- the question presented, submitted 


in this case, in this Court, in Eisentrager was the 


jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute.  But the case 


arose in the context where the Court of --


 QUESTION:  Was it really -- was it really 


9 

under the Habeas Statute or under the Constitution? 


10

11

 GENERAL OLSON:  It was --


 QUESTION:  Because if the, if the views of 


12 

the dissenters in Ahrens against Clark were the law 


13 

at that time as they perhaps are now, then there 


14 

would have been statutory jurisdiction, which was not 


15 

present at that time. 


16

 GENERAL OLSON:  But the Court was 


17 

specifically focusing on the jurisdictional incidents 


18 

attached to the condition of the individual --


19

 QUESTION:  But the Eisentrager Court never 


20 

once mentioned the statute, the Habeas Statute in its 


21 

opinion.  What it seemed to do was to reach the 


22 

merits and say at the end of the day, these people 


23 

have no rights.  They have had a trial under the 


24 

military tribunal and they have no rights that could 


25 

be granted at the end of the day, and no mention of 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

the Habeas Statute. 


2

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

 GENERAL OLSON:  The Court specifically did 


say, but did not mention the statute, Justice 


O'Connor, but the statute is mentioned throughout the 


briefs, in the government's brief when it says what 


-- the statute at issue, the Habeas Corpus Statute 


and within its territory, the language of Part A. 


The statute that exists today is the same statute 


that the Eisentrager Court was considering. 


10

 QUESTION:  Well, the briefs may have 


11 

mentioned it, but wasn't the problem that Eisentrager 


12 

had to confront, the problem created by Ahrens, 


13 

construing respective jurisdiction, and therefore, 


14 

the only way there could be habeas jurisdiction in 


15 

Eisentrager was if due process demanded it. 


16

 And the Court went on to say, well, there 


17 

are various reasons why there is no ultimate due 


18 

process entitlement, and therefore, due process does 


19 

not demand entertainment of jurisdiction. 


20

 After Braden, that argument is gone.  Why, 


21 

therefore, is Eisentrager not undercut to the point 


22 

where it's no further authority on the jurisdictional 


23 

point? 


24

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, it seems to me again 


25 

the entire opinion has to be taken in context.  The 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

33 

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Court did specifically say that there is no statutory 


authority.  It didn't say, it didn't identify by 


number a provision of the code, but it specifically 


said no statutory authority. 


 QUESTION:  The reason it said that was 


6 

because Ahrens was then the law. 


7

8

 QUESTION:  Yeah. 


 QUESTION:  And that was very clear in the 


9 

Court of Appeals opinion.  They rested their decision 


10 

solely on the Constitution. 


11

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, Justice Stevens, I 


12 

submit that in the context of the case, in the 


13 

context of the way the dissent understood it, as well 


14 

as the majority understood it --


15

 QUESTION:  Yes, but the fact case was --


16 

the case was decided when the majority view in Ahrens 


17 

was the law, and that is no longer the law. 


18

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, we would submit that 


19 

Ahrens, the over -- partial overruling, I think, has 


20 

been pointed out before.  Ahrens has no effect on the 


21 

vitality of the Eisentrager case.  The Court made 


22 

clear that it was deciding -- and everyone -- the 


23 

reason I mentioned the briefs is the context in which 


24 

the case was presented to the Court, and argued to 


25 

the Court and the decision that was made by the 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

majority in the Court, focusing on the identity of 


the Petitioner, whether alien or friendly. 


 Justice Black in his dissenting opinion 


says this decision would apply to whether someone was 


hostile or not, and the entire context of the case, 


Justice Stevens, it seems to me, and does not --


 QUESTION:  The context of the case was it 


was decided at a time when Ahrens against Clark was 


the law.  And if the dissenting opinion in Ahrens 


10 

against Clark had been the law, it would have been 


11 

decided differently. 


12

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, it seems to me that 


13 

a fair reading of the case goes much further than 


14 

that, because the Court was not focusing on that.  It 


15 

didn't specify that it was making its decision on 


16 

that basis.  It did specify over and over again, and 


17 

the dissent referred to this as well, that it was 


18 

focusing on the fact that the individuals bringing 


19 

the petition had no sufficient contacts with the 


20 

United States.  That's in part why the Court 


21 

distinguished --


22

 QUESTION:  And that's a complete response 


23 

to an argument resting entirely on the Constitution.


24

25

 QUESTION:  Did it cite Ahrens?


 GENERAL OLSON:  It did not, as I'm --

 QUESTION:  I don't recall. 


 GENERAL OLSON:  I don't recall that it 


3 

did.  The District Court --


4

 QUESTION:  Kind of extraordinary if it was 


5 

relying entirely on that --


6

7 

8 

9 

 GENERAL OLSON:  The District Court relied 


upon that decision.  The Court of Appeals went much 


further with respect to -- in fact, the Court, and 


this Court, Justice Jackson's opinion for the Court 


10 

in this case specifically points out that the Court 


11 

of Appeals went back to something it called 


12 

fundamentals, because it couldn't find any authority 


13 

in either the statute or the Constitution. 


14

 QUESTION:  Well, didn't the Johnson 


15 

opinion also say, we don't have to concern ourselves 


16 

here with the proper custodian.  We kind of finesse 


17 

that point? 


18

 GENERAL OLSON:  I believe that's a correct 


19 

characterization.  What -- the other portion of the 


20 

decision that it seems to me important to recognize 


21 

is that this is a decision that was widely perceived, 


22 

and has been consistently perceived, as a definition 


23 

of the scope of the Habeas Statute.  Going back to 


24 

the early 1800s, this Court decided that the extent 


25 

of habeas jurisdiction arose from the statute, not 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

36 

Alderson Reporting Company

from the common law.

 QUESTION:  That gets me back to your 


statement that if this had been a citizen held in 


Guantanamo, that habeas would be available.  But the 


statute doesn't talk about citizens.  It says 


prisoners held under the authority of the United 


States.  Now, if the citizen can say that he is a 


prisoner held under the authority of the United 


States in Guantanamo, why couldn't a noncitizen under 


10 

the statute say the same thing? 


11

 GENERAL OLSON:  I think, Justice Kennedy, 


12 

the answer to that is, in the first place, we are 


13 

not, we are not saying that there necessarily would 


14 

be jurisdiction there, but we are saying that the 


15 

Court -- that the Court would go further with respect 


16 

to that because, and this is also in Eisentrager and 


17 

a number of other Court's -- of this Court's 


18 

decisions, that the Court will find more protection 


19 

for citizens as a result of the relationship going 


20 

back --


21

 QUESTION:  Well, but the only way we can 


22 

do it --


23

 QUESTION:  I don't, I don't mean to 


24 

misconstrue it or to misstate it, I had thought you 


25 

said at the outset that if this had been a citizen of 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

the United States held in Guantanamo, there would be 


habeas corpus. 


 GENERAL OLSON:  We are not -- we are 


saying that we would not be contesting it, Justice 


Kennedy, and the Court will be dealing with other 


issues involving citizens. 


 QUESTION:  You don't have to contest the 


jurisdictional objection.  If there is no 


jurisdiction, there is no jurisdiction, whether you 


10 

contest it or not. 


11

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I guess the only way 


12 

I can answer this, Justice Stevens, is to say that 


13 

what the Court seemed to say, not only in the 


14 

majority opinion, but in the dissenting opinion, that 


15 

more rights would be given to citizens --


16

 QUESTION:  No, but there are no rights 


17 

that can be recognized unless there is jurisdiction 


18 

in the first place.  And if the Court is going to 


19 

make good on what you have just said it said, it has 


20 

got to do so presupposing jurisdiction.  So if you 


21 

are going to rely upon those statements, don't you 


22 

necessarily have to concede jurisdiction? 


23

24

 GENERAL OLSON:  I don't --


 QUESTION:  With respect to the citizen? 


25 

Doesn't make any difference if they have got lots of 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

rights if there is no jurisdiction to get into a 

court to enforce them. 

 GENERAL OLSON:  I think that the answer is 

that that does not necessarily follow.  The Court has 

not reached that decision yet, and that's something 

that is not before the Court. 

 QUESTION:  Certainly the argument is 

available that in that situation, the Constitution 

requires jurisdiction.  The Constitution requires 

10 

that an American citizen who has the protection of 

11 

the Constitution have some manner of vindicating his 

12 

rights under the Constitution.  That would be the 

13 

argument. 

14

 GENERAL OLSON:  I agree with that, justice 

15 

Scalia, and this Court has said again and again that 

16 

--                                                      

17

 QUESTION:  And that was part of his 

18 

argument in Eisentrager. 

19

 GENERAL OLSON:  And it was -- and in that 

20 

case, the Court specifically said the Fifth Amendment 

21 

did not extend to the Petitioners in that case.  The 

22 

Court has said that again in the Verdugo case in 

23 

terms of the Fourth Amendment. 

24

 QUESTION:  Is that your answer to Justice 

25 

Kennedy, that there would be jurisdiction because due

process would require it for citizens, but there 


would not be statutory jurisdiction in the case of 


the citizen at Guantanamo? 


 GENERAL OLSON:  I think it would be an 


interpretation.  And what this Court is doing is 


interpreting the statute because the Habeas Corpus 


Statute defines the extent of rights --


 QUESTION:  Well, but what is the 


9 

position -- I mean, I want to know what the position 


10 

of the United States is for the same reason Justice 


11 

Kennedy does. 


12

 GENERAL OLSON:  Our answer to that 


13 

question, Justice Souter, is that citizens of the 


14 

United States, because of their constitutional 


15 

circumstances, may have greater rights with respect 


16 

to the scope and reach of the Habeas Statute as the 


17 

Court has or would interpret it.  That case has never 


18 

come before this Court, and it's important to 


19 

emphasize that --


20

 QUESTION:  You go outside of the statutory 


21 

language for your case that's in front of us. 


22

23

 GENERAL OLSON:  Excuse me, Justice --


 QUESTION:  You are going outside of the 


24 

statutory language to resolve both the hypothetical 


25 

case and the case in front of us.  This is a 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

prisoner, and he is detained under the authority of 

the United States. 

 GENERAL OLSON:  And this Court construed 

those provisions in the Eisentrager case and 

determined that the statute did not reach aliens that 

did have no contact with the United States and were 

held in a foreign jurisdiction outside the 

sovereignty of the United States. 

 QUESTION:  It did not construe the 

10 

statute.  It assumed the statute was inapplicable and 

11 

concluded that the Constitution was not a substitute 

12 

for the statute. 

13

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, Justice Stevens, I 

14 

respectfully disagree.  I think the Court was 

15 

construing the statute not to be applicable, then it 

16 

went on because the Court of Appeals had addressed 

17 

the constitutional question. 

18

 QUESTION:  Not a word, not a word in the 

19 

opinion that supports it. 

20

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I respectfully 

21 

disagree.  The Court does say, we don't find any 

22 

authority in the statute.  We don't find any 

23 

authority in the Constitution.  We will not go to 

24 

so-called fundamentals to find it someplace else. 

25 

That is consistent with what this Court decided in 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

41 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

the --

9 

 QUESTION:  Well, it's obvious that there 


is language in Eisentrager that supports you, obvious 


to me, but you have just heard that judges don't 


always distinguish between 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), not 


even in this Court, at least we don't always get it 


right.  And there is also language, as you have 


heard, that's against you.  I think there is some in 


there. 


10

 So what I'm thinking now, assuming that 


11 

it's very hard to interpret Eisentrager, is that if 


12 

we go with you, it has a virtue of clarity.  There is 


13 

a clear rule.  Not a citizen, outside the United 


14 

States, you don't get your foot in the door.  But 


15 

against you is that same fact. 


16

 It seems rather contrary to an idea of a 


17 

Constitution with three branches that the executive 


18 

would be free to do whatever they want, whatever they 


19 

want without a check.  That's problem one. 


20

 Problem two is that we have several 


21 

hundred years of British history where the cases 


22 

interpreting habeas corpus said to the contrary 


23 

anyway.  And then we have the possibility of really 


24 

helping you with what you're really worried about, 


25 

which is undue court interference by shaping the 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

42 

Alderson Reporting Company

1

8

substantive right to deal with all those problems of 


the military that led you to begin your talk by 


reminding us of those problems. 


 So if it's that choice, why not say, sure, 


you get your foot in the door, prisoners in 


Guantanamo, and we'll use the substantive rights to 


work out something that's protective but practical. 


 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, Justice Breyer, 


9 

there are several answers to that.  You started with 


10 

the proposition that there was no check and that the 


11 

executive is asserting no check.  This is the 


12 

interpretation of the scope of a Habeas Statute. 


13 

Congress had -- has had 54 years with full awareness 


14 

of the decision to change it. 


15

 Indeed, as we point out in our brief, 


16 

eight months after the Eisentrager decision, a bill 


17 

was introduced that would have changed that statute, 


18 

H.R. 2812, which would specifically have changed the 


19 

statute to deal with the Eisentrager situation, so 


20 

there is a check. 


21

 QUESTION:  It could have been just a 


22 

clarifying, General Olson.  As you well know, the 


23 

fact that a bill was introduced and not passed 


24 

carries very little weight on what law that exists 


25 

means.

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I understand that, 


but the bill was -- came eight months after 


Eisentrager. 


 QUESTION:  You're not using it to say what 


the law was.  You're using it to show that there was 


available, and is available, a perfectly good check 


upon the executive branch.  If the people think that 


this is unfair, if Congress thinks it's unfair, with 


a stroke of the pen, they can change the Habeas         


10 

Statute. 


11

 GENERAL OLSON:  That's precisely correct. 


12 

And they had a bill before them eight months after 


13 

the Eisentrager decision which had -- that Congress 


14 

proceeded on it.  Congress has also dealt with the 


15 

Habeas Statute in a variety of other ways.  It has 


16 

seen fit in no way to change the decision required by 


17 

this Court with respect to the statute. 


18

 You mentioned several hundred years of 


19 

British history was your second point.  All of those 


20 

cases, or virtually all of those same cases that have 


21 

been brought up in the briefs, and the amicus briefs 


22 

today, were in the briefs that were before the 


23 

Eisentrager --


24

 QUESTION:  I grant you this.  My question 


25 

has to assume that Eisentrager is ambiguous and not 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

44 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

2 

3

5

clearly determinative.  But then on that assumption, 


I'm still honestly most worried about the fact that 


there would be a large category of unchecked and 


uncheckable actions dealing with the detention of 


individuals that are being held in a place where 


America has power to do everything. 


 Now, that's what's worrying me because of 


Article III, and the other thing on the opposite 


side, as I said, is it's possible to tailor the 


10 

substance to take care of the problems that are 


11 

worrying you.  Those are my two basic points. 


12

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, let me get back to 


13 

it again.  Those earlier cases were decided and 


14 

rejected in Eisen -- in the Eisentrager case. 


15 

Whether there is a check on the executive, there is a 


16 

Congressional check through the power of legislation, 


17 

through the power of oversight, through the power of 


18 

appropriations.  There is --


19

 QUESTION:  Can we hold hearings to 


20 

determine the problems that are bothering you?  I 


21 

mean, we have to take your word for what the problems 


22 

are.  We can't call witnesses and see what the real 


23 

problems are, can we, in creating this new 


24 

substantive rule that we are going to let the courts 


25 

create.  Congress could do all that, though, couldn't 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

45 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

it? 

2

 GENERAL OLSON:  Congress could do all that 

3 

--                                                      

4

5 

6

8

 QUESTION:  If it wanted to change the 

Habeas Statute, it could make all sorts of refined 

modifications. 

 GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, it could --

 QUESTION:  About issues that we know 

9 

nothing whatever about, because we have only lawyers 

10 

before us.  We have no witnesses.  We have no 

11 

cross-examination, we have no investigative staff. 

12 

And we should be the ones, Justice Breyer suggests, 

13 

to draw up this reticulated system to preserve our 

14 

military from intervention by the courts. 

15

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, we would agree with 

16 

that and we would emphasize the point that stepping 

17 

across that line would be impossible to go back from 

18 

with respect to prisoners in the battlefield.  In 

19 

fact, the reply brief refers to the front lines in 

20 

Iraq, in a battle station in Iraq.  We are talking 

21 

here about battlefield decisions and --

22

 QUESTION:  The battlefield, I might, since 

23 

-- all I mean by working out the substantive rights 

24 

is what Justice Harlan meant and what Justice Kennedy 

25 

meant in adopting Justice Harlan's view in Verdugo.

And that really derives from the insular cases, and I 


don't think it's something that requires witnesses 


and reticulated whatever they are, tax cuts. 


 (Laughter.) 


 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, to the extent that 


the Court would say, the executive, you must give a 


military process because the Petitioners in this 


case, first of all, demanded in their petition and 


they would have a right to raise these issues to the 


10 

extent they have not backed off in this case, but 


11 

they demanded in their petition, their release, 


12 

unmonitored communications with counsel, cessation of 


13 

interrogations, evidentiary hearings. 


14

15

 QUESTION:  Wasn't it --


 QUESTION:  Our, our doctrine would have to 


16 

be applied in the first instance by 800 different 


17 

district judges, I take it. 


18

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, there is no question 


19 

that that is exactly right.  And to the extent that 


20 

what the Petitioners are seeking is to oversee the 


21 

circumstances -- this is the language in their brief, 


22 

to oversee the circumstances of detention.  That is 


23 

going to vary from case to case. 


24

 QUESTION:  General Olson, I have looked at 


25 

the reply brief, which is the last chance to say what 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

47

1 

2 

3

they mean.  And they say we are not asking for any of 


those things, and certainly not asking to have a 


lawyer there while these people are being 


interrogated. 


 They are saying, look, we are claiming 


that our people are innocents.  And for purposes of 


this proceeding, we must assume that.  And all we 


want is some process to determine whether they are 


indeed innocent, and it doesn't have to be a court 


10 

process. 


11

 GENERAL OLSON:  But Justice Ginsburg, the 


12 

relief that I was articulating is what they asked for 


13 

in the first instance.  If they have jurisdiction in 


14 

this Court, the next Petitioner doesn't have to say 


15 

well, I only want a process.  And if they only 


16 

want -- now they are saying they only want an 


17 

executive branch process to review.  As we 


18 

explained --


19

 QUESTION: But to go back to the 


20 

jurisdiction, so I understand really what your 


21 

argument is.  Would this be entirely different, as 


22 

far as their jurisdiction is concerned, if we were 


23 

talking about -- if the people were prisoners on 


24 

Ellis Island or in Puerto Rico? 


25

 GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, we would.  Because we 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

are talking about territorial sovereign jurisdiction 

of the United States.  What -- what exists in 

Guantanamo is no different than existed in Lansberg 

Prison and --

 QUESTION:  Why is that, why is that 

crucial?  I mean, it's not crucial, I take it, under 

the respective jurisdiction clause of 2241.  Is it 

crucial under the Due Process Clause? 

 GENERAL OLSON:  It is, it is the line that 

10 

this Court drew and repeatedly articulated --

11

 QUESTION:  But why is it a good line?  I 

12 

mean, what is -- what is the justification? 

13

 GENERAL OLSON:  Because it is a line that 

14 

is, is -- has the virtue of what Justice Breyer was 

15 

talking about, of having relative certainty.  It is a 

16 

line that's defined by State to State relationships. 

17

 QUESTION:  Why does it have complete 

18 

jurisdiction?  No one else has jurisdiction. 

19 

Complete jurisdiction of satisfactory lines. 

20

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, the complete 

21 

jurisdiction is a phrase in that lease, the lease 

22 

specifically says that ultimate sovereignty is 

23 

Cuba's.  It specifically says that the United States 

24 

--

 QUESTION:  How many years have we been

operating in Guantanamo with Cuban law never 


applying? 


 GENERAL OLSON:  With respect -- the lease 


restricts the ability of the United States to use 


that property for only Naval or coaling purposes.  It 


specifically says it may not be used for any other 


purpose. 


 QUESTION:  General Olson, there is a whole 


9 

other issue in this case which you have not addressed 


10 

and I don't think your brief much addressed it. 


11 

There is also a claim of jurisdiction under Section 


12 

1331 in the Administrative Procedure Act.  Will you 


13 

say at least a few words about what your response to 


14 

that is?  I don't even see the APA cited in your 


15 

brief. 


16

 GENERAL OLSON:  What is cited in the 


17 

brief, and we explain that the President is not an 


18 

agency under the APA, that the United States military 


19 

with respect to operations and military operations 


20 

are specifically exempted by the APA. 


21

22

 QUESTION:  That goes to the merits. 


 GENERAL OLSON:  And that the fundamental 


23 

nature of what the Petitioners are seeking here is 


24 

the review of the nature and status of their 


25 

detention, which sounds in -- and is examined by this

Court repeatedly under the doctrine of habeas corpus. 


And that there is no foundation.  In fact, I submit 


that the way the briefs have been written, the 


Petitioners don't even feel strongly about the APA 


position. 


 What they are talking about, and why most 


of their briefs explain, they are focusing on 


fundamental habeas corpus as it existed throughout 


the centuries.  What is important to emphasize here 


10 

with respect to all of these questions, with respect 


11 

to, well, how much control would there be, how much 


12 

control would there be in Guantanamo versus a place 


13 

in Afghanistan or another place --


14

15


 QUESTION: No, I think Guantanamo, everyone 


16 

agrees, is an animal, there is no other like it.  The 


17 

closest would be the Canal Zone, I suppose. 


18

 GENERAL OLSON:  The Canal Zone was treated 


19 

differently by Congress.  Congress created, applied, 


20 

under its responsibility with respect to territorial 


21 

and insular or unincorporated territory, applied laws 


22 

there, put a court there.  So it's very different 


23 

than the Canal Zone. 


24

 QUESTION:  Why isn't this like, as I asked 


25 

Mr. Gibbons, a Federal enclave within a State?

 GENERAL OLSON:  Because it is -- because 


it is a -- in the first place, the question of 


sovereignty is a political decision.  It would be 


remarkable for the judiciary to start deciding where 


the United States is sovereign and where the United 


States has control --


 QUESTION:  The word is physical control, 


8 

power. 


9

 GENERAL OLSON:  We have that, Justice 


10 

Ginsburg, in every place where we would put military 


11 

detainees, in a field of combat where there are 


12 

prisons in Afghanistan where we have complete control 


13 

with respect to the circumstances. 


14

 QUESTION:  But those -- Afghanistan is not 


15 

a place where American law is, and for a century, has 


16 

customarily been applied to all aspects of life.  We 


17 

even protect the Cuban iguana.  We bring -- in 


18 

bringing people from Afghanistan or wherever they 


19 

were brought to Guantanamo, we are doing in 


20 

functional terms exactly what we would do if we 


21 

brought them to the District of Columbia, in a 


22 

functional sense, leaving aside the metaphysics of 


23 

ultimate sovereignty. 


24

 If the metaphysics of ultimate sovereignty 


25 

do not preclude us from doing what we have been doing

for the last 100 years, why is it a bar to the 


exercise of judicial jurisdiction under the Habeas 


Statute? 


 GENERAL OLSON:  The Court actually heard a 


case, Neely vs. Henkel, in 1901, which specifically 


addressed that, and held that the United States did 


not have sovereignty for the enforcement of its laws 


in Guantanamo.  And at that point --


 QUESTION:  We've been doing a pretty good 


10 

job of it since then, am I right? 


11

 GENERAL OLSON:  With respect to a certain 


12 

area, a military base in Germany, a military base in 


13 

Afghanistan, the United States must have and does 


14 

exercise relatively complete control.  Every argument 


15 

that's being made here today could be made by the two 


16 

million persons that were in custody at the end of 


17 

World War II, and judges would have to decide the 


18 

circumstances of their detention, whether there had 


19 

been adequate military process, what control existed 


20 

over the territory in which they were being kept. 


21 

What this is --


22

 QUESTION:  Are you saying that there is no 


23 

statutory regime that applies to Guantanamo which is 


24 

different from the statutory or legal regime that 


25 

applied to occupied territories after World War II or

indeed that applies to territory under the control of 


the American military in Afghanistan or Iraq? 


 GENERAL OLSON:  There is a great deal of 


differences in connection with every area over which 


the United States has some degree of control.  The 


degree of control that it has here is limited to 


specific purposes in -- with respect to the 


sovereignty of Cuba. 


 QUESTION:  Thank you, General Olson.  The 


10 

case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
