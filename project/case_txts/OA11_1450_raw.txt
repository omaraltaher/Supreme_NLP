 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE J. BOUTROUS, JR., 


 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 


 Congress enacted the Class Action Fairness 

Insurance Company v. Knowles. 


 Mr. Boutrous. 


 MR. BOUTROUS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

3
4  argument next in Case 11-1450, the Standard Fire 

5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12  Act of 2005, CAFA, to expand Federal diversity 
13  jurisdiction and to protect defendants and absent class 
14  members against the kind of State court class action 
abuses that are occurring in Miller County, Arkansas. 
15
16  Congress directed that in calculating the amount in 
17  controversy, "courts shall aggregate the claims of the 
18  individual class members."  That's 28 U.S.C. Section 
19  1332(d)(6), itâ€™s quoted in full at page 2 of our blue brief.

the individual class members in the text of the statute, 
rather than on the amount being sought by the would-be 
class representative, is dispositive of the question 
presented and requires reversal in this case. 

Congress's express focus on the claims of 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would your position 

3
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  be the same if the issue were not the amount sought but 
2  rather the substantive claims?  Say there are two 
3  different claims the class member -- the class could 
4  raise.  One would yield damages of $4,900,000.  The 
other would yield damages of $10 million.  Do you have 
5
6  the same objection in a case in which the prospective 
7  representative only pleads the first claim? 
 MR. BOUTROUS:  Not necessarily, Your Honor. 
8
9  We are not arguing that here.  There are cases that this 
Court has decided going back to Barry v. Edmunds in 1886 
10
11 
where there are allegations in a complaint that might, 
for example, yield a punitive damage claim, but it's not 
12 
13 
explicitly pled, and the courts then look and say, 
punitive damages could be recovered here and say the 
14 
amount in controversy clearly exceeds the -- the 
15
16 
necessary amount. 
17
18  courts need to look through and see every claim that 
19  could be in play. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

seem to have a difficulty with your position about how 
far it goes.  You make the point in your briefs about 
the statute of limitations question.  In other words, 
it's not just how much they claim, but where they decide 
to cut off the statute of limitations and so forth. 

 But we're not saying that in every case the 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but you do 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 It seems to me that it's a bit of a slippery 

adequate, but whether or not it's below or above, above 

maximum amount the plaintiff on his or her best day 
could recover based on the factual allegations in the 
complaint and the causes of action that could arise from 
the factual allegations --

1
2  slope if you start saying we're going to look at what 
3  the class could -- could recover in deciding whether or 
4  not, not simply whether or not this representative is 
5
6  or below $5 million. 
7
 MR. BOUTROUS:  That's really how it's been 
8  done, Your Honor, from day one.  Under the traditional 
9  diversity statute, the courts look and see what's the 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16  rules of the traditional diversity statute to this case 
17  because it's clear that under the traditional diversity 
18  statute, you -- you can waive excessive damages, right? 
 MR. BOUTROUS:  That's correct, Your Honor. 
19
20
21
22  apply that rule here. 
23
24  that rule, Your Honor, because that rule applies to the 
individual who brings his own case in court and can say, 
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but under the 

traditional -- you surely don't want us to apply the 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  I don't want you to apply 

The individual --

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you don't want us to

 MR. BOUTROUS:  It wouldn't protect it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, why doesn't -- why 

grossly unfair to the class that the judge is not going 
to certify that case? 

1  I want to come into court and collect less than the 
2  amount that would give Federal jurisdiction.  It's much 
3  different when Mr. Knowles has come to court and said, I 
4  want to represent these other individuals in Arkansas. 
5
6  doesn't the normal class certification process protect 
7  adequately the absent class members?  First of all, 
8  counsel has to prove he or she is adequate.  So doesn't 
9  that mean that if they enter a stipulation that is 
10
11 
12
13  protect from the problems and abuses that Congress was 
14  concerned about, Your Honor, and that are occurring 
15
16
17  If -- if the court finds the stipulation inadequate for 
18  the class, is that class going to be certified? 
19
20
21  seek more than $5 million.  That's why --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And then they would get 
22
23  removed to the Federal court, which is what the statute 
24  was intended to do. 
25

 MR. BOUTROUS:  It could be, Your Honor.  And 

another class representative could come in and could 

here. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You haven't answered. 

MR. BOUTROUS:  But what Congress was 

6

back 10 years.  The -- this case --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, discovery 

1  concerned about in the text of the statute, and the 
2  Senate report make this very clear, that with all the 
3  abuses that occur in the interim, discovery that has 
4  nothing to do with the case -- the discovery here goes 
5
6
7  vis-a-vis the certification of the class is going to 
8  happen anyway.  My point is that much of your argument 
9  in your brief is centered around binding the absent 
class members.  What I'm getting to is that if the 
10
11 
stipulation is grossly unfair, there may not be a class 
at all, or the Plaintiffs who have claims greater than 
12 
13 
those in the aggregate might opt -- will get notice and 
opt out. 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19
Congress was very concerned that cases were being kept 
20
21  in the State courts through abuses and manipulations of 
22  the amount in controversy.  It's very clear in the 
23  Senate report, Congress talks about this because, for 
24  example, in this case the defendants can never get a 
25

settlement is entered that is so grossly unfair that it 
violates due process.  So I don't know why the process 
itself doesn't protect the interests of -- of Congress. 
 MR. BOUTROUS:  Your Honor -- excuse me.  The 

class certification hearing in Miller County. 

And there is due process challenges if a

 They can never get a ruling on the merits.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Mr. Boutrous, you say what 
7  Congress is concerned about and point to the Senate report. 
8  You know, usually we look to the text and the text makes 
9  very clear that Congress was concerned about many things

MR. BOUTROUS:  Your Honor, I think the text 
does take away the St. Paul rule that an individual can 
control what he seeks and go where he desires and do 
what he wants -- or she -- because it points to the 
claims of the individual class members and the text 
Congress could expect --

and it did many things.  It got -- it really -- it 
raised the matter in controversy threshold.  It 
eliminated the Zahn anti-aggregation rule.  It 
eliminated the complete diversity requirement.  It 
eliminated the one-year limit on removal. 

Here's one thing it didn't eliminate.  It 
didn't eliminate the St. Paul master of your complaint 
rule.  So -- so I guess where in the text do you see 
this?  You point to claim, the word "claim."  Is that 
the only thing that you are resting on in the text?

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Well, Your Honor, I would 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do you think that the word 

bring, or would you think I mean what I demanded, what I 

adequately represent the class.  But in terms of valuing 
the claims here --

1
2  Mr. Boutrous, "Is your claim for over $100,000," what 

3  would you think I mean?  Would you think I mean some 

4  sort of abstract version of the best claim you could 

5
6  asked for? 
7
8  think that I would answer you that it's worth as much as 
9  I can possibly obtain in court if I was seeking to 
10
11 
12
13  "claim" is not -- when you say Joe made a claim for 
14  $100,000, a claim is not what he asked for, but is 
15
16  best thing that he could have asked for? 
17
 MR. BOUTROUS:  Your Honor, we've cited the 
18  Tohono O'odham Nation case, where the Court interpreted 
19  the word "claim" and said when a statute uses the word 
20
21  it's the operative facts and the right to recovery, not 
22  the demand.  That's exactly what we have here. 
23
24  at least as an alternative argument, you're saying:  The

instead some kind of law professor's view of what the 

"claim" regarding claims that have not been brought,

Plaintiffs have now conceded that.  So what we have 
here, the district court found on an uncontradicted 
record that the claims of the individual class members 
exceed $5 million.  That means there's Federal 
jurisdiction. 

1  Smith v. Bayer, which you so happily rely on, does not 
2  have much to do with this case.  Smith v. Bayer is the 
3  question of can an -- can a person be precluded by a 
4  judgment when that person was not part of a class. 
There's no question that this person is going to be 
5
6  precluded.  This person can go do whatever he or she 
7  wants before class certification and judgment. 
 MR. BOUTROUS:  Your Honor, that's --

cannot affect or jeopardize or undermine the claims of 
absent individuals. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  This is what I -- could you

Then I look here, and it says, "The district 

1  original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the 

2  matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of

6  court shall have jurisdiction of any civil action in 
7  which the manner in controversy exceeds the sum or value

10

 And it can't be the words I quoted that

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Your Honor, it's the other 
22  part that is extremely important, section 1332(d)(6). 
23  You were quoting from section 1332(d)(2).  Unlike 
24  section 1332(a), Congress in CAFA explicitly added 
25

Now, in respect to the first, we know that a 
lawyer can file a binding stipulation that says, I don't 
care what this is about, I am not asking for more than 
$75,000, and the Federal court does not have 
jurisdiction.  Given that's true in the first statute, 
and given that the second statute is almost identically 
worded, at least in that part, why can't he do the same 
thing with the $5 million?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, as to what that looks

4  like, "shall be aggregated," again from the language, is 
5
6  the individual -- thing to approach -- to count.  In 
7  other words, you aggregate rather than just looking at 
8  the individual members, which is Zahn, which has nothing

 And indeed, nobody objects here to the

 MR. BOUTROUS:  It's really not the word 

passed in 2011, which applies to 1332(a), Congress said 
the sum demanded will control. 

1  that's why I had trouble finding your argument in the 
2  word "aggregation." 
3
4  "aggregation," Your Honor.  It's the word "individual" 
and it's with the word "claims."  If Congress had done 
5
6  what you are suggesting, Justice Breyer, it could have 
7  said the aggregate amount being sought by the named 
8  plaintiff, or the total amount, or the demand of the 
9  plaintiff.  In the Venue Clarification Act, which was 
10

13  Congress defining, as I urged the Court --
14

16  to be much worse for your position.  If Congress had 
17  wanted to get rid of the St. Paul master of your 
18  complaint rule, it could have said, we are getting rid 
19  of the St. Paul master of your complaint rule.  But 
you're trying to find it in a provision which is really 
20
21  an anti-Zahn provision, not an anti-St. Paul provision. 
22
 MR. BOUTROUS:  Your Honor, it really goes to 
23  a fundamental issue of what a class action is.  If Mr. 
24  Knowles had come into court himself on behalf of

2  court, he can limit his recovery." 
3
 Mr. Knowles --
4
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Let's get back to the Chief 
Justice's question because there are a thousand ways in 
5
6  which we let the named plaintiff prior to certification 
7  construct a case, and then we ask, as Justice Sotomayor 
8  said, later we ask, is the way he's constructed a case 
9  adequate or not, and we allow him to go forward or not 
10
11
12  damages.  He gets -- at all, or whether he only can seek 
13  injunctive relief.  He gets to decide which claims to 
14  bring, trespass or negligence.  He gets to decide how 
many years' worth to ask for.  He gets to decide which 
15
16  defendants to sue. 
17
18  effect on -- on the amount that's -- that's being asked 
19  for.  And yet in all of these ways, we allow or --
maybe you're telling me no -- do we stop the named 
20
21  plaintiff from doing all -- all of those things, too? 
 MR. BOUTROUS:  We don't stop them from doing 
22
23  all of those things, Your Honor.  And there are certain 
24  things -- we -- we agree that the complaint controls a

 All of these things are going to have an 

great deal -- the factual allegations.

 Can we take that also into account in 


instead of 2 years?

would be clear that the amount in controversy was 


 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about specifically 
1
2  the question that the Chief asked about time?  You did 
3  argue in the district court that these plaintiffs could 
4  have specified a 5-year time period, in which case it

9  complaint could have been enlarged to include 5 years

14  thwart jurisdiction or affect jurisdiction, the Court 
15
16  the actual facts are. 
17

19  stipulations, they're slicing and dicing the classes up 
into pieces to -- to thwart jurisdiction and manipulate

that, Mr. Boutrous, because what you have, given that 
this is a State which says that these stipulations are

it proceeds to judgment, you have a cap of $5 million. 
You cannot be charged more than $5 million under this

if they're notified that there's a $5 million cap -- and 
I don't know that Rule 23 requires that, but suppose 
they're notified of that. 

1  discovery is being taken.  Here, the limitations period 
2  is limited to two -- or the class period is limited to 
3  two years.  The discovery that was served with the 
4  complaint goes back to 13 years.  So --
5
6  handled on remand to the Arkansas Supreme Court exactly 
7  like a Federal class action, I don't understand how

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Congress was concerned 
17  about suits of over $5 million.  And -- and the question 
18  here is, is this a suit of over $5 million.  Now, if it 
19  is a suit over $5 million, a State court is bound by the 
due process clause and a State court is going to find, 
20

22  We're not going to allow you to do that.  You're not an

was concerned about, too, Your Honor.  It was concerned 
that the State courts weren't applying standards of 
uniformity in these -- class actions that are affecting 
interstate commerce and that Rule 23's protections and 
standards should apply. 

 On the other hand, in a case like this where 

it's $5,024,000 and it only gets there because you've

we do so here? 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  We don't have a State court 

1  added on one and a half million dollars of legal fees, 
2  the Court might very well say you are an adequate 
3  representative, go for it.  Now, usually we don't 
4  question State court judgments of that kind.  Why should 
5
6
7  judgment yet, Your Honor, that -- and we judge the 
8  removal issues and the amount in controversy at the time 
9  of removal.  And $5 million is $5 million, Congress drew 
the line there.  And as Justice Alito was pointing out, 
10
11 
the notices to the absent class members, Congress -- I 
was about to say 3a of the addendum to our blue brief, 
12 
13 
those are the findings that Congress put into the public 
law, number -- letter C:  Confusing notices are 
14 
published that prevent individuals from exercising their 
15
legitimate rights in -- and enforcing their legitimate 
16 
17 
claims. 
18
19  if a -- where a statute was enacted to protect -- and 
this is in the findings -- "legitimate claims of absent 
20
21  class members" and to allow them -- the cases to be in 
22  Federal court, if this Court were to hold that a named 
23  plaintiff who doesn't represent those people can come 
24  into court and -- and say we're not going to seek the 
full amount of those claims in order to keep the case 
25

MR. BOUTROUS:  I'm not making a judgment on 
that point, Your Honor.  It may or may not be, and the 
Plaintiff makes this point.  Maybe it's better to be in 
State court.  But for removal purposes only, going back 
to just the pure analysis, the question is does the 
amount in controversy, when the claims of the individual 
class members are aggregated, exceed $5 million?  It's 
undisputed that that's true.  The only basis for saying 
it doesn't exceed that amount is the stipulation, which 
everyone now agrees has no binding affect whatsoever.

12  action; then it's binding and you haven't been exposed. 
13
 MR. BOUTROUS:  But, Your Honor, again, under 
14  the jurisdictional approach -- and Your Honor cited 
St. Paul.  St. Paul says that if -- once the amount in 
15
16  controversy has been established to exceed the amount, 
17  here $5 million, it's on the burden of the parties 
18  seeking to oust jurisdiction to show, to a legal 
19  certainty, that the amount will not go over $5 million.

concede it could well go over $5 million if this class 
representative is found inadequate, if another person is 
appointed to be the class representative, and therefore, 
there is Federal jurisdiction.  That's the rule that 
plaintiffs say should apply.  They don't even -- he does

outcome that a State court could come to.  A second 
10
11  outcome could be that at that point, if an alternate 
12  class member comes in and files an intervened complaint

14  point section 1453(b) applies and they can remove to

8  if the -- if the representation is inadequate, if indeed

a claim to punitive damages whether or not a Federal

7  into account. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if you had a

names begin with A to K.  It turns out that's

3  his adequacy, let's say he's fully representing, 
4  bringing all the claims and all the damages.  He's just 
decided to break it up from A to K.  Somebody from L is 
5
6  not going to say, well, he's inadequate when he's 
7  representing him just because he could have represented 
8  everybody in the other action.

11  purposes, the Court has always had -- that kind of legal 
12  strategy is perfectly appropriate under the master of 
13  the complaint --
14
15
16  statute, which is what their problem is, all you have to 
17  do, even if you were less obvious than the Chief 
18  Justice's example, what you do is you -- you file a 
19  complaint, you say it's for $4,900,000; in fact, it's 
20
21  Justice Alito, you figure a way around his problem, you 
22  keep them informed, and you say, it's getting close,

loophole because it swallows up all of Congress's

4  have ten actions and then you have 20.  So, in fact, all

least.  I gather they're some in Arkansas.  But that 
10
11 
seems to be all behind Justice Scalia's and the Chief 
Justice's questions, and I would like to hear a pretty 
12 
13 
complete answer on that. 
14
you look at the report that went along with the statute, 
15
16  what Congress was most concerned about was the situation 
17  where each individual class member would not be able to 
18  exceed $75,000, but there might be a million of them. 
19  And so you might have a million class members, each of 
whom had a claim for $50,000, and there was no way to 
20
21  get that to Federal court because of the Zahn 
22  non-aggregating rule. 
 Congress was not concerned about having the 
23
24  master of the complaint altered in this class process; 
and, in fact, Congress rejected a proposal that would 
25

 MR. FREDERICK:  Sure.  Justice Breyer, if

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, you 

talking about a Senate Report and now you are talking 
about proposals that weren't enacted.  Your -- your 
friend on the other side focuses on the statutory 
language which tells you how to find out how much is at 
stake. 

1  lower the amount in controversy for class actions to $2 
2  million because the congressional budget office said, if 
3  you keep it at that low, virtually every class action 
4  will be in Federal court and Congress has not 
5
6  deal with all of the class actions that would occupy 
7  this space.

13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19 
20
21
22  amount that's demanded seems to be totally meaningless. 
23  Here, we are told that the real amount is only slightly 
24  above the $5 million figure, but I don't think that 
25

MR. FREDERICK:  And I'm telling you that his 
focus on the word "claims" is insufficient because there 
are no claims by absent members until there is a civil 
action that has been filed.  And that is why if you look 
at the definition of a class action, it is a civil 
action that is filed pursuant to one of those rules. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Under your argument, the 

makes any difference.  So let's say that what was -- you 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. FREDERICK:  No, the 5 million --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  In practical terms. 
MR. FREDERICK:  Well, Justice Alito, it 

1  stipulate you are not going to get more than $5 million, 
2  but really the value of the claim is $50 million. 
 And you say that's perfectly okay.  It will 
3
4  be dealt with later when the case is -- after the case 
has been remanded to the -- to the State courts.  Isn't 
5
6  that right?  So the $5 million is just -- just means 
7  nothing.

14 
15
16 
17 
18
19  under their estimate of all of the class members in the 
20
21  $3 million.  And so --
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  But does that matter? 
22
23  We assume, I think, that the real amount is a little bit 
24  over $5 million.  Suppose the real amount is 6 million 
25

means we have to determine, and the district court has 
to determine, whether or not the 5 million has been 
satisfied on the basis of the well pleaded complaint and 
an aggregation where, as a factual matter and as a 
stipulated matter in paragraph 11 of the complaint, the 
class representative here said, this case is not worth 
more than $5 million. 

 And we know that that's true because even 

State of Arkansas, the damages only equal about 

or 7 million, 8 million, does it matter where along that

6
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But what you said then in 
7  response -- we're on the same subject, and I'm drawing 
8  the conclusion from what you say that yes, we've found a 
9  way around this.  And what we're going to do is we will 
divide our $25 million class action into six subsidiary 
10
11 
actions and proceed exactly the same merry way.  And we 
12 
do that by means of stipulation. 
13
 Now, your words in the statute do favor 
14  that, in my opinion, at the moment.  But the purpose 
15
16  to go the other way, in that you could say, given the 
17  purpose of this, the words do mean something different, 
18  and they do mean you should aggregate the real value of 
19  the real amounts that the class is likely to have. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

Now, it's capable of that reading, and the 
virtue of that reading is that it would stop what looks 
like, from what you're saying, a mechanical method of 
avoiding the purpose of the statute.  I say that 
explicitly because I really want to make it as much as 
possible that you will focus in on what's a response to

we still use that approach because the simplest is the

 That just is not responsive to his question.

But that might be a nationwide case.  It 

amount in controversy is debatable as to whether it's 
really $5 million, that's the kind of case where 
jurisdictional simplicity ought to encourage --

1  million class members, and each of them has a claim of 
2  $50,000, we know that prior to CAFA, that case was 
3  staying in State court because of this Court's Zahn 
4  rule. 
5
6  might be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in 
7  damages.  That was the kind of problem that Congress was

But we have to judge removal at the time 


MR. FREDERICK:  Not where there are 

1  stipulations can have no effect on absentees, until the 
2  Court finds at the certification stage that the 
3  stipulation was made in good faith and doesn't render 
4  the named plaintiff an inadequate representative. 
5
6  removal is made, and at that time, there is no 

7  determination of class.  So at the removal stage, the 

8  stipulation is inoperative as to the non-named class 

9  members.

14 
15

17
18  action, it has been filed by a putative class 
19  representative, that putative class representative in 
good faith, the district court found had acted in good 
20
21  faith in stipulating to a lower amount than 
22  $5 million -- and the question is should that be given 
23  legal effect, where everybody knows it will be binding 
24  if the class is certified, and it will be binding on the 
25

allegations about what the aggregated damages are about. 
That's why -- to address this in the language of the 
civil action, those absent class members haven't filed 
any lawsuit.  We don't really know what claims they 
might conceivably bring if they are were to be 
hypothesized. 

 What we do know is that there is a civil 

class representative if the class is not certified.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose this were an 

remove the case and prove that the amount is really 

1
2  individual action, and the amount is -- the amount is 
3  pled -- an individual diversity action -- and the amount 
4  that is pled is under $75,000.  The defendant still can 
5
6  higher than that because the practice of the State in 
7  question is to allow a recovery that is over $75,000. 
8  So why shouldn't the same approach apply here? 
 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, you were referring to 
9
a statute, Justice Alito, that was recently enacted, in 
10
11  which it does say that the presumption shall be that the 
12  amount pleaded in the complaint is subject to disproval. 
13  But that's reversing 200 -- well, 100-plus years of 
14  settled removal law, after the reforms of the 1870s 
created the removal jurisdiction the way it is more 
15
16  currently constructed. 
17
 And so in that interregnum between the 1870s 
18  and that statute passed just a couple of years ago, the 
19  rule was well-settled that the individual case pleading 
amount was fine.  And under St. Paul Mercury, if there 
20
21  was a stipulation that had been filed contemporaneously 
22  with the complaint or prior to removal, that that would 
23  be given legal effect.

it's possible to look behind that number. 

 But in a class action where the named 

look behind the number --

1  faith.  The district court found that -- and I don't 
2  think that's really an even arguable proposition here, 
3  where they were asserting a 40 percent attorney's fee on 
4  this -- and so really the question is, where you have an 
aggregated estimate, should that be given legal effect. 
5
6
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Wouldn't it be perverse if 
7  the rule were that in an individual action where a 
8  plaintiff is simply stipulating how much he or she is 
9  demanding -- individually -- which the person can do, 
10
11
12  Plaintiff is purporting to make a stipulation on behalf 
13  of absent class members as to whom the named plaintiff 
14  at that point has absolutely no authority, you can't 
15
16
17  might have a debate about the various virtues of that, 
18  but they were not enacted in the same piece of 
19  legislation. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

Congress had not adopted the rule that you're positing. 
Nonetheless, we do not attempt to argue that they have 
no basis for making arguments about amount of 
controversy when they remove, but it is subject to the 
rule that a binding stipulation shall be given binding 

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, as a policy matter, we

2  that is later proved to be inadequate --
3
4  you said in your brief it doesn't bind the unnamed class 
5
6
 MR. FREDERICK:  Justice Ginsburg, this is 
7  important that you and I understand each other on this 
8  point because it is binding in the civil action filed 
9  for all purposes.  So whoever is covered by that civil 
10
11 
12
 What we do not know is who will be members 
13  of that class until the certification hearing is done. 
14  Whoever ends up being covered by that civil action will 
forever be bound by that stipulation.  That is what the 
15
16  district court knows. 
17
18  I have been trying to figure out exactly what 
19  Mr. Boutrous is concerned about.  And one thing he might 
be concerned about is that, notwithstanding that the 
20
21  class has really claims for $20 million, the thing is 
22  going to be certified for $5 million, and all these 
23  absent class members are -- are being deprived of 
24  something meaningful to them. 
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask you this?  Because 

But that's something which -- you know 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

to worry about in interpreting this Federal statute. 
 The other possibility is that he might be 

1  usually, we assume that State court judges will do their 
2  jobs, will pay attention to the Constitution, will apply 
3  adequacy of representation standards that come from the 
4  due process clause.  So that seems like a strange thing 
5
6
7  worried that this stipulation won't be really as binding 
8  as you say, that in a case in which there is an adequacy 
9  of representation determination made, the class goes 
forward, and then things work out and it really looks 
10
11 
like all these absent class members are going to get --
12 
you know, badly treated. 
13
 He's going to tear this stipulation up or do 
14  something like that.  And it's going to be way down the 
15
16
17  because there are protections that are in the statute 
18  that protect both defendants and absent class members. 
19  And the protection for the absent class members is it 
that if that stipulation is insufficient to adequately 
20
21  represent their interests, the district court, the trial 
22  court and State court will not certify the class. 
23
24  certification, now it turns out that the certification 
was wrong, that in fact, these claims are worth a good 
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But this is -- he's done the 

line.  And why should we allow that to happen? 

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, for two reasons,

1  deal more.  And he says, I can't in good faith allow all 
2  these people's claims to be adjudicated for this amount 
3  of money when I know they're worth five times as much. 
 MR. FREDERICK:  And -- and as a matter of 
4
judicial estoppel, what is absolutely clear in every 
5
6  State that I am familiar with is that it follows this 
7  Court's basic formula in New Hampshire v. Maine, which 
8  looks at whether or not a change in position would 
9  prejudice the interests of the other party if the Court 
had relied on the original position of the litigant, and 
10
11  that will estop that person. 
12
 Now, it may -- it may well be that there are 
13  due process issues associated with class representative 
14  and the adequacy of a class representative is a 
15
16  because of due process concerns. 
17
18  might be worried about is that if this action is 
19  allowed to proceed, although on its face it's worth 
20
21  determination whether to settle for a particular amount 
22  or not. 
23
24  they've got to settle for whatever it is, 20 -- you

 MR. FREDERICK:  Actually, I think 


 And the point is that, for a variety of

is not worth than $5 million, the bidding starts at 5

is only going to be worth $5 million.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's going to be 
17  worth a lot more because, if you go to trial, you're 
18  going to have a judgment that they should have been 
19  giving the general contractor whatever --
20
21
22  every case.  And so that is going to be extremely 
23  valuable.  It's going to be worth a lot more -- but the 
24  downside, it's going to be a lot more than $5 million.

MR. FREDERICK:  GCOP.

And so when Congress is only addressing a 

1  Mr. Chief Justice, Congress could have drafted a statute 
2  that allowed for the removal of every State class action 
3  and dealt with that issue if it was deemed appropriate 
4  to have Federal courts decide all class actions, but 
that wasn't the statute that Congress enacted.  And 
5
6  Congress also could have expressed concerns and 
7  difficulty with this idea of having the Master of the 
8  Complaint Rule applied in the class action context, but 
9  it didn't address that either. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  difficult -- one reason, it's very difficult to 
18  speculate about Congress, what they speculate about what 
19  they would have intended.  Presumably, they may not have 
thought about the idea that there will be class actions 
20
21  worth a lot more than $5 million, but the plaintiff's 
22  lawyer will only ask for less than $5 million. 
23
24  stipulations are well known and in fact, as we quote on, 
I think it's page 5 of our brief, Congress was aware of 
25

very narrow problem of dealing with the non-aggregation 
principle so that class actions that were worth more 
than $5 million would be allowed to be removed to 
Federal court, I don't think it would be appropriate for 
the Court to try to infer a larger set of --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's very 

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, these kinds of 

44
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

members are. 

 And so here, where a good faith effort is 

1  factual stipulations.  They concede in their reply brief 
2  that it's perfectly fine for their to be a joint 
3  stipulation between the putative class representative 
4  and the defendants. 
And, yet, I would think that that would 
5
6  raise even more problems and concerns by you because 
7  that would lead to the kind of collusion between a 
8  putative class representative and the defendant without 
9  knowing what the other interests of the absent class 
10
11
12  made to quantify the aggregate claims and that good 
13  faith effort leads to the stipulation that the case will 
14  not be worth more than $5 million, the interests of 
jurisdictional simplicity, the interest of fairness to 
15
16  the class members, the interest of understanding what 
17  the civil action is all about so that the defendant is 
18  on notice about what will be claimed in this civil 
19  action are all things that should be given respect. 
20
21 
22 
23 
24 
25

has anyone thought of this -- I hate to bring up sort of 
a new idea, but somebody may have thought of it. 
Imagine we're now in the Federal district court.  And 
the Federal district court reads the statute because the 
case has just been removed.  And he says -- you know, 

JUSTICE BREYER:  What about -- what about, 

45
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

anything like that. 

 And let now me look at that stipulation. 

1  this -- this case would be worth a lot more than 5 
2  million were it not for that stipulation. 
3
4  That stipulation is a part of some, let's call it, 
"monkey business," which you will resist that, but I 
5
6  mean by that to -- to encompass the kinds of things 
7  we've been talking about, that there are going to be 
8  five similar class actions, that they're going to take 
9  the people A through K, that they're going to --
10
11
 And he says that's not under this statute 
12  the kind of stipulation that Congress meant to bar my 
13  consideration of the $5 million.  So if it's a 
14  manipulative stipulation, whatever that might be, it 
15
16  to -- beyond 5 million, but if it's not manipulative, 
17  fine.  Has there -- has there been any thought on that 
18  kind of --
 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, there are two tools 
19
that -- that we describe in our brief and that I think 
20
21  are reasonable ways that Federal courts address these 
22  matters.  One is to look at whether or not it violates 
23  Rule 11 and there are -- there's a frivolous assertion 
24  of a stipulation, which Federal district judges deal

with Rule 11 motions all the time.

court. 

 The second is the concept of good faith, 
1
2  which is what St. Paul Mercury addressed when it said 
3  that a stipulation for less than the jurisdictional 
4  amount, if made in good faith, is something that will be 
5
6
7  hypothetical would not come up on your theory because 

8  the Federal court would never get the chance to make 

9  that determination.  It would be made in the State 

10
11
 MR. FREDERICK:  No.  If I'm understanding 
12  Justice Breyer's hypothetical, it's at the amount of 
13  controversy stage and so there is litigation at that 
14  stage and the defendant presumably would bring to the 
judge's attention, I think this is being done in bad 
15
16  faith and I have these arguments for why this is 
17  deceiting -- deceitful, misleading, et cetera.

3  there might be ways of working with this notion, a 

4  little risky from your point of view, but there might be 

5
6  some -- there would be some power in the Federal 
7  district court to set aside certain stipulations which 
8  were used for manipulative purposes and what the definition 
9  of that manipulative is something that isn't clear to -- to 
10
11
12  notion that I have distilled from St. Paul Mercury and

14  addressed bad faith, which is obviously the converse of

17  would be framed.  And I think that that is as good a

it to be removed to Federal court wholly apart from the

With respect to Mr. Fredrick's suggestion 
that this stipulation is binding in this case forever 
and all-time on anybody who's in the case, his own brief 
on page 41 says, it might well be that another class 
representative might get appointed and the stipulation 
might be invalidated because it's -- it's an unfair 

cold comfort to say maybe somebody day the Court will find 
this is an inadequate class member or class 
representative.  It does not solve the problem that 
Congress sought to address.

7  reasons is speedy motion to dismiss, and a strong 
8  standard is necessary as to avoid discovery that is 
9  burdensome, that coerces settlements that don't relate 
to the merits.  So Congress knew it was bringing cases 
10
11 
into the Federal system for precisely that reason. 
12
 And on this master of complaint point, 
13  Mr. Frederick is simply incorrect on this point. 
14  St. Paul wasn't a master of the complaint case, it said 
15
16  seek.  The master of the complaint doctrine has never, 
17  ever been applied by this Court where an unappointed 
18  named plaintiff, who's not been appointed to represent 
19  people, seeks to try to alter the claims and judgments 
20
21
22  under contexts.  Where the Court has said if a plaintiff 
23  wants to bring a State claim, they can.  We are not 
24  going to force them to bring a Federal claim. 
25

the plaintiff can limit the amount that he wants to

of other people and the rights of them to recover. 

 It's usually been applied in the arising

 And this is just one aspect of that larger 

 MR. BOUTROUS:  Your Honor, on the amount in 

1  master of the complaint is inherent in every class 
2  litigation because there could be no class actions, 
3  there could be no definition of anything, of the claims, 
4  of the amount of damages, of the number of defendants, 
of the amount of time unless the plaintiff, the named 
5
6  plaintiff, had some ability to define the claim.

controversy, this Court has never held, in a class 
10
11  action or otherwise, that that's something that's 
12  subject to the well pleaded complaint rule or the master 
13  of the complaint doctrine.  The court in the Hertz case 
14  and in the McNutt case, which it cites, said the Court 
15
16
17  asking us to blow up the whole world. 
18

20
21  plaintiff can't define the clans.  Next time we are 
22  going to be back and tell you that they can't name the 
23  defendants. 
24
25

 MR. BOUTROUS:  No, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because you're saying:  Next 

time we will be back and tell you that the named 

should look past what the pleadings say. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  Then you really are

 MR. BOUTROUS:  We are asking the Court to

4  always applied, that when the complaint claims one 
amount, the defendant can bring forth proof that it's a 
5
6  larger amount, that it exceeds the amount in controversy
