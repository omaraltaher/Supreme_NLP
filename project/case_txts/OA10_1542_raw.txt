 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER 

1
 (10:19 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument 
3
4  first this morning in Case 10-1542, Holder v. Gutierrez, 
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
 Under section 1229b of Title 8, an alien who 
12  has not been a lawful permanent resident for at least 5 
13  years, or who has not continuously resided in the United 
14  States for at least 7 years following admission in any 
status, is not eligible for cancellation of removal 
15
16  under the first prong of the statute.  That is true 
17  regardless of whether the alien can show that his 
18  parents, or any other third party, for that matter, did 
19  satisfy those requirements.
20
21  appeals, has recognized a rule of imputed eligibility 
22  under section 1229b(a).  That rule is wrong for at least 
23  two reasons.  First of all, it is inconsistent with the 
24  plain text of the statute.
25

 The Ninth Circuit, alone among the courts of 

 The touchstones of eligibility under section 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

interpretation is at the very least a reasonable reading 
of the statute, if not the only reasonable reading of 
the statute. 

1  1229b(a), LPR status, admission, and residence, are all 
2  terms that are defined in the INA to refer to attributes 
3  that are individual to the alien seeking relief, 
4  attributes that cannot be satisfied by a third party.
 But even if the statute were thought to be 
5
6  ambiguous with respect to this question, the Board of 
7  Immigration Appeals has interpreted the statute to mean 
8  that the alien seeking relief must personally and 
9  actually satisfy both durational requirements.  That 
10
11 
12 
13
14  determination as a legal matter or as an exercise of its 
discretion?  As I read its opinion, it felt that it had 
15
16  to come to that conclusion as a matter of law. 
17
18
19  statute ambiguous, where has it explained its policy 
20
21
22  Sotomayor, we don't think the statute is ambiguous; and 
23  so, we don't think there's any reason to go to Chevron 
24  step two in this case.

decisions independent of its legal conclusions? 
 MS. KRUGER:  First of all, Justice 

 But if you look at the Board's decision in

1  Escobar in particular, I think the Board makes clear
 
2  that, although it thought the statutory language was
 
3  clear, it also rested its decision on other
 
4  considerations that are uniquely within the Board's
 
5
6  comports with the general policies of the statute, how 
7  it comports with the rule that the Board itself has 
8  recognized over time, that LPR status is something 
9  that's individual to a particular alien, and that the 
10
11  procedurally and substantively, satisfy the eligibility 
12  requirements. 
13
 And it also noted that the imputation rule 
14  would create significant holes in the statutory scheme. 
It would mean that an individual who may not even have 
15
16  been eligible for admission to the United States or 
17  lawful admission for permanent residence would 
18  nevertheless receive a significant benefit that goes 
19  along with that status.

22  address issues of imputation at all, does it?

2  that it's ambiguous. 
3
4  statute, as this Court has recognized, has to address 
5
6  unambiguous.  And this statute, I think, is unambiguous 
7  in that it refers to eligibility requirements that are 
8  by their nature, as defined in immigration law, 
9  individual to a specific alien.  There's --
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  Respondents relied very heavily on three court of 
17  appeals cases that had interpreted the predecessor to 
18  this statute, former section 212(c), to allow imputation 
19  of a parent's domicile to a child.  Those courts relied 
on the common law rule that a child's domicile follows 
20
21  that of his parents.  And applying that rule, they 
22  allowed children to rely on their parents' domicile in 
23  the United States to satisfy the 7-year lawful 
24  unrelinquished domicile requirement in that statute.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I guess a child doesn't 
25

 MS. KRUGER:  Right.  There -- the

 MS. KRUGER:  Under this Court's decision in 

Holyfield, the common law rule is that the child's 

1  have any domicile except the parents'; right?  Children 
2  who run away from home do not acquire new domiciles, do 
3  they? 
4
5
6  domicile is determined by that of his parents, 
7  regardless of where the child resides in fact.  When 
8  Congress repealed former section 212(c) and enacted the 
9  current cancellation of removal statute, it removed any 
reference to the word "domicile," instead replacing the 
10
11  requirement of 7 years unrelinquished domicile with two 
12  durational requirements that are at issue in this case. 
13
14  sufficient for us to say that this is -- was a clear 
indication by the Congress of an intent or purpose to 
15
16  alter the imputation rule? 
17
18  willing to presume along with Respondents that Congress 
19  would have been aware of these three court of appeals 
decisions that were issued, it should be noted, very 
20
21  late in the life of a provision that had existed in more 
22  or less the same form since the Immigration Act of 1917, 
23  then the Court also must presume that Congress was aware 
24  that the basis for those decisions was the common law 
25

definition of the term "domicile" and that Congress

decision and that the courts of appeals applied in 
interpreting former section 212(c).

10
11
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Assuming we don't accept 
12  Respondents' -- what appears to be their argument, that 
13  being an LPR is not a requirement of the statute, if we 
14  assume that being an LPR is what triggers the 
availability for the Attorney General's exercise of 
15
16  discretion, how does that -- how does the imputation 
17  rule harm the statute?  The child has lived with the 
18  parents for 5 years, whether before or after -- well, 
19  after, it wouldn't be an issue, but before the grant of 
20
21  statute? 
 I thought the idea of the statute was to 
22
23  give individuals who had ties to the United States an 
24  opportunity to stay.  If a child's been with their 
25

parents for 5, 10, 15 years, what sense does it make to 

LPR status.  How does that harm the purposes of the

 MS. KRUGER:  I think it's worth separating

4  going to get and which they've gotten?
5
6  out two different components of the cancellation of 
7  removal decision.  It is certainly true that it's an 
8  important criteria, in determining whether or not an 
9  individual is entitled as a matter of discretion to

11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  the Ninth Circuit has recognized is that it undermines 
18  the plain requirements for those threshold 
19  determinations of eligibility, conferring an important 
20
21  resident status and long-time continuous residence after 
22  admission on individuals who not only did not receive 
23  the necessary formal authorization from immigration 
24  officials at the requisite time; they may not even have 
25

cancellation of removal relief, how strong their ties 
are to the United States, what their family ties are and 
so on.  But it has never been thought that particularly 
compelling reasons for the exercise of discretion can 
overcome the plain threshold requirements for 
eligibility for the exercise of discretion under 1229b. 
 The difficulty with the imputation rule that 

benefit that goes along with long-time permanent

 I think it's also worth noting that this 

guidance makes clear that a minor receives particular 
consideration within the totality of the circumstances 
in determining whether or not prosecutorial discretion 
is something that should be exercised. 

1
2  statute is not the beginning and the end of discretion 
3  in the immigration system.  It is always true, and it is 
4  -- certainly was the case when Congress enacted the 
statute in 1996, that immigration officials have the 
5
6  discretion not to bring removal proceedings in the first 
7  place, to terminate removal proceedings once they have 
8  begun, to defer action on the execution of a removal 
9  order.  And current immigration and customs enforcement

17  they have a 6-month-old child.  All right.  What's the 
18  legal -- why doesn't the INS just take the child, ship 
19  him off?  I mean there -- is it just discretion?  Or is 
there some rule of law or regulation that prevents that

right?  There are -- you know the hypothetical. 

 I want -- one possible thing to say would be 

 MS. KRUGER:  Right.
 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  That's all you know.
 
 MS. KRUGER:  So, Congress has taken some
 

1
2
3
4  steps with respect to some subset of aliens.
 
Respondent, for example, brings up the LIFE Act, and 
5
6  that is an example of where Congress has taken a step 
7  to --
8
9  I'm saying, what in the law -- that's all you know.  All 
10
11
12  that child is -- is actually -- we are imputing that 
13  he's here for lawful permanent residence, too.  Every 
14  circuit had had some kind of imputation rule, and 
15
16  imputation rules in the immigration law.  Roughly, I 
17  have three or four cases on that.  But they're --
18  they're not exactly comparable. 
19
20
21  off to China if we don't impute? 
22
23  certainly not that we impute the admission of the -- as 
24  to child.
25

moreover there are other areas of law where I have found 

 Okay.  So, I just want to know what is it 

that prevents you from taking the child and shipping him

either imputation or nothing. 

 MS. KRUGER:  No, I think that that's 

incorrect.  There are certain provisions of law that

 Rather, the immigration system sets up a

2  Until that time, there were no efforts to remove him 
3  from the United States, and I think that that's fairly 
4  typical, but that's not because his parents' admission 
or their lawful status in the United States was imputed 
5
6  to Martinez Gutierrez, and there is no background 
7  principle in the law that would allow for such 
8  imputation of an individual formal authorization to 
9  remain in the country by immigration officials to be

13  seek to -- to petition for an immigration visa on behalf

lawful permanent residents cannot get lawful permanent 
20
21  resident status for himself at the age of 8, but that he 
22  can at the age of 15?  I mean, what commonly happens 
23  between that period that would make him ineligible --
24  eligible only when he is 15, other than just as a matter 
25

adjustment to lawful permanent resident status, but it's 

of providing all the documents?

6  I'm asking, does the passage of time, assuming two 
7  lawful resident parents, ever make it so that a child 
8  who was formerly ineligible is now eligible?  He was 
9  ineligible at 5, but he's eligible at 14?  I mean, how 
10
11
12  scenario is one in which a visa number doesn't become 
13  available until the child is -- is --

17  the queue in the immigration department? 
18
19  scenario, is -- is where the child is in the queue.  And 
I think Respondents place a great deal of emphasis on 
20
21  the amount of time it takes for visa numbers to become 
22  available for both children and spouses of lawful 
23  permanent residents, but that has been a regular and 
24  acknowledged feature of the immigration system for

 And I think that the best inference that we 

 The Congress that enacted IIRIRA in 1996 was 
1
2  well aware of the waiting times for these visa numbers. 
3  It had before it proposals for reducing the backlog, and 
4  it rejected those proposals.  It enacted in the 
cancellation of removal statute two eligibility criteria 
5
6  that do not turn on potential eligibility for receiving 
7  LPR status or admission to the United States but, 
8  instead, turn on actually having received that formal 
9  authorization from immigration officials.
10
11  can draw from the statutory language is that Congress 
12  meant what it said; it attached special significance to 
13  that formal authorization, the formal exercise of 
14  authority by immigration officials, and not simply the 
15
16
17  statute that doesn't say anything about imputation one 
18  way or the other, and you say that statute can still be 
19  unambiguous.  And that would I think be true as a 
general matter.  But now you add to that statute a 
20
21  history and a tradition and a practice in immigration 
22  law of imputation of various kinds.  One is imputation 
23  of domicile in the way we talked about, but there are 
24  other imputations that occur throughout the field of 
25

immigration law.  Some cut for the alien; some cut

4  in which the agency essentially has discretion to decide

 The reason the -- the agency has allowed for 

inadmissibility is imputed to the minor child.  So, too, 
in the context of abandonment of LPR status.  The Board 
has said --

1
2  imputation in other circumstances is with respect to 
3  certain inquiries that involve an inquiry into the 
4  alien's intent.  So, for example, the Board has allowed 
for imputation under section 1182(k), which provides for 
5
6  -- for discretionary relief from the Attorney General 
7  when an immigrant did not know or could not have known 
8  that they were inadmissible.  And the Board has said 
9  that, for those purposes, the parents' knowledge of

18
19
20
21  imputation of intent, of state of mind, to be 
22  permissible, in part for the same reason that the common 
23  law rule about domicile formed, which is that --
24
25

 MS. KRUGER:  Well, that's correct. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes. 
 MS. KRUGER:  That's correct.  But I think 
the critical point is that the agency has interpreted 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, you think that all the 

imputations that exist in immigration law are all a 

if the parents knew, the child knows, and the child 

20
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MS. KRUGER:  I think that that's -- all of 

examples in which such imputation would be permissible, 
in part because the background presumption of the 
immigration law is that those are both attributes that 
have to be individually achieved and the eligibility 
criteria have to be independently satisfied by each 
individual alien. 

1  matter of imputing intent? 
2
3  the imputations that Respondents have pointed to concern 
4  state of mind type requirements.  They don't concern 
formal authorizations by immigration officials.  The 
5
6  Board, I think, has been very consistent, certainly in 
7  the context of cancellation of removal, in not imputing 
8  the legal status of being an LPR or admission from 
9  parent to child.  And it's difficult to see any other 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  fraudulent conduct imputed to a child?  There's no 
18  intent there.  The child obviously doesn't have an 
19  intent or couldn't have an intent to commit a crime. 
20
21
22
23  holding against the immigrant, which your adversary 
24  points out is not a very favorable outlook for the 
25

agency, that it only imputes when it harms the 

So, why is that imputed by the BIA? 

 MS. KRUGER:  Well, I don't --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the state of mind 

1  immigrant.  But, putting that aside, there's no intent 
2  involved in the fraud.  It's just the commission of an 
3  act. 
4
imputation has come in, in the Board's analysis, is with 
5
6  respect to the state of mind and not with respect to the 
7  objective conduct. 
8
9  of committing an act, like a fraudulent act?
10
11  come up is in the context of knowing that the -- that 
12  the alien is not in fact admissible to the United 
13  States, is generally where it's come up.  I'm not --
14
15
16
 MS. KRUGER:  But, again, I think that the 
17  principle that the Board has applied is that, because 
18  the child is presumed not capable of forming a requisite 
19  intent, the parent's intent is imputed to the child.
20
21  critical point is, even in that context, what is being 
22  imputed is not a formal status conferred on an 
23  individual alien by immigration officials, or admission, 
24  a formal authorization to enter the country.  That is, 
again, conferred on an individual basis by immigration

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The child doesn't commit 

a fraudulent act.

almost backward. 

 MS. KRUGER:  Well, to be clear, 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  They do say --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's a little odd that the 

1  officials.  I think Respondents can identify no 
2  circumstance, no precedent, for that type of imputation, 
3  and it's one that would be inconsistent with the basic 
4  structure of the immigration system.
5
6
7  domicile is the more exacting of the two requirements, 
8  and yet the Congress allowed imputation in the domicile 
9  case but not -- not in the residence case.  It seems 
10
 MS. KRUGER:  Well, to be --
11
12
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Congress enacts a more 
13  forgiving and less exacting standard, but then takes 
14  away the imputation.
15
16  Justice Kennedy, Congress did not supply a definition of 
17  the term "domicile."  And so, the court of appeals 
18  opinions that Respondents are relying on followed the 
19  common law rule that says that a child's domicile 
20

 Two courts of appeals permitted children to

24  States even when they were not even physically present

thereafter, and simply had become an LPR outside of the 

opinions that were, again, decided very late in the life 
of former section 212(c).  But even if it had been aware 
of those decisions, it also would have been aware that 
by using defined terms in the INA that are defined in a 
way that's individual to the particular alien, it was 
eliminating any reference to the common law rule. 

1  the Ninth Circuit, for its part, applied that rule only 
2  where the alien child had been -- had entered the United 
3  States lawfully with his parents, according to the Ninth 
4  Circuit, remains lawfully in the United States 
5
6  full 7-year period. 
7
 In crafting the current cancellation of 
8  removal statute, there's no reason to believe that 
9  Congress was aware of these three court of appeals 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
 Unlike domicile, there is no rule that says 
17  that a child's LPR status follows that of his parents or 
18  that a child's admission follows that of its parents.

 MS. KRUGER:  Yes. 
21
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't see how the -- you 
22
23  can read the Lepe-Guitron -- that was one of the cases 
24  -- it seems to me clearly imputes residence as well. 
25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't see how -- were you 

finished? 

They quote the earlier case from the circuit which said 

24

earlier case, the parents had never been admitted.  He 

1  the 7 years of domicile have to come after their 
2  admission for permanent residence.  And then the dissent 
3  says, hey, what about permanent residents?  And what 
4  they say is this case is different because, in that

6  came after he was married in this case.  He's here after 
7  his parents were admitted.  Now, I grant you they didn't 
8  explicitly say this, but I don't see how they reached 
9  their conclusion without it.
 And then there's a different split in the 
10
11  circuits about the pro and con of tacking on periods, 
12  you know, before the domicile, after, et cetera.  And 
13  that seems to be what Congress resolved.

17  doesn't deal with that and deals with a slightly 
18  different thing.  Is that a fair reading, or what do you 
19  think?
 MS. KRUGER:  I don't think it is, but first 
20
21  I'd like to clarify that the Ninth Circuit had no reason 
22  to impute residence in Lepe-Guitron, in part because the 
23  alien in that case had resided in fact in the United 
24  States throughout the 7-year period.  I think

Respondents make the argument that Lepe-Guitron was in

3
4  reading of the Ninth Circuit's decision as well, and
 
that's for the following reason:  All three courts of 
5
6  appeals that Respondents rely on dealt separately with 
7  the threshold requirement under former section 212(c) 
8  that the alien be a lawful permanent resident.  None of 
9  those three courts permitted LPR status to be imputed 
from parent to child.  So, where there was an explicit 
10
11 
requirement in the statute that LPR status be obtained 
by the alien seeking relief, the courts were very clear 
12

in requiring that the alien before them independently 
satisfied that requirement.

16  acknowledged that, under circuit precedent, it had held

 Mr. Kinnaird.

22
23  applied to this specific circumstance.  And the

characterize that correctly as ambiguous.  It's just 

 MR. KINNAIRD:  I think it's ambiguous as

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, can you give any 

period of years, and he also does not control where he 

status; where the status that the parents have is 
automatically given to the child or, for that matter, 
automatically taken away from the child? 

1  that are not within the capacity or the control of a 
2  minor.  A minor does not decide whether or when a parent 
3  will apply for LPR status for him or her.  He does not 
4  control the -- the maintenance of that status over a 
5
6  resides. 
7
8  example -- the Government says you can't -- of an 
9  instance where status is imputed, not intent, but just 
10
11 
12 
13
14  status, as the Ninth Circuit found.  The reason was that 
15
16  domicile but lawful unrelinquished domicile, and, 
17  therefore, they had to reach back to the period in which 
18  the parent was an LPR --
19
20
21  place, right?  And that's -- that's an -- that's intent. 
22  That's imputing intent. 
23
24  lawfulness, which meant that the parent had to be an LPR 
for that period or at least in some lawful status.  And 
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But there -- there, you --

what they're imputing is the intent to remain in the 

 MR. KINNAIRD:  Section 212(c) imputed 

the requirement there was not just for unrelinquished 

 MR. KINNAIRD:  No, they also had to impute

JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the child would not 

1  in each of the three instances, the parents were LPRs in 
2  the times in question.  So, there definitely was a 
3  foregoing rule of imputation of status.  And I would 
4  submit that --
5
6  have been lawfully there but for the imputation of 
7  lawfulness from the parents. 
 MR. KINNAIRD:  That's right.  He -- well, he 
8
9  would not have qualified for -- for a waiver of removal.
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Kinnaird, I take it that 
10
11  the point you're making is the statute is ambiguous in 
12  the sense that its silence does not prevent the BIA from 
13  making this imputation if it wants to.  But the BIA 
14  clearly doesn't want to.  So, where does that leave you?
15
16  ambiguous, then the BIA actually has to exercise its 
17  discretion and grapple with that ambiguity.  And that is 
18  one of the fundamental problems, as Justice --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, are you saying that 
19
the BIA needs to write an opinion that says now we are 
20
21  doing Chevron step two analysis?  Is that what you're 
22  saying, that this is a matter of labeling? 
 MR. KINNAIRD:  I don't think it's a matter 
23
24  of -- of magic words, but what it has to do is actually 
25

grapple with and recognize the ambiguity, at least in 

 MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, I think if it is 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it doesn't have 

1  the alternative, and then exercise its discretion to say 
2  if this is a permissible construction of the Act and 
3  there's another permissible construction, which of the 
4  two better serves the statutory purpose.
5
6  to grapple with everything that's not there.  I mean, 
7  there are a lot of things that the statutes don't 
8  address. 
 MR. KINNAIRD:  Agreed.
9
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me that 
10
11  they don't have to grapple with everything that's there. 
12  You just have to say this doesn't address it.  So, 
13  whoever is asking for the affirmative, which is you, 
14  loses.
 MR. KINNAIRD:  I don't think --
15
16
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You're saying:  We 
17  think this law should allow -- should provide for this, 
18  should be extended for this.  And it's one thing to say, 
19  well, the statute's ambiguous; it talks about children 
in one category but not in another category; so, the 
20
21  issue's there; we don't know what they meant.  It's 
22  another thing if it's something that's totally not on 
23  the table.  I mean, if -- if you claimed that the law 
24  required every minor to get $500 a year, you wouldn't 
25

say the statute was ambiguous about that.  You'd say it 

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, that's right, Your 

1  doesn't have anything to do with it. 
2
3  Honor, but I think the ambiguity arises here because the 
4  matters in question are ones not within the capacity or 
control of the minor, and that's been the traditional 
5
6  basis on which the BIA has looked for imputation.  And 
7  when you take into account --
8
9  argument -- under your argument an alien, a child, who 
never acquired LPR status in its own right could get a 
10
11 
cancellation of removal based on the parents' status. 
12
 MR. KINNAIRD:  I don't think that's right. 
13  The Ninth Circuit did not address that, but I think the 
14  better reading of the statute, even if (a)(1) is 
15
16  an LPR in order to seek cancellation.  And then for 
17  these durational requirements and the look-back to 
18  status, there you do imputation. 
19
20
21  second is that there is a separate subsection, 
22  subsection (b), of that same statute.  I don't believe 
23  it's in the addenda provided to the courts, but it is 
24  cancellation of removal for certain nonpermanent 
25

 And the reason is twofold.  One, section 
212(c), which it replaced, was limited to LPRs.  The 

somewhat ambiguous on that point, is that you have to be 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In your -- your 

resident aliens.  And the critical distinction between

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Mr. Kinnaird, what would 

 MR. KINNAIRD:  I think if there's a 

Mexico and his parents are living in Los Angeles for 6 
years until they can afford to take him.  Is the 
parents' residence then imputed to the child so that 
when he moved to Los Angeles in year 7 he is deemed to 
have been there for 6 years?

1  the two, besides differences in criteria, is that that 
2  one authorizes adjustment of status as well as 
3  cancellation. 
4
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What would --
MR. KINNAIRD:  So, if you're not an actual 
5
6  LPR, you need to have adjustment of status to -- to not 
7  be in a legal limbo. 
8
9  happen if the child remains with the grandparents in 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  significant separation of that duration, I think there 
17  would be a question about whether you have the 
18  significant relationship between parent and child to 
19  warrant imputation.  But it is true that under former 
section 212(c), at least in two of the cases, they 
20
21  imputed residency where the child was not actually 
22  resident. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  You had an example in your 
23
24  brief, I thought -- you might -- I thought that it was 
an example of status rather than intent.  The example 
25

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. KINNAIRD:  That's right.  And the 

resettlement doesn't have any element of intent to it. 

 And I would also point out that, under 

program.  And then that seemed like a status, a 

1  that you gave -- I took that way; tell me if I'm -- is 
2  where an alien comes in and wants asylum, and then you 
3  can't get it if you were resettled in another country. 
4  And there are criteria -- country with a resettlement 
5
6  residence.  Were you resettled in the other country or 
7  were you not?  That's his status, and then that's 
8  imputed to the child. 
9
10
11  So, it's not true that everything turns upon intent. 
12
13  section (a)(1), it's not simply a requirement that there 
14  have been some grant of LPR status at some point and 
15
16  "lawfully admitted for permanent residence" includes a 
17  requirement that the status has not changed.  And that 
18  requires domiciliary intent because the BIA has 
19  interpreted that phrase to mean that you can change your 
status by intent, and in fact the Department of Homeland 
20
21  Security has defended against cancellation claims on the 
22  grounds that there was abandonment during a -- during 
23  the 5-year period.  So, if you had a child coming forth, 
24  you would have to look, in certain circumstances at 
25

passage of 5 -- of 5 years.  The statutory definition of 

least, to the parent for intent of abandonment.

who has lived here since the age of 5. 

 So, I think this is an element where there 

1
2  is direct continuity from section 212(c).  It makes 
3  eminent sense.  And even if the BIA is deemed to have 
4  exercised its discretion here, I think its rule is 
patently unreasonable, and for a number of reasons. 
5
6
 First, they're not able to advance a single 
7  policy reason that would be favorable to non-imputation. 
8  It destroys family unity, and it forecloses eligibility 
9  for relief for even people like Mr. Martinez Gutierrez, 
10
11
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There -- this Court has 
12  dealt in the constitutional context with parent-child 
13  relationships under the immigration law.  And let's take 
14  Fiallo v. Bell.  There the Court said, well, it tells us 
that for married parents it's this way, and for a child 
15
16  born out of wedlock, that relationship is something 
17  else.  That could be considered quite arbitrary when the 
18  question is, is the child left orphaned?  But the Court 
19  said, well, that's what the statute said.  It made that

prior rule. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Isn't it -- why 

1  Congress has the latitude to be -- to draw arbitrary 
2  lines.  I don't think the agency does if imputation is a 
3  permissible alternative.  I think they have to give a 
4  reasoned basis for denying imputation when it was the 
5
6
7  can't the BIA adopt or why doesn't the background 
8  principle apply that you're not entitled to admission 
9  unless you make an affirmative case for it?
 You say, well, the -- the government hasn't 
10
11  advanced any policy reason on the other side.  Why isn't 
12  that the basic policy of the government? 
13
14  look to the actual statute, and they have to give their 
own reasons, which I don't think they've done adequately 
15
16  as a matter of discretion.  But here, this is a --
17
18  it an adequate reason that they've come up with here and 
19  in their decisions that the prior word was "domicile" 
20
21  the word under the new statute is "residence" and the 
22  child's residence is not necessarily the residence of 
23  the parent?  That seems to me a perfectly valid reason. 
24
 MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, I wouldn't say that's 
Chevron step two discretion.  But I think you also have 
25

and a child's domicile is that of the parents, and that

think you can say there's no -- no rational basis given 
by the agency. 

 MR. KINNAIRD:  It's a different word, yes. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the one word demands 

1  to look to the fact that there was not only imputation 
2  of domicile; it required lawfulness.  And -- and in 
3  imputing domicile, they were also imputing residence. 
4  So, it's true the word "domicile" has --
5
6  a different word. 
7
8
9  imputation; the other doesn't.  So, I mean, I don't 
10
11 
12
13  comes in if -- if there's ambiguity and they're 
14  determining why -- if it's a permissible construction, 
15
16
17  I have is that I see the imputation as an equitable 
18  doctrine. 
19
20

the policies of the Act, to deny imputation.  And 

that the government said, the BIA said, in rendering its 

1  of issues open, like what do we do with 1229b(a)(2)? 
2  Isn't that an end run on stopping this continuous 7-year 
3  statute, or 10, whatever it is, if we're imputing a 
4  parent's residence or any of the things that you're --
5
6  decision? 
7
 I mean, you can't force a court to -- the 
8  BIA to impute.  So, what more do they have to say than 
9  we don't think it's consistent with the statute, even if 
10
11
 MR. KINNAIRD:  Well, I would say the statute 
12  has an equitable purpose which allows imputation.  I do 
13  not think there's discretion, if imputation is 
14  permissible unless there's a rational basis in serving 
15
16  discretion does come in at the second phase, which is 
17  when the Attorney General determines whether or not the 
18  -- the cancellation should be granted. 
19

22  Attorney General to deny relief.  And this is a 
23  once-in-a-lifetime remedy.  You can only apply for 
24  cancellation once in your life.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's so reasonable 

Your client is the one who has been here since 5 years 
old. 

1  children who were minors during the period, who could
 
2  not have controlled their status, could not have
 
3  controlled their residence, this is an eminently
 
4  reasonable rule that's backed by Congress.

5
6  about a child who lives with their grandparents outside 
7  the country?  Why should their parents' being in the 
8  U.S. be imputed to the benefit of that child?  I 
9  certainly understand it in your client's situation.

16  prevail under that rule, but I think the rationale is 
17  family unity; that even though there are periods of 
18  residence where there's a dysjunction, the real reason 
19  is simply the operation of quotas.  And -- and there was 
20
21  residence.  Since you still have the family ties, I 
22  think imputation is permissible there, as long as you 
23  have the significant relationship.

5
6  have to deal with the fact of lack of custody and
 
7  control.  That's been the basis for their abandonment

9  detriment of the alien where the child has no intent

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

 So far as subsection (2) of the provision 

provision that concerns me in the Sawyers case, we think 

the words that Congress used require imputation in the 
circumstances of this case. 

1
2  and may it please the Court: 
3
4  that we're talking about this morning, which is the 
5
6  that the Government's reading is simply not a sensible 
7  approach to the statute.  And in that sense, our 
8  position is not that the statute is ambiguous.  We think 
9  that the statutory context and the particular meaning of 
10
11 
12
 I'll start with the statutory background, 
13  where I think the Government understates the nature of 
14  the prevailing settled rule that it applied.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We usually like to 
15
16  start with the statutory language.  Where is this issue 
17  addressed in this statute at all? 
 MR. ROTHFELD:  Imputation as such, as has 
18
19  been said, is not directly addressed.  But the words 
20
21  the word -- particularly "continuous residence" are 
22  words that Congress would have thought carried along 
23  with it the concept of imputation.  And the reason why 
24  that is so, I think it's necessary to start with a 
25

that the -- that Congress used, the word "residence" and 

little bit of the background both of the statute and how

section 212(c), the old provision, the courts that --
5
6  courts of appeals that had addressed it had uniformly
 
7  applied an imputation rule.  The Government says it's
 
8  three courts.  Two of those courts are the Second and
 
9  Ninth Circuits, the largest immigration circuits that

have been decided up to that point. 

 The BIA itself had said, prior to the 

residence of the parent is imputed to child when the 
child is a minor.  Congress would have been aware of 
that when it used the word "residence" in 
subsection (2). 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I think there could be 
1
2  circumstances in which imputation is appropriate when --
3  when the child is in the custody of the grandparent. 
4  But I'm focusing on parents because that's how the cases 
5
6
7  enactment of this statute, in the In re Ng case that --
8  which I think is the case the Justice Breyer had 
9  referred to -- it had said in so many words the 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
you do if the parents -- the father is an LPR, the 
15
16  mother is not?  Do we then impute to the child the 
17  father's status?  The couple is not married. 
 MR. ROTHFELD:  There are rules, common law 
18
19  rules, that the courts had applied in determining whose 
residence and whose domicile would be attributed to the 
20
21  child when the parents were not -- didn't have joint 
22  custody.  When the -- if we're talking only about 
23  residence here --

 MR. ROTHFELD:  We --
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, we're talking about 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  I think that -- again, the 
1
2  courts have applied -- if we're distinguishing -- for 
3  purposes of residence -- and I'm not talking about the 
4  technical LPR status here when I'm using the term 
"residence"; I am referring simply to kind of the 
5
6  general common law concept. 
7
8  agreed that -- that LPR status would be necessary.  At 
9  least, Mr. Kinnaird said that.
10
11
12  the 5-year period and the 7-year period.  The child 
13  would have to have LPR status. 
14
 MR. ROTHFELD:  We agree ultimately, to get 
relief, the child has to have LPR status and certainly 
15
16  under subsection (1) of the provision, which is not at 
17  issue in the Sawyers case.  That concerns 5 years of LPR 
18  status.  Subsection(2), which is all that I'm concerned 
19  with in Sawyers because that's the only -- only element 
20
21  satisfy, concerns only the term "residence," not LPR as 
22  such; simply continuous residence in the United States. 
 And so, the question of would Congress have 
23
24  thought that residence, continuous residence, is 
25

of the relief provision that he was deemed not to 

imputable from parent to child -- I think it would have

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.
 MR. ROTHFELD:  That's correct.  That -- but 

1  want to hear your whole argument here.  You're saying 
2  they would have had, Congress, as a background, the Ng 
3  case where they imputed the Hong Kong residence; the 
4  fact that you were about to say, that domicile 
5
6  else? 
7
8  that --
9
10
11  I can add to that a little bit, that in the section 
12  212 cases, in which domicile was imputed, as the 
13  Government recognizes, in at least two of those cases, 
14  the child was not in the United States for a portion of 
that time; and, therefore, necessarily those courts must 
15
16  have been imputing not only domicile but residence.  And 
17  that is necessarily the case because -- residence is an 
18  element, a subset, of domicile --
19
20
21  United States before he came --
22
23  just as he was -- would have been domiciled in the 
24  United States.

7
8  that -- that specify the physical presence is equivalent 
9  to residence for particular purposes.  But as this Court

19  without being a domiciliary?
20
21  the definition, as this Court said, of -- of "domicile" 
22  is residence in a particular place accompanied by an 
23  intent to remain there indefinitely.  And so, you have 
24  to have both.  You can't be a domicile without being a 
25

held in Holyfield, as the Government recognizes in a 
domicile context, a child can be a domicile of a 
jurisdiction in which they have never set foot.  The 
legal presumption is that a child is -- takes the 
domicile of the parent, and -- and residence is a 
necessary subset, as this Court has said long ago, 
before any of these statutes were passed.  The 
definition --

 Congress would have been aware of that.  And 

1
2  when it used the term "residence," it would have been 
3  aware of that as a general proposition, and it would 
4  have been aware that in the particular context of 
section 212(c), imputation rule for relief in the 
5
6  immigration laws, that use of the term "resident" 
7  carries with it imputation. 
 I think that makes this -- so far as we're 
8
9  concerned, that makes the use of the term "continuous 
residence" in subsection (b) unambiguous and requires 
10
11 
imputation.  Congress would have been aware of this. 
There's no reason to think, the Government concedes, 
12 
13 
Congress was not trying to change the imputation rule 
when it changed the terminology from -- from "domicile" 
14 
to "resident." 
15
16
 In fact, it's sort of perverse to say that 
17  Congress had -- achieved that purpose, because it was 
18  a -- this was a liberalizing change.  The reason that 
19  Congress -- it's quite clear from the statutory 
20
21  years' unrelinquished lawful domicile in the old 212(c) 
22  to continuous residence after admission in any status in 
23  -- in subsection (b) of the new statute -- was to 
24  broaden the availability of relief.
25

background why Congress changed the language from 7 

 Congress was confronted with a split in the 

47
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

that for -- to have lawful domicile, you have to 

the BIA's view, Congress said, okay, we're going to put 
in subsection (a) of the new statute a requirement of 5 
years' LPR status. 

1  circuits on the interpretation of the old rule, as to 
2  whether or not one could achieve unrelinquished 
3  domicile -- lawful unrelinquished domicile while not in 
4  an LPR status, because the BIA had taken the position 
5
6  lawfully intend to stay here permanently; you can't do 
7  that if you're not an LPR. 
 And, therefore, Congress, confronting the 
8
9  split on circuits -- because some courts had rejected 
10
11 
12 
13
14  use the term "resided" in the ordinary sense of the 
word, they wanted to require that the alien actually 
15
16  have lived in the United States continuously for 7 
17  years, what language would they have used?  What 
18  language should they have used? 
19
20
21
 JUSTICE ALITO:  If they wanted (2) to mean 
22  that the alien must have actually -- that person must --
23  the one who committed the crime later must actually have 
24  resided in the United States continuously for 7 years --

8
9
10
11  everybody. 
12
 MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- I would think, given the 
13  context, of which imputation was the settled rule, that 
14  Congress would have had to indicate affirmatively that 
imputation was impermissible.  Just as if -- if Congress 
15
16  uses the term "domicile" as they did in the old section 
17  212(c), knowing the context in which, as a universal 
18  matter, the domicile of the parents is attributed to the 
19  child, one would expect --
20
21 
22 
23
24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:  "Domicile" is a legal term. 
You don't go around and you meet somebody and say, Where 
are you domiciled? 

 (Laughter.) 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  You might not even say, 

Where do you reside?  But it's closer to being ordinary 

49
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well -- and "reside" can have 

1  language. 
2
3  different meanings in different contexts.  There is a 
4  definition in the statute which the BIA itself has said 
does not apply to conditional uses of the term.  So, you 
5
6  know, "residence" in its plainest sense -- I mean, as 
7  this Court said in the Savorgnan case, which is where 
8  Congress derived the -- the definition which is now in 
9  the INA, that was under the plainest use of the term 
"residence."  You know, unadorned.  And that was the 
10
11 
statutory definition, which says without regard to 
12 
intent. 
13
14  it's continuous residence, as in subsection (b) of the 
statute, or permanent residence, necessarily one has to 
15
16  look at intent.  And, therefore, that statutory 
17  definition cannot apply.  The BIA itself has said that 
18  expressly in the Huang case, which we discuss in our 
19  brief, that so far as permanent residence is concerned, 
20
21  necessarily one has to look to intent. 
22
23  secondary argument here, but insofar as intent is 
24  essential for imputation, which is what the Government 
says -- the Government says the reason that the switch

continuously or permanently. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is -- is there some 

 MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- the consequences of 

1  from "domicile" to "residence" matters is because 
2  "domicile" looks to intent, and "residence" doesn't. 
3  But, in fact, continuous residence does, necessarily 
4  does, look to intent because it's the intent to remain 
5
6
7  advantage to giving parents an incentive to apply for 
8  early lawful permanent residence?  Because under your 
9  view, parents wouldn't have to bother to apply for it at

12
13  deciding in your favor.  And the other one, quite 
14  distinct, is it seems to me that there probably would

18  particular relief from removal provision.  And so,

 MR. ROTHFELD:  No, but in this particular

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MS. KRUGER:  Thank you. 
 I'd like to make three quick points --
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The -- the Respondent said 

that the BIA gave no policy reason, no policy 

 Is that correct in your view? 
 MS. KRUGER:  I don't think that that is

7
8
9  correct.  The BIA noted -- to be clear, the BIA was, I 
think, heavily influenced by what it saw as the clear 
10
11 
language of the statute, but it also noted that the 
imputation rule was inconsistent with a history of 
12 
13 
non-imputation of LPR status, an approach that treats 
LPR status as accorded to individual aliens.
14 
15
16  point that lawfulness has been attributed, not just 
17  intent, but under the prior law, lawfulness was also 
18  attributed? 
19
20
21  former section 212(c) had an explicit lawful status 
22  requirement, which is the status of being a lawful 
23  permanent resident, no court of appeals allowed 
24  imputation from parent to child.
25

 MS. KRUGER:  I think this goes back to the 
answer I was giving to Justice Breyer earlier.  Where 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you respond to the 

 Their argument is a little bit more

 I think the more straightforward way to read 
the Ninth Circuit's decision is that it was imputing the 

1  convoluted than that.  It is that because domicile, 
2  lawful unrelinquished domicile, was interpreted to mean 
3  the ability to form a lawful intent to remain 
4  permanently in the United States, and the Ninth Circuit 
said you could only form such an intent if you are a 
5
6  lawful permanent resident, that in Lepe-Guitron, the 
7  Ninth Circuit was therefore necessarily imputing LPR 
8  status from parent to child. 
9
10
11  intent to remain permanently in the United States from 
12  parent to child, based in part on the parents' 
13  establishment of a domicile, and based on the common law 
14  rule that the child's domicile follows that of his 
15
16
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, in response 
17  to Justice Kennedy's question about whether they gave a 
18  policy reason, your answer was that they, you know, 
19  followed the history.  I'm not sure that's the same as a 
20
21
 MS. KRUGER:  Well, in -- in addition to 
22  discussing the individual nature of LPR status, they 
23  also noted the consequence of the Ninth Circuit's 
24  imputation rule would be to permit a kind of end run 
25

around the substantive eligibility requirements for LPR

 I want to --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was that the case under the 

 MS. KRUGER:  Under the -- under former 

whether or not he could have received that status in 

1  status.  So, theoretically, you could have an individual 
2  minor alien who's not eligible, who's inadmissible for 
3  adjustment of status, who would nevertheless be accorded 
4  a substantial benefit of that status without regard to

important for the following reason:  When Congress

6  enacted the present cancellation of removal statute, it 
7  preserved that threshold requirement that you had to be 
8  an LPR in order to seek relief, but it added a 
9  durational requirement.  You had to have attained that 
10
11
 There's no reason to think, if there's no 
12  precedent for imputing LPR status in the first place, 
13  that there would be precedent for imputing LPR status 
14  going back 5 years.  One necessarily follows from the

16
 If I could, I'd like to address the other 
17  proposition that Respondent Sawyers makes, that courts 
18  were necessarily imputing residence as an element of 
19  domicile.  That argument relies heavily on the 1967 
20
