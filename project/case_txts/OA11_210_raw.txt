 Military honors play a vital role in 
12  inculcating and sustaining the core values of our 
13  nation's armed forces.  The military applies exacting 
14  criteria in awarding honors, and Congress has a long 
15
16  honors system. 
17
18  tradition by prohibiting knowingly false statements that 
19  one has been awarded a military honor.  It regulates a 
20

22  substantial, and, indeed, compelling governmental 
23  interest, and it chills no protected speech.

 Knowing statement.  He didn't win the Purple 
Heart.  As a reader, I can't be sure whether he did and

 Is that person -- if he's not a veteran 
8
9  having received a medal, is he liable under this Act?
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think, Your Honor, it 
10
11  would depend on whether that was -- that expression was 
12  reasonably understood by the audience as a statement of 
13  fact or as an exercise in political theater.  If it's

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'm -- I'm not sure

3  Court has said in numerous contexts, numerous contexts,

9  always in context where it is well understood that

cases, and I -- I think it's a sweeping proposition to

17  in which we contrast what is false and what is true.

GENERAL VERRILLI:  I want to respond with 
precision, Justice Kennedy, that the -- I think what 
this Court -- and Gertz is a good example -- has done is 
to draw a line, and that line -- and I think it is Gertz 
itself that contains this Court's statement that false 
statements of fact have no First Amendment value.  That

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's in the context

2  fact lacks First Amendment protection. 
3
4  of a defamation case.
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes. 
5
6
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And you want to take the 
7  Gertz case, where it's well understood that defamation 
8  is actionable, and say that as a general matter, that 
9  the government can inveigh against what's false.
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  The -- no, I'm trying to 
10
11  say something much narrower than that, Justice Kennedy, 
12  that, with respect to factually false statements, the 
13  government has the authority, if it can meet the 
14  "breathing space" principles that this Court's cases 
have articulated, along with the recognition that 
15
16  factually false statements have no intrinsic First 
17  Amendment value.  Those are substantial constraints, but 
18  they are substantial constraints that are satisfied in 
19  this case because the Stolen Valor Act regulates a very 
narrowly drawn and specific category of calculated 
20
21  factual falsehood, a verifiably false claim that an 
22  individual has won a military honor, and that's 
23  information that is within you, and only punishes speech 
24  about yourself.  So, it is speech that's uniquely within 
25

the knowledge of the individual speaker.

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Well, I do think the

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose -- suppose, 

1
2  General Verrilli, that the decorations were left out and 
3  Congress had said we don't like people saying that they 
4  were in the Marine Corps for 25 years when they never 
served for a single day in any armed force.  So, they 
5
6  have a statute just like this one, but it is directed to 
7  the false claim that one has served in the armed forces. 
8
9  something special about the decorations.
10
11  decorations matter, Justice Ginsburg.  We -- we think 
12  that that kind of a statute would be a harder case and, 
13  under the Court's "breathing space" principles, closer 
14  to the line because the category is much broader, much 
harder to define, and it would depend on the interest. 
15
16
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is it much harder to 
17  define?  I don't -- why does the broadness have anything 
18  to do with the breathing space?  I mean, I suppose your 
19  argument here is that there is harm; it's not just 
20
21  as libel is. 
22

falsehood, but it's falsehood conjoined with harm, just 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  That's -- that's exactly

example that Justice Ginsburg just gave -- in your case

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Their service is demeaned 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  And if that's the -- and 

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes, and -­
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why isn't that just 

1  there's harm to those courageous men and women who 
2  receive the decorations.  In the -- in the example that 
3  Justice Ginsburg gave, there's harm to the people who 
4  honorably served in the armed forces.
5

7  as -­
8
9  if that is the -- that's what I was trying to get to, 
10
11
12  when everybody says I served in the armed forces. 
13
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Congress -- under this 
14  Court's "breathing space" principles, Congress would 
need to articulate a substantial interest.  We think 
15
16  that would likely qualify.  We just think that's 
17  a harder case to make. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, where do you 
18
19  stop?  I mean, there are many things that people know 
about themselves that are objectively verifiable where 
20
21  Congress would have an interest in protecting.  High 
22  school diploma.  It is a crime to state that you have a 
23  high school diploma if you know that you don't.  That's 
24  something you can check pretty easily.  And Congress can 
say:  We want people to finish high school.  It's a big

Honor identified, States -­

1  thing to have a high school diploma.  So, we want to
 
2  make sure nobody goes around saying they do when they
 
3  don't.
 
4
 What about that case?

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think that that case, 
5
6  Your Honor, I think if it's an objectively verifiable 
7  fact -- it would seem more likely that a State 
8  legislature might enact a law like that.  If it were an 
9  objectively verifiable fact and the State could

11

14
15
16  to have received a diploma from a public university. 
17
18  submitting résumés.  That's -- when -- that's fraud. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I do -- if I could get 
19
20
21  it is true that in Gertz you had the particularized 
22  harm, but this Court -- the common characteristic that 
23  allowed this Court to move from defamation to 
24  false-light privacy, to intentional infliction of

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  States -- States do have 
laws, some States do have laws respecting false claims 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's -- that's for 

back to Your Honor's point about the nature of the harm, 

emotional distress in the Falwell case, then to baseless

The common characteristic that this Court's opinions 

 It is true that the harm here is different. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  They were -- they were in 

a context, though, of recognized torts, intentional 

1  lawsuits, the sham exception in Noerr-Pennington, the 
2  sham exception under the National Labor Relations Act, 
3  the common characteristic was not an analogy to the 
4  particularized harm that existed in defamation contexts. 
5
6  identify is the calculated factual falsehood. 
7
8  It's a -­
9
10
11  infliction for emotional distress.  Here it does seem to 
12  me that you can argue that this is something like a -- a 
13  trademark, a medal in which this -- the government and 
14  the armed forces have a particular interest, and we 
15
16  we'd have to do that. 
17
 But just to say that the cases you mentioned 
18  say that there's no value to false speech, I just simply 
19  cannot agree that they stand for that broad proposition. 
20
21  like intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  That -- that is true. 
22
23  And this -- this is a case in which the -- one of the 
24  harms that justifies this statute is the 
25

They do in the particular context of a recognized tort 

misappropriation of the government-conferred honor and 

could carve out a narrow exception for that.  I think

falsehood that 

particularized harms that are real.  And the kind of 

1  esteem, and that is a real harm and a significant harm. 
2  And there is also the particularized harm of the erosion 
3  of the -- of the value of the military honors confirmed 
4  -- conferred by our government; and those are 
5
6  speech that this statute regulates are a genuine threat 
7  to those harms in a way that, looking backwards, looking 
8  and anchoring this argument in the tradition of this 
9  Court's precedents, this is a type of calculated factual

12
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Harms -- General, I 
13  spent a lot of time going through the multiple cases 
14  that you cited in your brief defining the various 
15
16  impersonation of some sort or another.  And virtually in 
17  every one of them, except perhaps one, there was either 
18  an economic interest that was harmed by the 
19  impersonation, either by the face of the -- by the very 
face of the statute or by the nature of the claim, a 
20
21  dilution of a trademark by taking on someone else's 
22  valuable property rights. 
23
24  Justice Story many, many years ago said, look,

falsehoods have no value as such, but the "breathing

2  cause injury to rights that people possess, to pecuniary 
3  -- to pecuniary interests that they have, or to the 
4  reputation of others.  And almost every statute where 
we've approved a harm concept as being permissible for 
5
6  recovery has affected one of those three things. 
7
8  Justice Story's view, number one; and, number two, how 
9  does the definition of harm fit in that?  What's the 
10
11
12  points.  First, if I could just make a general point in 
13  response to Your Honor's question.  I think that one 
14  reality here is that, as I read this Court's cases, this 
15
16  when the government wants to regulate a properly defined 
17  category of calculated factual falsehood, that it has to 
18  meet strict scrutiny.  That would be a real break and a 
19  -- and a real change in the law that would subject -­

1  way. 
2
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  And that's why I want to 
3  get to -- that's why -- but I think it's relevant, Your 
4  Honor, to the point about Justice Story in the following 
way:  The -- the -- there are a series of statutes, 18 
5
6  U.S.C. 1001, 18 U.S.C. 962, the impersonating a Federal 
7  officer statute; 1001 being the false statement statute; 
8  perjury statutes.  Those are designed to protect the 
9  integrity of the government processes.  There isn't -­

16  force you to tell the truth. 
17
18
19  right.  That fits within Story's definition.
20
21  read what Justice Story is talking about, he was talking 
22  about the rights of private citizens, and what I'm 
23  saying is there is an additional category of 
24  long-recognized, well-accepted government regulation of

 And, of course, one of the reasons Congress 

books for the better part -­

2  to the Stolen Valor Act, the -- Congress -- Congress is 
3  building the Stolen Valor Act on a statute that Congress 
4  enacted in 1923 which prohibited the -- the wearing of

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Is your argument limited to

statements that a person makes about himself or herself? 
15
16
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  Yes.  It is.  That's the 
17  category that the statute regulates.  That is -- and it 
18  seems to me in a situation in which the statute is 
19  limited to factually verifiable information, the person 
is speaking about himself or herself, and the category 
20
21  of what's prescribed is clear -­
22

 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think -­
JUSTICE ALITO:  That would be protected by 

talking about calculated factual falsehood, you'd have 
to answer a question, which is, how much risk is there 
of chilling constitutionally protected speech, because 
when you're talking about somebody else -­

1  someone said falsely and knowingly that a spouse or a 
2  parent or a child was a medal recipient, that would also 
3  be covered. 
4
5
6  the First Amendment? 
7
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think that would be a 
8  -- that would be a case in which under the "breathing 
9  space" principles that this Court applies when we're 
10
11 
12 
13

17  retreating from what our cases have repeatedly said, 
18  that there is no First Amendment value in falsehood. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  And that only -- and 
19

so, you -- it may be a more difficult case.  But under 
the Court's "breathing space" principles, that's the 
question that one would have to answer. 

1  what I was trying to say in response to Justice Alito's 
2  question.  You have -­
3
4  First Amendment value in -- in falsehood.
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  You have to answer the 
5
6  question in that case of whether there was a material 
7  risk of deterring expression that's truthful because 
8  what -- who knows whether your grandfather was telling 
9  the truth when he -- when he said he won the medal.  And 
10
11 
12 
13
14
the assumption is that it's false.  That was -- and that 
15
16  it's not so hard to find out if somebody claims to have 
17  the Medal of Honor and he doesn't.  So that -- first, 
18  you answered yes, that it's only self, and now you said, 
19  no, it's -- it can be -- or at least I think you said -­
making a false statement of fact.  And the concern is -­
20
21  and I gave you the question of just in service, leaving 
22  out the -- the decorations -- other statements of fact, 
23  false statements like "I deny that the Holocaust ever 
24  occurred."  That's a statement -- a false statement of

 This is a pinpoint accuracy, a specific 

under the Court's "breathing space" analysis you 

but that's really quite different from what we have 
here. 

1
2  statute seeking to regulate that, Justice Ginsburg, 
3  would have viewpoint discrimination problems of the kind 
4  that the Court identified in R.A.V., and I think also 
5
6  would -- you'd have to look long and hard and have 
7  significant concerns about that kind of a -- a statement 
8  because it's so bound up with matters of ideological 
9  controversy that -- that you'd want to exercise care, 
10
11 
12
13  verifiable factual claim about yourself, that you've won 
14  a medal.
15
16  follow up on Justice Scalia's question because I'm not 
17  sure I understood.  The Government's position is that 
18  there is no First Amendment value in a false 
19  representation of fact, by which I understand you to 
mean not parody or something like that, but a statement 
20
21  that's intended to be understood as true.  There is no 
22  First Amendment value in that statement.  It may be 
23  protected because of the "breathing space" argument, but 
24  in whatever context, in whatever guise, there's no

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could I -- I want to

 That's -- so, our -- our position is based 
on the precise language of cases stretching back a half 

1
2  position we've taken in this case, Your Honor, and the 
3  reason we've taken it is because we read the Court's 
4  precedents, Gertz and many others, Falwell v.  Hustler, 
as saying precisely that.  In fact, Falwell goes a step 
5
6  further and says false statements of fact are 
7  affirmatively harmful to First Amendment interests 
8  because they impede the -- the search for truth. 
9
10

12  category of speech that is no part of the expression of 
13  ideas or the search for truth, and then it 
14  cites Chaplinsky -­

20
21 
 GENERAL VERRILLI:  I think that those kinds 
22
23  of statutes are going to have a lot harder time getting 
24  through the Court's "breathing space" analysis because 
25

these State statutes -- there are more of them than I 
thought that there would be -- that say no demonstrable 
falsehoods by a political candidate in a political race, 
and prohibit demonstrable falsehoods by political

8  whether you've been in military service, whether you've

13  political candidate context, those statutes are going to 
14  pose a particular risk of chill that this statute does

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I don't understand 
18  why it would be more chilling in the one case than in

military honor or not?  And a statement that is about 
yourself only, not about somebody else, and that -- and 
is supported by a quite strong particularized interest 
in ensuring the integrity of the military honors system.

13
14  that's not what the honors system is about.  The honors 
system is about identifying the attributes, the essence, 
15
16  of what we want in our service men and women:  Courage, 
17  sacrifice, love of country, willingness to put your life 
18  on the line for your comrades.  And what the medals do 
19  is say to the -- to our military this is what we care 
about.  It's what George Washington said in 1782, when 
20
21  he set up the honors system.  It's designed to

 And I -- what I think with respect to the

government to say this is a really big deal and then to 
5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, of course,

7  you're talking about defamation, trademark, perjury, all

9  principle and apply it without regard to the situation.
 MR. LIBBY:  Well, that's right, Mr. Chief 
10
11  Justice, but in all of those examples, those are 
12  examples where we have harm attached to the falsehood. 
13
14  just the impairment of governmental purposes, such as 
section 1001, which criminalizes the making of a false 
15
16  statement to any Federal agent, for Pete's sake.  How do 
17  you justify that?  Because the making of the false 
18  statement impairs a governmental investigation.  And 
19  what is being urged here is that the making of this type 
of a false statement impairs the government's ability to 
20
21  honor valorous members of the armed forces. 
22

5
6  all of these cases.  Now, almost nothing passes strict 
7  scrutiny.  Why should 1001 pass strict scrutiny?  I 
8  mean, it seems to me you're proposing a test that would 
9  invalidate all of the laws on the books regarding false 
10
11
12  we're suggesting is false statements -- false statements 
13  laws do have a history in this country.  And the Court 
14  could recognize a historical category of -- of imminent

19  these various false statement laws.
20
21  deference to Congress as to whether there is a harm to 
22  governmental purposes, or do we make it up ourselves?

4  non-expressive purposes of wearing the medals.

12  that's the case?  There's no non-expressive purpose that

5
6  right way of looking at this is you -- you determine

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Mr. Libby, let's suppose 
that I agree with Gertz that there is no constitutional 
15
16  value in a false statement of fact, and the reason why 
17  we protect some false statements of fact is to protect 
18  truthful speech. 
19
20
21  truthful speech will this statute chill? 
 MR. LIBBY:  Your Honor, it's not clear that 
22
23  it may necessarily chill any truthful speech.  I mean, 
24  it's -- we certainly concede that one typically knows 
25

nothing on the face of the statute to suggest that 
those -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, boy, I mean, that's a 
3  big concession, Mr. Libby.  Then you're saying you can 
4  only win this case if this Court decides that the Gertz 
statement was a kind of overstatement, an exaggeration, 
5
6  puffery. 
7

9  does cover -- someone could be prosecuted for engaging

read statutes to avoid a constitutional collision.  So,

16  let's assume that we are not going to cover 
17  performances, satire.  It's just a bald-faced lie. 
18  That's all that this covers.

20
21  protected unless we go back and it fits into one of the 
22  historical categories of speech that this Court has 
23  found historically is unprotected.  And bare falsity 
24  certainly has never previously been recognized by this 
25

 MR. LIBBY:  Then it's still our position 
that it's still a -- that all speech is presumptively

 MR. LIBBY:  I suppose I read the 

mean, is -- it's totally unprotected.  I understand them 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, my -­
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't understand 

1
2
3  the Government to argue that the speech at issue here is 
4  totally unprotected.  I understand them to argue -- I 
5
6  to argue that it can be limited under its "breathing 
7  space" rationale.  In other words, it's not within one 
8  of the categories of totally unprotected speech.  You do 
9  have to analyze it under the First Amendment, and you 
analyze it to determine if it chills protected speech. 
10
11
12  Government's argument differently.  As I read the 
13  Government's argument, it's that it's entitled to, at 
14  most, limited protection.  So, the Government seems to 
15
16  speech; whereas, of course, what we should be starting 
17  with is the presumption that it is fully protected 
18  speech unless this Court has previously said it's in one 
19  of these historical categories of unprotected speech.
20
21  your argument, you're saying historically we have not 
22  protected false statements that cause harm.  I think 
23  that's your argument. 
24
25

start from the presumption that it's not fully protected 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  May I -- if I understood 

 MR. LIBBY:  That's correct.  Yes, Your 

Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Assuming -­

information.  That's a different issue. 

 So, I go back to Justice Alito's question 

 But the question is how do you deal with the 

1
2  so, it's -- we do protect false statements 
3  presumptively, but the historical exception, like 
4  defamation, are those that cause harm.
5
6  because you really haven't answered his question. 
7  You've dealt with the government process cases, although 
8  I -- we could argue about whether that's protecting a 
9  process or protecting a government right to truthful 
10
11
12  intentional infliction of emotional distress?  Because 
13  damage -- we require injury, and it's defined under law 
14  what kind of injury.  So, tell me how you define harm in 
the nongovernmental situation, number one, and then tell 
15
16  me why that -- this situation doesn't fit that 
17  definition. 
18
19  intentional infliction of emotional distress, you are 
dealing with an instantaneous harm, a mental distress 
20
21  that results from the false statement.  So, there -­
22  there's imminent harm as a result of -- that results in 
23  intentional infliction of emotional distress for 
24  false-light -­
25

 MR. LIBBY:  Well, in the situation with 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, why isn't the 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  outrage that medal winners, legitimately entitled medal 
2  winners, experience in seeing fake people or hearing 
3  fake people claim a medal -- why isn't that comparable? 
 MR. LIBBY:  Well, I don't believe that fits 
4
into the same category of -- of mental distress that we 
5
6  look at in intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
7
 Certainly, people are entitled to be upset 
8  by these false claims.  I mean, I'm personally upset by 
9  these false claims.  But the fact that there is a 
certain level of upset doesn't mean that you were -­
10
11 
you're harmed in the sense of the intentional infliction 
of emotional stress tort.  And so, what we're dealing 
12 
13 
with here is simply a non-instantaneous harm. 
14
 Now, what the Government has suggested is 
that there's no harm that really results from a single 
15
16  claim, that Mr. Alvarez's falsehood did not cause harm 
17  to any individual. 
 JUSTICE ALITO:  It seems to me what you're 
18
19  -- what you're arguing is that we should determine that 
there are certain harms that are sufficient to allow the 
20
21  prohibition of a false statement and there are certain 
22  harms that are not sufficient, irrespective of what 
23  judgment Congress made about the significance of those 
24  harms.  Is that -- is that accurate?
25

 MR. LIBBY:  That's certainly part of it.  I 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1  mean, we believe that there needs to be imminent harm, 
2  that it needs to be targeted harm to an individual or 
3  to -- to government function, that it can't be the type 
4  of diffuse harm that the Government -­
JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?

7
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?  Because, after 
8  all, we're willing to protect the Olympics Committee 
9  when a false person saying he's the Olympics Committee 
might deprive the Olympics Committee of a penny, while 
10
11 
here they're saying that to win this great medal, say, 
the congressional Medal of Honor, the highest award in 
12 
13 
the military the nation can give, you're deserving of 
the most possible, grandest possible respect, and we 
14 
don't -- we don't even want you to have to think about 
15
somebody having taken that name falsely; and so, we will 
16

just criminalize it to discourage such activity that 
undermines the very thought and purpose of giving the

22  instances where we do want to protect false information. 
23  And I want you to accept that as a given because that 
24  isn't my question.

 So, I'm just saying in my mind there's real

Alderson Reporting Company 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The government is going to 

for them to be exposed.  And, in fact, that's 
what typically happens-­

1
2  right that there are very good First Amendment reasons 
3  sometimes for protecting false information, and if this 
4  also would cause serious harm, what the government is 
aiming after, are there less restrictive ways of going 
5
6  about it?  And, if so, what and why? 
7
 MR. LIBBY:  There are.  First of all, more 
8  speech.  There's time to fix the problem.  If someone 
9  tells a lie about having received an honor, there's time 
10

sanction.  You know, when there's a sanction in place, 
you think twice before you tell the lie.  But if there's 
no sanction except you might be exposed, who's going to 
expose you?  That sanction already exists, and there are 
a lot of people nonetheless who tell the lie.  You 
really expect the government to hire investigators to go 
around the country outing people who falsely claim 
military honors? 

 MR. LIBBY:  Well, what -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there anything else -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not going to happen. 
 MR. LIBBY:  Isn't that exactly what's 

1
2
3  happening right now with this law?  Because the law is 
4  on the books, the government is sending FBI agents out 
to investigate these allegations.  How do they find out 
5
6  about it?  It's because it's reported.  Individuals hear 
7  the statement, and they think it may be false.  They 
8  investigate it.  And -- and conduct their own 
9  investigations.
10
11  supposed -- that's the whole idea of more speech. 
12
13  that the threat of criminal prosecution might discourage 
14  from lying who would never be caught.  So, at least as 
to that set, exposure won't work.  So, you have a less 
15
16  restrictive alternative that helps some but not 
17  completely.  Are there others? 
 MR. LIBBY:  Well, of course if you're never 
18
19  caught, then under the Government's theory, then no one 
20
21
22  theory is that it does hurt the medal, the purpose, the 
23  objective, the honor, for people falsely to go around 
24  saying that they have this medal when they don't.  Okay?

5
6
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Or might be. 
7
 MR. LIBBY:  The military can redouble its 
8  efforts at honoring those who in fact are entitled to 
9  the awards.  There was a congressional hearing that 
suggested that the military has been a little lax in 
10
11 
identifying true heroes and awarding them medals.  So, 
12 
that could be done. 
13
 The government could publicize the names of 
14  true winners.  It could create educational programs to 
let the nation know what it takes to win these awards, 
15
16  what these awards are, who has won them.  All the heroic 
17  acts that have -­

 MR. LIBBY:  Well, Your Honor, actually, 
that's certainly something the government could do. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  How about giving a medal of

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. LIBBY:  Well, there is a significant 

medal of shame doesn't matter under your theory.

2  theory, right?  I mean, it -- I mean, it's still a 
3  sanction for telling something that you say is protected 
4  under the First Amendment, whether you get 6 months or a 
5
6
7  difference between a criminal sanction that puts someone 
8  in prison versus simply exposing them for what they are, 
9  which is a liar.  And Mr. Alvarez -- whether or not he 
in fact was sentenced to a crime, he still was exposed 
10
11 
for who he was, which was a liar. 
12
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose -- suppose the 
13  statute were amended, as has been proposed, to require 
14  an intent to obtain anything of value.
 MR. LIBBY:  That would turn the law into a 
15
16  fraud statute.  And, of course, fraud is an unprotected 
17  category of speech.  So, that certainly would be a 
18  constitutional law. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But that wouldn't -- that 
19
wouldn't reach this speaker.  Is that -- is that -- that 
20
21  wouldn't reach Alvarez because he didn't obtain anything 
22  of value.

24  not what we have here.  What we do know is that

Mr. Alvarez did not obtain a thing of value.

9  would consider that to be a great thing.  There are also 
10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it seems to me 
13  that your willingness to say that this statute is valid 
14  so long as there's some benefit to the person who lies, 
15
16
17  again, if Congress were to amend the law to require that 
18  it be done with the intent to obtain a thing of value, 
19  again, it becomes fraud.  And fraud is something that

14  he makes this statement at a debate when he's running 
for office, then you can prosecute him because getting 
15
16  the office is presumably something of value.  It 
17  presumably has some pecuniary aspect to it. 
18
19  again, it may come down to how the courts ultimately 
interpret a thing of value.  It's not clear that simply 
20
21  trying to obtain a vote from somebody is necessarily a 
22  thing of value, would be considered a thing of value.

4  telling lies about their extramarital affairs.
5
6  addition to the -- the governmental interest, Your

16  chilling effect analysis, you -- you would, I think, 
17  have a great deal of difficulty sustaining that statute. 
18  But, of course, that's not the kind of statute that we 
19  have here.  This is a targeted statute that's designed 
20
21
22  think of 10,000 instances that meet your criteria that 
23  one candidate or another could bring up in a political 
24  campaign.  And we don't know what will come up, but I 
25

can easily think of examples.  And then, if this is

1  lawful and constitutional, then you have people in
 
2  political campaigns suddenly worrying that the U.S.
 
3  attorney is going to come in and start indicting him.
 
4  Now, that's part of the chilling effect.  And you've
 
5
6  less certain. 
7
8  that's why I think the "breathing space" analysis 
9  requires before a statute gets upheld that it -- that it 
10
11
12  doesn't? 
13
14  and that's the key here.  This statute doesn't.
15
16  that you're asking us to value the speech in context. 
17  We're not talking about the effect of the speech and 
18  whether you can regulate that.  You're asking us to say, 
19  you know, the guy who says he's a college graduate in a 
political campaign, that could chill political speech.
