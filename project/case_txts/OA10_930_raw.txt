 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will now hear

 MR. HORNE:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

 I'd like to start picking up on a question 

 General Horne. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. HORNE 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3
4  argument in Case 10-930, Ryan v. Gonzales.
5
6
7
8
9  please the Court:
10
11  asked by Justice Ginsburg on the Rees case. 
12  The Rees case is pre-AEDPA.  If there is one thing that 
13  Congress had in mind when it passed AEDPA, the 
14  Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, it is 
15
16  and habeas should not result in undue delays to give 
17  effect --
18
19  AEDPA would alter the outcome of Rees?  Do you think 
20
21
22  really deal with our issue, which is competence to -- to 
23  aid counsel. 
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a different point.
 MR. HORNE:  Yes, I agree, Your Honor, but I 

that the death penalty process needs to be speeded up, 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you don't think that 

Rees would come out the other way after AEDPA? 

 MR. HORNE:  Well, I think that Rees didn't

 And then, on that point, this Court has said 

 So the sentence with, "even less," followed 
the sentence with, "not."  So it was even less than not 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Tell me how you define 

1  thought it -- it would be relevant to point out that it 
2  was pre-AEDPA. 
3
4  several times that habeas should not be used to grant 
indefinite stays.  In fact, there -- even pre-AEDPA, in 
5
6  the Barefoot case, this Court said that habeas is not a 
7  time to retry a case and even less is it a time to grant 
8  indefinite stays. 
9
10
11  that it should grant permanent stays. 
12
13  indefinite stays, meaning are you okay with the six 
14  months to a year stay, for a court to try to get someone 
15
16  which the defendant's information is necessary? 
17
18  the Ohio position.  In the -- in the American 
19  Psychiatric brief, I think it's page 10, note 20, they 
said that up to 90 percent of the cases are solved in 6 
20
21  to 9 months.  And I think that, if this Court set a 
22  standard of no more than a year for the successive 
23  stays, that would give some guidance to the courts. 
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do you deal with 
Justice Kagan's earlier question of what difference does 

back to competence, assuming that there is a claim in 

 MR. HORNE:  Yes, Your Honor.  We agree with 

4
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. HORNE:  Because I think the -- the 

consequence of AEDPA is that a balance has to be drawn 

balance between that and the -- the need to have a 

1  it make if the person's still necessary -- or the 
2  information -- potential information is still necessary, 
3  what makes it unnecessary after a year? 
4
5
6  between the fact that there has to be finality.  In 
7  fact, the -- this Court has said the purposes of AEDPA 
8  include finality, comity, federalism, and reduction of 
9  delays in death sentence cases.  There needs to be a 
10
11  competent defendant, if we can have one, in a case where 
12  the testimony is necessary. 
13
 This Court has said several times -- I was 
14  going to mention also the Heinze case, where this Court 
15
16  indefinite.  So -- so I think it would be very helpful 
17  for this Court to give a guideline to the courts and say 
18  the way to balance this is that, if they get the time in 
19  which 90 percent of the cases are -- are --
20
21 
22 
23 
24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But those cases didn't 
establish a limit on how long states needed to take to 
adjudicate claims.  They just said a district court 
should put in conditions that move things along --

thinks that -- very clearly, that stays cannot be 

 MR. HORNE:  Yes.  That's correct,

would be helpful if the Court gave some kind of a 
standard, so that there would be some guidance and 
uniformity, and so that -- so that courts did not get 
around this Court's --

1
2  defendants to press their claims within a reasonable 
3  time that required periodic updates, that required 
4  monitoring by the court, but it didn't set an artificial 
end time.  It just said you can't just do an open-ended 
5
6  stay and not give conditions to comply with.  Why should 
7  this be treated differently? 
 MR. HORNE:  Your Honor, we think it would be 
8
9  helpful -- and we agree with Ohio on this -- we think it 
10
11 
12 
13 
14
15
16
17  would be that -- that 6 to -- 6 to 9 months would be the 
18  standard, and certainly no more than a year; that it 
19  would be in months and not years, including not just the 
20
21
22
23  where a stay was appropriate.  Now, in the record-based 
24  case, no stay is appropriate.
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  In all cases? 
 MR. HORNE:  In all cases.  In all cases 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How -- how would you 

define that standard?  What standard do you suggest? 
 MR. HORNE:  The standard we would suggest

7  could arise where, in habeas, they made like a prima 
8  facie showing or a -- convinced the judge that there 
9  really is a very good chance here, or maybe even I think 
10
11  point where it's like not having a trial. 
12
13  arises?  I mean, should we leave the door open just for 
14  that possibility?
 MR. HORNE:  I think the answer to that is 
15
16  no, Your Honor, because the assumption -- once -- once 
17  the conviction has occurred, the presumptions shift.  In 
18  the criminal trial, all the presumptions are in favor of 
19  the defendant.  The case has to prove -- the state has 
20
21
22  put in the possibility that, on the basis of what's 
23  presented to me, the judge, I think I have so much

 MR. HORNE:  I would believe the time would

begin to run with the treatment because the basis for 
20
21  the 6 to 9 months was what was in the amicus brief 
22  against us by the American Psychiatric Association

11  that it -- that the prisoner's testimony is essential, 
12  then -- and that it's not a record-based case, then I

19  defendant needs to be competent in order for the lawyer 
effectively to represent him on habeas.  So under what 
20
21  circumstances do you think competency matters, so that 
22  the lawyer should not be expected to go on without a 
23  competent client?

the case.  It will often be the case for a Section 2255

new evidence and that the review is strictly limited to

counsel claim.  And in those circumstances, if he has 
something that -- if the lawyer has something that he 
wants the prisoner's assistance with or may need 
testimony from -- from the prisoner, we think the 
district court has discretion to allow a stay -- a 
limited stay to allow the prisoner to regain his

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
 Ms. Marquez. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LETICIA MARQUEZ

11
 I'd like to begin by correcting a statement 
12  by the United States.  Mr. Gonzales is not precluded by 
13  2254(d) or Pinholster.  Mr. Gonzales has identified 
14  several ineffective assistance of counsel claims that 
would be ripe for review under this Court's decision in 
15
16  Martinez and, therefore, would be available in district 
17  court.  And we would also be able to present new 
18  evidence.

21  state court record, what's your best example of a case 
22  in which, nonetheless, a stay would be appropriate; in 
23  which, nonetheless, consultation with the client was 
24  necessary for a full and fair adjudication?

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Marquez, could you tell 
me, if it were the case that somebody was limited to the

 MS. MARQUEZ:  Well, in our particular case, 

1  examples, and -- you know, I'm not doing very well, 
2  quite honestly.  So what's your best one? 
3
4  we -- we raise several claims in habeas -- in habeas 
proceedings.  We raise guilt claims, and we also raise 
5
6  sentencing claims.  And it is often the case with our 
7  clients that, at their direction, they choose not to --
8  not to pursue or do not want to pursue sentencing claims 
9  and want to only pursue guilt claims.
 So those are claims that are strictly on the 
10
11  record.  And under the ABA guidelines, the client is the 
12  ultimate decisionmaker as to where the particular 
13  representation is going.  So that is a huge, 
14  all-encompassing decision that a client needs to make as 
15
16
17  you're -- that seems like almost a due process argument, 
18  that in every single case, you have to grant a stay. 
19  You're -- you're parting from the Respondent in Carter, 
20
21
22  does -- just an example of where, if there is a client 
23  in -- in that particular situation --

presumably, can help you make those decisions.  So tell 

 MS. MARQUEZ:  Well, no, Your Honor, where it

17
 MS. MARQUEZ:  That -- that is if a client is 
18  incompetent.  I suppose, if that's -- if we were forced 
19  to do so, we would.
20
21  it -- it is unfair to prevent -- to stop everything, so 
22  that the client can tell you not to bring one of those 
23  things?  I don't know why that's unfair.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What in the record could 

 MS. MARQUEZ:  Well, as this Court held in 
1
2  Pinholster, not all Federal habeas claims fall within 
3  the scope of 2254(d).  And there are situations where we 
4  would be granted an evidentiary hearing.
 In this particular case, we have not yet 
5
6  been briefed our 2254(d) claims.  We are at the stage 
7  where we're going to brief merits claims, and in 
8  addition to that, we are going to brief evidentiary 
9  development in this case, where we would have to assert 
what -- what facts need to be developed and, also, the 
10
11 
diligence standard. 
12
13  plausibly, certainly be seen, that would suggest that 
14  your defendant has information that could be valuable? 
Assume it's not the ABA standard, but the plausibility 
15
16  standard or the certainty standard or something. 
17
 MS. MARQUEZ:  Well, there was -- there is 
18  information in the record that the trial judge and our 
19  client had an antagonistic relationship.  And there was 
comments -- the trial prosecutor was interviewed -- or 
20
21  said on the -- on the record that the judge and the 
22  defendant, Mr. Gonzales, snarled and snapped at each

16  sit down to -- with our client and say, what happened in 
17  this situation? 
18
19  this case explained why he concluded that there was no 
issue that couldn't be fairly adjudicated on the basis

22  explanation?  He looked at the case carefully, and he 
23  said, there's nothing that can't fairly be adjudicated 
24  on the record.
25

 MS. MARQUEZ:  Well, first, initially, the --

 MS. MARQUEZ:  We currently have not been 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The district judge in

before it when -- when the district court looked at the 
particular claims.  We were just asked to identify.  We 
did not put forward a -- a complete briefing on that 
issue.  And the --

1  the district court judge agreed with -- with 
2  Mr. Gonzales that there was a need for Mr. Gonzales to 
3  be competent at his habeas proceeding.  And we actually 
4  began a course of -- of a competency determination. 
And -- and that is a longer record.  Also, our client 
5
6  went into -- was treated at the state mental hospital.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If -- if we think 
19
it's necessary to set some objective limit on how long 
20
21  an inherent authority could be exercised, is there any 
22  reason to adopt any limit, other than the one that the 
23  psychiatrists have suggested, which is, I gather, most 
24  people, if they're going to, will recover competence 
25

8  for an objective standard, other than abuse of

10

12
13  would suggest that the Court look to -- to this decision 
14  in Rhines, where -- and my answer is we can look at a 
15
16  competent at the end of that year, then explore other 
17  options, such as next friend or -- or perhaps 
18  proceeding. 
19
20
21  district courts are allowed to -- to stay proceedings, 
22  so that the petitioner could -- could go back to State 
23  court and exhaust.  And in -- in that decision, the 
24  Court was specific as to guidelines for the district 
court to assert its discretion, 30-day updates, make

4  with Rhines stays.  The district courts have been able

7  the district court denied a stay.  If this is an 
8  equitable power, how can you be comfortable that the 
9  Ninth Circuit, as an appellate court, overrode the 
10
11
 MS. MARQUEZ:  We believe that the district 
12  court was -- abused its discretion, but first, did not 
13  apply the correct standard, which is essential 
14  communication.  The district court erroneously decided 
15
16  communication was not essential to the proceedings.

18  that that issue is always in the district court's hands 
19  to start with?

22  me what -- how we establish or set a standard so that 
23  appellate courts are not overriding that at whim?

 MS. MARQUEZ:  Well, that's how the cases 

are -- are being raised.  Always, there is a question of 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh, you're flipping it. 

1  Circuit essential communication standard, where you 
2  first have a finding of competency and then a 
3  determination of whether that client's communication is 
4  essential to the proceeding.
5
6  You're saying, first, you give a stay for competence. 
7  You've determined competency first and not essentiality 
8  first? 
9
10
11  competency, and then the courts are looking to whether 
12  or not there is essentiality. 
13
14  argument that the AEDPA somehow -- or AEDPA -- somehow 
forecloses any types of stays.  The Congress recognized

6
 Also, I would like to address the Court's --
7  or the government's concern as to whether or not these

15
16  length -- or the presumptive maximum length of a stay, 
17  what -- because that's the period within which there's a 
18  good chance in most cases of restoring the petitioner to 
19  competency -- at what point would that begin to run? 
Would there be any obligation to begin the treatment 
20
21  prior to the -- to the time when the motion for a stay

9  gets to a point where that incapacity forestalls that 
attorney from being able to move forward on his case, 
10
11 
then that attorney is, at that point, under a duty to 
12 
raise this claim with the district court. 
13
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, is he under duty to 
14  raise it as soon as possible, at the risk of forfeiture

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's why I'm

23  make that decision.  And yes -- I'm sorry -- if there is 
24  dilatory action on the part of the attorney, that is 
25

 (Laughter.) 
 MS. MARQUEZ:  I -- I think the ABA 

something for the district court to consider in issuing 

if he doesn't?  That's the import of the question.

4  competency determination and a stay?
 MS. MARQUEZ:  The motion in this case was 
5
6  made when we -- the stay was lifted in district court, 
7  and we were ordered to do -- to do merits briefing. 
8
9  remember the date, roughly?
10
11  February 2006. 
12
13  habeas petition filed in district court? 
14
 MS. MARQUEZ:  It was filed in July 2000.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Of 2000? 
15
16
 MS. MARQUEZ:  Yes.

18  there was no obligation to do anything between 2000 and 
19  2006?

21  communicate with the -- with Mr. Gonzales the entire 
22  time.  At that point, the case was stayed in district 
23  court for Rhines and Ring and Summerlin determinations.

experts, saying, there's something wrong with this guy, 
and sought to put together his mental health history. 

1  being unable to communicate with him, that the attorney 
2  said maybe there's a competency problem here? 
 MS. MARQUEZ:  No.  We -- we were having 
3
4  difficulty with the client the entire time, since we 
5
6  and we just thought he was a difficult client.  And 
7  after we -- we filed the amended petition, which was 
8  basically a notice pleading, the -- within a month of 
9  that, we first got in contact with mental health 
10
11 
12
13  state court, exhausting issues and raising Ring claims. 
14  In -- in that court -- because we were stayed in 
district court -- in that court, his post-conviction 
15
16  counsel raised ineffective assistance -- I'm sorry, 
17  competency issues -- and it was -- and it was an 
18  incompetency to assist in post-conviction -- stay 
19  post-conviction -- and that claim was denied.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So did -- did he 
20
21  begin treatment prior to the district court order on 
22  Federal habeas? 
 MS. MARQUEZ:  No.  It was not until the 
23
24  district court ordered -- or, actually, the district 
25

court ordered him transported back to -- or transported

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Treatment stopped because 

 MS. MARQUEZ:  Because he had back pain.  And 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, so how -- what 

 And while there, he was -- he was treated. 

then we began briefing on what the course of treatment 

1  to the state mental hospital.  And there, he was to be 
2  evaluated, to finally determine competency. 
3
4  And while he was being treated, he was starting to 
regain competency, at least to some extent.  Then 
5
6  treatment stopped. 
7
8  he -- he said there were side effects? 
9
10
11  should be, if any. 
12
13  is this 9 months or 1 year?  The amount of time he's 
14  under treatment or the amount of time from the district 
15
16
17  mental hospital for about 6 months, and he was being 
18  evaluated.  And as -- inadvertently, then, the state 
19  mental hospital began treatment.
20
21  question:  Assume we say you have to spend a reasonable 
22  time trying to get someone to competency.  And, here, 
23  there appears to have been efforts to do so.  And your 
24  client is saying, I can't be treated because the drugs 
25

make me sick.  So when does all of this end?

3  couldn't be treated.  It was just these specific drugs. 
4  And we were on a course of -- of trying to figure out 
what, if any, other regimen was available.  And we
 
5
6  believe that it is within the district court's --
7
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that time has
 
8  passed by now, hasn't it?  That that -- they stopped

10
11  transported him back to DOC, and he is not being treated 
12  currently. 
13

 MS. MARQUEZ:  No, Your Honor.  And we are --
15
16  we do not have -- he will not see us, and we do not have 
17  access to medical records because we do not have a 
18  current release.  And the district court did not grant 
19  us an order to get those records on a consistent basis. 
20
21

23  treatment could be had.  So why has it stopped?

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. HORNE 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. HORNE:  Thank you, Your Honor. 
 I -- I need to disagree with 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 
 General Horne, you have three minutes 

The standard has to be essentiality.  The witness has to 
be essential.  In fact, you heard my friend representing 
Gonzales emphasize essentiality.  And it was emphasized 
in their -- in their responsive brief, at pages 1, 2, 9, 
10, 11, 12, 21, 30, and 39.  On all of those pages, they 
said the witness' testimony must be essential. 

1  decision -- or the State has appealed the decision. 
2
3
4  remaining.
5
6
7
8
9  the Solicitor General on one point about the standard. 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  you have been arguing on two different axes.  One is how 
18  tight the standard should be to grant any stay at all, 
19  and the other is what limits there should be on how long 
20
21
22  prioritize, in terms of the state's interests in 
23  effective habeas adjudication, which is more 
24  important -- you know, cranking up the standard or 
25

making sure that there is a time limit in place? 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, could I ask you, 

a stay can be if a stay is warranted. 

 And I'm just curious, if I forced you to 

41
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 MR. HORNE:  Well, I think the first -- the 

 MR. HORNE:  The time limit is -- is crucial, 

matter of pretty clear law that is --

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, I know.  But, really, I 

prongs of the Ninth Circuit decision, which we think --

1
2  first priority is that there should be no indefinite 
3  stay.  And the second priority is that there should be 
4  no stay in a records-based case.  Those are the two 
5
6
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But ordered in that way, 
7  that, for you, the time limit is the more important? 
8
9  but I have to say no stay on a records-based case is a 
10
11
12  said, if I forced you to prioritize between the two. 
13
14
indefinite.  That would be the first priority.  But I 
15
16  think it's also clear from this Court's very definite 
17  statements in a number of cases that -- that there 
18  cannot be a stay in a records-based case.  Now --
19
20
21  counsel under our decision in Martinez. 
22
23  district judge specifically found that there is no 
24  possibility for a case of ineffective assistance of 
25

 (Laughter.) 
 MR. HORNE:  I would say it can't be 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Opposing counsel said 

that there is an exception for ineffective assistance of 

 MR. HORNE:  Your Honor, in this case, the 

counsel, that those were waived by the -- by -- when the 

42
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

claim was made and was claimed -- made a number of times 
in the State proceedings, it was clear that those were 
on-the-record comments. 

1  case was sent back to the State for additional 
2  post-conviction relief proceedings, that claim was 
3  waived.  It's in the district court's order, Appendices 
4  B and C to our -- to our petition.
5
6  that.  The Ninth Circuit argued that there was an issue 
7  as to whether there was prejudice by the judge.  But 
8  there is a very detailed analysis, again, in the 
9  district court's order, showing that every time that 
10
11 
12 
13
14  ex parte.  Those were on-the-record discussions that 
were being complained about.  And the district court 
15
16  judge found that if there was something secret, then 
17  those have been waived by -- by the petitioner because 
18  he didn't bring it up in the numerous case -- times that 
19  it came up at the State level, and he was talking only 
20
21
22  counsel. 
23
24
25

 The two cases are submitted. 
 (Whereupon, at 11:27 a.m., the case in the 

about on-the-record comments by the trial judge.
