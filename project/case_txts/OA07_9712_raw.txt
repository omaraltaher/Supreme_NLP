 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first today in Case 07-9712, Puckett v. United 
States.

 Mr. Isaacson.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LARS R. ISAACSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ISAACSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court:

 This case is framed by two major facts: 
Jimmy Puckett pled guilty and waived his fundamental 
right to trial in exchange for a promise by the 
government that they agreed he was qualified for a 
three-level reduction in his offense level; and the 
government of the United States breached this promise.

 The teachings of this Court in this 

situation are instructive.  For a plea to be valid, it 
must be voluntary and intelligent.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Isaacson, you said 
there were two facts.  Aren't there three?  Isn't it a 
fact that after the plea bargain the defendant in 
essence broke his side of the bargain by committing a 
crime while he was in jail?

 MR. ISAACSON:  No, Your Honor.  He did not

breach the plea agreement by doing that.  He --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I used to teach 

contract law and I'll tell you that would have been a 
breach of contract.  That would have been a breach on 
his part.

 Now, the government has conceded the breach 

of the plea agreement.  I don't -- I can't understand 
why they did that, but they apparently have conceded it. 
Does that mean that we have to ignore it for purposes of 
deciding what the -- what the remedy is?  Ignore the 
reality that there was a breach?  I mean, you know, 
if the government said, we will ask the court to 
sentence at the lower end because of the -- the remorse 
that the defendant has shown, and the defendant then 
demonstrates that he has no remorse by -- you know, 
suppose he comes and stabs the judge -- is the 
government really supposed to have to go before the 
judge and say, "Your Honor, this man is really 
remorseful and you should sentence him at the lower 
end"?

 It seems to me it's a basic principle of 
contract law that a party to a contract cannot take 
action which makes it impracticable for the other side 
to carry out his part of the bargain, and that's what 
your client did.  The government couldn't practicably go

in and make that argument when he had demonstrated 
himself to be an unremorseful criminal.

 MR. ISAACSON:  The government in this case 

drafted a plea agreement, and most plea agreements --
I've practiced in the Northern District of Texas quite 
often, and virtually every plea agreement has a 
provision in it that says if the defendant does some 
type of criminal activity, thus it will render it void. 
This plea agreement did not have that in it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh.
 MR. ISAACSON:  So it's different than most 

plea agreements.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you want to us make the 

inference that the impermissible or criminal activity 
was permitted by the absence of this specific clause. 
You say there is no implied condition, no implied 
covenant?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Well, I'm not -- what we are 

saying is the government needs to obey the promise in 
the plea agreement.  The promise in the plea agreement 
is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the questions so far 
indicate that one of the promises was an implied promise 
that you will keep the terms of the agreement by lawful 
behavior.  So that just -- what you say just begs the

question.

 Now, I recognize the government has conceded 
a breach, and we will probably move on from that point. 
But, as Justice Scalia indicates, it puts the case in a 
very artificial posture, it seems to me.

 MR. ISAACSON:  It is -- well, it is up to 

the judge to determine whether or not the defendant gets 
the acceptance points or not.  The bargain here was not 
that Mr. Puckett would get the points, but that the 
government would agree that he was qualified to receive 
those points.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And there is nothing 

theoretically inconsistent with the government -- you 
can feel remorse.  I mean, you're not going to do it 
again.  You going to feel remorse every time you do it, 
but that doesn't mean he didn't feel remorse from the 
crime he was pleading to.

 MR. ISAACSON:  Yes, 3E1.1.  There is a 

number of different factors that go into whether or not 
someone gets the acceptance points.  It is the judge's 
discretion to give those points and there are a number 
of different factors that go into it.  Certainly the 
termination of criminal activity is one 1 of those 
factors the court looks at, but it's not the only one.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this judge said --

and he was open in his thinking.  He said:  "Unheard to 
me that I would give acceptance of responsibility credit 
to someone that as soon as he gets sent to jail is out 
there committing another crime."

 MR. ISAACSON:  That is what Judge --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The judge did say that. 

He said it was unknown to him that judges give 
acceptance of responsibility credit to someone who in 
the interval between the plea and when he shows up in 
court for sentencing commits another crime.

 MR. ISAACSON:  That is what Judge Sanders 

did say.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Your point is not that he 
should have gotten the reduction.  Your point is that 
the government should have made the recommendation.

 MR. ISAACSON:  Well, the position --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't it?  Isn't that your 

point?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  The agreement called for 
them to make a recommendation and they didn't make it. 
In fact, they recommended the contrary.  And that's your 
gripe, right?

 MR. ISAACSON:  The plea agreement did not 

say the government had to get up there and make a

statement at sentencing that he was supposed to get his 
points.  They just agreed he was entitled to his 
acceptance points.

 There was two parts of the plea agreement. 
The first part that they agreed to was, you know, that 
he was entitled to those points; and the second part was 
that they would recommend at sentencing that he get the 
lower in the guideline range.  The first part was not --
did not say they had to get up there and say that.  They 
chose on their own to get up there and breach the plea 
agreement by saying, he's not entitled to those points.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where is that in the 

record, do you know offhand?  Where the plea agreement 
is?

 MR. ISAACSON:  It's page 54a of the Joint 

Appendix volume 1, paragraphs 8 and 9.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Thank you.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I suppose Justice 

Ginsburg's point is relevant, though, on the question of 
prejudice.  If the judge gets up there and says, I don't 
care what the government says, I am not going to give 
anybody a departure when they have committed another 
crime, then you haven't been prejudiced by the 
government's breach.

 MR. ISAACSON:  Well -- I believe he has been

prejudiced by the government's breach, because once the 
government violates the plea agreement on the first 
level, as we know under the prior precedents of this 
case, it makes the actual plea agreement void.  And 
secondly, the Santobello case clearly talks about it is 
not important the effect on the sentencing judge 
what the -- in Santobello the government breached a plea 
agreement and the judge said:  It doesn't matter the 
government breached the plea agreement; I would have 
done the same thing anyway; it makes no different.  This 
Court said specifically that's not relevant.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the judge would have 

known about what happened anyway from -- from the 
presentence investigation, wouldn't he?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Correct.
 I guess the point I am trying to make is the 
agreement here was not that Judge Sanders would give him 
acceptance points.  The fact is the government made the 
position -- and I should point out that Mr. Puckett, he 
gave up all his rights just for this slim reed of hope.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But he could have, if he 

felt that way -- I mean, there they were in the 
courtroom; all of them knew about the plea agreement 
because there had been the Rule 11 colloquy when it was 
taken, right?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And so they were all

 MR. ISAACSON:  Right, yes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So it was not a secret to

extra acceptance of responsibility credit.  And yet the 
defendant and his lawyer stand there and they don't say 
a word:  Wait a minute, judge.  They didn't object at --
there was no motion to withdraw the plea, was there?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Mr. Puckett had made a motion 
prior to the sentencing to withdraw his plea on his own. 
He basically pro se had done that.  But not --

was no plea to withdraw the plea.

 MR. ISAACSON:  During the sentencing, no, 

there was not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And so that's why we are 
-- if he had asked to withdraw the plea, then we'd have 
a different case.  But he didn't, so we are here on 
plain-error review.

 MR. ISAACSON:  Our point is that we suggest 

plain error shouldn't be applied to this case.  This 
court in Santobello said 35 years ago when the 
government breaches a plea agreement it can never stand.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But Santobello was a case 

where there was a timely objection.

 MR. ISAACSON:  That is correct, but the 

principles of whether or not when the government 
breaches a plea agreement that renders the underlying 
conviction void raises it to a different level.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Why should that be the case? 

I know plea agreements are not strictly governed by 
contract law, but there is an analogy and your whole 
argument seems to be that the government's breach 
rendered the plea agreement void.  But why would that 
so?  There was a plea agreement, voluntarily entered 
into, and then there was a breach.  So, why shouldn't 
the issue be what is the remedy for the breach?  And why

shouldn't it be governed by the plain-error rule like 
most errors that occur at trial?

 MR. ISAACSON:  I would suggest it goes to 

the very heart of whether or not he actually pled. 
Justice Ginsburg's raised a great point about what Judge 
Sanders did in this case.  He was long involved.  The 
promises in the plea agreement were talked about.  Mr. 
Puckett had every right to rely upon those promises when 
he foreclosed his right to jury trial, his right to 
present witnesses on his own behalf.  This is a 
solemn --

JUSTICE ALITO:  But you can say that in 

every case in which parties enter into a contract and 
later there is a breach.  The fact that one of the 
parties later breaches doesn't mean that there never was 
a contract.  There was an agreement that he voluntarily 
entered into at that time.  And then there was a --
subsequently there was a breach, but that doesn't mean 
that he involuntarily -- he did not voluntarily enter 
into the agreement, does it?

 MR. ISAACSON:  I would suggest this Court's 
precedent is that it has to be a knowing waiver of his 
rights, that promises that are unfulfilled or 
unfulfillable render the plea itself void.  The 
constitutional due process overtones or overpinnings of

a plea agreement as opposed to a normal contract makes 
this different.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What relief are you 

seeking now?  You didn't -- you didn't ask to withdraw 
the plea when you were before the sentencing judge.

 MR. ISAACSON:  We request -- what relief do 

I want?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Right.
 MR. ISAACSON:  Mr. Puckett would like the 
plea agreement to be set aside and be allowed to take 
this case to trial.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Which would expose him to 

a considerably greater penalty.

 MR. ISAACSON:  Potentially, yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why wouldn't it suffice to 
give your client everything that he was entitled to if 
the case were remanded to a different judge and the 
government were required to go before that judge and 
make the commitment that it undertook in the plea 
agreement?

 MR. ISAACSON:  We believe --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why wouldn't that be a 

perfectly satisfactory remedy?

 MR. ISAACSON:  We believe that the action of 

the government, again, rendered the plea agreement

itself void, without value, and he would -- Mr. 
Puckett --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you have to say that. 
But let's assume I don't agree with that.  Let's assume 
I agree with Justice Alito that his entry into it was 
voluntary and all that's happened is that one of the 
commitments on the part of one of the parties has not 
been complied with.  Why isn't it an adequate remedy for 
that problem to send it back to a new judge and have the 
government come before that judge and make the same 
commitment it was supposed to under the agreement?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Certainly that is a remedy 

some circuits have used.  Why that is not effective, we 
believe the defendant should have the right to be able 
to choose.  When it reaches this level, the plea 
agreement is void.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask essentially two 

questions.  You mentioned the fact that this is not --
this is an unusual agreement, and that some of the 
provisions were negotiated and the record shows they 
were -- they were deliberately undertaken.  It seems to 
me that this was probably a scrivener's error.  The 
normal -- most plea agreements would include a provision 
that if the defendant engaged in unlawful conduct, all 
bets are off.  And my hunch was that somebody just

forgot to put the boilerplate language in the agreement. 
Is that fair to say?  I can't imagine the government 
negotiating an agreement that doesn't include that 
clause.

 MR. ISAACSON:  I certainly can't put myself 
on the sides back then.  I think it's fair to say it's 
unusual.  The government in its breach -- sorry -- in 
its brief indicated it could have included it in there.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It did include it in the 

motion, didn't they?

 MR. ISAACSON:  It was --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Wasn't there a motion --
MR. ISAACSON:  Yes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- for credit for 

acceptance of responsibility, and had as a condition 
that the defendant be law-abiding?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Yes, that was included in the 
motion filed the next day for the additional point, that 
is correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So isn't it odd that the 

-- that these documents both meant to serve the same 
purpose, one has the provision for law-abiding conduct 
in the future and the other doesn't?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Well, one is a plea agreement 
that is entered in open court with the defendant present

with his attorney and the second is a motion filed by 
the United States attorney the day after.  So they are 
different.  Certainly they have different, I would 
suggest, importance.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But going back to my 

question, isn't it a likely explanation for the 
defendant's lawyer's failure to object that he just 
didn't realize this agreement didn't have this normal 
provision in it?

 MR. ISAACSON:  I -- I can't.  As to 

whether -- I would suggest that it is -- this is a --
normally, these are normally included in these 
agreements, I would suggest to you.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Right.
 MR. ISAACSON:  But I would suggest to you 
also that it was not included in this agreement, and 
since the government drafted it I don't think we can 
just assume it should be there.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, I understand that. 

But the other thing I wanted to ask you:  You keep using 
the term "void."  Do our cases say that any breach of a 
plea agreement renders it void rather than subject to 
some kind of other remedy?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Well, if it is -- I think the 

language of -- of Brady -- certainly a plea must stand

unless it is induced by misrepresentation, unfulfilled 
or unfulfillable promises.  Recently in the Bousley, 
case:  Statements in there can't go; not good if it's 
induced by misrepresentation; Machibroda --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  But those are cases that 
say that the remedy is setting aside the -- the guilty 
plea, but they don't characterize the -- the agreement 
as having become void, if I -- if I remember correctly.
 MR. ISAACSON:  Well, again, I am -- citing 
from Machibroda:  A guilty plea, if induced by promises 
or threats which would deprive it of a private or 
voluntary act are void.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes, but those -- that 

goes to the integrity of the guilty plea, not to whether 
or not the underlying contract became void, I think. 
Maybe I'm missing something.

 MR. ISAACSON:  Well, I -- I think what we 
are saying is once the government takes its action, it 
deprives the plea of its voluntary character.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't -- it doesn't 

retroactively render the government's promise a 
misrepresentation.  Every time a -- a party to a 
contract fails to comply with a contract, he hasn't been 
guilty of fraud.  "Misrepresentation" would mean the 
government had no intention of complying with it when --

when it entered into it, and you -- you don't assert 
that was the case, do you?

 MR. ISAACSON:  No, but I would suggest that 
Santobello again talks about the intent, whether or not 
-- in that case there were two prosecutors who didn't 
know what one -- the other one was doing, and this Court 
said that's not important; it is the integrity of the 
plea that's important and the government's breach 
thereof.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under the law of contracts 
I assume -- I haven't looked it up yet -- that you can't 
rescind for a nonmaterial breach.  A trivial breach 
doesn't always allow recision.  And isn't it trivial if 
the district court said:  You know, I don't care if the 
Attorney General of the United States and the Solicitor 
General himself both came into the court on their hands 
and knees begging me to do this.  I wouldn't do this.  I 
wouldn't give you an increase.

 MR. ISAACSON:  Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So it seems to me an 

immaterial breach, other than as to one level -- and

MR. ISAACSON:  I'm sorry -- I am missing --

what are you talking about?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There are some instances 

in which the -- the prosecution must make the 
recommendation before the district judge has the 
authority to depart downward, am I correct?

 MR. ISAACSON:  I -- I -- I am sorry.  For 

the downward departure and acceptance of responsibility, 
they are different.  For the first two points, it can be 
done in the plea agreement.  The third has to be done by 
the prosecution.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's right.  So -- so 

this -- this district judge, I take it, did not have the 
authority to go down by -- by a third without the 
recommendation?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Well, the government filed a 
motion.  I don't know if they officially had withdrawn 
it or not.  I know at sentencing they argued against it, 
so -- I am not sure if the judge had the power to or 
not.  The motion was already on file.  The government 
had already asked for that.  Now, they changed their 
mind.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Even as to the third 

level, the district judge said, you know, I will assume 
that they have made the argument.  I will assume they

have made the argument.  I wouldn't hear the -- I -- I 
wouldn't grant -- I wouldn't follow the recommendation. 
I am not going to depart downward even assuming the 
government -- it seems to me that there is -- the 
government's breach is immaterial.

 MR. ISAACSON:  Well, in terms of materiality 

of the breach, in Santobello there are those exact 
words:  The government is in a very poor position to 
talk materiality after they've breached the agreement.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My reading of Santobello 
is the same as yours on that point, and it's difficult 
for me to understand.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There was part of this 
agreement that was honored.  In fact, the judge after 
having said that, I never heard of giving credit for 
responsibility to somebody who commits a crime in the 
interim, but he said:  I understand there was an 
agreement to sentence at the low end, and that's what 
I'm going to do.

 MR. ISAACSON:  That's correct.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So if you say what you 
want is a trial, the defendant would be exposed to not 
just the upper level; plus weren't there add-ones in 
this case that the judge ordered to be served 
concurrently rather than consecutively?

MR. ISAACSON:  Yes, there were three 

underlying Federal charges that he was on supervisory 
release for that the judge ran concurrently with the 
sentence in this case.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What would counsel say about 
a case in which it's unclear whether there is a breach? 
There is a factual dispute as to whether there was a 
breach.  Let's say the government agrees that it will 
reserve the right to call all relevant facts to the 
attention of the sentencing judge, but won't take a 
position on sentencing.  And the prosecutor in 
sentencing makes certain remarks that might be 
interpreted as taking a position or might be interpreted 
as simply calling facts to the judge's attention.
 Would it be your position that when a 

defendant hears that, the defendant can sit back and 
wait and see whether he or she is satisfied with the 
sentence and then after this sentence is imposed raise 
the issue of breach on appeal and not be subject to 
plain error, rather than calling it to the attention of 
the sentencing judge at the time when the -- the 
potential breach could be adjudicated?

 MR. ISAACSON:  I think there are two parts 
to your question, Your Honor, if I could address them. 
In regard to a de minimus breach of the plea agreement,

we recognize that technical defects in a plea agreement 
may not always require automatic reversal.  However, the 
government must always fulfill completely the promises 
they have made in the agreement.  And that goes to the 
difference between a -- a plea agreement is being 
different than a normal contract.

 In a normal contract, you think of a -- an 
Exxon merging with Mobil, things of that nature.  This 
is a situation where the government's -- the obligations 
in the plea agreement for the vast majority are on the 
defendant, what he has to do.  He gives up his rights. 
He must cooperate, things of that nature.  As on page 
51a shows, the government's agreements are extremely 
small.  There's only two paragraphs.  And that's 
normally how it is.  Our position is if the government 
breaches its promises, that's when it must be reversed.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm not sure that really 

answers my question.

 MR. ISAACSON:  Well --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you saying as to some 
errors there is a plain-error rule, in some breaches 
there is a plain-error rule, but not as to all breaches?
 MR. ISAACSON:  No.  I'm -- what I'm saying 
is the threshold of whether there is a breach or not --
the question has been posed of whether or not every

single breach is automatic reversal.

 We -- we recognize that there may be some 

that have absolutely no basis or do not really imply or 
go into what the government promised to do.  Because the 
government's promises as a part of the plea agreement, 
again, are just two paragraphs of this case.  Our 
suggestion is when the government breaches what they 
promised to do, that's when the automatic reversal --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you are saying, if -- if 

I understand you correctly, that even if at the trial 
your client's lawyer had objected and had -- and had 
said, Your Honor, the government promised to recommend, 
you know, a lower thing, what the trial judge would have 
to have said was, the plea agreement is invalid.  And 
the trial judge could not say, oh, yes, the government 
has to make that recommendation.

 You are -- you are saying it is invalidated 
by the mere fact of the government's not having done it, 
right?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  So no objection need to be 

made or can be made, right?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Well, certainly, we -- we'd 

never suggest --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wow.

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. ISAACSON:  Well, Your Honor, it -- it 

seems harsh and perhaps it is harsh, but the government 
has to abide by the contracts they make.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, but I take it -- you 
never really answered Justice Alito's question.  I take 
it that the defendant and his counsel can knowingly 
recognize that an error is being committed, say nothing, 
listen to the sentence, and then object later.  That's 
your position, yes or no?

 MR. ISAACSON:  For it to be reversible, yes.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's inconsistent 

with the answer you gave me.

 MR. ISAACSON:  I'm sorry.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The answer you gave me is 

that automatically the guilty plea is washed out --
automatically.

 MR. ISAACSON:  We -- if the government 

breaches the plea agreement, yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It is automatically washed 

out?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Well, I would suggest --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And, therefore, he 

cannot -- he cannot sit around and wait to see what 
happens.  What happens is -- whatever happens, it's

have a new trial.

 MR. ISAACSON:  I would suggest that the word 

"void" may also be "voidable."

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Voidable -- then your 

answer to me would be different.  It's -- it's not void. 
It's voidable, so that he can play dog in the manger and 
wait and see what happens, and then if it's in interest 
that -- in his interest to void it, he does.  If it's in 
his interest not to void it, he doesn't.

 MR. ISAACSON:  Your Honor, these are not 
easy issues.  Certainly, defense attorneys should not 
ever sit on his hands and let these things go.  To take 
a chance and to just say, oh, we are going to do nothing 
and just sandbag, like is suggested by the government, 
I'm suggesting that is never going to occur.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It would not be 
cost-free for you, because if you just sit there and 
say, you know, the agreement is void, the government is 
going to say, well, fine, I will see you in court; and 
we will have a trial; and you are going to get twice as 
much as you would have gotten anyway.

 You have some interest, since you entered 

the guilty plea, in going forward with the plea.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but let's put 

it this way.  Maybe this is the same question anyway. 
Let's say it is the same facts as we have here but 
instead of saying, I can't do this, the judge says, I'm 
going to do this.  And, look, I think you are 
remorseful.  I'm going to give you three points.  And 
that's all you agreed with the government.  The 
government says we'll recommend it, and the judge says, 
well, you're going to get it anyway.  I think you should 
get it.  The agreement has still been breached, right? 
The government didn't recommend.

 MR. ISAACSON:  It has been breached.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So in that 

situation, you think you can withdraw the agreement?

 MR. ISAACSON:  I would suggest that it would 

be at the defendant's option to do so.  The point that 
I'm trying to make --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  But why -- why should the 
defendant have the option to withdraw from an agreement 
when he got everything under the best possible 
circumstances that he could have expected?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Because the government --

well, we don't know that, what the sentence would have 
been by the sentencing judge.

JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but we are talking 

about the Chief Justice's hypothetical at this point. 
And they -- in his hypothetical, the sentencing judge 
says, I'm going to give you the three points; you are 
going to get everything that on the rosiest scenario you 
could have hoped for.

 Why should he be able to withdraw his plea 

at that point?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Because the jurisprudence 

teaches that the result of the effect on the sentencing 
judge is simply irrelevant.  If the government breach --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  In other words, your 

position is -- is kind of a theoretical formalistic 
position, that -- I'm not sure if this is the wrong 
words here -- there is a metaphysical quality to the 
plea, and even though things turn out as well to him as 
he could possibly have expected had the agreement been 
kept punctiliously, if the government simply omits the 
words he can walk away from the plea?  I mean, that's 
your position?

 MR. ISAACSON:  I believe so, yes.  But there 

is a reason for it.  This Court has stated the 
government cannot breach the plea agreement.  That's all 
we're saying.  The power the government has in reducing 
the plea, the rights the defendants are giving up, it

should be at the option of the defendant to decide.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Yes, but usually -- I mean, 
the theory of relief in contract law depends upon relief 
from something.  And if, in fact, there is -- there is 
no discernible damage that has been suffered, if on the 
other hand -- again, taking the Chief's hypothetical --
there is an affirmative demonstration that no damage 
occurred, normal principles of contract would say there 
is nothing to give him relief from.  The law of contract 
is -- is not a metaphysical construct.  Why should the 
law of plea agreements be?

 MR. ISAACSON:  I -- I'm not suggesting it 

would be metaphysical.  I'm simply suggesting --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, I think you are.  I 
mean, you are saying even though he has come out with, 
you know, a rose in his mouth, he can still, if he is 
crazy enough, throw away the whole plea agreement.

 MR. ISAACSON:  I think that suggests that 

the result on the judge has to do with the breach, what 
the government does.  The concept is, if the government 
breaches the plea agreement, the defendants should have 
the right to withdraw from the plea even if there is no 
effect on the sentence.

think what we are all trying to get at -- is in order to

have a rule, an absolute rule like yours, we usually 
look for a good reason to have that rule.  And since we 
are talking about an agreement, the place to look for 
the good reason is in the consequences to the defendant. 
And when the consequences are terrific, when they are 
the best that he could possibly have hoped for, there 
doesn't seem to be a good reason to adopt your very 
theoretical construct of agreement.

 Is there some reason that we are just not 

seeing?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Because it doesn't occur.  I 

mean, the government could not cite a single case in 
which this --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Never mind what the 

government can cite.  I'm asking you if there is a good 
reason to adopt this absolute rule of yours.

 MR. ISAACSON:  There is an absolute -- the 

good reason is the defendant should get the promises the 
government has elicited for his giving up of his 
fundamental constitutional rights.  99.9 percent of the 
time that's going to be adverse to the defendant, as it 
was in this case.

 A possibly hypothetical situation where the 

judge would forego or ignore what the United States 
attorney says and give him acceptance points is so rare,

JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask this kind of 

conceptual question?  Is it your view that a breach of a 
plea agreement can never be concluded to be harmless 
error?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Harmless error?  Yes, I -- if 

it -- well, harmless error if you are talking about 
structural error, I mean it's a little different 
analysis.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  I'm trying to get rid of 
the labels like "plain error" and "structural."  But if 
in fact it's totally harmless and everybody agrees it's 
harmless, would the government still have to -- or would 
there be an adverse consequence nevertheless?
 MR. ISAACSON:  Yes, I believe so.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  So, there could never be 

harmless error, harmless breach of a plea agreement?

 MR. ISAACSON:  Yes, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why wouldn't someone read 

what happened here as the defendant saying, well, I 
didn't get the acceptance credit, but the judge is still

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA H. SCHERTLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 When the government breaches a plea 

agreement, an objection made in the district court 
serves important purposes that relate to the functioning 
of Federal courts.  It permits the district court and 
the parties to determine whether a breach has occurred, 
and it also, in many cases, may permit an immediate cure 
of that breach to be administered, obviating the need 
for appellate review of the issue altogether.

A central purpose of the contemporaneous 
objection rule is to ensure that the district court 
proceedings are as free of error as possible.  And that 
purpose is served in this context, the plea breach 
context, as it is in others.

 Rule 52(b) reinforces the contemporaneous 

objection rule by placing a heavier burden on the party 
who does not object in the district court to win relief 
on appeal.

 The government's submission to the court 
today is that the plain-error standard does apply to 
forfeited claims that a plea agreement has been 
breached, that the Olano framework should be followed, 
and that one component of the plain-error showing in 
this context should require a defendant who did not 
object to a breach in the district court to show a 
reasonable probability that the outcome of the 
proceeding was affected by the breach.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just to explore the issue 

of breach for a moment, suppose hypothetically, same 
facts here, but it is all vented and discussed and aired 
and objected to in the district court.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Yes, Your Honor.

the government says, well, Your Honor, well, he 
committed another crime.  And then the judge says -- and 
we are not going to move for the recommendation.  And 
the judge says:  I will assume that you made the 
recommendation, and I will just tell you right now I 
wouldn't take the recommendation anyway.  I'm not 
going -- I wouldn't give a lowered sentence even if you 
made the objection.  What result?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well, I think the result 

there is controlled by Santobello.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it?  Because in 

Santobello there was no reason given for the prosecutor 
to violate the plea agreement.  Here there's a good 
reason.  Can you distinguish Santobello on that basis?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  I would -- I would -- I 

would seek to distinguish Santobello.  As we say in our 
brief, there seemed to have been multiple problems going 
on in Santobello.  And in -- and it was unclear that the 
district court in Santobello even knew what the terms of 
the agreement were.

 This court -- a court in that situation 

would have been aware -- would have sorted through what 
the terms of the agreement were.  Now -- and -- and, we 
don't believe that there is a reason not to apply 
harmless error review in this context as there is in any

other context.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Excuse me, were you --

Justice Kennedy, were you through?  I'm sorry, I thought 
you started a question again.

 The problem I have with the harmless error 
suggestion that you've made is this.  If the government 
does engage in some breach of the agreement, it seems to 
me the consequence is that an individual has given up a 
trial and as a consequence of that has given up liberty, 
without either the trial that he is entitled to or 
fulfillment of the conditions for giving up the liberty.
 And isn't there -- isn't there a very high 

value to be placed on the fact that nobody in the United 
States under the constitutional guarantees should be --
should be sitting behind bars without either a 
conviction following full trial, invocation of whatever 
rights he wants to invoke, or a voluntary agreement to 
be behind bars?  And -- and when neither of those 
conditions is fulfilled, don't we have an error that as 
a matter of constitutional law cannot be regarded as 
harmless.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well, there -- certainly I 

agree, Justice Souter, that -- and although there is 
distinguishable facts in Santobello, that that theme is 
present in Santobello as well.  And the Court there said

that it was not -- at the very least, the Court said 
when the government has not fulfilled its promise and an 
objection is raised and the defendant has suffered an 
adverse consequence that was somehow related to the 
government's broken promise, that the Court is not going 
to find harmlessness simply based on the district 
court's statement itself that it didn't rely on what the 
government had said.

 Now, we would submit, however, that there 
could be cases -- and the Chief Justice's hypothetical 
would have one of those -- where even in a setting where 
an objection is raised, if the defendant receives the 
benefit that was the aim of the promise he secured from 
the government -- for instance, if in Santobello the 
defendant there received the lowest possible sentence 
that he might have gotten -- that in that circumstance, 
Santobello should not preclude harmless error review, 
and the defendant cannot be said to have -- to be in 
jail having not received the benefit.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  I -- I think I would agree 
with you there because, by whatever means, the defendant 
has gotten everything the defendant bargained for.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Yes, Justice Souter.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  It may have come by a more 

circuitous route, but he got it all.

MS. SCHERTLER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But in the case when, 

unlike the Chief Justice's hypothetical, when we don't 
know that, when we -- the judge sort of keeps his 
thoughts to himself or herself, then don't we have the 
-- the problem of the -- the individual behind bars, 
neither as a result of trial nor as a result of the deal 
that he made?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  I agree that is -- that is 
the strong suggestion of Santobello when there has been 
an objection made.  We would -- we would submit to the 
Court that the analysis must differ when no objection is 
made in the district court.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Doesn't -- whether we 

accept that proposition or not that the analysis must 
differ, doesn't that really depend on -- on what value 
we place on the importance of the proposition that I 
started with?  If somebody's behind bars, it's either as 
a result of a valid conviction after trial or a 
voluntary agreement that says, yeah, I will stay there. 
And if -- if we place a very high value on the liberty 
interest -- in -- in retaining liberty except under 
those two conditions, then isn't it fair to us -- isn't 
it sensible for us to say even in a plain-error 
situation, we are going to recognize this -- this kind

of prejudice, despite the fact that he didn't object? 
If we place a high value on the liberty interest, we 
wouldn't accept your position; isn't that fair?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  The high value that the 

Court placed on the liberty interest in that situation 
would also have to be to the exclusion of other very 
important interests that are served by making sure that 
objections are raised in the district court.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  You are right, there is no 

question about it.  If -- we are saying we will take 
a -- a less efficient process, a process less efficient 
perhaps even for getting at the truth, because we think 
the liberty interest is that important.  You are 
entirely right.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  I -- and -- but I also would 
add on to that that I don't think it is only efficiency, 
that that is the sole interest that would be sacrificed 
by an -- by an absolutist approach, really, that Your 
Honor has suggested.  There also would be interests, 
fairness interests, that would be compromised by that 
rule, because just a rule that --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Will you give me an 

example?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Yes, yes.  The rule that 

Petitioner proposes, for example, is that when a

government breach occurs, one need not object in the 
district court, one may raise it on direct appeal and 
one automatically gets to elect to withdraw the plea. 
That would create incentives on the part of defendants 
to -- to withhold objections.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  No -- no question, but it 

seems to me that the answer to that is, it's an 
incentive that would never come into play if the 
government kept its word.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  So why -- why should -- why 

is the government really in a position to object to 
that?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Because this Court has 

the -- what it permits is manipulation of the system by 
-- by counsel, really.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  You're talking about 
manipulation of the system.  I just wonder if the 
government wasn't manipulating the system when they said 
we should grant cert in this case.  You did -- you did 
agree that the cert should be granted.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Oh, we did acquiesce, yes. 

Yes, Justice Stevens.

objection would always be controlling?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  The --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  For example, in this 

particular case, it seems to me that if the -- if you 
had an objection and if the judge had agreed with the 
objection and said I will set aside the plea because of 
adopting the arguments of your opponent, I think the 
government would have appealed, and said that that 
decision is so wrong and it's because it's really 
harmless error.  I think here the real question is 
whether there's harmless error available, rather than 
turning anything on whether or not an objection was made 
in the district court.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well, but this -- this is 

the question on which the circuits had divided, and 
which is why we acquiesced in this case to sort through 
that question.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But in talking about the 
division of the circuits, do you think all breaches of 
-- of plea agreements should be governed by precisely 
the same standard?  Or do you think there are varying 
facts in different cases?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well, I think that the 

analysis of a breach in each case will differ and it 
first and it will in the -- first and foremost depend

upon what the standard of appellate review is and 
whether an objection has preserved, in which case it 
would be the government's burden to show that a breach 
is harmless, or in the plain-error sentencings the --
the burdens are reversed; and we think the -- the 
ordinary rules codified in rule 52(a) and (b) apply in 
this context equally.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's clear, isn't 

it, that the defendant in this case was in fact 
prejudiced?  The judge -- Judge Sanders said it's very 
rare, he said, that you would depart -- or I 
forget whether it's depart or --

MS. SCHERTLER:  So rare as to be unknown.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So rare -- I thought 

he said "rare to unknown," "to be unknown" -- you are 
right.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Yes.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I suspect it's 

probably rarer still for the government to recommend 
that.  So you can't really say that he wouldn't have 
done this or he certainly wouldn't have considered it. 
It's one thing to say I've never heard of that.  It's 
another thing when one of your colleagues is there 
saying, this is what you should do.

that immediate point.  Which is -- my response would be, 
yes, if the government were to recommend that he 
received acceptance of responsibility in this situation, 
that may be considered significant; but the district 
court judge would also know that it was in fulfillment 
of a promise that was made before renewed criminal 
activity occurred from jail.  And so, given that 
circumstance --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, but none of us 

can know what the judge would have done.  I mean, we 
have had cases here where the government's 
recommendation of downward departures has been pretty 
surprising to me as well, and it's because they were 
informants or whatever and they have engaged in some 
pretty bad conduct; and I don't know what Judge Sanders 
would have done.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  And here under the plain 

error standard it was the defendant's burden to show a 
reasonable probability that something different would 
have happened.  The court of appeals made findings on 
this record that the record showed that nothing 
different would have happened, even had the government 
complied with its promise.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Looking at this, why can't 
we say the following?  Some circuits have said that they

will never recognize plain error, when it's a breach of 
a plea agreement.  That's wrong.  It could be plain 
error like any other kind of a case, every other kind of 
issue.  Sure.  But the error here isn't plain.  On the 
one hand, all they did, the promise was the government 
agreed to request that his sentence be placed at the 
lowest end, and they followed it.  In the other part 
they made no promise.  They simply agreed that he had 
demonstrated acceptance of responsibility.  And then 
what they did at the trial, they said, "we don't want 
him to get acceptance of responsibility at this point."

 Now, some people could argue that here is an 
implicit promise in paragraph 1, not to say something at 
the trial that is contrary to their recognition in 
paragraph 8.  That's where it is.  On the other hand, 
you could argue that there is implicit, also, a promise 
not to implicitly do the first implicit, if what he has 
done in the meantime is commit another serious crime.

 So we have two arguments, one of which says 
they committed error, and one of which says they didn't 
commit error; and the argument turns on two implicit 
readings of paragraph 8.  Therefore, it is not plain. 
End of case.  What's wrong with that?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well, the -- the government 

has conceded, and I don't --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, I mean, the 

government would like a whole lot of questions answered. 
So what I don't see is how the government can come here 
because they want a lot of questions answered, and get 
us to take the case, which I'm not sure was a wonderful 
idea; maybe it was.  But then we take the case, and now 
they want us to say, no, no, don't take the obvious 
response to it because we would like you to answer five 
other questions.

 So what I want to know is, what's wrong with 

what I said?  Is that a possible outcome?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  That is a possible outcome, 
Justice Breyer, and clarification for -- from this Court 
that the plain-error standard does apply to this type of 
error as it does to others would certainly help to 
resolve the conflict that does exist out there in the 
courts of appeal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I may have gotten 

lost in the dialogue.  As you understand it, 
Justice Breyer's suggestion was that you win, right? 
You get plain error, and then sometimes you apply it and 
it comes out one way, and sometimes you apply it the 
other.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Yes.  Yes, Chief Justice.

go along that.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Yes.  The -- it does not 

give the courts all of the guidance that would be 
helpful as to how to apply other components of the 
plain-error standard in this context.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that's a big 

difference, right?  As you said earlier, harmless error, 
the government has the burden; plain error, the 
defendant has the burden.  That's certainly going to 
change how you approach however many different factual 
contexts.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well, yes, Mr. Chief 

Justice.  I mean, what -- the reason that this case 
seemed to us a good vehicle to address these questions 
is that they was agreement throughout the appellate 
process that there was an error that was plain and, 
therefore, it provides an opportunity to address -- if 
the Court chooses, which it need not, but if the Court 
chooses -- to address how the substantial rights aspect 
of the plain-error standard and discretionary aspect --
JUSTICE STEVENS:  It seems to me that the 

government has tried to pick a case in which it has the 
strongest opportunity to win on the merits in order to 
have us decide a rule that really isn't important in a 
lot of other cases, but it is totally unimportant in

this case.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well, Justice Stevens, what 
one finds when one looks through a lot of these -- when 
these cases are brought, there often is a dispute and a 
real -- and a genuine dispute as to whether a breach has 
occurred or not.  And those cases, of course, do not 
allow exposition -- explanation about the other 
components.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But don't you think it 

would have been open to the government to make the 
argument that Justice Breyer has made and said there 
really wasn't a breach here, at least an insignificant 
breach that should be ignored?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  As we acknowledge in our 
brief, there might be arguments out there that there 
were implicit terms to this plea agreement that were 
breached by the defendant.  Those arguments were never 
made in the court of appeals in this case, and so we are 
accepting that record as a way --

JUSTICE BREYER:  They can only get -- they 

can only get your breach if they find an implicit 
agreement.  The implicit agreement is that you will not 
tell the court that, in light of changes, paragraph 8 no 
longer describes the situation.  You didn't breach 
paragraph 8, as taken literally.  You agree he had shown

that acceptance of responsibility.  What you told the 
court was, now we don't think he should have this 
acceptance of responsibility, which previously he had 
shown, because he's committed another crime.  Those are 
the exact words you said to the court.

 Now, he may have made an implicit not to do 
that.  On the other hand, that implicit promise may be 
negative by, you know, the other implicit acceptance of 
the fact that this applies only where we don't commit 
another crime.

 So I'm just saying this -- I'm not saying 
you are even right.  I'm just saying, having those two 
arguments, it seems that you aren't plainly wrong.  You 
aren't plainly wrong.  So how do I get to the other 
questions if I believe that?  Do I say, "Hypothetically 
if the error here were plain, which I think it isn't, 
then I'd like to tell you where the burden of proof 
lies."?  By the way, if I happened to think that that's 
whatever it is, then I will go into a few other things. 
That's really what I feel you are asking me to do 
because I don't think it's plain.  Maybe the other 
people think it's plain.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well, I mean -- as I've --
as I've already indicated, having the Court state that 
the -- Rule 52(b) applies here is a -- is a -- I think,

a helpful --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think it's plain.  What 

about paragraph 9?  Are you ignoring paragraph 9?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  You fulfilled paragraph 9, 

didn't you?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  The -- paragraph 9 indicates 

that the government agrees to request that Puckett's 
sentence placed at the lowest end of the guideline 
levels deemed applicable by the court.  And there has 
been no claim, at any point in this proceeding, that 
that provision has been breached.  What happened at the 
sentencing was that the district court stated on the 
record:  I know that there is an agreement in here that 
that the lowest end of the guideline is appropriate, and 
I intend to follow that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think it's very 
clear that there has been a breach here.  And it's not 
fanciful to say he felt remorse and then he went and did 
it again.  That happens all the time.

 You know, when I have a rich dessert I 
shouldn't have, I feel bad about it afterwards.  It 
doesn't mean I will not do it again.  I mean, why isn't 
that the case here?

we have taken the position that this was a breach of the 
government's agreement that he qualified for a 
three-level reduction in his offense level.  That was 
the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And you can put that 
before the judge.  You are supposed to go there and say, 
"Look, we agreed to recommend it and we do recommend 
it."  You could say, "And by the way, you should know 
that he's gone out and done this again."  But you most 
-- you certainly prejudiced him by not doing what you 
said you would do.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well, we breached the 

agreement by not doing what we said we would do, and the 
question we would submit to the Court is whether, given 
the absence of an objection, Petitioner carried his 
burden of showing that we did prejudice him.  And the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but isn't it the 

fact that we can never know what Judge Sanders would 
have done if the government had what it said it would 
do.  And because -- why shouldn't you bear the burden of 
showing there is no prejudice when you can't tell 
because you're the one that breached the agreement?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Because in the plain-error 

setting, this Court has made clear that the burdens 
shift and that, under the third component of that

standard, it is the defendant's burden, if he did not 
object, to show an effect on the outcome of the 
proceeding, that his substantial rights were violated.

 And here -- and I would note that the court 
of appeals made findings that the result would have been 
the same, and Petitioner in this Court has never 
challenged those findings on this record.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you say just for me, 

because I am changing a little bit here in light of that 
question, but what is it precisely that the government 
said it would do that it did not do?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  The -- paragraph 8 of the 

plea agreement indicates that the government --

JUSTICE BREYER:  What does it say?  What are 

the words that it says the government did not do?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well, we indicated to the 

district court that Petitioner did not qualify for 
acceptance of responsibility.  And paragraph 8 was a 
government agreement that he did qualify for acceptance 
of responsibility.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So he did agree.  "We 

agreed that he does qualify."  And then when you got to 
the court, you said, now we don't agree that he 
qualifies at this point.

was -- and there an intervening event, obviously, that 
affected the judgment, but because the explicit 
provision of this particular plea agreement, which I 
agree is atypical, as the government's motion for the 
third point made clear, did not have a qualification in 
there.  And that -- that is the base -- I mean, I don't 
mean to be arguing strenuously that the government did 
something wrong here, because there were -- but the fact 
is, given the terms of this plea agreement, there --
that is the basis for our concession that there was a 
breach.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  As a matter of practice 

among U.S. attorneys, we do have six and a half years at 
stake here, right?  That's the difference between the 
two levels?  Why wouldn't it be the appropriate thing 
for the U.S. attorney, the assistant U.S. attorney, to 
say, "Judge, I want to call your attention to paragraph 
8 of the plea agreement.  At the time we entered into 
it, we made that undertaking."  And so then everybody is 
sure that the judge's mind is focused on that.  Wouldn't 
that be the better practice?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Absolutely, 

Justice Ginsburg, and if there had been an objection 
based on that provision of the plea agreement, that may 
have been very well what would have happened.  The

breach could have been cured.  And the fact is that, in 
the absence of that objection, the breach was not cured 
when it could have been, and that is one reason -- that 
is why it makes sense to apply the plain-error standard 
in this context.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, could the breach have 

been cured?  I mean, the point -- it seems to me, the 
point at which the defendant would have known that the 
government had breached the agreement was when the 
government stood there before the court and said, "In 
fact, he hasn't accepted responsibility.  He went out 
and committed another crime while he was behind bars."

 It seems to me that that's the point -- and 

maybe this phrase occurred somewhere in the record --
that that's a bell that you can't unring.  For the 
defendant to get up and object and said, "Wait a minute, 
were you supposed to represent to the court that you 
agreed that I did accept responsibility" -- to require 
the government to fulfill that undertaking at that point 
would have been ridiculous.  I suppose the U.S. attorney 
could have said, "Oh, yes, he's right, Judge.  We agreed 
that he accepted responsibility."  But the U.S. attorney 
has already just said a moment before, "He hasn't.  We 
really don't mean that at all."

 There's no way, it seems to me, that there

could have been a better outcome in a case like this, 
even if the objection had been contemporary.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well, there would be more 

than one way to cure a breach such as this, if an 
objection had been raised in the district court.  One 
way would have been by the correction on the record that 
we have just discussed, but another way --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  Which would have been 

silly.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  But if the defendant -- and 
if the defendant said that, that would be a silly way to 
correct it.  It also could have been sent to another 
judge for resentencing, just as the Court in Santobello 
said, that a remedy could be accomplished.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It was sent to another 

judge, that judge would still have the presentence 
report.  After all, it wasn't the government that 
initiated reneging on the -- if it was the -- it was the 
presentence report.  And before the government said a 
word, the judge had read and was discussing the 
presentence report, which said, judge, earlier, we said 
you should give credit for acceptance of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.
 MS. SCHERTLER:  Yes.  And I don't think 

Petitioner -- Petitioner even contends that he is 
entitled now -- or he contends he is entitled to get out 
of this plea.  But taking the more typical remedies that 
this Court proposed as one possibility in Santobello, I 
don't think Petitioner would say that a judge should not 
know that he did -- that he engaged in subsequent 
criminal conduct.  That is information that any judge 
sentencing him must know about in order to fairly assess 
what sentence he should receive.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe Judge Sanders 

would look at this kind of the way that we have been 
discussing it, and he would look and say, boy, it's --
it's -- he committed subsequent conduct, how can you 
recommend that I depart?  He says, but on the other 
hand, every plea agreement I have seen you always say if 
he commits subsequent conduct that is illegal, that all 
bets are the off.  You didn't say that here, so I'm 
going to take the recommendation seriously.

 I don't think it's -- maybe I am repeating 
myself, but I don't think it is at all clear that the 
result wouldn't be different here.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Well -- and again, I guess I 

would give the same response, that it -- it is

Petitioner's burden to show a likelihood, a reasonable 
likelihood that it would have been different.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  With respect, that is not 
what Olano says, is it?  The -- the -- the basic Olano 
standard is a -- is a violation of substantial rights 
standard.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  Yes, Justice Souter.
 JUSTICE SOUTER:  And one way that you could 
show a violation of substantial rights would be a -- a 
demonstration that the outcome would have been 
different.  But another possibility of showing that 
violation is -- is whether -- and I know you don't 
accept it, but it's the one that I proposed earlier, 
there is a violation of substantial rights if somebody 
is sitting behind bars without having gotten there by 
the performance of an agreement that he made, or as a 
result of a trial.  And that, too, could satisfy the 
Olano formulation, could it not?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  It could, Justice Souter. 
And if the Court were to take that position, we would 
argue that there is still, under the plain-error 
standard, the fourth component, the discretionary 
component --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I know you want to -- as I 
point out one other thing to you.  I think it's a hard

question, burden of proof and these other things, that I 
just turned the page, after the person, Ms. Simms, she's 
the prosecutor, and she's absolutely clear to me, others 
can disagree, that this judge knew just what the 
government had agreed to, and the prosecutor was saying 
that now things have changed.

 And then the judge turns to the probation 

officer, and the probation officer says, just to 
reiterate what Ms. Simms said, the new offense, 
according to the guidelines of the guideline manual, 
prohibits any acceptance of responsibility.  Now, if 
that turns out to be right, of course, it couldn't 
matter less whose burden of proof it is.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  It was not correct, as a 

matter of fact, and the defense attorney made that 
correction, and the -- and the judge accepted that.  And 
if I could go back --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  He wasn't -- was he 

convicted of this new crime?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  He -- not at the time of 

these proceedings.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It was just an 

allegation, right?

 MS. SCHERTLER:  That's right.  Another --

another defendant had pled guilty to this crime, and the

factual statement supporting his plea had implicated 
Petitioner as having instigated the crime, suggested 
to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why did we assume 
anything anyway?  I assume he denies the allegations.

 MS. SCHERTLER:  He admitted the allegations 
to the probation officer, and that is what was reflected 
in the presentence report.

 And if I could return to Justice Souter's 
question about if the Court were to take the position 
that a form of substantial rights is affected in every 
case of a government breach of plea agreement, we would 
respectfully submit that as this Court analyzed a 
similar type of difficult question in Johnson and 
Cotton, that the fourth discretionary component of the 
standard should preclude relief or should at least give 
the district court, the court of appeals discretion to 
not grant relief where, as in this case, there has been 
no showing that there was an effect on the outcome, and, 
as the Court of Appeals found, an affirmative record 
that the outcome would have been exactly the same.

 Thank you, Your Honors.  We would ask that 

the judgment be affirmed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LARS R. ISAACSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ISAACSON:  Thank you, Your Honor.
 The problem that the Puckett panel had in 

the third prong of 52(b) they focused on whether or not 
there is prejudice at sentencing.  That was the focus of 
the Puckett panel.  That is why they said 52(b) plain 
error applied and was found in that case.

 The problem with that is that Santobello 
clearly points out that prejudice to the trial judge, 
that the trial judge -- what the trial judge would have 
done is simply not relevant.  That is why 52(b) cannot 
be applied in this case.

 Secondly, when the government argues that 
there is no prejudice -- you have to show prejudice at 
sentencing, the judge would have done something 
different, that is virtually an impossible standard. 
Under 18 U.S.C. 355 -- there are a number of factors a 
sentencing judge has to take into.  The idea -- and 
there is many different factors they must look at, all 
of these different things.

 The idea that a defendant can somehow show a 
judge would have come to a different result but for the 
government breach is an impossibility.

The final point I would make is, the 

argument the government is making now about prejudice, 
it would make no difference at all if the defendant had 
objected at the time.  If there is no effect on 
sentencing, it would not pass muster under plain-error 
or the harmless error standards.  So the next case that 
is going to come before this Court is when you have an 
objection, and then they're going to say the exact same 
argument here.

 We would ask you to reverse the decision of 

the Fifth Circuit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:15 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
