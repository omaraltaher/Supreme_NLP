 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-876, Conrad Black 
et al. v. The United States. 
Mr. Estrada.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. ESTRADA:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 For two decades, courts of appeals 

confronting Section 1346 have been unanimous on, at 
most, three points.

 The first one is that the unvarnished text 

of the statute is vague, amorphous, open-ended, and 
essentially, not very helpful.

 The second one is that a meaningful attempt 
to construe the statute can take place, if at all, only 
in light of a body of law that this Court rejected in 
McNally and Congress likely intended to restore in the 
act.

 And the third is that this exercise is 

fraught with due process and federalism problems and 
risks the creation of common law crimes, especially in 
the private sector where the pre-McNally precedent was

not well-developed.

 The principal question in this case is 
whether a prosecution may be sustained under a 1346 
theory, under a theory that was not successful before 
McNally and, in fact, had been affirmatively rejected, 
even in the heyday of the intangible rights doctrine. 
Because the answer to that question is "no," all 
convictions in this case must be reversed.

 It would be well to start by acknowledging 

that the root difficulty in this case is that this Court 
asked Congress to speak clearly, and Congress did not do 
that.

 As a result, there is no solution that is 

really capable of providing an -- an elegant out to the 
morass that the lower courts have been confronting, but 
the choices, essentially, fall on three categories.

 And the first is to return the matter to 

Congress, either because the statute is vague in all of 
its applications, both public or private, or as to 
private conduct, because there are not enough guideposts 
for judicial decision-making to give meaning to the 
statute.

 The second category of choices --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you don't ask for 

the first, do you?

MR. ESTRADA:  Yes, we do.  I mean, we -- we 
have -- we have written a question that necessarily has 
that as a predicate, which, under this Court's cases, 
leave that predicate open to the Court.  We have an --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are -- are you saying that 

unless we adopt the limiting instruction that you 
propose, the statute is then vague?

 MR. ESTRADA:  We have argued that.  It is 

also -- you know, just to -- just to finish painting the 
picture, Justice Kennedy, we have -- we have the trunk 
of a tree, and that's -- you know, the statute, is it 
vague or isn't?

 Then we have the question of whether there 

is a limiting construction, and Professor Altshuler, for 
example, has made a case that limiting the statute to 
bribes and kickbacks is a possibility, as that being, 
arguably, the only core conduct that Congress could have 
contemplated.

 And -- and the third one is to go beyond 

bribes and -- and kickbacks, and to expand the statute 
to what Congress likes to call self-dealing or 
non-disclosure, which is really a wholesale takeover of 
State commercial law.

 In our view, if the Court is disposed to 

reach that far into the third category, it is essential

that the restrictions that had been recognized before 
McNally be enforced against -- against the government, 
but we have briefed the case in the way we have to 
this -- basically assuming that this tree is not 
imaginary and actually exists --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your theory -- your 
theory that return to the pre-McNally cases would help 
you is based almost entirely on the D.C. Circuit case --
case in Lemire -- Lemire.

 MR. ESTRADA:  I think that is not a fair 

statement, Mr. Chief Justice.  I think the D.C. 
Circuit's opinion, of course, is indeed very helpful, 
but it was a -- a distillation of what other courts of 
appeals have told the government again and again, in 
Ballard in the Fifth Circuit, in Feldman in the Seventh, 
in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The -- the 

government tells us it was an outlier.

 MR. ESTRADA:  Well, it had a different view, 
as we have pointed out, when they filed the brief in the 
Carpenter case.  But the fact is, whether it is or it 
isn't can be judged by what the contemporaneous cases 
were.

 And Von Barta, Dixon, all cases in the 

Second Circuit, Feldman in the Seventh, Ballard, all had

indicated that this was a requirement of the theory in 
intangible rights cases.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, since the -- since the 

body of pre-McNally lower court cases was hardly 
completely consistent, do you think this is a workable 
approach?

 MR. ESTRADA:  The honest answer is:  I do 
believe that the statute is vague in all of its -- all 
of its applications, and I am happy to explain, quickly, 
because of that, why that is.

 Obviously, there are obvious problems of 

notice with the statute.  The more fundamental problem 
with the statute, as if the notice problems were not 
enough, is in the second prong of the vagueness 
doctrine, which is the conferral of discretion to select 
the defendant on the government, and in particular, the 
prosecutors.  And this is a situation not unlike that as 
was outlined by Justice Breyer's concurring opinion in 
the Morales case.

 And what he pointed out, pointing to cases 
like Coates v. City of Cincinnati, was that a statute 
that essentially confers discretion on the -- on the 
police and the prosecutors to select the quarry and come 
up with that appropriate justification to sell to the 
Court later --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't know what's so 
discretionary and harmful about a bribery or kickback 
case.  Let's take just the limiting principle of the 
trunk.

 Whether it's in the private or the public 

sector, why would, offering, there be any discretion or 
any sense of vagueness about saying:  It's illegal to 
give a bribery?

 MR. ESTRADA:  I --
JUDGE SOTOMAYOR:  To get a contract, to pass 
legislation, it's illegal to take a kickback.  There is 
nothing seemingly vague about that or seemingly 
troublesome about prosecutorial discretion in those --
at least those two situations.  We could then go to the 
self-dealing question.

 MR. ESTRADA:  I absolutely agree with the 

statements that you made, Justice Sotomayor.  It is 
undoubtedly true that a -- that a statute that 
proscribes bribery or kickbacks can constitutionally be 
written, if that is what the statute says.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's not your -- it's 
not within your test, as I understand it.  Your test is, 
there has to be economic harm to the person owed the 
duty of loyalty.

 Now, you could have a bribe or a kickback

that will line the pockets of the person who takes it, 
doesn't deceive the person who is giving it, and doesn't 
harm the company to whom a duty of loyalty is owed.

 So it seems to me that the bribe and 

kickback, which I think is heartland McNally, would not 
be included in yours.  It must be economic harm, actual 
or contemplated, to the person owed the duty of loyalty.

 MR. ESTRADA:  I think that is not a fair 
statement, Justice Ginsburg, because in our economic 
system, I think it is fairly inferable, and any jury 
could so find that if you are a supply agent for a 
corporation and you are taking a bribe of $10,000 to 
steer the contract to Company X, Company X would be more 
than happy, and it would be a matter of indifference to 
Company X to just give a 10K break to your employer.

 So it is inherent in the economic system in 
the private sector that if you're talking about bribes 
and kickbacks, there is an obvious, though perhaps not 
fully quantifiable, risk of loss to the person to whom 
the duty is owed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  The problem with the bribe 

or kickback explanation, unlike -- or you contend, 
unlike yours, is that there's no basis in the statute 
for limiting it to that.

 MR. ESTRADA:  I think, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, we -- we can't find 
a statute that says, "No person shall commit a bad act." 
We can't find that to be non-vague as applied to murder. 
Everybody knows that murder is a bad act.  Would that --
would that law be constitutional?

 MR. ESTRADA:  No, and that was going to be 
the second part of my answer to Justice Sotomayor, and 
it is a point that Justice Breyer also made in the 
Morales case, taking -- taking the example of Coates v. 
City of Cincinnati where the law basically said, "You 
shall not engage in annoying conduct."

 Now, as Justice Breyer pointed out, many of 

us would agree 100 out of 100 that certain things are 
definitely annoying.  And the fact that you could find, 
for example, that an assault is annoying does not mean 
that this statute gives notice that -- that, you know, 
your conduct is -- is within its written terms --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Let's say you have a 
bank that is going to be opening up a lot of branches in 
the State, and one of the directors knows this and knows 
where they are going to open them.  And he goes around 
and buys up the real estate where the bank is going to 
put its -- put its branch, so that he gets the benefit 
of the -- of the sale.  And assume that the price that 
-- that he's going to charge is a fair market price, no

different than what anybody else would charge.

 Now, is that sort of self-dealing covered 

under your view of the statute?

 MR. ESTRADA:  Well, I think that sort of 

self-dealing likely would be covered, not under my view 
of the statute, but under Carpenter, because if you were 
stealing confidential information from your employer, 
and the Court in Carpenter did say that confidential 
information is a -- is a form of property as a matter of 
Federal law --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But he is not 

stealing -- he is not stealing the confidential 
information.  As the director, he has the perfect right 
to know the confidential information.

 MR. ESTRADA:  But under either view, if you 
are going to steal the corporate opportunity, that, too, 
is a form of property, and in fact, the property counts 
in this very --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I don't know 
that I would call it a corporate -- I don't know if I 
would call it a corporate opportunity.  They are not 
looking to sell the land; they need to buy it.

 MR. ESTRADA:  Precisely, but -- but this is 
not unlike cases like O'Hagan, or even Carpenter itself, 
in which, you know, the value of the use of the

information comes from learning the confidential plans 
of your employer.  And in those circumstances, Carpenter 
said that the information itself could be a form of 
intangible property.

 And so that is a different problem than a 

native duty violation, which is what we are dealing 
here.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just while we are on the 
Oeschler thing, and then you'll probably want to go on 
to the other thing.

 Assume this trial were held again.  The 

government said:  All the same evidence -- same 
evidence.  Would that evidence suffice for an 
instruction to the jury?  Could the case go to the jury 
under the Oeschler theory?

 MR. ESTRADA:  Under the obstruction, or -- I 

mean, under the -- under the kickback --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Kickback or bribe.
 MR. ESTRADA:  No, it couldn't.  I mean, part 

of the point I was going to make is that under any of 
these choices, whether the statute is vague or 
unapplicable to private conduct, choice one, or whether 
it is a kickback or bribe, choice two, there would not 
be a case to send to the jury for the defendants in this 
case.

The only argument comes up if you really 

want to climb to the thinnest reed of the thinnest 
branch and say that it could extend to naked 
non-disclosure of confidential information or use of 
confidential information in violation of a duty imposed 
by contract or State law, or maybe even a consent 
decree, as in Sorich.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Estrada, let -- let me 

pursue the notion I -- I floated earlier, that the 
problem with Professor Altshuler's approach is that 
there is nothing in the text of the statute that would 
enable you to limit it to kickbacks and -- and bribes. 
Is there anything in the text of the statute that makes 
your proposal any better?

 I mean, to be sure, it does -- it does make 
this a kind of fraud, and in the past, fraud did require 
injury to somebody.  But it defined a new kind of fraud, 
namely, fraud that consists of the deprivation of honest 
services.  That's the fraud.  That, in and of itself, 
under the text of the statute, I take to be the fraud.

 MR. ESTRADA:  Your Honor, I don't think that 
I can give an answer that would be fully satisfactory to 
a pure textualist, that this can be taken out of the 
words of the statute.

 As a practical matter, however, if you

consider the legislative record, and the avowing hint to 
restore some part of what McNally had thrown out, then a 
harder question comes up, and the issue of what that was 
actually becomes highly relevant.  But I do not think 
that, even under the textualist view, it is fair to say 
that Congress went in the private sector from a view of 
fraud that is -- that was classically property kind to a 
view of fraud that has nothing to do with property.

 And the reason for that takes understanding 

what -- what the problem really was that Congress was 
trying to fix, and that the intangible rights cases were 
trying to fix.  And it's really one of symmetry.

 It has always been the case that mail fraud 
is a specific intent crime.  And it has always been the 
case, and this is clearly stated in cases like Regent 
Office Supply and Dixon, from Judge Friendly, that a 
part of the specific intent to defraud is an intent to 
harm.  Now, in classic fraud, the defendant intends to 
harm the victim by obtaining, in a corrupt manner, his 
property.  So there is a perfect symmetry between the 
intended harm to the victim and the expected gain of the 
defendant, because the gain comes from the victim's 
pocket.

 The problem of bribes and kickbacks that the 
intangible rights cases were trying to deal with is not

that they were trying to dispense with the harm's 
requirement to the victim; they were trying to deal with 
the lack of symmetry where the person given the payoff 
is not deceived and the harm to the victim is 
non-quantifiable.  And to fix that problem, you could 
say that this statute could then say that the term of 
art, as the government calls it, that Congress used was 
intended to cover that situation.

 Now, the proof in the pudding on that comes 
from a very well-known case.  Let's take, you know, the 
Holzer case, which was cited extensively by Justice 
Stevens in his dissent in McNally.  You may recall it 
was a State court judge who had been taking bribes, and 
his conviction was affirmed in an opinion by Judge 
Posner, which he cited in this case again, which 
appears, I think, at 816 F.2d, and it was just a 
straight intangible rights affirmment.  He sought cert, 
you know, Judge Holzer did, and he got a GVR in light of 
McNally.  And Judge Posner got the case back.

 Judge Holzer goes back and there is a second 
opinion, 840 F.2d, and Judge Posner has to conclude that 
Judge Holzer has to be let go on the mail fraud counts. 
And the reason he gives is:  Look, the judge obviously 
got lots of money, but he didn't get the money from 
anybody who was deceived, and all of his victims, which

were the public and the litigants against whom the cases 
were fixed, those people didn't lose any money, so that 
under the McNally paradigm, because the money that Judge 
Holzer got in bribes did not come from the victims, that 
-- that judge had to be let go.

 And I think that that's part of what 
Congress clearly had in mind as was trying to fix.

 Now, I agree with your -- with your apparent 

antecedent view and what I call issue one in the case, 
that the way that Congress did it has been one of not 
complying with the request that this Court made.  It did 
not make anything clear in a way that sets forth in the 
text what it does.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but 

presumably, the one thing it's odd to suggest Congress 
did was sort of run 1346 through 1341, when what it was 
trying to fix was the Court's understanding of what 1341 
provided.

 MR. ESTRADA:  There are any -- there are any 

number of problems with how Congress chose to do this, 
Mr. Chief Justice.  That is actually the tip of the 
iceberg, because if you look as a textual matter to the 
first words of Section 1346, you will see that this new 
amended definition of "scheme to defraud" applies to all 
of the offenses in Chapter 63 of Title 18.  There are 11

of those.

 And in addition to mail and wire fraud, at 

least three of them -- bank fraud, securities fraud, and 
healthcare fraud -- used the phrase "scheme to defraud." 
And unless you are prepared to try to save the statute 
by -- by trying to identify a core of what Congress was 
trying to do that is squarely anchored in the 
pre-McNally law, which may or may not be a successful 
enterprise, you do not have any textual guidance that 
will tell you whether this theory that the government 
likes to state at a very high level of generality would 
not become a deus ex machina in a number of other 
statutes that we have yet to -- to hear from.  And that 
is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if -- what if I think 

that even -- I mean, much of your case is directed to 
the point that you -- you have to narrow it this way to 
avoid constitutional problems.

 What if I think you don't avoid 

constitutional problems?

 MR. ESTRADA:  Then it --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why should -- why should I 
turn somersaults to -- to come out with the -- with the 
interpretation that you want?

event, we fully support -- actually, we support anyway 
-- the -- the brief that was filed by the Chamber of 
Commerce and the National Association of Criminal 
Defense Lawyers, for the proposition that as an 
essential matter, this statute cannot be saved.

 I am merely pointing out, Justice Scalia, 

that for somebody who is not a textualist, that question 
may not be as clear-cut.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where -- where in 

the record do we find your argument that the statute is 
unconstitutional?

 MR. ESTRADA:  We made it -- we made it in 

the district court in a motion to dismiss the 
indictment, and I don't believe that is part of the 
joint appendix, but it is Docket Entry 261.

 And in that same motion, we argued that this 

statute, if it were to be applied at all, had to be 
interpreted solely as a matter of Federal law, which 
oddly enough, is the position that the government has 
finally now taken in the Weyhrauch case.  And we argued 
based on the Jerome case and Cleveland case, which are 
the cases that the government has finally discovered.

 We argued again in the court of appeals, and 

we argued expressly that although the Seventh Circuit 
had -- had previously indicated that it would uphold the

constitutionality of the statute against a vagueness 
challenge, that Judge Easterbrook, writing for the court 
in Thompson, had left open the possibility that they may 
yet find a case in which that would be revisited.  And 
we expressly argued that this was the case for which 
Thompson had left the -- the question open.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, what about --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under the test that you 
propose, is the test the same?  Does the statute read 
the same way, and is the test the same for private and 
public officials?

 MR. ESTRADA:  No.  No.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, then we -- then if 

we accept your view, we have to have one subset of 
definitions for private officials and another for public 
officials.  It's hard to do that under the statute.
 MR. ESTRADA:  That is a problem that is 

inherent, as I said earlier, in trying to do anything to 
save the statute.  But let me say --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, under the judge's 

bribery case that we just -- that you discussed earlier, 
couldn't you take the position that that money the judge 
took as a bribe really should have been paid to the 
government?

an argument that was made to Judge Posner and remanded, 
the Holzer case, and Judge Posner said, Well, that is 
really untenable.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that would fit your 

test, though.

 MR. ESTRADA:  Well, yes, in a -- in a very 
formal way.  But -- but if I could say just one word on 
the question of the public v. Private distinction, 
Justice Kennedy, because I think it is important, in 
trying to figure out how one goes about trying to fix 
what is basically a mess, you have to keep in mind that 
the courts had accepted the intangible rights theory 
before McNally, and which Congress presumably and -- or 
likely was trying to bring back, had -- had not taken 
the view that they were doing something other than 
fraud.

 But they have taken the view that there was 

a basis in the concept of fraud for distinguishing 
between the public and the private, even before McNally. 
And some of this -- this is found in the briefing in 
McNally and is set forth in Justice Stevens's dissenting 
opinion, that there was this other statute, Section 371 
of 18 U.S.C., the conspiracy statute, that uses the 
phrase "conspiracy to defraud the United States."

 And on the basis of that statute, before

McNally, the courts of appeals have -- have ruled that 
an intent to interfere with the property rights of the 
government was not an element of the core meaning of the 
fraud.  And the reason for that was that since 1905, in 
a case called Hask v. Henfold, and followed later by a 
case called Hammerschmidt, this Court had said that in 
order to be convicted of defrauding the government under 
this other statute, no need -- there was no need to show 
that the government's property interests were -- were 
interfered with solely --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, you were --
I think you were about to tell me where you raised it in 
the Court -- the constitutional argument in this Court?

 MR. ESTRADA:  We -- we raised that as a 

predicate for our question presented.  And we said this 
is vague, but -- but if -- but if you do not accept this 
proposed restriction that has been accepted by the -- by 
the courts of appeals, then you would really have to 
take the -- take the step of actually striking it down.
 If you are asking whether we tendered it as 
a separate question presented, the answer to that is no, 
Mr. Chief Justice, but under this Court's cases that is 
not needed.  And the cases that I would direct the --
the Court to for that proposition are -- some of them 
are cited in the Chambers brief.  And the first one is

U.S. v. Grubbs, where this Court said that in a case 
involving the technical sufficiency of a search warrant 
it was, of course, open to the Court to consider whether 
the particular type of warrant, an anticipatory search 
warrant, was categorically improper under the Fourth 
Amendment.  And -- because, as the court explained, it 
was an antecedent question that was a predicate for a 
logical disposition of the actual question in front of 
the Court.

 In doing that -- that, by the way, was a 

unanimous opinion by Justice Scalia.

 In doing that, you know, the Court cited to 

the case of Wilkinson v. Austin, which was another 
unanimous opinion, this time by Justice Kennedy.  In 
that case the issue on which cert had been granted was 
the -- the question of what process was due to a -- to a 
prisoner in State custody.

 And the State of Ohio, that case had 

affirmatively conceded that there was a liberty interest 
and that the suggestion of the United States as amicus 
-- the Court concluded that whether or not there was 
even a liberty interest was an antecedent question and 
was a logical predicate for -- for the intelligent 
consideration.

and explain why any error in the honest services 
instruction wasn't harmless as applied to the 
Forum/Paxton transaction?

 MR. ESTRADA:  That's -- that's Count Seven?
 JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.
 MR. ESTRADA:  Well --
JUSTICE ALITO:  As I understand it, there 

was no evidence there that the $600,000 was a -- a 
recharacterized management fee; isn't that correct?

 MR. ESTRADA:  No.  The argument on that, 

Justice Alito, was entirely different.  The -- the 
record does show that the executive committee of 
Hollinger and the full board unanimously, including 
every member of the audit committee, had approved the 
execution of the noncompetes with Paxton and -- and 
Forum.  And the only other evidence as to why they were 
not in fact executed as contemplated by the board 
resolutions was Radler's testimony that Kipnis simply 
forgot.

 Now, significantly, after the jury came back 

and found all three of the defendants guilty on that 
count, Judge Sansieve entered a judgment of acquittal 
for Kipnis on Count Seven, finding that the evidence was 
insufficient as to him.  And if there are no further 
questions, I would like to reserve my time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.
 Mr. Dreeben.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. DREEBEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
 The Petitioner today has sought to present a 

question to this Court that he chose not to include in 
his questions presented, whether the statute is 
unconstitutionally vague in all of its applications.

 What he did present in his question 

presented to this Court is whether there is an element 
of contemplated economic harm inherent in the concept of 
fraud in Section 1341, so that any honest services 
prosecution must show contemplated or foreseeable 
economic harm in order to be sustained.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But I don't -- I don't have 
the heart to inquire into that question if I think that 
the whole statute is bad.  And that's the point he is 
raising, that it's -- it's a predicate to our 
considering that question, that if you agree with him, 
you think the statute will be sustained.

 But if I think the whole statute is bad, 
what -- you know, why should I engage in -- in this 
exercise?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  It doesn't make any sense 

to make me do that.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Maybe you should wait for a 

Petitioner who presents the question, rather than 
granting relief to a Petitioner who chose not to raise 
the constitutional issue in this Court --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it's a little --
it's a little odd that you -- you would say that an 
argument that shows a way the statute can be saved 
cannot be -- cannot be presented.
 MR. DREEBEN:  Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, he's saying the 
statute could be saved, if at all, if you adopt this --
this construction.  And if you do, his -- his conviction 
must be set aside.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I think that the Court should 

reach that issue, the issue whether there is 
contemplated economic harm as a requirement for the 
statute, and the government briefed that issue, and I 
disagree with Petitioner that contemplated economic harm 
is either an element of the statute or necessary to save 
its constitutionality.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, on the other hand, 
if we just can't find a -- a grounding in the statute 
for it, then that's because the statute's there.

MR. DREEBEN:  What this statute is, Justice 
Kennedy, is Congress's effort to reinstate the body of 
law that this Court held was not a valid construction of 
the mail fraud statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Before you -- do you --

does the government feel that it hasn't had an adequate 
opportunity to brief the constitutionality of the 
statute?

 MR. DREEBEN:  If the Court wished to address 

the constitutionality of the statute, the government 
would brief it more fully, including by making the 
points that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Might this come up in the 

Skilling case?

 MR. DREEBEN:  The Skilling case raises the 
question of whether if this Court does not interpret --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So we have to say, in your 
view -- no, I'm just -- I'm cutting into you because I 
don't -- you answered it once you said that.

 The -- the -- what I wonder is, does the 

government feel, in order to have a full opportunity to 
brief constitutionality, that we should issue an order 
saying:  Please brief the constitutionality?

 MR. DREEBEN:  If the Court believes that 

that is a necessary question to resolve, then it should

be briefed in a supplemental passage --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So we should say that?
 MR. DREEBEN:  But not in this case, because 
I think if a Petitioner comes to this Court and presents 
a particular statutory construction question and then 
seeks to smother in --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That would be --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- does Skilling -- I'm 

sorry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Go ahead.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Directly answer this 
question:  Does Skilling present the pure question or 
not?

 MR. DREEBEN:  No, because in Skilling, 

Justice Sotomayor, the question is whether an element of 
personal or private gain needs to be read into the 
statute in order to render it constitutional.

 Now, in all fairness to Mr. Skilling, he has 

not filed his opening brief; the government has not 
filed its response.  So that case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We don't know if that's 

going to be --

different issue.  But again, I -- I think that if a

Petitioner wishes to come to this Court and say that a 
statute is unconstitutionally vague in all of its 
applications, this is not a statute that offends First 
Amendment rights or anything --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, Mr. Dreeben, 
you agree that it would be very unusual if in June we 
announced the opinion in your case agreeing with you and 
then the next case announced that the statute is 
unconstitutional?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Agreed.
 (Laughter.)
 MR. DREEBEN:  I would vastly prefer, 
Mr. Chief Justice, that the Court hold that it is 
constitutional.  And I think that it should, because --
let me outline --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, just -- just so we --
we know what is -- what is going on here:  It is not the 
case that the Petitioner here has said here that if we 
adopt his interpretation, it will render the statute 
constitutional.  He doesn't say that.

 He says that if we adopt his interpretation, 

we can avoid reaching the constitutional question, 
because whether it's constitutional or not, it at least 
requires the -- the kind of financial harm that -- that 
he asserts.  So he is not asserting that if we -- if we

accept his position, the statute is constitutional.  I 
don't read his brief as saying that, anyway.

 MR. DREEBEN:  That's probably a fair 

characterization of language in his brief, but it does 
bear note that he never asked this Court to decide that 
question.

 Now, the question that is before the Court, 

and I think it will illuminate the vagueness concerns 
that are on the Justice's minds, is:  What does the 
statute mean?  And the way to understand this statute is 
to recognize that when this Court held in McNally that 
the mail fraud statute did not protect intangible 
rights, Congress came back in response to this Court's 
invitation and said:  Yes, it does; it protects the 
intangible right of honest services which had assumed 
the status of a term of art in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How could it have been a 

term of art when the courts -- the lower courts were 
massively confused?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Ginsburg, I think the 
description of the lower courts as massively confused is 
not correct.  It's not a fair description of the cases.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, there wasn't even a 

uniform terminology in the lower courts.  They didn't 
all use --

MR. DREEBEN:  All of the lower courts used 

essential synonyms for what Congress sought to 
reinstate.  They refer to the right of honest services, 
faithful and honest services, loyal and honest services, 
and they were talking about one thing:  Divided 
loyalties of an agent or a fiduciary.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, as I hear that -- I am 

exaggerating, possibly, but I think every agent has a 
duty of loyalty to provide loyal and honest services to 
the master, master agent.  Every worker is an agent of 
his master, the employer.  So every instance in which a 
worker does not provide honest services to the employer, 
he has met your test.

 I think there are 300 -- perhaps there are 

150 million workers in the United States.  I think 
possibly 140 of them would flunk your test.

 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, that's what 

worrying me.  Now, why?  Because -- I -- "Do you like my 
hat?"  Says the boss.  "Oh, I love your hat," says the 
worker.

 (Laughter.)
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  So the boss will 

leave the room so that the worker can continue to read 
the racing form.  Deception?  Designed to work at

reading the racing form instead of doing your honest 
work and, therefore, violation?

 Now, explain to me how your test does not --

and I think you can probably do it; I just don't 
understand it at the moment.  Explain it to me, how your 
test does not make this statute potentially 
criminalizing 100 million workers in the United States, 
or some tens of millions?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer, I hope you 

give me a moment to explain my theory of the statute in 
response to your question.  The statute covers bribes, 
kickbacks, and undisclosed conflicts of interest by an 
agent or fiduciary who takes action to further that 
interest.

 These were well-recognized categories of 
honest services violations.  Virtually every circuit 
that examined the pre-McNally case law said these are 
the prototypical cases.  Bribes, kickbacks, undisclosed 
conflicts of interest by an agent or fiduciary who takes 
action to further that interest.  These are not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So is that -- does 
the right to intangible services refer to an obligation 
that is legal or moral?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Legal, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Only -- only legal?

So that if in a State their corporate law says conflicts 
of interest with respect to spouse and children must be 
disclosed, but conflicts of interest with respect to 
nieces and nephews need not, you would say you cannot 
use this statute to prosecute somebody who, under some 
abstract sense, should have told their employer that, 
"My niece is going to get $10 million if we go ahead 
with this contract"?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Let me make two points in 

response to that, Mr. Chief Justice.

 The obligation under 1346 is a Federal 

obligation.  Congress, by reinstating this body of law, 
by virtue of 1346, created a Federal obligation that is 
not dependent on State law.  And I think we will address 
this more in the Weyhrauch case, where that issue is 
specifically presented, but it should not be understood 
as a State law obligation.

 Second, the core --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then what's the 

source -- and I think that's inherent in the Chief 
Justice's question -- what is it -- where did he draw 
the line and where do we go to look to where you draw 
the line on what information needs to be disclosed? 
Because if it's not a niece, my best friend is going to 
get a 1.4 million on this deal.

Where is the line drawn, and what is the 

source of the law that we look to to figure out where to 
draw that line?

 MR. DREEBEN:  The line is personal 

conflicting financial interests of the individual, which 
--

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you are talking about 

private gain?  Do I gain something as opposed to --
because that -- I know that is the Skilling case.  But 
if --

MR. DREEBEN:  I prefer not to address the 

Skilling case until that has been briefed.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, but that's -- you 
have to, because you have to tell us what draws -- you 
have to give us the source or some source of limiting, 
of limitation.  And that's what Justice Breyer has been 
talking about.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I'm trying to do that, Justice 
Sotomayor.  A personal conflicting financial interest is 
not subtle, it is ascertainable, it is core, it is the 
characterizing feature of the vast majority of --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now this -- I'm just 

getting a label, and as I hear you talk, I think it's

precisely what you said, it seems to me in what I have 
labeled Altshuler alternative B, does that ring a bell?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I don't know what 

Professor Altshuler's alternative B was.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes.  You've read the 
briefs-- you've read the briefs.  He has alternative A 
and alternative B.  And alternative A he says kickbacks, 
and it could be limited to bribery or kickbacks.  In 
alternative B he adds bribery, kickbacks and undisclosed 
self-dealing capable of causing economic harm.  That's 
what I got out of the brief.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I would not have --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now I just heard what you 

said and it sounded like the same thing.

 MR. DREEBEN:  It's not the same thing and I 

think this goes back --

JUSTICE BREYER:  It is not causing economic 

harm.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Not causing economic harm 

because there are instances where important fiduciary 
relationships are breached personally.  For example, 
doctor-patient, lawyer-client, union-union 
representative, where the harms are intangible; they are 
noneconomic; they were intended to be picked up by this 
statute.  But to answer your question directly, Justice

Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER:  So what about my racing 
form?  He is acting for himself and not his employer.

 MR. DREEBEN:  That -- that is -- implicates 

a -- one of the two important limiting principles on 
this statute which is materiality and intent to defraud. 
And I do not think that any jury would find and the 
government would be very foolish to prosecute that 
material --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Different matter. 

Different matter.  The foolish to prosecute, jury 
defined, worries me for the reason that what's in the

 JUSTICE BREYER:  When the criminal code was 

reenacted and never was, one kind of joke was that it 
there it would be -- there would one ball, the law would 
be read as a crime to do wrong, okay?  "It is a crime to 
do wrong."  Sometimes adding, "in the opinion of the 
Attorney General."  All right.

having a statute that picks up 80 or 100 million people.
 MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer, the point that 

I was making is that this statute does not establish a 
free-floating federal crime based on a breach of a 
trivial duty.  It requires materiality, as all fraud 
statutes do; it requires --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But defined how?  That's 
what I'm -- I'm trying -- material in what way?  Because 
if you don't how by an economic loss to the victim or by 
private gain to the -- to the perpetrator, then you are 
left with what substance to the issue of materiality?

 MR. DREEBEN:  The --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What becomes important?
 MR. DREEBEN:  The issue of materiality --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That the -- for an 
auditor on April 14th his guy -- or April 1st his 
employee goes off to a ball game?  It could be a huge 
economic loss to that employer by that employee's 
decision at that particular moment to go to a baseball 
game as opposed to working.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I agree, Justice Sotomayor, 

but materiality as the Second Circuit said in the 
Rybicki opinion is a time-tested way of separating 
out --

said economic loss --

MR. DREEBEN:  No --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that there has to be 

the risk of economic loss --

MR. DREEBEN:  With all respect --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- in the private 

sector.

 MR. DREEBEN:  -- Justice Sotomayor, the 

Seventh Circuit in its Rybicki opinion in the en banc 
opinion did not say that, nor I think is it fair to say 
that the Second Circuit had ever said that economic loss 
was an element of an intangible rights fraud, either 
pre-McNally or post-McNally.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is -- I mean, I'm 

still waiting to hear what materiality consists.  It is 
just -- de minimus doesn't count?  Is that all you mean?
 MR. DREEBEN:  Materiality, Justice Scalia, 

it takes the classic definition of your opinions for the 
Court in Kungis and Gaudin as reasonably likely to 
affect the decision of the body to whom the statement is 
made.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So if the employee would 

be fired if defalcation had come to light, that's 
material?

it would be.  And I should add --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right, that's the ball 

game.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then that's the ball game. 

Hypo:  you go to the ball game, the government --

MR. DREEBEN:  No, it's not the ball game.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The employer finds out 

about it, he fires -- so it's material because you would 
be fired for it.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Materiality isn't the only 

element.  It's not a divided loyalties issue.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm asking about just 

materiality.  Just materiality would be satisfied.  You 
said that if the employer would fire, that is material. 
And then we had the ball game hypothetical.  Then you 
said oh, well, and then some other thing.  But we are 
talking just about materiality so you should stick with 
that question.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I'll -- I agree, Justice 

Kennedy, and I intend to answer that question, but I 
think that it is fair to say, for me that by 
acknowledging that something can be material if the 
employer would take different action does not mean that 
everything that the employee does is a crime.  The

employee is not exercising the official powers of his 
office or job, and that is what was critical.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  He drives to the ball game 

in the government -- in the company car.

 MR. DREEBEN:  He is still not exercising the 
powers of his company, he is off on a frolic and detour. 
What the pre-McNally cases were looking at were agents 
who --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Excuse me, may I ask you 

to put -- in terms of your brief, you said your 
definition of materiality -- you said materiality is 
related to but different from what Mr. Estrada is urging 
the Court to adopt:  economic harm to the victim.  So 
can you tell us how materiality is related to economic 
harm to the victim and how it is different from economic 
harm to the victim?

 MR. DREEBEN:  It is related to it, Justice 

Ginsburg, in that in a business setting materiality will 
be in most cases coextensive with economic harm at least 
if economic harm is conceived as I conceive it, and as 
the cases have conceived of it as extending to things 
like harm to reputation that will interfere with a 
business's ability to go forward.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it -- it doesn't answer 
the racing form case.  I mean, you are using materiality

in two senses.  All you mean by materiality is that the 
misrepresentation must have been material, okay?  So in 
the racing form case, let's say the question the boss 
asked is, you know, "Are you going to work hard this 
afternoon?  Or do I have to stand here and look over 
your shoulder? " And he says, "Boss, I'm going to work 
hard this afternoon. " "Okay, then I'll leave."  And the 
boss leaves.  That representation is material in that it 
got the boss to leave, whereupon he reads the racing 
form.

 But you know, that's immaterial in another 

sense, it's a -- it's not a substantial crime.  And 
that's -- that's what we are looking for here, something 
that -- that separates reading the racing form from 
really harming the employer --

MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- to a substantial degree. 
And you have nothing in your -- in your brief or in your 
argument that eliminates these de minimus kind of --
what should I say --

MR. DREEBEN:  Fraud.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Misrepresentations to the 

employer.

all -- what you are describing are all money or property 
frauds that could be charged if the government so chose 
so long as the mails or the wires were involved.  The 
mail fraud statute doesn't by itself carve out de 
minimus frauds.

 The concept of materiality, though, in my 

concept of the divided loyalties that lies at the heart 
of honest services fraud, includes in itself the concept 
of an undisclosed interest that is important in some 
way, because the obligation of the employee, the agent, 
the fiduciary, the company executive, the politician who 
has been elected to office, is defined by a bedrock 
substratum of fiduciary duties that are universally 
recognized in the common law, that were --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Dreeben, can I ask 

this?  It seems to me that even if there is some 
economic harm amounting to the cost of a World Series 
ticket, that's all -- or the amount of gas used to drive 
to the ballpark, that could still not meet the 
materiality requirement.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I agree with that, justice 

Stevens.

 MR. DREEBEN:  There is no bright line rule 

just based on economic harm versus everything else.

in the law of mail fraud in these issues but the scope 
of the duty that has been recognized in the pre-McNally 
cases had to do with the conflicts of interest produced 
by bribes, produced by people who took kickbacks, 
produced by self-dealing where somebody was selling his 
own product to the company but not disclosing that he 
had an interest in the company.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That -- that is Altshuler 
B, which I -- that seems to work, but then you want to 
go beyond that.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And I think in going beyond 

that is the paradigm case of -- of moonlighting?

that ever --

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no, no.  I'm trying 

to get -- encapsulate your test in my mind.  I'm just 
trying to find a way, so as I listen to you, I think 
what you are driving at -- a paradigm case of what you 
are driving at would be moonlighting.

 MR. DREEBEN:  If by moonlighting, Justice 

Breyer, you mean somebody who has a business on the side 
and in dealing with his own company.

real estate.

 MR. DREEBEN:  No.  That's -- no, no. 

Self-dealing in the kind that I am talking about is 
where somebody has -- he is playing the role of loyal 
corporate employee, loyal corporate officer, but he is 
actually working for himself by buying from his own 
company, without disclosing that to the --

JUSTICE BREYER:  You have to have all those 
elements?  One -- I mean, everybody is working for the 
company.  Everybody has loyalty to the company owner. 
And, now, you are saying everybody has competing things 
that they sort of like to do, which would deprive the 
owner of the honest services, but you are saying, in 
addition to that, he has to have his own company?

 MR. DREEBEN:  No, Justice Breyer.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  In addition to that, what?
 MR. DREEBEN:  What I -- I'm describing for 

you are the core cases, so that this Court can put a

familiar to the lower courts which have had this body of

 MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or is the problem the --

the self-dealing itself, the fact that the person is 
receiving a gain?  There's where I'm trying to draw the 
line because I keep going back to -- what is the source 
of information that would put a limitation on how much 
you disclose or don't disclose?

 It has to be -- the issue has to be looked 
at differently, which is the evil is the self-dealing, 
the gain the person's receiving.  I know, you don't want 
me to go there because of Skilling, but I'm troubled 
because the issue of disclosure creates a Federal common 
law of what's important to tell either the public or a 
private employer?

 And I don't know how to define that issue of 

importance --

MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the real --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- other than to say 
that it's a gain that the individual's receiving or 
something the individual's doing.

a set of cases that subsumes what you're interested in, 
Justice Sotomayor, and provides guidance to the lower 
courts and to prosecutors on what can be charged.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if my son gets the 

money?  I don't get the money.  My son does.

 MR. DREEBEN:  Your son, Justice Scalia --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's an adult son.
 MR. DREEBEN:  The adult son is not you, 

personally, no.  I don't think that this is the -- the 
core of the pre-McNally cases involve personal 
conflicting financial interest.

 JUDGE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  You're --

off to read the pre-McNally cases.  And I have to tell 
you, they are a mess, I don't understand them at all.

 Is -- you speak as though it is up to us to

think is a good idea, but that's not our job.

all it does is refer us to the pre-McNally cases, I'm 
at -- I'm at sea.

 MR. DREEBEN:  I think that Petitioner and I 
agree that Congress wrote this statute with the use of 
the phrase "right of honest services" as a term of art, 
in order to refer to a body of law that it understood 
had a consistent core, and that core --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe it was wrong.  Just 

because it understood it had a consistent core, it has a 
consistent -- consistent core?

 MR. DREEBEN:  No, but it, in fact, did have 

one, and the reason that it had one, even though this 
Court held that the mail fraud statute did not protect 
the deprivation of intangible rights, there was, 
nonetheless, at the heart of the pre-McNally cases, a 
substratum of a universal common law rule of fiduciary 
duties and agency that has, as an undisputed and not at 
all vague core, that agents can't engage in undisclosed 
self-dealing.

 They can't --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Now, kickbacks and -- and 

bribes is clear.  Sometimes, the government just talks 
about conflict of interest.  Sometimes, it says, "taking 
action under conflict of interest."  Well, action is 
quite broad.

And that's -- what do you include concretely 

within this self-dealing category?  Taking or taking 
action on the basis of undisclosed information?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Ginsburg, it's when 
the same person is on two sides of the transaction, so 
you have in, for example, this case, Mr. Black is going 
to receive compensation from his company, and on behalf 
of the company, he is authorizing and entering into 
alleged noncompetition agreements that recharacterize 
the money or, in a case of Count 7, I think Justice 
Alito is absolutely correct, outright steal the money.

 He --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, could I 
ask -- could I ask you just, in terms -- the terms of 
the statute, does your theory give any independent 
substance to the word "right"?

 It seems, to me, your argument is that --

that someone who deprives another of honest services.  I 
don't know where the concept of "right" comes in, which 
is in the statute.

 MR. DREEBEN:  The right refers, 

Mr. Chief Justice, to the acknowledgment that there was 
a common law fiduciary duty that was assimilated into 
the law of fraud, really, beyond dispute.  I haven't

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the point -- I 
guess maybe this is -- maybe I asked you this before. 
The -- the right is not limited to specific legal 
obligations, but to a developing Federal common law of 
criminal liability?

 MR. DREEBEN:  No, it certainly is not, 

Mr. Chief Justice.  Congress intended to basically say 
to this Court, you have determined that intangible 
rights are not protected under the mail fraud statute. 
Only money or property is.

 Congress desired to correct the statute by 

protecting frauds that involve intangible rights, and it 
did that by using a term of art that was replete 
throughout the legislative debates, for those who read 
them, as referring to the same core body of cases that 
we rely on here.

 And those cases -- any -- any legal rule 
will have cases at the margins, in which reasonable 
jurists will debate whether --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Dreeben, I should know 

this, but refresh my memory.  The body of pre-McNally 
court of appeals cases, to what extent were they just 
public rights versus private?  Was there a substantial 
body?

public sector cases.  There was a very substantial body 
of private sector cases, many of which were cited in 
Your Honor's dissent in the McNally case.

 And those cases, I think, as Mr. -- the 

Chief Justice indicated earlier, contained, but a single 
opinion, the Lemire opinion from the D.C. circuit, that 
talked about contemplated economic harm.

 Petitioner seeks to assimilate that, 

somehow, into the notion of an intent to defraud that he 
says was inherent in the mail fraud statute everywhere 
and always before McNally.

 But if he seriously believes in that theory, 
then he would have to say that a -- an intangible rights 
defendant would have to contemplate economic harm, 
foresee economic harm in any intangible rights case, 
which would knock out, immediately, many of the critical 
pre-McNally public official cases, in which a legislator 
takes a bribe for action that doesn't implicate the 
pecuniary interests of the holder or the fiduciary duty 
or in which a union official accepts payment for someone 
who wants to apply for membership.  Membership fees are 
fixed.  It's not as if the union is losing money.

 And it's really inconceivable that Congress 
would have passed a statute to say, we don't want this 
law to be limited to property rights.  And somehow,

through the back door, smuggle in the same test of 
contemplated economic harm.

 What the right way to handle this issue 

is -- is to look at it under the rubric of materiality 
because materiality is flexible.  It considers what the 
rights are of the particular fiduciary --

JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought materiality just 

has to do with whether a false statement you make, in 
fact, causes the effect, or is likely to, that is the 
harmful effect.

 MR. DREEBEN:  But the point, Justice Breyer, 

is --

JUSTICE BREYER:  That's always there.
 MR. DREEBEN:  -- that materiality would 

function much like the Petitioner's contemplated 
economic harm requirement in private sector, private 
enterprise cases.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, and the -- and the 
reason I say with -- maybe I have the example that I 
mean now.  In the cases you just mention, the bribe 
case?  Right, the legislature is not going to gain.  The 
legislator or the briber might, but somebody will.

 And the object of those bribes was that 

there would be economic gain, and that was what -- when

could fit them into this alternative Altshuler thing, 
but now, you -- you worry me that you have a different 
test that will bring in like any failure to fill out a 
disclosure form.

 A deliberate failure to answer a box, one 

out of 1,000, for every government employee, would 
immediately -- 20 years in jail.

 MR. DREEBEN:  No, not immediately, because 

there needs to be an intent to defraud, which 
includes -- Mr. Chief Justice, if I might finish.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.
 MR. DREEBEN:  -- which includes knowledge of 

the legal duty that the employee is violating and will 
include materiality.  And these are the issues that 
screen conflicts and prosecutions in a variety of public 
corruption type cases, and across the board economic 
harm requirement, which I understood today Petitioner to 
disavow would devastate the application statute in its 
core areas of public corruption cases.

MR. ESTRADA:  Just a few points, 

Mr. Chief Justice.  First, it bear emphasis that the 
government has once again said that this is a federal 
obligation.

 This entire case was tried based on Talmudic 

debates of the ins and outs of Section 144 of the 
Delaware law of corporations.  We had motions to 
dismiss, we had briefing.  The jury was given detailed 
instructions, and this goes to all of the fraud counts, 
Justice Alito.  You cannot say that you can uphold 
something as harmless when the entire theory on which 
the case was tried actually has been changed at the 
Supreme Court of the United States.

 Relatedly, I would like to add, because the 
government said that count seven was a theft, that the 
government's theory on count seven was that the 
noncompetes were frauds from their inception, because 
the reps from Paxton and Forum, none was wanted.  And in 
fact, other counts that charged Forum and Paxton, two 
and three, you know, the jury returned a verdict of 
acquittal.  And as did Judge Sansieve on Kipnis on 
seven.

 And that makes it highly likely that -- that 
the jury convicted based on the government 's argument, 
that even though every single member of the audit

committee approved the noncompetes as a member of the 
board, that Delaware law required a separate and prior 
application to the audit committee.

 And if that's what the jury was told, you 

cannot really say that count seven is separate.

 Second --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where was that in the 

charge?

 MR. ESTRADA:  Excuse me, Your Honor?
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The charge -- the judge 

charged the jury in terms of Delaware law?

 MR. ESTRADA:  Yes, yes, Your Honor.  The 

jury was told -- let me find that, I think it's around 
page 336.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  336.
 MR. ESTRADA:  Yeah, 336 and 337, and the 

jury was given detailed instructions as to how all this 
turned on whether the transactions at issue were, quote, 
entirely fair under Delaware law.

 And the jury was further told --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it said honest 
services include fiduciary duties under corporate.

 MR. ESTRADA:  Correct.  And then you then 

went to say that -- that, you know, Delaware was 
controlling -- this is the middle of page 336 A -- under

Delaware law, a corporation's officers have these 
duties, one of them is loyalty.  Loyalty requires this 
and such under Delaware law.

 One of the things that -- that would allow 
the jury to convict was the notion that the government 
in entirely just has odds for understandable reasons, 
but this was not entirely fair.  And a transaction could 
fail to be entirely fair if every disclosure that should 
have been made in accordance with Delaware law was not 
made.

 On the second point that I wanted to make is 

the question of whether we are really embarking on the 
federal common law of materiality.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- I know you are 

running out of time, but you are speaking so fast I 
can't even follow you anymore.

 MR. ESTRADA:  I apologize, Your Honor.
 The second question I wanted to address is a 
question that you raised, Justice Sotomayor, it is false 
to say that the materiality is a filter.  Criminal law, 
just as a question of doctrine, has always looked at the 
mens rea, as the filter that takes out the culpable from 
the nonculpable.  In this case, you know, the so-called 
filter is elusory.  If you have a money or property 
case -- Your Honor, may I finish?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Finish your thought.
 MR. ESTRADA:  -- you know what the decision 

is that you are supposing to induce, whether you --
whether the person would part with the money.  Here the 
but-for world, was the decision that the employer might 
make, do I dock his pay; do I give him a demotion; do I 
fire him for all purposes, or do I simply say, that I 
would not have authorized him to be absent at all for 
the ball game.  None of those things is specified, and 
the entire test of the filter is as vague as the 
statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

The case submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:18 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
