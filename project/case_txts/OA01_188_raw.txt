CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 01-188, The Pharmaceutical Research and


Manufacturers of America v. Kevin Concannon, et al.


Mr. Phillips.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS


ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER


MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


Under 42 U.S.C. section 1396a, in subsection 


(a)(19), which is found on page 244 of the joint appendix,


Congress made absolutely clear, as a singular precondition


of all Medicaid plans, that they must assure that care and


services will be provided in a manner consistent with 

simplicity of administration and the best interests of the


recipients.  This statute does not allow Maine to use


Medicaid recipients as pawns in its effort to reduce


health care costs for those individuals who are not


eligible for Medicaid.


QUESTION:  Was this statute -- was the statute


discussed in the First Circuit opinion?


MR. PHILLIPS:  The Medicaid statute?


QUESTION:  The -- the provision you just read. 


MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, absolutely, Mr. Chief

Justice.


QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, that -- that provision


is -- is in the portion of the statute dealing with the


approval of the State plan, a State plan has to have that


consequence.  It has to serve the interest of the Medicaid


recipients.


MR. PHILLIPS:  That's true, Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  It doesn't say that each -- each --


each feature enacted by a State has to be judged


individually under that standard.  It seems to me, why


isn't it the case that if -- if a State adopts some


provision which does not comply with that provision, its


plan is no longer a conforming plan, and the Secretary has


explicit authority under the statute to -- to repeal the


Secretary's prior approval of the plan.  Why isn't that


the way this thing should work?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, the way this operates is


that this is not adopted as a part of the State's plan


that's subjected to review by the Secretary of HHS.  What 


this is, is a completely separate program that's been


adopted independently, and all it does is reach out and


hold the recipients of Medicaid as hostages in order to


extract money from out-of-state manufacturers --


QUESTION:  Yes, but do you --


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- but it's not a part of the

plan.


QUESTION:  -- but is it -- is it the case, if we


were to, let's suppose, affirm here, that the Health &


Human Services head could nonetheless call a halt to it


and say, you no longer conform with our understanding of


what's required, you're holding hostage our Medicaid


recipients and it's having a negative effect on them


because of the prior approval requirements of drugs that


otherwise wouldn't be required?  Is -- would -- would the


Secretary have that power?


MR. PHILLIPS:  I believe the Secretary might


have that power, although I would ask you to ask


Mr. Kneedler when -- when he's arguing.


QUESTION:  Well, I probably will.


(Laughter.)


MR. PHILLIPS:  But over and above that, that


doesn't -- but that's not an exclusive remedy, that's all.


QUESTION:  But how can the authorization


provision and the requirements attached to the


authorization provision, how can that conceivably not be


part of the State plan, as you say?  I mean, it seems to


me it's central to the --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean --


QUESTION:  -- there's an authorization --


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- there's a -- there's a

formalistic way of looking at it, which is that they have


a State plan, and this is not incorporated as part of the


State plan.  What this has been -- what has been done here


is to adopt a completely separate program which simply


reaches out, as I said before, and seeks to hold hostage


certain elements of it.


QUESTION:  But if you take that position, the


State plan could be rendered meaningless.  I mean, the


State plan simply becomes a kind of formal Open Sesame.


The -- there's got to be power to look, as


Justice Scalia suggests, or the State plan means nothing.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, no, there has to be a State


plan. The question is whether or not (a)(19) reflects


congressional intent that the State has to act in a


particular way. 


If it acts contrary to that way, the only 

question then is, are there multiple remedies available to


respond to it?


I think, Justice O'Connor, the answer to your


question is yes.  I think the Secretary does have that


authority to go forward, although I would ask


Mr. Kneedler --


QUESTION:  Can I ask this question:  Could the


State, if it just -- without adopting a Maine Rx program,


just decide, we want to take a good, hard look at every


sale of drugs that comes into our State, so we're going to

subject every drug manufacturer to prior approval pursuant


to 1396r-8(d), could they do that?


MR. PHILLIPS:  I -- there's an open question as


to whether they could do that.  Certainly, if you take the


most expansive reading of 1396r-8(d) you could make that


argument.  The alternative argument would be to what


extent that that violates or interferes with the formulary


formulations that are embedded in the statute.


QUESTION:  But if they do have that authority,


and you say that's an open question, doesn't it follow, a


fortiori, that they can do what they're doing here?


MR. PHILLIPS:  No, it doesn't follow a fortiori,


because what they're doing here is imposing the prior


authorization with respect to, you know, to serve purposes


that are completely unrelated to the Medicaid program. 

QUESTION:  Well, maybe my hypothetical was


completely unrelated.  They just want to be sure you can


open the caps on the drug containers, or whatever it might


be, some idiocentric -- I don't think that the -- as I


read it, I don't see anything in that provision that says


it must serve a Medicaid purpose.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think you'd have to read


that provision in the context of the entirety of the


provision providing for coverage of drugs, and I think you


have to do it in that context, and I think there are

broader issues there, but the singular problem here,


obviously, is that if you interpret the statute as broadly


as the State of Maine does to say that we can impose prior


authorization requirements, then what they can say is, we


want to extract money from manufacturers solely for the


purpose of building schools or roads or anything else that


we want to, and there's no restriction on that, and it


seems to me that if what you're saying is you want to have


prior authorization as a mechanism to deal within


Medicaid, to provide generally for a balance of interest


between Medicaid recipients, that's one thing.


But what -- what -- what Maine is doing is using


Medicaid recipients to further completely unrelated


purposes of the State, then it seems to me what you've


done is essentially ask the Federal Government to 

subsidize a program that -- that's not an appropriate one


to subsidize.


QUESTION:  Okay, what about the halfway measure,


and the halfway measure has been described by the


Government as -- as some instances of prior approval that,


that it would authorize that go beyond what the -- the --


the -- the very strict enforcement of Medicaid in a


limited sense would require.  Do you think what the


Government has -- excuse me.  Do you think what the


Government has suggested  is also beyond the authorization

of the statute?


MR. PHILLIPS:  I think it is.  I think the


better way to read the statute is to recognize that this


is designed to benefit Medicaid recipients, and the


problem is, once you get past programs that are designed


to benefit recipients themselves, it's very difficult to


see where you draw the line after that in terms of where


it goes.


QUESTION:  Well, is it correct that the


Secretary has approved a few plans in other States that do


go beyond, technically, the direct Medicaid recipients,


for instance, the people who are very close to the line


and might well become eligible soon?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Justice O'Connor, that is


correct. 
 They have approved those programs. 

QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Those programs are in litigation


as we stand here --


QUESTION:  Uh-huh.


MR. PHILLIPS:  -- as I stand here today, and --


QUESTION:  Is that possible -- I mean, as I'm


seeing this at the moment, if the State uses the


authorization program for any purpose at all, we know that


some -- that some Medicaid recipients will be hurt.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.

 QUESTION:  If a Medicaid recipient walks into a


drugstore and asks for drug X, that recipient can get it


more easily if it's not on this prior approval list than


if it is, and that being so, it must be impermissible


under Federal law, unless the object of the program


achieves a Medicaid-related purpose, so the question in


front of us is, does it?


Now, what's bothering me about that is that the


Secretary thinks some programs like Maine's are okay, and


others maybe not.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well --


QUESTION:  So in my mind the words, primary


jurisdiction, suddenly flash red.  How can I decide this


case without knowing what the Secretary thinks, and how


can -- I mean, after all, if the Secretary says this one 

is okay, that would have a big leg up under Chevron, and


if the Secretary says no, it wouldn't, so why isn't the


correct principle primary jurisdiction, which we can apply


whether the parties like it or not, and why isn't the


correct result here to send it back to the district court


and say, district court, Maine cannot put this into effect


until they ask the Secretary about it?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I don't have any particular


problem with sending it back to the district court


enjoined subject to approval by the Secretary of HHS, I

mean, if that's the way the Court wanted to resolve this


case.


QUESTION:  Well, I'm really -- that's not what I


want.  I want to have --


QUESTION:  Is that the way primary jurisdiction


works?  I thought there has to be in place some mechanism


for getting the agency to pass upon the question, a


mechanism that the person who is dismissed from Federal


court is entitled to use, and I'm not sure that exists


here.


MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't know, Justice Scalia,


that you need to be dismissing it from Federal court.  I


think it's quite possible for the --


QUESTION:  Well, even if you sit on it until


it's done --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, stay your hand pending --


QUESTION:  -- you still have to assure that


there's some -- some mechanism.  I mean, all the primary


jurisdiction cases I know of, there -- there was a means


to file a case before the agency.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I don't disagree with that,


Justice Scalia.


QUESTION:  Well, I disagree with it, so we'll


have to work it out.


QUESTION:  You can't just send them off and say,

you know, ask the Secretary, by the way, and have the


Secretary write us a letter.  I don't know that we've ever


done that.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I'm not sure that there


isn't a mechanism for asking the -- to petition the


Secretary for review.  I think if Maine wanted to get


approval of this particular program, it certainly had it


available to do that.  It didn't seek that particular


course.


And Justice Breyer, I think it's important, in


the context of trying to figure out primary jurisdiction,


we know the views of the United States with respect to


this particular program.  There may be other programs, as


Justice O'Connor identified, that come close to the line


where the Secretary would have a different view, and I 

think it's appropriate in --


QUESTION:  Is their views the Secretary's view?


QUESTION:  That's what I --


QUESTION:  I'll -- fine, I'll ask them.


MR. PHILLIPS:  I believe it is the Secretary's


view, but --


QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, as I understand your


position, so long as it benefits Medicaid recipients, any


-- any authorization scheme is okay?  I mean, a State can


say, we'll authorize your drug if you pay $5 to each

Medicaid recipient?


MR. PHILLIPS:  That is not my position.  My


basic position is that the Court doesn't need to figure


out precisely what prior authorizations are permissible in


order to decide this case, because the one thing that


should be absolutely clear is, you cannot use this


mechanism in a Federal program in order to disadvantage


the primary recipients of that program without serving any


Medicaid, sort of, related purpose.


QUESTION:  You -- you -- you may be up in a --


in a later case arguing that the -- that the reasonable


reading of the authorization requirement is -- is to


assure the safety of the drug, or the necessity of the


drug for the particular illness?


MR. PHILLIPS: 


That -- that's absolutely 

correct, Justice Scalia.  We'd -- we -- I mean, I think we


would take that position, and that we -- that you cannot


read (d)(1) completely in isolation, and -- and to the


fullest extent of the language of that, without regard to


the rest of the provisions of (d)(1) through (d)(6), and


you -- and for sure, you cannot read them without regard


to the more fundamental requirement in subsection (a) and


(a)(19), that the primary consideration must be the


beneficiaries of this program.


They are the most needy people in our country,

and the notion that you use them as a mechanism for trying


to simply lower health care costs for the Steven Kings of


the world strikes me as -- as an outrageous position for


the State of Maine to take.


QUESTION:  No, but they may not be doing that. 


They may think that the object of this is to lower the


health care costs for the moderately poor not yet on


Medicaid, and thereby prevent people from falling into the


Medicaid category.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Justice Breyer, that would be a


persuasive argument if this statute had any kind of a


tailoring mechanism to it whatsoever.  It is open to all


residents who are otherwise not covered by --


QUESTION:  Maine says those are never caught --


QUESTION: 


Administrative regulations, one of 

the things that Maine said was, you've stopped us at the


threshold.  We could have regulations that say, for


example, people who are covered by insurance will not have


access to this benefit, but on the question -- you said


would -- you would be content if the Court said, the


Secretary has to look at it, until then it's no good.


Would you have -- this is the -- your lawsuit. 


Could you have gone to the Secretary and say, said,


Secretary, we want you to look at this, the Secretary


says, I'm busy with a dozen other things and I don't want

to look at it?


MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't know of any statutory


mechanism for a third party to come in and ask the


Secretary to review a State plan.  I don't know that -- I


don't know that there's anything that prevents anyone from


sending a letter to the Secretary to ask him to take, to


undertake that.  That said, the Secretary obviously knows


about this particular scheme.


QUESTION:  Yes, and the Secretary, you said that


the -- at least the SG supports your view that this --


that this program of Maine's is impermissible, but the SG


also told us, essentially, that this case wasn't ripe, so


we shouldn't have granted cert.  I mean, that was the SG's


first position, that this is a -- we don't know what, in


fact, the Maine scheme is, because it was never -- it 

never went into effect, because you got an injunction.


MR. PHILLIPS:  But the one thing that we


absolutely know about the Maine scheme, and it -- Justice


Breyer described it, is that every Medicaid recipient is


placed at risk by the prior authorization scheme.


QUESTION:  Yes, but Mr. Phillips, are there any


findings that any Medicaid recipient has actually been


harmed by this program?  I -- this is a --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, because there was a


joinder --

 QUESTION:  -- one of the things that bothers me,


I don't know that we have any findings by the district


court as to what the real impact will be.  I know your --


your -- the Government says this is going to happen --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, if --


QUESTION: -- but if everybody agreed, for


example, to join the Maine program, maybe it may work out


fine.


MR. PHILLIPS:  The -- I don't have to go to the


United States.  The State of Maine concedes in its brief


at page 25, Maine Rx can be expected to trigger prior


authorization more often than previously.


QUESTION:  Yes, but it may well be that prior


authorization would, in turn, lead to some solution


between the drug companies and the State as to how this 

will all be handled.  I don't think the fact they agreed


that it would trigger prior authorization necessarily


proves the conclusion that the Medicaid recipients will be


harmed.  It may well be true, but I'm just not sure --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, but --


QUESTION:  -- the record supports that --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- as of this stage of the case.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, but there'd be no way to


enjoin the program before going into effect, which means

that you essentially have to wait until actual Medicaid


recipients are deprived of drugs in order to be able to


implement -- to stop a program that on its face does


nothing to benefit Medicaid beneficiaries, and clearly


poses a serious threat to them.


I -- if we go back to Hines v. Davidowitz


language, it talks about the full achievement of Congress'


objectives.


QUESTION:  But it only opposes the very threat


that the statute by its own terms authorizes.  That's the


threat.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, but it only authorizes --


QUESTION:  The threat of prior approval which


the statute authorizes.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Sure. 


It -- to serve Medicaid-

related purposes.


QUESTION:  But the statute doesn't say that.


MR. PHILLIPS:  I -- I understand that, Justice


Stevens, but the point is that if you read the statute,


and it's essentially six, those six words, to say that the


State has unlimited authority to do that, it strikes me as


inconceivable that Congress would have allowed this entire


mechanism to be available for the State to come in and


simply to raise revenue from out-of-State manufacturers. 


There is no rational basis for that kind of a conclusion.

 The much more sensible way to narrow the statute


is to say, if it serves other Medicaid purposes, then


that's an appropriate way to proceed.  If it doesn't, then


it seems to me the -- the Court has to conclude that the


best interests of the beneficiaries ultimately has to


trump here under these circumstances.


QUESTION:  Mr. Phillips, do you also rely on the


Commerce Clause as somehow prohibiting what Maine has


done --


argument?


MR. PHILLIPS:  I --


QUESTION:  -- and if so, how do you make that


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, Justice O'Connor, we have


three components to that argument.  The thing that is -- I


concede at the outset that there is no case at this Court 

that directly controls in either direction.  This is a


unique scheme that's been adopted here, and -- and --


QUESTION:  Is there anything in the Commerce


Clause that prevents a State from addressing within its


State boundaries requirements for dispensing prescription


drugs?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, when the entire burden of


the program falls out of State, it seems to us that this


creates at least a serious question about what's going on


here.  The --

 QUESTION:  Well, any State regulation, a State


wants to have a special rule for a bicycle, you could say,


well, that increases the cost to the manufacturer and the


other States have to pay for it, so I'm -- I'm not sure


that that reasoning, which was in your brief, carries the


day.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I --


QUESTION:  Like a special fuel requirement for


automobiles?  Do you think California can set certain


standards, that of course it affects the auto


manufacturers?  They don't make them in California.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  There's no question that


States are free to create certain types of regulations


that are different from other States, and that's -- and


that's not the full sweep of the argument that we're 

making here.  What -- what --


QUESTION:  That's not what happened here.


MR. PHILLIPS:  No, that's --


QUESTION:  I don't understand the Commerce


Clause argument.


MR. PHILLIPS:  I wouldn't presume to try to


teach you about the Commerce Clause, Justice O'Connor, but


the reality of what's happening here is much more like the


West Lynn Creamery case, where what you're talking about


is the payment of a subsidy, all by out-of-state entities,

in order to benefit -- in that case it was to benefit in-


state competitors.  There are no in-state competitors in


this case.


QUESTION:  Oh, I've got quite --


QUESTION:  Isn't that a --


QUESTION:  -- a problem with the argument.


QUESTION:  That was the problem.


MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  I'm sorry.


MR. PHILLIPS:  I didn't hear --


QUESTION:  Well -- no, let me yield to Justice


Kennedy.


QUESTION:  I had thought you might make the


argument -- I didn't see it in your brief, maybe I missed


it -- that this is just so burdensome on manufacturers to 

go from State to State to State that it's just an -- it's


an undue burden on an interstate transaction, period.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Under Pike v. Bruce Church.


QUESTION:  And -- and Southern Pacific v.


Arizona.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Yeah.  The reason we didn't raise


that argument is that we thought that we would require --


in order to make that argument we would require more


factual findings by the district court --


QUESTION:  Right.

 MR. PHILLIPS:  -- in order to get into it,


because there's a balancing component to that --


QUESTION:  The other thing I wondered about is,


if you've come over from Vermont or New York you can't


have the advantage of this.  I suppose it's not


necessarily in your interest to argue that it has to be


expanded to other States, but I -- it seems to me that


also was a questionable part of the program.


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I do think one of the real


problems with this program is that some States will adopt


this kind of a scheme and other States won't adopt this


kind of a scheme, which means that you're going to have


inherent discrimination with respect to consumers.  Some


consumers will benefit to the detriment of other


consumers, and it does seem to me that -- that the theory 

of West Lynn Creamery was designed to say that you don't


just look at the competitors and the relationships between


them, you have to look more broadly at the manufacturers,


the wholesalers, all the retailers, and all the way down


to the consumers, and if you have the kind of


discriminatory effects here where Maine seizes for itself


all the economic benefits and imposes on -- on everyone


else the economic burdens, that in that circumstance this


runs afoul of the core --


QUESTION:  The -- wasn't this --

 MR. PHILLIPS:  -- command of the Commerce


Clause.


QUESTION:  -- one of the reasons the First


Circuit vacated the injunction, the fact that there just


hadn't been any factual development here as to what was


happening?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, that was part -- yes, to be


sure, Mr. Chief Justice, that's part of what they said. 


On the other hand, if you accept our basic theory about


the clear discriminatory implication of the way the scheme


operates, that kind of an operation is per se invalid. 


That's what the Court held in -- in West Lynn Creamery.


QUESTION:  But isn't the West Lynn Creamery


difficulty in your argument that here, unlike West Lynn,


there are no entities within the same category, 

manufacturers, e.g., producers, for example, some of whom


are being discriminated in favor of others?  What's going


on here is not discrimination by the State within a given


class to benefit the members of the class within the


State.  What is going on here is a scheme which happens to


fall on certain individuals in a manufacturing class who,


incidentally, are out of State, for the benefit of people


in a different class, that is, the consumers, who are in-


State, and West Lynn doesn't govern that.


MR. PHILLIPS:  No, it doesn't directly cover

that, and I conceded that at the outset.


On the other hand, the point here is that there


are entities out there in the stream that are within


Maine, and on whom this burden is not imposed.  It was


chosen to impose the burden strictly on the manufacturers,


and it is done in a way that will create disparate impacts


with respect to consumers in Maine versus consumers in


other -- in other States, but --


QUESTION:  That is -- I mean, that's a -- that's


a necessary consequence of the prior approval scheme. 


That -- you're going to have that argument no -- no matter


how -- no matter how prior approval --


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, and -- and if it operates


within Medicaid, it seems to me that there's no -- there's


no significant argument to be made there, because Congress 

has basically taken it over.


QUESTION:  Simply because you've got to have it.


MR. PHILLIPS:  But otherwise -- and one last


point I'd like to make, which is simply that the Commerce


Clause issue does not need to be addressed in the event


the Court holds that the, that the Maine statute is


preempted.


If -- I'd like to reserve the balance of my


time.


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Phillips.

 Mr. Kneedler.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE


MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The Department of Health & Human Services has


articulated a position on two issues that are directly


relevant to this case, and those positions are set forth


in the letter to the State Medicaid directors that is set


forth in an appendix to our brief at page, I believe it's


page 45a it begins.  The first of those --


QUESTION:  Well, does that lead to a conclusion


as to its view as to this program that we're considering? 


Is it valid, or isn't it?


MR. KNEEDLER: 


If I could -- there are two 

problems --


QUESTION:  As far as the Secretary is concerned.


MR. KNEEDLER:  There are two problems with


the -- with the State program under this Medicaid


director's letter that the Secretary sent out.  The first


is that it's the position of the department that a plan


such as this, which imposes a prior approval requirement


for Medicaid patients, if the drug manufacturer does not


pay rebates with respect to sales to non-Medicaid


patients, that sort of change is a material change in the

State's plan which requires the approval of a plan


amendment.


There is a regulation that we cite in our brief


at page 28, and quote, that requires that, and that, by


the way, I think could be the -- the mechanism effectively


for a prior jurisdiction sort of approach.


QUESTION:  I see that, but I -- I mean, I'm a


little bit at sea.  I absolutely wouldn't call it primary


jurisdiction. The label doesn't matter, but the -- the --


but -- now, where I'm -- where I'm -- where I'm at sea is


in figuring out whether it's possible to say, and you


don't say this in your brief, that -- that a program like


Maine's, which is arguably, arguably wrong, or arguably


right, that it can't go into effect without the prior


approval of HHS. 


Now, that's going to require me to look 

up the approval statutes, a whole lot of things that


weren't briefed.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it's -- the -- the -- we


have cited this regulation in our brief, and the -- and


under Allens v. Robbins the Secretary's, or the -- the


Secretary's interpretation's set forth in the brief.  It's


also set forth in the Medicaid director's letter.


QUESTION:  After the Secretary acted under it,


then.  What are you bothering us for?  If the Secretary


has power under this -- under this regulation to stop this

plan from going forward because it amounts to an amendment


of the -- of the plan, and an amendment that hasn't been


approved, the -- the Secretary has the power to stop it. 


Why -- you know, why --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well --


QUESTION: 

--  

do we have to get involved?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, if I could just answer that


and then move to the second question, because I think it's


related, the regulation identifies what -- that material


changes in the plan have to be submitted for an amendment. 


The Secretary's enforcement authority comes from a


different source, which is in 42 U.S.C. 1396c, which


allows the Secretary to cut off funds in whole or in part


if a State is operating under a plan that requires an


amendment because of those changes, so -- but I --

QUESTION:  Well then, why doesn't the Secretary


do it?


MR. KNEEDLER:  I think it was -- it's entirely


reasonable -- first of all, that's a matter of enforcement


discretion under Heckler v. Cheney, and at least for the


time being, why this -- while this case is under -- is


under submission, the Secretary has not -- has not


proceeded.


QUESTION:  Well, but I think the Secretary is


ignoring one serious problem, and I suspect it's behind

Justice Scalia's question.  It's certainly in my mind. 


It's one thing for the Secretary to act within enforcement


power.  It's one thing for the Secretary to interpret the


regs by, the statute by regulations that are subject to


Chevron deference, but if the Secretary does neither one


of those things, and from one side of the Secretary's


mouth we hear, well, yes, some prior approval beyond what


is strictly necessary for the direct benefit of Medicaid


recipients is okay, but this goes a little bit too far,


courts are then placed in the position of saying, well,


can we read the statute so precisely as to say that the


Secretary's position of what is okay is okay and, by going


this step further, there's a violation of the statute?


We are placed in a very difficult position, in


effect by the Secretary, by you, in being asked to draw a 

line with a very fine pencil, whereas if the Secretary


wants to act under administrative authority, presumably


that's the end of it.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, in going forward, I mean,


the Secretary issued this Medicaid director's letter in


September, after the Court had granted review --


QUESTION:  Ah.


MR. KNEEDLER:  -- because this was an area that


required attention.  Going forward, we -- we expect


that -- that States will submit their proposals to the

Secretary as plan amendments --


QUESTION:  Well, is there some --


QUESTION:  And --


QUESTION:  Is there some mechanism by -- or


authority by which we could somehow refer this back to the


district court to seek some kind of information from the


Secretary?


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, here's the way I think that


it could proceed.


QUESTION:  How -- how could we do it?  I don't


know of a doctrine but --


MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I think the procedural


posture of this case would allow that, and let me explain


why.  The Secretary's second position in this case, which


I wanted to also make sure I articulated, which was that 

a -- that a proposed, or a plan such as this, which


provides for rebates for non-Medicaid patients, still must


serve some Medicaid purpose.


In the district court, when the district court


entered what is only a preliminary injunction at this


stage, at page 71 of the petition appendix, the district


court pointed out that the State had not argued that its


proposal served any Medicaid purpose.  As the preliminary


injunction was entered, it was entered on that premise. 


The court of appeals then speculated that perhaps it does

serve a Medicaid purpose, but looking back at when the


preliminary injunction was entered, it was entered on the


premise that it served none, and we think, and the


Secretary believes that a plan must at least serve some


Medicaid purpose.


QUESTION:  But as I understand it, Mr. Kneedler,


it is -- it is at least theoretically possible that the


Secretary could approve this very plan.


MR. KNEEDLER:  If -- on the proper showing.  The


rationale --


QUESTION:  Right, of course.  It needs more


facts.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  The rationale adopted by


the district court was the rationale that some --


QUESTION:  Yes. 


It may have now advanced a 

Medicaid-related purpose that may or may not be


sufficient.


MR. KNEEDLER:  That's -- but we believe that the


purpose that has been advanced does not save this statute. 


The purpose that has been advanced and was identified by


the court of appeals was a purpose that some people who


were close to being Medicaid-eligible will be forced to


spend more on drugs, may become Medicaid-eligible, and


therefore cost the Medicaid program more money.  That's a


Medicaid-related purpose.  The problem is, the State

statute is not tailored to people who are close to the


poverty line.


QUESTION:  So is the procedure --


QUESTION:  Would you -- would you finish your


response to me --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  What --


QUESTION:  -- to tell me --


MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  -- what it is that you think we could


do?


MR. KNEEDLER:  If the Court reversed the court


of appeals decision, in effect affirmed the district


court's injunction, which was entered on the basis that


the plan serves no Medicaid-related purpose, the State


program would be enjoined.


At that point the State of Maine could submit


the program to the Secretary of Health & Human Services


along with any justifications for the plan, such as


those -- there are two additional ones that have been


raised in its brief in this Court for the first time, and


we think that's how it should play out.


This is a -- right now, the case presents a very


narrow issue on a preliminary injunction.


QUESTION:  Why couldn't that procedure be


followed by affirming, and saying there should be a

hearing in the district court on these very issues that


you're raising, and both sides would present the facts?


MR. KNEEDLER:  We don't think it would be a


hearing in the district court.  We believe it should be


submitted to the Secretary, because a plan amendment is


required, but we do believe that -- that the petitioner


has made a sufficient showing based on the, on what the


district court said, that this plan, that Maine had


offered no justification, no Medicaid justification for


the plan.


QUESTION:  Do you read the statutory


authorization for prior approval to mean prior approval


only if there's a Medicaid-related benefit?


MR. KNEEDLER:  We -- we do.  The legislative


history of the prior approval position --

QUESTION:  You rely entirely on legislative


history for that?


MR. KNEEDLER:  No, and also there are two other


provisions of the act which we think are relevant, on the


one hand, a(19), which talks about the best interests of


the patients, but on the other hand, a(30) -- this is


1396a(30)(A), which says that a State plan must provide


for methods of payment that advance efficiency and economy


in the Medicaid program.


We think both of those speak to interests within

the Medicaid program and require in the prior approval


process, as well as in the administration of the plan


generally, weighing the interests of the Medicaid


beneficiaries against the broader institutional interests


of the Medicaid program.  If there was no Medicaid-related


purpose requirement at all, then a State could impose a


prior approval requirement if the drug company contributes


money to the art museum or to the State highway program.


We think that under this Court's decision in Dublino, the


State must be pursuing a purpose in common with the


Federal Government, a Medicaid-related purpose.  What --


what the scope --


QUESTION:  Mr. Kneedler, it -- it was the


Government's first position that this Court ought to let


the case ripen, and now you -- you are necessarily taking 

a position in this lawsuit because we granted cert, but


the Government made a pretty good argument essentially


that this case wasn't ripe.


MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, ripe for this Court's


review, but we now -- we now believe that, given that the


director's letter that was sent out in September, that


there is a basis, there's an articulation of the


Secretary's position both on plan amendments and the


requirement of a Medicaid-related purpose that -- that


this Court could properly dispose of the case in the

narrow -- in the narrow way I suggested which, of course,


would also obviate any requirement to consider the


Commerce Clause question.


Things have evolved in the Secretary's


evaluation of this and, as Justice O'Connor, I think


pointed out, the Secretary has since approved a Michigan


plan amendment under this same general approach.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.


Mr. Hagler, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. HAGLER


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


MR. HAGLER:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it please


the Court:


People without insurance are charged more for


prescription drugs than any other purchaser in the market, 

often much more.  Patients who are forced to pay cash at


the pharmacy are those least able to absorb these high


prices.  To ameliorate this hardship, Maine's legislature


will embrace a market-based approach used by other large


third party purchasers to leverage its purchasing power


under -- as a third party purchaser in Medicaid to obtain


price relief for the uninsured in Maine.


QUESTION:  And you think that's one of the valid


uses of the authorization provision?  You think that's why


it was included in the statute, so that a State could --

could shake down drug companies to lower prices to other


people?


MR. HAGLER:  I concede that -- that Congress


never thought that Maine might use prior authorization in


the way that Maine Rx anticipates it.  However, what


Congress said --


QUESTION:  You can use it for anything at all? 


Could -- could you use it to -- to say, we -- you know,


you -- you have to pay each member of the Maine


legislature $100 a year?  Could -- could you put that in


there?


MR. HAGLER:  As you get further and further for


the purposes of -- of providing health care, you approach


uses a -- of prior authorization that might offend


Congress and this Court, but preemption is a question for 

Congress.


QUESTION:  Well, did Maine offer in the district


court, in the hearings on whether a preliminary injunction


should issue, a justification for how the Maine Rx program


benefits Medicaid patients?


MR. HAGLER:  We did not so argue in the district


court.


QUESTION:  Okay.


QUESTION:  When you say -- who does it apply to? 


That is, the statute says it applies to qualified

residents.  They define that as people with a Maine Rx


enrollment card, and now I don't know who those people


are.  Is it virtually everybody in the State?  Is it a


small subclass, those who don't have insurance?  Who is


it?


MR. HAGLER:  Well, it's -- it's those without


insurance.


QUESTION:  So that's a fairly small group.  What


percentage of that -- it's 15 percent of the people of


Maine?


MR. HAGLER:  If -- we estimate 22 percent.  The


AARP had a different --


QUESTION:  Okay, so 15, 22 percent.  Now, if


that being so, it sounds to me like it could be like the


one that was approved, or maybe it's not like the one that 

was approved.


MR. HAGLER:  And you don't know --


QUESTION:  It sounds like a case, to me, that


has to go to the Secretary, whose job it is to approve it,


rather than having us fly blind.


MR. HAGLER:  Well, here's the difference between


what the Secretary approved and what the Maine -- and --


and what he's proposing with respect to Maine Rx and the


plan amendments.  What the Secretary approved was a


program that's a demonstration project, a waiver program,

allowing more people into Medicaid notwithstanding the


fact that they're ineligible.


QUESTION:  That has been approved for Maine?


MR. HAGLER:  Approved and struck down by the


D.C. Circuit on Christmas Eve.  The Secretary and the


Solicitor General, the Secretary and the Solicitor General


identified the fact that that program helped people up to


300 percent of poverty.  Without the Healthy Maine


program, the demonstration project, Maine Rx is now the


only program that helps those people.


QUESTION:  That isn't an answer to my question. 


The answer to my -- my question was, it sounds to me like


a program that the Secretary might approve or might not


approve, and so why should we fly blind?  Why isn't it the


case that you can't put this program into effect, given 

Federal law, without the approval of the Secretary?


Now, when she approves it or disapproves it,


they can argue about whether that was legal.


MR. HAGLER:  Well, the Secretary is suggesting


that the State of Maine seek a plan amendment, but by


definition, a plan amendment allows -- a plan amendment is


something that, if we sought a plan amendment to run Maine


Rx it would necessarily be allowed by the Medicaid


statute.  42 -- the Medicaid statute, 1396 section --

argument that --


MR. HAGLER:  We don't --


QUESTION:  -- even if the Secretary disapproved


this, were it a plan, we still could do it?  If that's


your argument, I'll answer that question.  That's a legal


question.  I think it's an easy one to answer.  In my


mind, the answer's no. 


MR. HAGLER:  Well, if the Secretary were to --


QUESTION:  Now, you can explain why it shouldn't


be no, but I want to know if that's what I'm supposed to


decide.


MR. HAGLER:  It's not what you're supposed to


decide.  The Secretary has not acted, other than speaking


to this Court through the brief of the Solicitor General. 


The Medicaid statute provides a mechanism for the 

Secretary to tell the State when it is running its


Medicaid program in a fashion which violates the


provisions of the Medicaid statute.  That is --


QUESTION:  Well, but is this actually a -- the -


- the State -- the State of Maine running its Medicaid


program, it --it's a freestanding statute, isn't it?


MR. HAGLER:  It's an entirely different --


correct, it's an entirely different statute.  We don't


believe we need a plan amendment to seek approval to run


the Maine Rx program.

 QUESTION:  That's fine.  So then you want me to


decide the question of whether it would be possible to


have this statute even if the Secretary, were it an


amendment to the Medicaid plan, would say no, okay?  I say


that's a legal question we can decide.


MR. HAGLER:  But you should not decide that now.


QUESTION:  Is that what you think we should


decide now?  Are you following what I'm saying or not?  Am


I not --


MR. HAGLER:  Not precisely.


QUESTION:  I can decide the question if the


Sec -- you're saying -- suppose the Secretary's approval


makes no difference.  Let us assume the Secretary would


disapprove it.


MR. HAGLER:  Okay.


QUESTION:  There would -- a legal question, can


you have this statute anyway?


MR. HAGLER:  Yes.


QUESTION:  Okay.  That's what you think we


should decide?


MR. HAGLER:  I believe that's what I --


QUESTION:  All right.  If that's what you think


we should decide, fine, then why isn't the answer to that


question clearly no?  You would have a Federal statute, it


uses the Federal program, the Secretary thinks it's

contrary to the Federal program, the Secretary's views are


within her authority, let's say, under the -- under the


Federal program, and so a State cannot put something into


effect --


MR. HAGLER:  Well --


QUESTION:  -- that is so clearly contrary to the


Medicaid program using the Medicaid device. 


MR. HAGLER:  The question that this -- the first


question that this Court certified was, as described in


the Secretary's brief, is whether the Federal Medicaid


statute allows the use of that authority under the statute


to compel -- the prior authorization authority --


QUESTION:  And I assume it --


MR. HAGLER:  And he says yes.


QUESTION: 


And it would be a waste of time and 

money for us to send it back to the Secretary, at least if


we are convinced on the basis of the briefs submitted


here, that even if the Secretary did approve it, that


approval would be invalid.  I mean, you would concede


that --

send it back to the Secretary if, when the Secretary


approves it, there is then a lawsuit and we say, oh, by


the way, he couldn't approve this.


MR. HAGLER:  Right.


QUESTION:  This goes too far.  We might as well


decide that now, no?


MR. HAGLER:  You can decide the preemption


question now, and I think that the Court should, and the


preemption question is whether Congress intended to


prohibit what Maine has here done.


When Congress legislates against the backdrop of


the preemption doctrine and it give -- gave to the State


the discretion to subject to prior authorization any


covered outpatient drug, it qualified that discretion


hardly at all. 


The only qualifications are the two 

provisions, the procedural safeguards that require that if


prior authorization is sought --


QUESTION:  Doesn't the Secretary have some


discretion in this area as to whether to say it's good or


bad, the -- the Maine plan, or are you saying it's simply


not his business?


MR. HAGLER:  It's Congress' business --


QUESTION:  Well, right.


MR. HAGLER:  -- to set the line --


QUESTION:  But did Congress in what it enacted

leave any room for the Secretary to have some discretion


here?


MR. HAGLER:  What Congress enacted was the


opportunity for the Secretary to tell the State that when


it's begun a program or is operating its Medicaid program


out of compliance with the Medicaid statute, that it


believes that that's the case, and the provision provides


for a fair hearing for the State, we get together with the


Secretary, we try to work it out.  If we can't, and if the


Secretary -- if Maine persists in wanting to run the


program, and the Secretary disapproves the program, then


his remedy is to withhold money from the State and --


QUESTION:  But if-- if it's a freestanding


pro -- if it's a freestanding statute, not part of Maine's


Medicaid, how can the Secretary disapprove a freestanding 

statute?


MR. HAGLER:  What he can do is look to the


effect of what happens once Maine Rx is implemented, and


look to the effect on the Medicaid beneficiaries as to


whether or not they'll be harmed.


QUESTION:  Well, the Secretary theoretically


could conclude already that to require prior approval for


every prescription drug will have negative effects on


Medicaid recipients who otherwise would not have to seek


prior approval, because there's quite a bit in the record

about the difficulty when prior approval must be obtained.


MR. HAGLER:  Oh, I submit there -- that


there's -- I disagree with respect to the record.  I


believe that there's very little in the record which


demonstrates that there will be any harm to Maine Rx


beneficiaries, harm to their health, once Maine Rx is


imposed, and should the State ultimately impose prior


authorizations under the Maine Rx statute.


You have lodging materials which are untested. 


The fact of the matter is, if we were to return to the


district court we could demonstrate, based on a vigorous


use of prior authorization in the 2 years that have


intervened the granting of the injunction and today, that


we are imposing prior authorization and we are answering


the phone in less than 2 hours, and that Medicaid patients 

are, in fact, not being harmed.


We -- our position is that to survive a facial


challenge the petitioner must demonstrate that any use of


prior authorization, as contemplated by the Maine Rx --


QUESTION:  Well, I question whether this is


correctly described as a facial challenge.  You think of a


facial challenge more in terms of somebody who has a --


First Amendment implications, or at least criminal law


applications.  This -- as I read the First Circuit's


opinion, although they talked about a facial challenge, I

thought what they were saying was, we just don't know


enough, since the thing had never gone into effect to


uphold the injunction.


MR. HAGLER:  No, and -- and what the First


Circuit didn't know was how the program would actually be


implemented, and there are many ways of implementing the


program that not only will not cause harm to Medicaid


beneficiaries, but which will affirmatively advance the


purposes of Medicaid.


QUESTION:  Is the program now in a -- being


operated?


MR. HAGLER:  It is not, and the reason that it's


not is because the --


QUESTION:  The way you spoke, I thought you had


some current experience.


MR. HAGLER:  We do have current experience with


the use of prior authorization to save Medicaid money.


QUESTION:  For Medicaid, for Medicaid patients.


MR. HAGLER:  For Medicaid, correct, and as a


result of that experience we know much more about our


abilities and would be able to describe to the district


court much more about our abilities should the First


Circuit --


QUESTION:  Why wasn't the plan put into effect

 MR. HAGLER:  The mandate was stayed pending --


QUESTION:  Oh, I see.


MR. HAGLER:  -- for a writ of certiorari, so


we've -- we've not had an opportunity to implement the


program.


QUESTION:  But the Federal Government, with


reference to Medicaid, certainly thinks prior


authorization is an important enforcement mechanism and


now you're saying oh, don't worry about it, it doesn't


make much difference.


MR. HAGLER:  Well --


QUESTION:  That's hard for me to accept.


MR. HAGLER:  Well, the Federal Government agrees


that prior authorization -- prior authorization is


undeniably a cost-saving measure. 


That's the primary 

purpose why Congress permitted the States broad discretion


to impose prior authorization.


Under the Maine Rx program, what the State is


saying to manufacturers is, please negotiate with us, and


if you don't negotiate with us, we will review the drugs


that you manufacture to see and determine, on a drug-by-


drug basis, whether it would be appropriate to subject


those drugs to prior authorization.


QUESTION:  But the very reason you put that on


the bargaining table is because you know it's going to --

 it's going to slow down the sales of some of these drugs. 


Incidentally, I -- and you can answer that.  I take it


that if Company X has 10 different drugs, and it can't


agree with you on the rebate price for just one, that all


of those drugs must have prior authorization, or am I


wrong about that?


MR. HAGLER:  I believe that you're wrong.  I


believe that -- that the Secretary has the discretion --


QUESTION:  I read the Government's brief to the


contrary, but I'll take a look at it.


MR. HAGLER:  Yeah, I believe --


QUESTION:  You're representing that it's drug-


by-drug, so a company can agree with you as to nine of the


drugs, and those will not be subject to prior


authorization, but only the tenth drug, as to which you 

can't agree, will be subject to prior authorization?


MR. HAGLER:  I believe --


QUESTION:  That's your representation?


MR. HAGLER:  As to the -- I believe that our


administrative rules demonstrate, proposed administrative


rules that the Department hasn't enacted because the


injunction has been imposed allow the Department of Human


Services of the State of Maine to look on a drug-by-drug


basis as to whether any particular drug ought to be


subjected to prior --

MR. HAGLER:  In other words, if Pfizer were to


agree to provide a rebate for some of its drugs but not


all of its drugs, must we look to the other drugs --


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. HAGLER:  -- and determine prior


authorization?  The statute contemplates a negotiation. 


The Commissioner is to use his best efforts to negotiate


with manufacturers in order to --


QUESTION:  I take that to be a yes?


MR. HAGLER: 


The answer is yes. 

QUESTION:  You can keep all of their drugs off


unless they give you what you want for some of them?

QUESTION:  To -- to the Medicaid --


MR. HAGLER:  Oh, the Medicaid recipients, the


Medicaid recipients themselves pay nothing, but it can


save money in, and it's probable that it will save money


in the Medicaid program, and the reason for that --


QUESTION:  I understand, because some people


won't come into the program who otherwise would come in.


MR. HAGLER:  Well, that's what the First Circuit


picked up on, but the other reason and the other method in


which it would save Medicaid money is, it would result in


shifting prescribing behavior from more expensive drugs to


less expensive drugs.  The Commissioner, under


subsection --


QUESTION:  But doesn't that depend on who you


make the deals with?  Maybe the more expensive drug --


drugs we're willing to make this deal with you, and the


less expensive not willing.


MR. HAGLER:  Subsection 13 of the Maine Rx


statute gives to the Commissioner the discretion to run


the Medicaid program and the Maine Rx program in a


coordinated manner so as to enhance efficiencies in both,


and so I believe that the Commissioner would never impose


prior authorization on the cheapest drug in a therapeutic

class even if that manufacturer didn't provide a Maine Rx


rebate, because it would be silly to do so.  He's got a

QUESTION:  I've known some silly administrators.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  The point is, he could do it.  The


point is, he could -- you're - you're -- you're -- you're


troubled by a -- by a statute which would allow a denial


of authorization unless the drug company pays $100 to each


member of the -- of the legislature.  I -- I gather you -


- you acknowledge that -- that the authorization


requirement in the statute has some unstated limitation


upon it, or don't you acknowledge that?


MR. HAGLER:  I believe that -- that under the


Court's preemption analysis we look to the primary 

purposes of the Medicaid statute and you seek to determine


what Congress intended.


QUESTION:  Does the authorization provision have


some unstated limitation upon it, a limitation that is not


in that sole provision alone?


MR. HAGLER:  I believe that it doesn't, but even


if it does --


QUESTION:  It doesn't, so $100 to each


legislator is okay?

Congress, Congress has the ability to act.


QUESTION:  The real question is whether it has


an unstated limitation that's sufficiently clear that it


preempts the State law.


MR. HAGLER:  I'm sorry.


QUESTION:  The real question is whether the


unstated limitation is sufficiently clear to be preemptive


of a State statute to the contrary.


MR. HAGLER:  That's -- that's correct.


QUESTION:  Well, how is Congress --


MR. HAGLER:  The language of the statute is, a


State may subject to prior authorization any covered


outpatient drug.


QUESTION:  Well, how could Congress --


MR. HAGLER:  Every --


QUESTION:  Sorry.  No, go ahead.  Finish,


please.


MR. HAGLER:  Indeed, every outpatient drug could


be subjected to prior authorization.  That, too, would be


silly, but the power is that broad.


QUESTION:  Now, that's what I want to know. 


Why?  I mean, how could Congress possibly want a statute


which would hurt the Medicaid patients at -- no argument


it wouldn't hurt some of them, and has nothing to be said


for helping anyone related to Medicaid?

QUESTION:  I understand that.


MR. HAGLER:  Right.


QUESTION:  So how can I decide this case without


knowing whether the people in charge of the statute agree


with you about that, as they might, or you might negotiate


some implementation of how to have regulations that they


can agree to, or, or, or, the possibilities are endless. 


How can I decide in your favor, in other words, without


knowing, the same question, what the Secretary thinks?


MR. HAGLER:  Because the Secretary can act if


the injunction -- if the First Circuit's decision is 

affirmed, the Secretary can act, and tell the State of


Maine we believe that you will harm Medicaid beneficiaries


and we will take your money away.


QUESTION:  But suppose --


MR. HAGLER:  But the Secretary hasn't acted. 


The Secretary has asked this Court to approve his notions


of what Maine Rx might look like if it were more limited


in scope in terms of the number of beneficiaries, but he


hasn't defined for the Court how to set the line.

says that each Medicaid beneficiary shall pay an


additional tax of $50 a year.  You say that the only way


to get rid of that law, which would certainly contravene


the -- the whole purpose of Medicaid.  The only way to get


rid of it is to go to the Secretary and say, since this


law is an amendment of the State's plan, you should


approve it, it requires your approval.


MR. HAGLER:  Now, there --


QUESTION:  They couldn't strike that down as


just being contrary to the --


MR. HAGLER:  No, it's contrary to the statute.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. HAGLER:  Medicaid beneficiaries can't be


required to pay more than a nominal co-pay.


QUESTION:  Okay, so --


MR. HAGLER:  Congress thought --


QUESTION:  So the only remedy for something that


is contrary to the statute is not going through the


Secretary, that some things that are contrary to the


statute can be attacked directly, as is being done here.


MR. HAGLER:  But -- but I'm not convinced that


from the text of the statute you can find an intent --


QUESTION:  Okay. That's a different question.


MR. HAGLER:  -- on the part of Congress to


prohibit this, and even if it were to -- Congress were to

prohibit using Maine Rx like prior authorizations for some


purpose wholly unrelated to health care, when you get


closer and closer to something approaching what the


Secretary in fact does approve of, how can a court set the


line?  The question really is --


QUESTION:  That's the merits question, rather


than whether we have, you know, power to -- to move at


all, so long as the Secretary can handle the problem by


denying approval.


MR. HAGLER:  The Secretary has indicated that


he'll handle the problem, or he's expressed his views


about what the program is.  The Court should wait to see


whether the -- I mean, the Court should allow the


Secretary to --


QUESTION:  Can I ask you this question:  I


thought you would agree that, if it were clear as a matter


of fact that this program was going to harm Medicaid


recipients, that we would have power to enjoin the


program?


MR. HAGLER:  Yes, but it's not -- I do agree


with that.


QUESTION:  So your argument, as I understand it,


it's an unresolved factual question whether, in fact,


these adverse consequences would follow?


MR. HAGLER:  That's correct.  We have -- there's

no facts in the record, and -- and this -- this is a


facial challenge in which my colleague has to demonstrate


that they are in no way -- there's no possibility of


implementing the program in a way which doesn't cause harm


to --


QUESTION:  Well, I may not agree with that


statement, but at least they have to make a showing there


in fact will be an adverse effect.


MR. HAGLER:  Some showing.


QUESTION:  Yes.


MR. HAGLER:  And the only showing that the


district court seized upon is this notion that, by


definition, prior authorization imposes some sort of


procedural impediment to free access to all drugs on


behalf of Medicaid patients, but the --

QUESTION:  I thought you -- I thought you had


acknowledged that the authorization requirement must not


merely not harm Medicaid recipients, but that the


authorization must serve the purpose of helping Medicaid


recipients. Don't -- don't -- don't you acknowledge that?


MR. HAGLER:  Our --


QUESTION:  You were saying it does help them,


you know, and you're mentioning the ways in which it helps


the Medicaid program.


MR. HAGLER:  Under either test we think we win.

Under the first test, the question should be, did Congress


intend to prohibit what Maine has here done?  If the


question is, does the Maine Rx program advance the


purposes of Medicaid --


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. HAGLER:  -- it assuredly does that.


QUESTION:  But you don't think that's necessary?


MR. HAGLER:  I'm -- I'm not convinced that


that's necessary.


QUESTION:  Okay.


MR. HAGLER:  But even if it were necessary,


there's -- the -- the facts in the record, and the


reasonable expectation of how the program will work will


yield Medicaid cost savings both by imposing prior


authorization on drugs that are more expensive than their 

therapeutic equivalents, and also by making Maine --


allowing people without insurance in the State of Maine to


purchase their prescription drugs and become less likely


to become disabled and financially eligible for Medicaid.


QUESTION:  Of the proposed regulations, is


anything published?  There was nothing before either court


about how this would be implemented, was there?


MR. HAGLER:  There were proposed regulations. 


They are in the appendix.  They have not been promulgated. 


They were drafted, and they're --

 QUESTION:  Before the district court?


MR. HAGLER:  Yes.  They were handed up to the


district court, and they -- they should be in the court


file.  They -- they are found on page 278 of the appendix,


and that provision describes how Maine will go about


reviewing the drugs for prior authorization.  If a


manufacturer refuses to participate in -- in a Maine Rx


negotiation, then the Commissioner will hand a list of --


of that manufacturer's drugs to a committee of physicians


and pharmacists who will determine whether it's clinically


appropriate to subject those drugs to prior authorization,


guided constantly by the principle that the purpose of


Medicaid is to provide necessary medical assistance to


those in need.


QUESTION: 


Thank you, Mr. Hagler. 

Mr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


Justice Stevens, I want to focus on the


narrowest basis on which this case can be decided, which


is, we have a preliminary injunction that was issued by


the district court.  A preliminary injunction was issued


on the basis of two bases, 1) the State has not put


forward any Medicaid-related purpose to be served by Maine

Rx, and 2) that no matter how you want to define it, there


is an obstacle to the full achievement of the recipient's


primary interest of receiving medicine.


As I said, there's a clear debate as to exactly


the extent of the obstacle, but that there could be no


question that there is an obstacle, and it seems to me


that what this Court can do is simply say, those two


findings are not an abuse of discretion on the record in


this particular case, therefore there is a basis for


affirming.


If the Court wants to go further from that and


say, on remand, some guidance might be useful from the


Secretary of HHS and propose some mechanism by which to


have primary jurisdiction or some other mechanism devised


by which to obtain the review by the Secretary, I think 

there's probably no problem with that and, as I said


before, I can't imagine that we would have any complaint


about that, but the importance of this is to -- is to


retain the injunction in place so that the unquestioned


harms that are going to happen are not allowed to take


place, and then try to undo them after the fact, which was


the reason for issuing the injunction.


QUESTION:  A brief question, I don't -- I'm


worried about your time, but is it inconceivable to say


that there was no showing at the time of the preliminary


56 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005 

Alderson Reporting Company 

injunction hearing but now they -- Maine says they can


make the showing that they should have made before. 


Should the judge not listen to that?


MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think when you get past


the preliminary injunction and you move on to the


permanent injunction, if they think that they can show no


burden whatsoever, or if they think they can show that


there are greater purposes to be served, that's certainly


available to them.  But on an abuse of discretion standard


this Court ought to affirm that, and nothing that the


First Circuit said justifies taking any action in this


particular case.


If there are no other questions --


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr.


Phillips.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
