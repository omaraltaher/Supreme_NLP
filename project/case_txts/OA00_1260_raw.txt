CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: 

We'll hear argument 

next in No. 00-1260, the United States v. Mark James 

Knights. 

Mr. Stewart. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOM L. STEWART 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. STEWART: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

In May 1998, respondent was convicted of a 

misdemeanor drug offense in a California court and was 

placed on 3 years' probation. 

One term of his probation 

required respondent to submit to searches of his person or 

property, quote, with or without a search warrant, warrant 

of arrest or reasonable cause by any probation officer or 

law enforcement officer. 

The acknowledgement signed by 

respondent stated: 

I have received a copy, read, and 

understand the above terms and conditions of probation and 

agree to abide by same. 

The Supreme Court of California has long held 

that such an acknowledgement is a voluntary and 

enforceable consent to future searches because, under 

California law, a defendant may not be compelled to accept 

probation, but may insist instead on serving the term of 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

confinement that is authorized by law. 

Less than a week after respondent was placed on 

probation, State police came to suspect that he was 

involved in an act of vandalism against electric and 

telecommunications facilities that caused approximately 

$1.5 million in damage. 

Relying on the search condition, 

police searched respondent's residence and found evidence 

implicating him in the crime. 

Respondent was subsequently indicted in Federal 

court on charges of conspiracy to commit arson and being a 

felon in possession of ammunition. 

QUESTION: 

Now, Mr. -- may I ask this question? 

The actual search was conducted by State officers, as I 

understand it. 

MR. STEWART: 

That's correct. 

QUESTION: 

Do you think the consent would have 

applied equally to Federal officers? 

MR. STEWART: 

It would have. 

By its terms, it 

said any probation officer or law enforcement officer. 

I'm not aware of any cases in the California system in 

which the search condition has actually been invoked by a 

Federal officer, but I think it would apply by its terms 

to such searches. 

QUESTION: 

What about a law enforcement officer 

from Nevada?

MR. STEWART: 

I -- I think that's correct. 

It's 

unlikely that such a search would occur because presumably 

one of the terms of probation would be that the -- the 

respondent would be required to remain within the State of 

California, and it's -- it's unlikely that he would be 

searched in California by Nevada officers. 

But I think if 

-- if such an unlikely scenario unfolded --

QUESTION: 

Well, it could be on the basis of a 

preexisting criminal situation. 

I mean, he might have 

committed a crime in Nevada 2 years ago. 

MR. STEWART: 

That's correct. 

It could have 

happened. 

QUESTION: 

But what do you think? 

Would it 

apply to a Nevada officer as well, do you think? 

MR. STEWART: 

I think it would. 

The consent 

would apply by its terms because it refers, without 

qualification, to any law enforcement officer. 

QUESTION: 

Well, I assume that -- doesn't that 

reasonably mean a law enforcement officer who has 

authority? 

MR. STEWART: 

I mean, there might be some 

independent basis for objecting to the presence of the --

the officer from outside the State, but I -- I don't think 

that the consent would fail to extend to --

QUESTION: 

Well, not -- I mean, if you have

consent, I assume it could be, you know, a law enforcement

officer from Afghanistan. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. STEWART: 

Well, the -- the Supreme Court --

QUESTION: 

Don't you think the consent is 

reasonably understood to be limited to a law enforcement 

officer who has authority under the applicable law of the 

jurisdiction? 

MR. STEWART: 

I think the -- I think that may be 

right --

QUESTION: 

Which would include a Federal 

officer --

MR. STEWART: 

And it might include --

QUESTION: 

-- but not -- not an Afghan officer. 

MR. STEWART: 

Well, it might -- it might include 

a Nevada officer, and if -- if under the circumstances 

Justice Stevens posits, there were actually authority for 

a Nevada officer to -- to be on the premises. 

In any event --

QUESTION: 

Well, but isn't -- doesn't your 

argument have an even narrower consequence? 

Because part 

of your argument, which I -- I want to go into, rests upon 

the fact that if he didn't consent, the State could --

could commit him, could put him -- put him in the house of 

correction. 

And you're saying, well, a person, in effect,

can consent to bargain his way out of that more -- more 

serious imposition, but that suggests that the only thing 

that he's freely consenting to is the avoidance of 

something that the State could do to him. 

The Federal 

Government couldn't do it to him. 

Nevada couldn't to him, 

and Afghanistan couldn't do it to him. 

So, doesn't --

doesn't that suggest that the only thing that he's 

consenting to is what he has to consent to, and that is to 

let California people search him so he doesn't have to go 

behind bars now? 

MR. STEWART: 

Well, the Supreme Court of 

California has construed the consent to -- not to apply to 

searches that are conducted for purposes of harassment or 

in an unreasonable manner. 

QUESTION: 

Well, but what about my -- what about 

my question? 

If -- if there is significance in the -- in 

your argument, and I take it there is. 

If there is 

significance in the fact that California can put him 

behind bars if he doesn't agree, doesn't it follow that 

his consent is likewise limited, i.e., limited to agreeing 

to let officers of the State that could put him behind 

bars search him? 

MR. STEWART: 

No. 

I don't -- I don't think that 

follows. 

That is, the reason that California insists in 

many cases upon a waiver of Fourth Amendment rights as a

condition of release on probation is that it wants to 

ensure that there will be no unnecessary barriers to 

monitoring the individual's compliance with the terms of 

his probation. 

QUESTION: 

That is to say monitoring by 

California. 

MR. STEWART: 

Well, it wouldn't -- it would 

extend beyond monitoring by California, because one of the 

terms of probation is that the individual avoid violations 

of any criminal law. 

That is, the individual would be in 

violation of his probation if he violated --

QUESTION: 

Well, sure, I -- I understand that, 

but it's California that monitors California probationers, 

isn't it? 

It's not -- it's not Federal probation officers 

and it's not Nevada probation officers. 

MR. STEWART: 

Certainly California has the 

primary interest in ensuring that California probationers 

comply with the terms of their probation, but -- but it 

would be a violation of the California probation for 

respondent or another probationer to violate Federal law. 

QUESTION: 

Oh, I -- I realize that, but I'm just 

saying -- well, let me -- let me put the question to you 

blankly. 

What is the significance for your argument in 

the fact that California could commit him? 

Is -- is --

are you implicitly making the argument that because

California could commit him, California could do something 

lesser than committing him; i.e., it could let him out 

subject to a limitation on Fourth Amendment rights? 

Is --

is that your argument? 

MR. STEWART: 

We're not making that argument all 

the way because there would be some possible --

QUESTION: 

Because if you made that argument all 

the way there would be no significance in the -- in the 

agreement, would there? 

MR. STEWART: 

To take an example of --

QUESTION: 

Would -- would there? 

If that were 

your argument, we would need an agreement. 

MR. STEWART: 

I think that's right. 

QUESTION: 

Okay, so that's not your argument. 

MR. STEWART: 

And to take an --

QUESTION: 

What then is the significance of the 

power of California to commit him? 

MR. STEWART: 

I think the significance is that 

this is -- that the defining characteristic of 

probationers is that they have recently been convicted of 

criminal offenses, and the premise of the institution of 

probation, as the Court said in Griffin, is that a 

probationer is more likely than the average citizen to 

violate the law. 

And one possible way of dealing, 

obviously, with people who've recently been convicted of

crimes is to incarcerate them to minimize the -- the 

likelihood that they will commit future criminal offenses. 

QUESTION: 

All right. 

Doesn't it boil down then 

to saying that the significance of the conviction is 

simply that it presents the occasion for this agreement 

and that it's the agreement that is really what is 

significant here? 

MR. STEWART: 

I mean, it --

QUESTION: 

Everything stands or falls on the 

fact that there's an agreement. 

Isn't that what your 

position boils down to? 

MR. STEWART: 

Well, everything stands or falls 

on the fact that there is a conviction. 

That is, it -- we 

think it would be the case that even if --

QUESTION: 

Well, if there were no conviction, 

there would be no occasion for the agreement. 

They 

wouldn't be there. 

They wouldn't be standing in court. 

But once there is a conviction and the occasion 

has presented itself, I don't see what in your argument 

goes beyond the significance of the agreement itself. 

MR. STEWART: 

We would say that even if there 

had been no agreement -- that is, even if it were the case 

under California law, as it is under Federal law, that an 

individual who has no legal right to -- that an individual 

has no legal right to refuse probation, even if probation

were a sentence that were imposed upon the defendant 

without his consent -- we -- we would still argue that the 

search condition is a reasonable term of probation. 

QUESTION: 

Okay. 

But in that case, you would be 

saying that because California had power to deal with him 

at that point, it had power, in effect, to limit his 

Fourth Amendment rights. 

MR. STEWART: 

Let me give an example of --

QUESTION: 

No, but isn't -- isn't that what 

you're saying? 

MR. STEWART: 

That is almost what I'm saying, 

but let -- let me give an --

QUESTION: 

But there's no -- I mean, there's no 

general rule across the board that I know of that because 

someone has been convicted, the State, in effect, can --

can limit bill of rights entitlements as a general rule. 

MR. STEWART: 

Let me give an example of why 

it's --

QUESTION: 

Is -- am I right on that? 

MR. STEWART: 

I think that's right, and let me 

give an example of why we're not going quite all the way 

and why we think you're correct. 

For instance, this Court held in Bell v. 

Wolfish, which is not cited in our brief, but it's in 441 

U.S., that prison officials may preclude inmates from

receiving hard cover books from persons other than 

booksellers or bookstores. 

And the rationale for that 

restriction was that hard cover books could be used to 

smuggle contraband into the institution. 

We think it's 

very unlikely that the State could impose a similar 

restriction on probationers because once an individual is 

allowed to circulate in the community, the likelihood that 

his receipt of hard cover books will add a meaningful 

increment of danger that he will possess contraband would 

be pretty insignificant. 

QUESTION: 

Right. 

It's the specific 

relationship between the State and the prisoner at that 

time that governs, in effect, what the State can do to --

to limit rights. 

MR. STEWART: 

That's correct. 

QUESTION: 

So, the same rule would apply in the 

State as -- as probationary supervisor vis-a-vis 

probationer. 

Right? 

MR. STEWART: 

That -- that is correct. 

Our --

QUESTION: 

And doesn't it follow from that then 

that the State's right to limit is itself limited by the 

State's interest in supervising probation, as distinct 

from the State's interest as a general enforcer of the 

criminal law? 

MR. STEWART: 

I think it's correct that the

State has an interest. 

I wouldn't quite put it as the 

State has an interest in supervising probation. 

The State 

has an interest in seeing to it that adequate measures are 

taken to ensure that a probationer doesn't violate the 

terms of his conditional release. 

And if -- if one of the dangers that the State 

fears, when a probationer is released into the community, 

is that he may commit Federal crimes as -- in addition to 

State crimes, it may reasonably choose to subject him, in 

effect, to increased monitoring by Federal officials by 

saying that he will have no right to demand the judicial 

warrant even as to searches by -- by those officials. 

So, 

we think that the -- a term of release like that is 

reasonably related to the purposes and conditions --

QUESTION: 

Okay. 

Does that -- does that mean 

then, at this point in the argument, that you're relying 

on the State's power as -- as the -- as the State vis-a-

vis a convict for your position rather than the convict's 

agreement for your position? 

MR. STEWART: 

We -- we are relying on both. 

We 

are saying --

QUESTION: 

But what does it -- I mean, if -- if 

your last argument is sound, what does the agreement add? 

MR. STEWART: 

I mean, the agreement provides an 

additional check, an additional means of assurance that

the conditions of probation are not unduly onerous. 

The 

fact --

QUESTION: 

Isn't the -- isn't the agreement, if 

you're going to talk about it in realistic terms, simply 

notice? 

This is not something that the prisoner can 

negotiate. 

This is a package deal. 

This is what 

probation is. 

If you're on probation, these are the 

conditions. 

So, doesn't that -- that agreement -- the 

word agreement seems to me not quite right to describe a 

situation where the defendant really has no choice. 

This 

is probation. 

This is the package that comes with 

probation and that's it. 

MR. STEWART: 

We would --

QUESTION: 

Well, doesn't the prisoner have the 

power to say, no, I don't want probation? 

Usually that 

extends much longer than a jail term. 

I'd rather go to 

jail. 

I know when I used to sentence criminal defendants, 

many times they'd make that choice. 

They'd say I'd rather 

take a short jail sentence and get the government out of 

my business than to accept a longer probation term on 

these conditions. 

Don't they make a choice sometimes? 

MR. STEWART: 

It happens rarely but it does 

happen. 

And it is an agreement. 

That is, the individual 

admittedly is faced with two options --

QUESTION: 

All right. 

What about the person for

whom there is no jail term? 

And I think you conceded 

there is a category where probation is the only 

punishment. 

MR. STEWART: 

No. 

Probation may be the only 

punishment that is actually imposed in a particular case, 

but we -- we certainly don't concede in this case that the 

individual had no choice. 

The individual could have 

insisted upon --

QUESTION: 

But you're -- you're asking for a 

rule across the board. 

And so, I'm asking you, what about 

the category of case for which the prescribed punishment 

is probation? 

Period. 

MR. STEWART: 

It's -- you're -- you're correct. 

In the Federal system, for instance, where an individual 

doesn't have the choice to refuse probation, it may be 

that a condition of this sort would still be upheld. 

We 

would argue that it would, but it could not be on a 

consent theory. 

We would agree with you on that. 

And to return to Justice O'Connor's point --

QUESTION: 

Was this a case where the defendant 

had to be placed on probation? 

Was there not a jail term 

that could have been imposed here? 

MR. STEWART: 

There -- there was a jail term. 

The statute provided for up to a year in prison or up to 3 

years' probation, and the individual was placed on

probation for a period of 3 years. 

And this Court has often recognized, in the 

context of plea bargaining --

QUESTION: 

Can I just -- excuse me. 

Just one --

is it not true, though, that the Wisconsin -- the -- the 

-- California could have insisted on the 3-year probation? 

MR. STEWART: 

Yes. 

QUESTION: 

Okay. 

MR. STEWART: 

I'm sorry. 

No, it couldn't have 

insisted on the 3-year probation. 

That is, if the -- if 

the --

that --

QUESTION: 

Is -- is that possible in California 

MR. STEWART: 

No. 

QUESTION: 

-- a person could be placed on 

probation without a willingness to be placed on probation? 

Is there no choice given to the person convicted? 

MR. STEWART: 

No. 

No. 

In California, the 

individual could insist on imprisonment. 

He couldn't 

insist on probation. 

That is, if the judge had wanted to 

sentence him to prison, he couldn't have said, no, I'll 

take the 3-year probationary term instead. 

But he could 

insist on imprisonment and could refuse to be placed on 

probation. 

And as the Court has often recognized in the

plea bargaining context, often defendants will plead 

guilty because they're faced with unattractive options. 

QUESTION: 

The relevance of this is -- escapes 

me slightly because I -- I wonder what -- I mean, you may 

have plenty of power to impose the condition you want. 

That's a different issue. 

But as far as consenting is 

concerned, don't people get searched in prison? 

MR. STEWART: 

Yes. 

QUESTION: 

Okay. 

And don't they get searched 

out of prison under this? 

MR. STEWART: 

Yes. 

QUESTION: 

Then what's his choice in respect to 

search? 

MR. STEWART: 

Well, his choice -- I mean, he --

the likelihood is that as a practical matter, he will have 

more privacy when on probation than -- than when he is in 

-- than if he were in prison. 

But you're right. 

As a 

legal matter, he is subject to searches without any 

requirement of individualized --

QUESTION: 

To say he consents to search without 

his consent is like saying I consent to being a human 

being. 

MR. STEWART: 

No. 

I mean, to take -- to take 

the example of -- of plea bargaining, if an individual 

pleads guilty to a criminal offense --

QUESTION: 

Yes, I grant you he concedes -- he 

can choose whether to be in prison or out of prison. 

MR. STEWART: 

But in the --

QUESTION: 

He can't choose whether to be 

searched or not be searched. 

MR. STEWART: 

That's correct. 

But in the plea 

bargaining context, if an individual pleads guilty to an 

offense because his understanding is he'll be sentenced to 

10 years in prison and he does it because he thinks that 

if he goes to trial, he'll be sentenced to 20 years in 

prison, I mean, you could say in a sense that either way 

he's going to be placed in prison, so what's the choice? 

But the Court has recognized that to be a meaningful 

choice. 

The fact that the options are unattractive 

doesn't negate the volitional element. 

QUESTION: 

If he's in prison, can the police 

then go to his premises? 

Suppose he had been put in jail 

and not let out because they suspected that he had done 

something much more serious. 

And then the law enforcement 

officer goes into his house, no warrant, finds all the 

same damning material. 

Could -- could that be done 

without a warrant when the man is not there? 

MR. STEWART: 

No. 

No, unless some other 

exception to the warrant requirement applied. 

QUESTION: 

So, if he were in jail, that's the

way he would have of protecting his house against entry 

without a warrant. 

MR. STEWART: 

I mean -- and, you know, to look 

at it that way, you could say that probation is 

disadvantageous because, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, 

it may extend for a longer period of time. 

The point here 

is not that the individual, in choosing probation, doesn't 

give up anything that he might have had had he chosen 

prison. 

The point is that each of the options has both 

attractive and unattractive features and the individual 

has the choice --

QUESTION: 

Mr. Stewart, can I ask you this 

question? 

I really want to understand the Government's 

position. 

It seems to me -- maybe they don't do it. 

I 

thought they did, but a State could have a -- a law that 

says if you violate this statute, your punishment shall be 

60 days in jail and a year of probation. 

They could do 

that, and that's the only -- only alternative so that 

there is no element of consent whatsoever on the part of 

the defendant, but the statute provides you have to 

subject to it. 

And would your argument apply equally to 

that case and to this case? 

MR. STEWART: 

No, it would not. 

That is, we --

we would still take the position that such a term was 

reasonable, but it would be a pure special needs case. 

We

would not -- if the individual had no choice but to be 

placed on probation, there would not be a consent theory 

available to us. 

QUESTION: 

If we follow your suggested line of 

decision and say that this was a consented-to search, can 

we write the opinion without citing Griffin? 

MR. STEWART: 

I -- I assume that you would cite 

Griffin, but I don't think that there is anything in our 

position that is inconsistent with Griffin. 

That is --

QUESTION: 

We don't need Griffin under your 

view. 

MR. STEWART: 

That's correct. 

We -- I think the 

part of Griffin that is particularly helpful to us is the 

first part of Griffin that explained why supervision and 

monitoring of probationers is a State interest distinct 

from enforcement of the criminal law. 

QUESTION: 

But Griffin was not a consent case. 

MR. STEWART: 

That's correct. 

There was no 

allegation in Griffin that the individual had a right to 

refuse probation. 

And I think even in the circumstances 

presented in Griffin where the individual was placed on 

probation without his choice, the Court was careful not to 

suggest that the features of the constitutional -- the 

features of the Wisconsin scheme were necessarily 

constitutional prerequisites to a valid process.

particular, in footnote 2 of the Griffin opinion, the 

Court noted that the test for restrictions within the 

prison is whether they are reasonably related to a 

legitimate penological objective. 

QUESTION: 

Do we say that the consent has to be 

for a search that is substantially related to the purposes 

of the probation; i.e., the hypothetical probation for 3 

years but you give up your Fourth Amendment rights for 

life? 

MR. STEWART: 

I mean, I think -- yes, I think we 

would say that for the -- for the consent to be valid, the 

individual's waiver of rights needs to bear some 

reasonable relationship to the fact that he's on 

probation. 

For instance, we've said in our brief that the 

State presumably could not condition release on probation 

on an individual's agreement to refrain from criticizing 

the Government or to refrain from engaging in religious 

worship. 

QUESTION: 

Once you --

QUESTION: 

Is that an unconstitutional 

conditions analysis? 

MR. STEWART: 

I think that's correct, that the 

-- the Court has said that ordinarily even when the 

Government has discretion to grant or withhold a benefit 

entirely, it may not grant it on a relinquishment of

constitutional rights that bears no reasonable 

relationship to the program at issue. 

So, because a 

probationer's criticism of the Government would impair no 

legitimate Government interests, would cause no damage 

distinct from any other individual's criticism of the 

Government, the strong inference would be that a State 

that imposed that condition was simply trying to stifle 

dissent and was attempting to use the probation condition 

as a hook. 

QUESTION: 

Once you say that, I don't see what 

is to be gained by drawing the -- the big distinction that 

you attempt to draw between consent and nonconsent. 

Once 

you've -- once you've made that -- that line that it has 

to be related to the Government's not just penological 

interest, because it's certainly a punishment not to be 

able to criticize the Government -- I guess one of the 

punishments of being in prison, for example, is -- is the 

inability to have sexual relationships with -- with your 

spouse. 

But I -- I assume you would say that the 

Government could not sentence you to 5 years in prison 

plus another 5 years for no sexual relationships with your 

spouse. 

Right? 

MR. STEWART: 

Right. 

QUESTION: 

So, somehow the -- the -- it can't be 

a punishment. 

What is attached after the prison term has

to be related to assuring the safety of the society from 

the individual, which this search condition would. 

But 

once you say that it has to be connected that way, what do 

you gain by saying there has to be consent? 

MR. STEWART: 

Well, I think the consent --

QUESTION: 

I mean, consent or no consent, if 

it's -- if it's connected up in that way, why isn't it 

valid? 

MR. STEWART: 

I mean, we have -- we have said --

I mean, I've said today that we would be here defending 

the condition even if it were imposed on a defendant who 

had no option to refuse probation. 

So, we would agree 

that the -- the existence of consent is not in our view 

outcome determinative. 

However, the -- the fact that the 

individual has the choice whether to accept probation or 

to insist on incarceration does provide an additional 

check, an additional assurance that the condition is not 

unduly onerous. 

QUESTION: 

The constitutional rights he can give 

up are related to the purpose of the enforcement. 

So, 

could you require him to give up his Miranda rights? 

And my next question would be, could you require 

him to give up his right to be free from coerced 

confession by brutal torture? 

MR. STEWART: 

No. 

I mean, there would be --

there's a Government interest there and I don't -- what 

is --

MR. STEWART: 

I don't -- I don't think the --

the legitimacy of using those particular methods to 

attempt to solve as yet unanticipated crimes would vary 

depending on whether the individual is a probationer or 

not. 

QUESTION: 

Can you consent to torture? 

Can you 

consent to the elimination of your Miranda rights? 

Wouldn't it -- wouldn't it suffice for your case to say 

that the State can take away any of the constitutional 

rights related to the -- the probationary nature of the --

of -- of the punishment? 

Any of those rights that a 

person can waive? 

MR. STEWART: 

I think that's probably at least, 

if not exactly, the --

QUESTION: 

I don't think you can waive your 

rights to torture. 

QUESTION: 

But you can certainly waive your 

right to Miranda, and you could waive your right to save 

questioning for 3 days in a -- in a cell. 

Everything 

isn't torture.

MR. STEWART: 

Well, you can -- you can waive the 

rights that are explained to you in the -- in the Miranda 

colloquy. 

That's a different thing from saying you can 

waive your right to be informed of -- of those rights. 

And to further elucidate what to us is the 

significance of consent, if the terms of probation under 

California law were much more severe -- for instance, if 

the probationary period were 15 years rather than 3 or if 

one of the conditions of probation was that an individual 

had video cameras mounted in his residence so he could be 

observed at all times -- at a certain point, you'd get to 

a situation where lots of probationers would decide that 

incarceration is better than this. 

QUESTION: 

May I ask another question? 

To what 

extent is the waiver of Fourth Amendment rights total in 

your view? 

Could he, for example -- could you say he's 

waived his right to every 6-hour body cavity searches, for 

example, something very extreme and intrusive searches? 

MR. STEWART: 

I mean, he -- he doesn't under 

California law. 

That is, the California Supreme Court has 

interpreted the consent condition as not applying to 

searches conducted in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner 

or for purposes of harassment. 

And there is a statute in 

the California penal code governing the situations under 

which strip searches may be conducted.

QUESTION: 

Do you think that statute is 

constitutionally compelled? 

MR. STEWART: 

I mean, there -- there may be rare 

situations in which an individual's consent -- blanket 

consent to searches could be enforced with --

QUESTION: 

In other words, he can waive his 

right to be free from unreasonable searches, but not from 

very unreasonable searches. 

MR. STEWART: 

I mean, certainly the -- the type 

of -- there -- there would have to be some justification 

for performing the search based on the fact that he was a 

probationer, but again --

QUESTION: 

I'll look at the laws. 

I had thought 

that under California law, for a second drug offense or a 

third drug offense, you can get lifetime probation. 

So, 

would you say -- let's say for a second offense, assuming 

you could have probation for 20 years or a lifetime, the 

Fourth Amendment right could be surrendered for that long? 

MR. STEWART: 

I mean, I think if it were for a 

third offense, I think yes. 

I think the State could 

legitimately make the judgment that a person who has three 

times been convicted of drug offenses was, for the rest of 

his life, meaningfully more likely to violate the criminal 

law than the average citizen. 

If you talked about another type of extreme

example -- for instance, upon conviction for a traffic 

violation, you'll be placed on lifetime probation under 

which you can be searched at any time -- I think it would 

be probably be irrational for the State to say simply 

because you were convicted of a traffic violation, we will 

regard you 20 years down the road as being more likely 

than the average citizen to violate the law. 

But the -- the point I was making about the --

the potential terms of probation becoming more onerous, if 

we got to a situation where because the conditions of 

probation were especially harsh, large numbers of 

probationers decided that incarceration is better than 

this, then the -- an individual defendant's right to 

choose between the two alternatives would have obvious 

significance. 

It would provide an obvious degree of -- of 

comfort that the -- that what was being placed upon him, 

if he chose probation, was not unconstitutionally onerous. 

QUESTION: 

How long back does the consent or the 

notice apply? 

Suppose the law enforcement officer is 

investigating a crime that occurred before the defendant 

was apprehended on the charge for which the sentence is 

probation. 

So, here the last act of vandalism occurred 

after the probation sentence. 

Suppose all the vandalism 

acts had occurred before he was picked up for drug 

possession.

MR. STEWART: 

I think the consent would apply, 

by its terms, to that situation, and it would be 

constitutional. 

QUESTION: 

And then you couldn't have the 

purpose, well, we want to see that from the day he's put 

on probation, he's not living a life of crime. 

This would 

have been before. 

So, it would be hard to connect it with 

a probation purpose. 

MR. STEWART: 

I agree that the link between the 

search that you describe and the -- the monitoring of 

compliance with the conditions of probation would be more 

tenuous. 

In this case, as you point out, the -- the 

search was intended to and did produce evidence of a crime 

that was committed after the individual was placed on 

probation. 

If I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder of 

my time. 

QUESTION: 

Very well, Mr. Stewart. 

Ms. Fox, we'll hear from you. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HILARY A. FOX 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MS. FOX: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 

the Court: 

Respondent's argument has two major points. 

First, on the facts of this case, the Government has

failed to establish that there was an effective consent to 

search. 

But second, even if the Government could 

establish consent, California's blanket search condition, 

which purports to permit searches at any time of the day 

or night, by any law enforcement officer, for any reason 

or no reason, is unenforceable. 

With regard to the first issue, the basis for 

the consent argument here is a one-page probation order. 

Mr. Knights' signature appears on the order beneath a two-

line advisement of rights. 

The -- the first line advises 

him that, should he satisfactorily complete probation, he 

may ask to have his conviction set aside, and the second 

sentence confirms that he has received, read, and 

understood the terms and conditions of probation and 

agrees to abide by same. 

Beneath that is a line for 

defendant's signature, acknowledgement of receipt. 

As Justice Ginsburg suggested earlier, this is a 

notice provision. 

This is not an effective consent. 

Moreover --

QUESTION: 

Well, does it -- does it say? 

Does 

it use the term consent? 

MS. FOX: 

No, Your Honor, I don't believe it 

does. 

QUESTION: 

Is it somewhere in the record? 

MS. FOX: 

Yes.

appendix, Your Honor. 

QUESTION: 

Thank you. 

QUESTION: 

I don't even think he agrees to them. 

He agrees to abide by them. 

He agrees to abide by the 

conditions. 

MS. FOX: 

Exactly, agrees to abide by same, 

meaning the conditions. 

QUESTION: 

Well, that's certainly an agreement. 

Whether you'd call it consent or not, it's an agreement. 

MS. FOX: 

It does say agree, Your Honor. 

QUESTION: 

Well, I'm not saying it just says 

that. 

If he signs it, it is an agreement, is it not? 

MS. FOX: 

Well, Your Honor, I'm -- I'm not sure 

that's an accurate way to characterize it, in that with 

this probation order, we don't know when or where Mr. 

Knights signed it. 

There's no evidence. 

QUESTION: 

Well, does it make a difference? 

MS. FOX: 

Well, I think, Your Honor, it does in 

terms of was this an order of the court -- it's called a 

probation order -- that was imposed on him. 

QUESTION: 

But -- but he -- he has signed his 

name saying he agrees to abide by it. 

Isn't that the 

case? 

MS. FOX: 

That's correct, Your Honor. 

That's 

why I was going to refer then to the Bumper case, which I

think is very instructive as to whether this type of 

agreement is an enforceable consent. 

In Bumper v. North 

Carolina, of course, Mrs. Bumper did agree to -- consent 

to a search of her house, but that's because she thought 

that the searching officers had lawful authority to search 

her house. 

So, the Court concluded that her consent under 

those circumstances was nothing more than acquiescence to 

a show of lawful authority. 

In this case --

QUESTION: 

When, in fact, the lawful -- the 

authority was not lawful. 

MS. FOX: 

Exactly. 

And our argument here, Your 

Honor, is that the probation order with form conditions, 

one box checked being a search condition, sets forth a 

blanket search condition that is not constitutional and 

not enforceable, but that Mr. Knights, in agreeing to it, 

would have had no way of knowing --

QUESTION: 

Well, in Bumpers, the premise for 

lawful authority was established without reference to the 

argument at hand. 

Here you're assuming -- you're assuming 

the premise. 

MS. FOX: 

That's correct, Your Honor. 

In fact, 

it's my second point. 

QUESTION: 

So that Bumpers doesn't work. 

MS. FOX: 

Well, I -- I think it does if you --

of course, you then accept the second point which is was 

this blanket search authority constitutional. 

My position 

is that under Griffin, clearly it's not. 

An easy way to 

understand that is that this condition is not limited by 

its terms to probationary searches in that it --

QUESTION: 

Well, but Griffin is a special needs 

case and you might argue that this is -- has -- that if we 

have a special needs dichotomy, we have to expand somewhat 

the holding of -- of Griffin. 

But Griffin, I don't think, 

discussed consent. 

As I understand it, it as not a 

consent case. 

Here it's a consent case. 

MS. FOX: 

Yes, Your Honor. 

What -- what the 

Government, I believe, conceded is that even if they don't 

rely on Griffin, they do have to -- have to acknowledge 

some or find some rational relationship between the 

condition and the needs of the probation. 

And here, 

California in the Supreme Court has construed this 

condition in the Woods case, which I cited in my brief, to 

authorize searches targeted at third parties who are not 

on probation. 

QUESTION: 

We wouldn't have to -- we wouldn't 

have to accept that, would we? 

MS. FOX: 

Well, I believe, Your Honor, under 

Griffin the Court would look to --

QUESTION: 

I mean, can't we say that's totally

wrong or say that this has nothing to do with this case? 

What about -- what about leaving that out? 

MS. FOX: 

You could, Your Honor. 

I was only 

going to say that -- that we usually look to California 

law to fix the meaning of the --

QUESTION: 

No, no. 

That's the meaning. 

Fine, 

okay. 

Does this involve such a search? 

MS. FOX: 

No, it doesn't. 

QUESTION: 

Okay. 

So, we could say, applied to 

such a search, it's unconstitutional. 

What about this 

case? 

MS. FOX: 

In this case --

QUESTION: 

And suppose I say you're right about 

consent. 

Consent has nothing to do with it, that this is 

a punishment. 

One of the objectives of punishment is what 

used to be called incapacitation, what's now called 

specific deterrence. 

Many think that's the main purpose 

of punishment, to incapacitate this person. 

We 

incapacitate him in prison and we do it, in part, by 

searching him randomly. 

What about a halfway house? 

What 

about home confinement? 

What about probation where he is 

at home? 

Why would we not have the same kind of 

incapacitation there that we have in prison, indeed, a 

less severe form? 

MS. FOX: 

Well, Your Honor, the -- Your Honor's

argument suggests somewhat the greater versus the 

lesser --

QUESTION: 

No, it doesn't. 

MS. FOX: 

-- argument that was raised earlier. 

QUESTION: 

Nothing to do with greater versus 

lesser. 

I'll take greater/greater. 

When people are in prison, they are 

incapacitated from committing further crime. 

That's the 

purpose of punishment, a major purpose. 

So, why can't a 

State say, I am going to punish you for, in part, the same 

purpose, to incapacitate you while you are being punished, 

and I will do the same thing we do in prison in respect to 

that? 

What we do in respect to that in prison is we 

search you randomly. 

When you are in the halfway house, 

you will be searched randomly. 

When you are confined to 

your house, you will be searched randomly. 

When you are 

on probation, you will be searched randomly. 

Now, my question is, why in each of those 

instances can the State not do the same thing? 

MS. FOX: 

Because, Your Honor, the rationale for 

the limitation of prisoners' Fourth Amendment rights --

and they would apply also to individuals at halfway houses 

-- is not that we take away rights as a punishment. 

Rather, what the Court has held is that recognition of a 

privacy right in a cell is incompatible with the unique

needs --

QUESTION: 

I -- I thought -- then you're saying 

we should -- if I were to tell you in my experience, which 

is somewhat in this area -- I've had experience -- that 

one of the purposes of punishment is incapacitation, and 

you're saying that we couldn't have a punishment that 

would be designed to do that by searching -- by searching 

people's cells randomly to be sure that they're not 

committing crimes in -- in a prison in order to make sure 

-- I mean, I -- I had thought -- I'm not positive, but I 

had thought that that was an important purpose. 

MS. FOX: 

Yes, it is a purpose of punishment, 

Your Honor. 

What I'm, I think, relying on in part is that in 

Griffin this Court has previously held that probationers 

do have Fourth Amendment rights, and that a probationer's 

home, like anyone else's, is protected by the Fourth 

Amendment. 

QUESTION: 

I'm not sure the Government has even 

argued what Justice Breyer is suggesting, namely that I --

it follows from what he's suggesting that you could have 

-- you could sentence somebody to nothing but the 

incapacitation of forfeiting their Fourth Amendment 

rights. 

That is, I sentence to you 10 years of, you know, 

warrantless searches and seizures.

QUESTION: 

That actually isn't my question. 

QUESTION: 

Well --

(Laughter.) 

QUESTION: 

My question is designed to show you 

-- to suggest that there is a purpose in searches that is 

related to a basic aim of punishment. 

MS. FOX: 

Certainly, Your Honor. 

QUESTION: 

And so my -- my point is to suggest 

to you to ask -- answer me as to why that same purpose 

doesn't apply when, in fact, the person is on probation. 

I may have overstated the case. 

I obviously misled 

Justice Scalia. 

(Laughter.) 

QUESTION: 

And so, I will confine, not overstate 

so that you can answer. 

MS. FOX: 

Your Honor, my answer would be that 

any sentence imposed must be imposed within constitutional 

limitations, and in this case, I think Griffin is an 

essential case because Griffin helps us see what are the 

constitutional limitations on probationers' Fourth 

Amendment rights. 

Obviously, the Fourth Amendment would 

dictate that police searches have -- be based upon a 

warrant, issued upon probable cause, and Griffin, like TLO 

against New Jersey, and the other special needs cases 

issued since, recognized that there is a limited class of

cases in which special needs, beyond the normal needs of 

general law enforcement, make the warrant and probable 

cause requirements impractical. 

And what I would say is 

that for a general law enforcement search, the Fourth 

Amendment tells us that a warrant and probable cause are 

not impractical by definition. 

So, what we have in the probation context is a 

special need of probation supervision, a dual need that --

that includes both the monitoring and protection of the 

community, which is the Government's main focus, but in 

addition, rehabilitation. 

And I submit to you that if it 

were only that single focus of protecting the community, 

it would not be a special need beyond the general needs of 

law enforcement. 

QUESTION: 

Are you saying, in effect, yes, 

Justice Breyer, you -- the Government could have a -- a 

regime of probation in which they subject you to random 

searches, but what the Government cannot do is have a 

regime of probation in which you are subjected to 

nonrandom searches, searches conducted not in supervision 

of probationers, but searches conducted in the 

investigation of specific crimes, and in the later case, 

the -- the Government ought to follow normal Fourth 

Amendment standards? 

Is that, in effect, your answer? 

MS. FOX: 

Well, no, not quite, Your Honor,

because I don't believe that the Court should or would 

dispense with the reasonable suspicion requirement in this 

situation. 

There are, of course, very cases --

QUESTION: 

Okay, add that to his hypo: 

random 

searches with reasonable suspicion. 

You would then say, 

sure, you can have a regime like that. 

But this is not a 

case that involves the -- the exercise of that kind of 

power because in this case, you weren't having random 

searches for probation supervision based on -- on 

reasonable suspicion. 

You were having a full-blown law 

enforcement kind of search, and you should have gotten a 

Fourth Amendment warrant. 

Is that --

MS. FOX: 

I believe that's -- that is correct. 

QUESTION: 

Good because that's exactly where I 

am. 

That's better -- that's exactly where I am. 

But then 

if that's so, how do you distinguish this particular case? 

QUESTION: 

Yes. 

Why wasn't there reasonable 

suspicion? 

MS. FOX: 

You may have gotten ahead of me. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. FOX: 

The -- first, the district court found 

reasonable suspicion and we disputed that, but that's the 

district court's factual finding. 

That alone, at least 

under Griffin, is not enough to make it a valid special 

needs search. 

This was a police investigatory search as

part of a 2-year investigation conducted without a 

warrant, without probable cause. 

So, for -- for it to be a proper probationary 

search under Griffin, we believe it would have to satisfy 

other requirements. 

First, it would have to be, Griffin 

suggests, done at the direction of or with the advice of a 

probation officer to show that the search was, in fact, 

somehow related to the programmatic purpose of probation 

supervision. 

And --

QUESTION: 

Well, that -- that's part of my 

problem with your argument. 

Why isn't it part of the 

programmatic purpose of probation to ensure that, A, he 

doesn't use drugs, and B, he doesn't violate other laws? 

MS. FOX: 

For this reason, Your Honor. 

In 

Griffin, when it talked about the importance of deterrence 

and -- and searches to ensure that the probationer is 

compliant, the Court undertook a balancing of the degree 

of intrusion and the importance of the need. 

And central 

to the first factor, the degree of intrusion, was that the 

search was only being performed by a probation officer. 

The balancing turned out to be constitutional because it 

was not a police officer conducting a police search. 

QUESTION: 

Well, Griffin upheld a search by a 

probation officer. 

I really don't think it answered all 

these questions. 

I don't think it answered this question.

And it is a concern to me that the whole thrust 

of releasing someone on probation after a conviction of a 

serious crime is to try to prevent that person from 

committing other crimes, to try to encourage the person to 

lead a law-abiding life for a sufficient period of time 

that he can be totally released at the end of the day with 

safety to the public. 

And so, this is terribly important 

that you provide a deterrent to people not to commit 

further crimes, and that is exactly what this probation 

term is all about. 

Why isn't that eminently reasonable? 

MS. FOX: 

Your Honor, three reasons. 

The first 

is --

QUESTION: 

And this very case, this person was 

found to have all kinds of indications of having been 

planning and perhaps having committed a number of very 

serious offenses while on probation. 

MS. FOX: 

Your Honor, now I remember two of the 

reasons. 

The first is that this probation was imposed on 

-- on my client after a conviction for a misdemeanor, and 

the Government's arguments, and the amici arguments in 

particular, rely tremendously on the recidivism rates for 

felony offenders and felony probationers and fail to point 

out that in fact the recidivism rate for misdemeanant 

probationers is substantially lower. 

So, I think the --

the magnitude of the threat that's been suggested to the 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Court has not been borne out by the facts. 

QUESTION: 

Are you suggesting then we draw a 

line depending upon how serious the offense is? 

If you 

don't commit a serious offense, but if you -- however, at 

some probation you could attach this condition and other 

probation you couldn't? 

MS. FOX: 

Your Honor, this condition -- I -- no. 

And I'll get to that in a minute. 

I don't believe it 

would ever be -- I can't imagine when it would be an 

appropriate condition in light of the underpinnings of the 

Fourth Amendment and our Constitution abhorrence for a 

regime of unfettered search discretion. 

And I think 

that's what I'd like to get with Justice O'Connor. 

But I do think that the magnitude of the threat, 

the Court said in Edmonds, is never determinative --

QUESTION: 

Well, then -- then one would never 

know. 

A police officer would never know how a court was 

going to react to a search on reasonable suspicion like 

this. 

He -- he would have to evaluate for himself how 

serious the offense was versus all the other balancing? 

MS. FOX: 

No, absolutely not, Your Honor. 

The 

-- the decision making would come at the time that the 

court imposed sentence. 

Now, because what I was going to 

get to with Justice O'Connor is that, you know, 

fundamentally the Fourth Amendment was, as the Court is

well aware, adopted for many reasons, but primarily in 

reaction to a system of general warrants, writs of 

assistance, in which petty officials could invade 

citizens' homes at will. 

That unfettered search --

QUESTION: 

Citizens who had not been convicted 

of crimes and who had not been placed on probation. 

MS. FOX: 

Yes. 

QUESTION: 

This person is in a different status. 

MS. FOX: 

Yes, and it's only because he's a 

probationer that he can be searched without a warrant at 

all. 

Were he not a probationer, of course, he couldn't be 

searched by anyone, let alone a probation officer. 

But to get back to the Justice's question, oh, 

it's not for the officer in the field to determine. 

The 

point is that the court, in imposing sentence -- and the 

First Circuit has gone into this in the Gianetta case, 

which we cite -- has -- Gianetta suggested that where you 

have a State that has failed to establish any kind of 

regulatory scheme, such as the Wisconsin scheme, that 

would limit the search discretion and indicate when 

searches were appropriate, then in that case, a judge 

could still impose a search condition, but it would be 

appropriate for the judge to make some kind of factual 

findings --

QUESTION: 

But -- but I take it then a judge's

finding wouldn't be conclusive necessarily. 

It could be 

attacked collaterally as not having been part of a system 

or having been an erroneous application of the system? 

MS. FOX: 

No, I -- I think what the judge would 

-- would do, in addition to making findings, is to impose 

a --

QUESTION: 

Well, but I'm talking --

MS. FOX: 

-- narrowly tailored search condition. 

QUESTION: 

Yes, but I'm talking to you about a 

situation where the judge says, you know, perhaps not 

consistently with the system, but he says, in this 

particular case, this person is subject to search on 

reasonable suspicion. 

And the -- the judge says that, 

recognizing that he has to balance perhaps the seriousness 

of the offense, and he says, I balance it this way. 

Now, when the person is searched and that 

evidence is sought to be admitted at his trial, can the 

order of the judge be collaterally attacked by saying that 

this judge just didn't reach the right balance in this 

case? 

MS. FOX: 

Well, yes, Your Honor, though I don't 

mean to suggest, in fact, that a condition that simply 

required reasonable suspicion and did not ensure that it 

was going to be probationary searches, would be 

constitutional because the exception that we're talking

with here, to the Fourth Amendment, is a special needs 

exception. 

And that -- that's what Griffin relied on. 

And you only get to a special needs exception if the 

searches that are being conducted are special need 

searches. 

QUESTION: 

Well, Griffin relied on that but did 

not say that there's -- that's the only condition. 

It --

it said the Wisconsin Supreme Court had -- had adopted a 

-- a different principle, and we said -- we begin the 

opinion, we think the Wisconsin Supreme Court correctly 

concluded that this warrantless search could not violate 

the Fourth Amendment. 

To reach that result, however, we 

find it unnecessary to embrace a new principle of law, as 

the Wisconsin court evidently did, that any search of a 

probationer's home by a -- satisfy the Fourth Amendment. 

We just didn't -- didn't consider whether we needed that 

new principle of law and maybe that new principle of law 

is at issue in this case. 

MS. FOX: 

Well, two answers to that, Your Honor. 

QUESTION: 

So, I mean, don't -- don't -- I don't 

think Griffin precludes us from --

MS. FOX: 

No, it doesn't. 

However, I would 

point out first that Griffin, even the -- the Wisconsin 

Supreme Court was only talking about searches by probation 

officers. 

So, the issue --

QUESTION: 

Why -- why does that -- I mean, 

what's bothering me from a policy perspective is there are 

a whole range of punishments called intermediate 

punishments, which perhaps should be encouraged, and they 

include things like boot camp -- not boot camps, but 

halfway houses, home confinement, night and weekend 

confinement, and probation. 

That's one of them. 

And so, 

why is it unreasonable for the State to say we want to 

encourage this kind of thing, but part of it has to be 

checkups on people to make certain that they're not 

committing crimes? 

And the condition that you have 

checked here in the -- in the form is simply one of those 

conditions that would help encourage, and indeed make more 

sensible, this kind of range of intermediate punishments. 

MS. FOX: 

Well, Your Honor, as we point out in 

our brief, the -- the intermediate sanction programs, 

which have been implemented, I hope effectively, across 

this country by different States that are cited by amicus 

-- several of the amici -- not a single program relies on 

random searches by police. 

It is simply not a component 

of an effective intensive supervision program, let alone a 

regular probation system, in any State. 

QUESTION: 

I thought there were some other 

States, in addition to California, that had as a condition 

of probation that you -- your premises can be searched to

determine whether you are continuing -- whether you are 

engaged in crime. 

I did not think California was alone in 

that respect. 

MS. FOX: 

Your Honor, apart from California, I'm 

aware only of Virginia as having approved a blanket search 

condition such as this with no limitations for 

individualized suspicion and no limitation to the 

probation officer. 

Many States permit probation officers, 

as part of their duties, to conduct home searches. 

QUESTION: 

Well, if we put individual suspicion 

-- there was reasonable suspicion in this case. 

If you 

admit that one of the purposes of probation is to monitor 

the person to make sure that they are now off their 

bottle, they're no longer committing crimes, if that's a 

purpose of probation, then why isn't this an entirely 

reasonable condition to say we have to check up on you to 

see that you're not engaging in crime anymore? 

MS. FOX: 

Because it's disproportionate. 

Because what this condition purports to do, even if we --

if we put back a reasonable suspicion requirement, it 

still gives police unfettered discretion, randomly, 

arbitrarily, as often as they want, for no reason or any 

reason to go into, as they did in this case, Mr. Knights' 

home --

represents to us that the State of California says that

there's not a single --

That's their argument. 

So, it's not 

-- so, it is not completely arbitrary. 

MS. FOX: 

Yes. 

I -- I'm not sure whether 

arbitrary and harassing are the same, in that if there's 

no requirement of individualized suspicion, then it would 

seem to me that there's certainly a broad range of --

QUESTION: 

And there was -- there was reasonable 

suspicion here. 

MS. FOX: 

Yes, yes. 

I understand that in our 

case. 

QUESTION: 

I mean, we just don't have the 

extreme here. 

And -- and with the help of hindsight, it 

looked like an eminently reasonable search, for goodness 

sakes. 

MS. FOX: 

Well, Your Honor, looking again at the 

facts of our particular case, that officer, Detective 

Hancock, had over 12 hours during which he prepared to do 

this search. 

So, it's clearly not a search that had 

exigent circumstances attached to it. 

It's also not a 

search for which he couldn't have gotten a warrant. 

In 

his own view, Detective Hancock believed he could have

gotten a warrant, and in fact, he --

QUESTION: 

Well, that's a perfectly good 

argument against searching someone who's not on probation, 

but it doesn't deal with your case to say they could have 

gotten a warrant and it wasn't exigent circumstances. 

MS. FOX: 

Right. 

I guess what I was thinking is 

it shows that -- that expanding the Griffin probation 

search condition, special needs doctrine, is not necessary 

to enable Detective Hancock to search because he could 

have searched a different way. 

If the Court is 

considering going beyond Griffin and endowing police 

with --

QUESTION: 

Well, you say -- you say going beyond 

Griffin, I mean, Griffin described the Wisconsin system at 

some length, but I don't think, as Justice Scalia 

suggested, that we implied that every single facet of the 

Wisconsin system was necessary to its constitutionality. 

MS. FOX: 

Certainly not, Your Honor, and I --

and I have not sought to represent that. 

But what Griffin 

-- if Griffin means anything, what it does mean is that 

there is some line between a probationary search and a 

nonprobationary, general search. 

Otherwise --

QUESTION: 

Griffin means Wisconsin can do what 

Wisconsin was doing. 

That's what it means. 

MS. FOX: 

Yes. 

But it's not a one-line opinion

that says --

QUESTION: 

And it's very hard to take a case 

that the defendant loses -- where there's a Fourth 

Amendment claim that he loses and say, aha, but in the 

next case, he'll win because the court confined itself to 

the situation before it. 

MS. FOX: 

That's -- that's correct, Your Honor. 

But I -- I believe the Griffin analysis, in going through 

first considering who conducts the search, second, 

considering the presence or absence of reasonable 

suspicion, and then third, concluding that it's conducted 

in conformance with the regulatory scheme that itself 

limits discretion and is therefore constitutional --

QUESTION: 

That's because we were not interested 

in -- in contemplating the creation of any new 

constitutional law. 

We said this can all be fit into 

prior constitutional law on -- on the basis of the special 

needs doctrine. 

But we didn't intimate that if the 

special needs doctrine did not apply, the thing was 

necessarily unconstitutional. 

We didn't intimate that at 

all. 

We just were not interested in going any further 

than we had to. 

QUESTION: 

May I ask you one question that I've 

been pondering about during the argument and don't know 

what the answer is? 

Do you think it would be

unconstitutional for a State legislature to decide that we 

don't want to put drug offenders in prison anymore, but we 

do want to impose on them, in haec verba, condition 9 of 

the probation order here and that -- and pass a statute 

and say all drug offenders who are convicted of possession 

of illegal drugs shall have to submit to that provision? 

MS. FOX: 

Your Honor, I think it's a close 

question. 

The -- the Court might well uphold it, although 

I might argue against it, for this reason. 

The condition 

permits random drug searches. 

QUESTION: 

Correct. 

MS. FOX: 

Now, that's clearly, I think, 

constitutional if they were conducted by the probation 

department. 

There's no reasonable suspicion requirement, 

but in various cases, this Court has repeatedly held that 

detection of drug abuse may be a situation in which we 

dispense with individualized suspicion because it's 

difficult to detect always signs of inebriation. 

This 

condition does appear to require an individual to submit 

to police searches. 

So --

QUESTION: 

Right, but it seems to me that's less 

intrusive than going to jail. 

MS. FOX: 

It's -- well, again, I would never use 

less intrusive than jail as a standard of assessing the 

constitutionality of a probation condition because

certainly a condition that the defendant pay money to the 

opposing party or the district attorney would be less 

onerous than jail, but doesn't answer whether it's 

constitutional. 

So, the Fourth Amendment analysis that 

this Court --

QUESTION: 

Well, it does in a way because what 

the -- the net result of a criminal conviction is a loss 

of liberty, and the question is which liberties can you be 

deprived of and so forth. 

So, there's a definite 

relationship. 

MS. FOX: 

All right. 

(Laughter.) 

QUESTION: 

And you're saying that you can lose 

your liberty by going to jail, but you can't lose this 

lesser liberty. 

I know every lesser included argument 

doesn't prevail, but I don't -- I'm not at all sure why 

this one doesn't. 

MS. FOX: 

It might. 

It would be, again, a 

different case. 

It would be an interesting case. 

But it 

may be again that the intrusion on privacy required of 

urine testing or that you'd lose as a result of urine 

testing is minimal compared to the kind of invasion of 

privacy we're talking about here. 

QUESTION: 

I don't see why it's magic that --

that a probation officer has to do it. 

I mean, there are

certain objectives that -- that the probation officer has 

in common with the law enforcement officer, and -- and one 

of them is to prevent individuals from committing 

additional crimes. 

And what difference does it make 

whether it's a probation officer or a law enforcement 

officer that is pursuing that purpose? 

MS. FOX: 

Your Honor --

QUESTION: 

What about a State that doesn't have 

probation officers? 

You mean States have to have 

probation officers? 

Suppose -- suppose they just say we 

don't feel any need for special probation officers. 

MS. FOX: 

Well, this I think is the important 

distinction between probation and police, and it's a two-

part answer. 

First, under Scott, this Court has recognized 

that police have different objectives than probation 

officers. 

And so to the extent that we're talking about a 

-- to an extent, we are talking about a special needs 

programmatic exception. 

Certainly when the search is 

conducted by a probation officer, under Scott, the Court 

will presume that the probation officer has a probationary 

objective; whereas, again under Scott, a police search 

does not have as its goal ascertaining compliance with 

probation or parole conditions. 

And the Court has 

recognized that in determining that the exclusionary rule

wouldn't apply to parole revocation proceedings. 

But second, in Edmonds, the Court indicated that 

the fact that a general law enforcement search, as a 

secondary matter, furthers special needs -- in that case 

highway safety -- does not bring the search scheme within 

the special needs exception because a secondary, 

incidental furtherance of a special need doesn't change 

the fundamental character at the programmatic level of the 

search. 

That's why police searches that are conducted 

pursuant to this condition are so problematic because, of 

course, as a secondary matter, they ensure compliance with 

probation conditions, but the primary objective of a 

police search, as -- as it was the objective this search 

in this case, is to investigate crime. 

And under the 

Fourth Amendment, we've already decided as a society that 

the hurdles of requiring a warrant and requiring probable 

cause are acceptable costs to impose on the police when 

they're engaged in general law enforcement. 

That's why 

this condition is unconstitutional. 

The Government's consent argument that we 

started with doesn't save it for the reasons that I 

suggested earlier. 

QUESTION: 

You said something in your brief 

about the unconstitutional conditions doctrine rarely

applies in Fourth Amendment cases. 

Now, you did say that, 

didn't you? 

MS. FOX: 

That's my understanding, yes, Your 

Honor. 

QUESTION: 

And why do you think that's so? 

MS. FOX: 

I think the special needs balancing is 

the unconstitutional doctrines -- unconstitutional 

conditions doctrine in the Fourth Amendment situation. 

It's -- it's virtually an identical balancing, and I think 

this Court, in assessing Fourth Amendment issues, again 

and again has returned to the special needs balancing, 

which is particular to the privacy interests and the State 

needs that the Court faces when resolving a Fourth 

Amendment case. 

So, when you look at unconstitutional 

conditions, I think it's achieving the same end by 

requiring a central nexus and then, most importantly, 

looking at proportionality. 

I think that's what -- I'm 

sorry, Your Honor. 

QUESTION: 

Thank you, Ms. Fox. 

Mr. Stewart, you have 2 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOM L. STEWART 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. STEWART: 

The State of California has 

represented in its amicus brief that the State has a 

little over 67,000 police officers and a little over 7,000 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

probation officers within the State. 

And in light of that 

fact, California has, by conditioning probation on consent 

to search by any probation officer or law enforcement 

officer -- the State has, in effect, attempted to enlist 

its police officers in the administration of the probation 

program. 

The core message that this -- excuse me -- that 

this consent term sends to police officers within the 

State is, if you suspect that a known probationer is in 

violation of the most fundamental term of his release --

namely, he's committing future crimes -- you may conduct a 

search that is designed to confirm or dispel that 

suspicion --

QUESTION: 

Or even you don't suspect. 

MR. STEWART: 

Or -- or even you don't suspect. 

But -- but --

QUESTION: 

But, I mean, that -- that's the 

problem. 

MR. STEWART: 

I think it's probably more likely 

that a probation officer would conduct a truly 

suspicionless search, a search with no individualized 

suspicion whatever, than that a police officer would do 

so. 

A probation officer might decide to conduct spot 

checks of his charges even if there were no reason to 

believe that a particular individual was violating the 

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400  1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


Alderson Reporting Company


Page 56 

law. 

A police officer would be less likely to regard that 

as an effective use of his resources and -- and the 

department's resources. 

But -- but the point here is that when a State 

police officer conducts a search intended to confirm or 

dispel the suspicion that a probationer is engaged in new 

criminal activity, he is contributing directly and 

precisely to the realization of a core probation purpose. 

I have nothing further. 

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: 

Thank you, Mr. 

Stewart. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
