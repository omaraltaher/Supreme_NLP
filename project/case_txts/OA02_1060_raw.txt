CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 20 - 02-1060, Illinois v. Robert S. Lidster.


Mr. Feinerman.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY FEINERMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. FEINERMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


A Lombard informational checkpoint was designed


to find witnesses to a specific known crime.  The


principal question here is whether the checkpoint is per


se invalid under the Fourth Amendment or whether it's


governed by the Brown balancing test.  Now, the touchstone


of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, which generally 

is measured by balancing the Government interest advanced


by a seizure against the intrusion on the individual and


this Court has held that road - roadway checkpoints,


including those that serve a law enforcement purpose, are


governed by the balancing factors set forth in Brown v.


Texas.


Now, in Edmond, an exception was carved for a


certain category of law enforcement checkpoints, those


that are designed to advance the general interest in crime


control.  The Court held in Edmond that crime control

checkpoints are not subject to a balancing analysis, but


rather are per se invalid.  The Illinois Supreme Court in


this case held that informational checkpoints, including


the Lombard checkpoint here, fall within that general


crime control exception.  That was an error.  Per se


invalidity under the Fourth Amendment is very strong


medicine and ought to be reserved for exceptional


circumstances, and those circumstances -


QUESTION: Well, I suppose we'd have to decide


here not only whether it was per se invalid, but whether


it was reasonable under any other standard.


MR. FEINERMAN: That's correct, Justice O'Connor.


QUESTION: And let me ask you, is it often that


roadblocks are set up just to get information like this?


MR. FEINERMAN: I - I would rely on the amicus 

briefs submitted by the Illinois Association of Chiefs of


Police and the Major Cities Chiefs Association, and they -


they have informed the Court that roadblocks are not used


frequently, rather they are used judiciously in order to


solve certain -


QUESTION: This was a little odd.  It was a week


later?


MR. FEINERMAN: It was a week later, but there


was a very good reason why the checkpoint was set up at


that particular place and at that particular time.  There

was a fatal hit-and-run accident at about midnight on a


Friday night.  There were no witnesses, at least


pedestrian witnesses, and the Lombard police reasonably


concluded that, because people's driving habits, or at


least some people's driving habits might be regular, that


some of the drivers that were there on the night in


question would also be driving the same route at the same


time at the same place one week later, and we -


QUESTION: The - the - you - you said that they


had to be used judiciously and that's a good word, but our


- do our precedents in this area generally say, well, we


defer to the good judgement of the police, they won't use


them too often.  The Illinois Supreme Court said, oh, if


we allow this, we're going to have roadblocks every other


- every day, every other street and in part that's 

hyperbole, but on the other hand, it does caution us that


there should be some limiting principle and I just don't


know if our precedents would support us in adopting your


word, oh, if it's used judiciously.


MR. FEINERMAN: Well, it's used judiciously for a


number of reasons.  One are the resource limitations. 


These kinds of roadblocks are very resource-intensive. 


There's also the prudential limits that the police


departments place upon themselves.  They don't want to


appear too intrusive to the public and this is a - a minor

inconvenience and the -


QUESTION: What if that isn't enough?  What if


they - they're squandering their resources?  You have a


dumb police chief who's - who's using most of his


resources in fruitless roadblocks.  What do we do then?


MR. FEINERMAN: Then the courts step in and apply


the Brown reasonableness factors. 


QUESTION: Well, what - that's what I'm asking. 


What makes this reasonable that wouldn't make other ones


reasonable?  What would be unreasonable?  A - a general


roadblock asking about general crime - you know, sir, have


you seen any crime committed in the last 6 months,


something like that?  Would that be -


MR. FEINERMAN: That would be closer - that would


be closer to the situation that was presented in Edmond, 

although it wouldn't - it wouldn't present one of the


hallmarks of what we believe is a general crime control


roadblock, which is that it's the goal of the police to


incriminate the motorists as opposed to simply seek


information.


QUESTION: No, it wouldn't - it wouldn't come


within that, but you think that that would - would be


invalid even though you would support these informational


roadblocks in some circumstances?


MR. FEINERMAN: That - that question, of course,

isn't presented here, but I - I -


QUESTION: No kidding.


MR. FEINERMAN: - I understand, but our - I - I


suppose we would say that such roadblocks should not be


declared per se invalid under the Fourth Amendment, but


rather they ought to be subject to the Brown balancing


test.


QUESTION: You going to answer my question? 


Would that one be invalid or not?


MR. FEINERMAN: It would depend upon the


circumstances.  We could -


QUESTION: I gave you the circumstances.  It's a


general roadblock.  They stop everybody who comes along


simply for the purpose of asking, sir or madam, have you


seen a crime committed within the last 6 months? 

MR. FEINERMAN: I think there - there would be -


QUESTION: What other circumstances do you need? 


Whether it's raining or not?


MR. FEINERMAN: No.


QUESTION: Okay.  Now, can you give me -


MR. FEINERMAN: I can't -


QUESTION: - a yes or no?  Is that good or bad?


MR. FEINERMAN: It's, in my most instances it


would be bad, but -

 QUESTION: Okay.


MR. FEINERMAN: - I - I don't know if we could


foreclose the possibility that there might be some


circumstances were such a roadblock would be reasonable. 


For example, let's assume that in - in some area of some


city that there's just rapid lawlessness because of a


blackout or whatever and there are hundreds of crimes


committed and the police might want to canvass the


neighborhood but nobody wants to be seen talking to a


police officer.  So in that instance perhaps a roadblock


would be set up where the police would hand each motorist


a piece of paper saying, you don't have to talk to me now


but here's a number, and if you know of anything that had


happened that was unlawful, please feel free to give us a


call, we'll maintain our confidentiality.


QUESTION: Well, what - what about -


QUESTION: Mr. -


QUESTION: - a road - roadblock that you find in


perhaps some smaller towns where the police just very


briefly stop you and ask you to contribute to the police


boys fund.


MR. FEINERMAN: I'm - I'm not sure that would be


a - a crime control roadblock.


QUESTION: I don't think it is.


(Laughter.)

 MR. FEINERMAN: That - that perhaps would be


valid and now it would be a better practice, of course, if


the police were to simply approach cars that were stopped


at a stoplight or a stop sign or a tollbooth. 


QUESTION: If you had that kind of a roadblock


and one of the drivers just about ran into the policeman,


do you think that the court - the courts would entertain


the argument that, well, the initial stop was invalid,


therefore running into the policeman - it cannot be


grounds for the arrest?  I - it's just a clumsy way of


asking, I guess, whether - whether or not there is any


kind of a causation break here, causation link problem.


MR. FEINERMAN: Yeah, we - that - that argument


perhaps could been made below but it wasn't, and as this


case comes to this Court, the assumption is that if - if 

the roadblock were invalid under the Fourth Amendment,


then the subsequent arrest would be as well.  Even though


the - the - Mr. Lidster almost running into the police


officer did provide cause, that question's not presented


here.


QUESTION: Mr. Feinerman, may I go back to your


own hypothetical of a moment ago in which this crime has


been committed, people don't want to be seen talking to


the police, so the police might set up a roadblock under


those circumstances.  What about the same situation in

which the police say - and I suppose it would be


reasonable in your hypo that they need to talk to a lot


more people than simply the ones who were driving in cars


- on your reasoning, could the police, in effect, cordon


off sidewalks so that any pedestrian coming down the


sidewalk would have to pass through sort of a chute at the


end and could not get through with stopping to talk to the


police officer and answer questions in order to get


through?


MR. FEINERMAN: No, Justice Souter, because


pedestrians have greater Fourth Amendment rights than


motorists.


QUESTION: Well, they - they - they do in the


sense that we - we recognize certain rights to stop the


motorist because of the regulated nature and the highly 

dangerous nature of the - of the driving enterprise.  But


here we're talking about stops which bear absolutely no


relation to the regulation of motor vehicles.  The only


reason for the stop in the case that you're defending, and


the only reason for the stop in my hypo is that there may


be an opportunity to gather evidence from a citizen who


won't come forward but would answer a question.  So it


seems to me that the difference between cars and


pedestrians has nothing to do with the - the - the answer


to my question.  Am I wrong there?

 MR. FEINERMAN: I believe so, Your Honor, with


respect.  It would be permissible with motorists.  It


wouldn't be permissible with pedestrians because motorists


do not have the same expectation of freedom of movement


that pedestrians do.


QUESTION: No, but the - no, but the


justification for interfering with their freedom of


movement is not the justification that's involved in this


stop.  You're not looking for impaired motorists.  You're


not checking licenses and registrations.  You're simply


stopping motorists because they might have seen a crime,


and in the extension of your hypo I'm talking about the


pedestrian who might have seen a crime or have some


evidence of it.  They're in exactly the same situation. 


If you can stop the cars, why can't you stop the 

pedestrians?


MR. FEINERMAN: Again, I - I just have to rely on


my prior answer.  It's because this Court has held that in


certain - in certain situations, suspicionless roadway


stops are permissible, or at least subject - potentially


permissible and subject to the Brown balancing test.


QUESTION: Does one have a - in - is it - a


greater sense of privacy walking down a main thoroughfare


than being in a car?  I understand the distinction between


a home or an office, but you're out there on the street

and the police could make - could - the police could go to


any particular pedestrian and say, could you tell me if


you know anything about X crime that was committed in this


neighborhood and the police could do that?


MR. FEINERMAN: That's correct.  The police can


walk up to any pedestrian and ask questions and that's not


a seizure under the Fourth Amendment.


QUESTION: Can they make the pedestrian stop?  I


mean, I'm walking along, the police says, excuse me, sir,


can I ask - I say, no, I'm too busy, and I keep walking.


MR. FEINERMAN: No.


QUESTION: Can they arrest me for keeping on


walking?


MR. FEINERMAN: No.  That's Brown v. Texas.  The


police cannot do that, but -


QUESTION: So why can they do it with a car?  Is


that what happened here?  Suppose this car were in first


gear as it cruised, you know, rolled up to the roadblock


and the same thing happened, the policeman said, I want to


ask you, you know, sir, I'd like to ask you a question. 


I'm sorry, I'm too busy, just keeps rolling on through. 


Would - would he have been arrested in this roadblock?


MR. FEINERMAN: If - if he's - if he rolled on


through and - or - or if he stopped and said, I don't like


- I don't want to -

MR. FEINERMAN: The - the record doesn't reflect


whether any such instances happened and that would be a


close -


QUESTION: He'd be arrested, let's - he'd be


arrested pretty -


MR. FEINERMAN: Perhaps he would be arrested for


not following -


(Laughter.)


MR. FEINERMAN: Perhaps he would be arrested for


not following the police officer's -


QUESTION: Well, now -


MR. FEINERMAN: - instruction, but really the -

QUESTION: Do - do you think he could do the same


thing with a - with a pedestrian?


MR. FEINERMAN: No, no.  And that's Brown v.


Texas.  Pedestrians cannot be seized for this purpose and


that this -


QUESTION: Well, now, in the Edmonds case, the


Court opinion said that under exigent circumstances there


could be some kind of a - an appropriately tailored


roadblock.  Do you take the position that trying to find a


witness was some kind of an exigent circumstance here?

 MR. FEINERMAN: No.  Our position is not that


there are exigent circumstances.  Our position is that


this is not a general crime control roadblock.  A crime -


QUESTION: When you make your balance under


Brown, do you - does the time that it takes to answer the


officer's inquiry the relevant factor or the time you have


to wait in line if there's a big - it's a crowded street,


you know, they - you cause a traffic jam, you have to wait


20 minutes?


MR. FEINERMAN: It's our position that it's only


the time that - of the police-motorist encounter.


QUESTION: So that even if in fact the delay


caused the - a bunch of people a half hour's delay, that


would be irrelevant?


MR. FEINERMAN: In - in our - we - we - if - were


that question presented, we would say that that's


irrelevant because that's simply endemic.  That's just a


byproduct of driving.


QUESTION: It's a byproduct of the seizure of one


person that you got to wait - wait in turn to be seized


yourself.


MR. FEINERMAN: That's true, and - but what's -


the reason why - the police don't want there to be a line. 


The police just want to talk to each motorist as they're

driving by.


QUESTION: No, but if - if you're on a busy


street, as they were in - in - I forget which suburb of


Chicago this was -


QUESTION: Lombard.


QUESTION: - in Lombard, you're gonna - you're


gonna tie up traffic for a while.


MR. FEINERMAN: Yeah, I should mention - I should


mention that Mr. Lidster at his trial, at page 47 of the


transcript, testified that there were only three cars in


front of him.  So he was stopped really for - at most only


a minute, which is permissible.  But were there a case as


in your hypothetical where a motorist were stopped for a


half an hour, we would still say that that waiting time


doesn't count because that's really more a function of the 

number of vehicles on the street and it's not really - it


was not intended by the officer that there be this backup.


QUESTION: I - I suppose part of the


reasonableness inquiry has to be what alternatives were


available to achieve the same objective.  And why couldn't


the police just have had a big sign on the side of the


road, one of those, you know, illuminated signs that they


have now, which said, you know, please help us, looking


for hit-and-run -


MR. FEINERMAN: It -

 QUESTION: - last week, something like that.  And


then those people who are willing to cooperate could pull


over and cooperate and those - those who want to have


nothing to do with it can keep on moving.


MR. FEINERMAN: That would be possible, but this


Court has said very clearly that a less restrictive means


test is not to be applied under the second Brown factor.


QUESTION: I'm not applying the least - least


restrictive means test, but surely one of the - one of the


factors in determining whether this was reasonable is


whether you could have done - achieved the same objective


in - in some other manner.


MR. FEINERMAN: That's correct.  That is a factor


and - but these kinds of signs or billboards, it isn't


like it just says, drink Budweiser or fly United Airlines, 

there's a lot of information on there, and if these cars


are -


QUESTION: It might distract drivers if - if a


big sign on the road - on the highway when you're supposed


to be looking at the road.  That might be a reason, but


there's a - there's an aspect of this, you've repeated the


police many times, and one of the worrisome things of this


set-up is all you need is a crime, and in major


metropolitan areas there are crimes, multiple crimes every


day.  Who makes the decision?  The local police chief.

And then after some, you can get into court.  It's - it's


not like the law dictates this or even the State's


Attorney General, but it's in every town, the local police


chief that may have just a range of views about using


roadblocks. 


MR. FEINERMAN: That - that's what the Brown


balancing test is there for.  It's there to determine what


kinds of stops are reasonable and which one aren't.  Now,


if there are some circumstances where we can imagine that


we'd want to have this kind of informational checkpoint,


then a - and that's really the principal question here. 


There ought not to be a per se rule, because there are


some situations, and we submit that this is one of them,


where it makes perfect sense for the police to set up a


roadblock because the physical evidence recovered from the 

scene was not sufficient to identify the perpetrator, and


the only witnesses to the crime were fellow motorists, and


there was really only one way our - there wasn't only one


way, but this was a very good way of getting at them.  And


if there are circumstances where we can imagine that we'd


want to enable the police to solve crimes in this manner,


then a per se rule is invalid.  It ought to go through


Brown balancing.


QUESTION: You - you mentioned that this is a


good way to get at the people you want to get to.  Is

there any indication that there - anything of value was


obtained in the investigation of this crime in this


particular roadblock, or do you have any information


across the - from - from broader statistics across the


nation about the effectiveness of doing this?


MR. FEINERMAN: I have no statistics from across


the nation and I'd have to go outside the record to answer


your question.  The Lombard police asked the local news to


actually cover the roadblock, which they did, and somebody


who was watching the local news realized that a gentleman


in her apartment complex had recently had damage to the


right headlight of his F-150 and called -


QUESTION: If - if the police had - if the police


had asked the local news to - to broadcast a 2-minute clip


of a police officer saying, we're having trouble finding 

the perpetrator of this crime, please come forward,


wouldn't that have gotten the same result?


MR. FEINERMAN: Well, we have to -


QUESTION: They wouldn't have done it, but I mean


-


MR. FEINERMAN: They may not have done that.  If


- if there are no further -


QUESTION: - a roadblock is much more fun to


cover.

 MR. FEINERMAN: Justice Scalia makes a good

QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Feinerman.


Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE


SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The reason a news story covering a - a hit-and-


run fatality, as in this case, is not as effective for a


number of reasons.  First of all, statistically, the


majority of Americans don't watch local news.  More


importantly, there is significant value as - as has long


been recognized when police deal with pedestrians and 

approach them, seeking their assistance in solving crimes,


there is significant value to having a police officer


approach someone in a one-on-one manner in an effort to


solve a crime.


First of all, the - the approach impresses on


people, who are otherwise very busy, the importance of the


matter before them and that this may be worth devoting


their time.  The police officer's one-on-one approach can


advise the person, in addition, that what you say might be


significant even though you didn't see an accident.

 QUESTION: But can you stop the person?  I mean,


put it in a pedestrian context, do you think a police


officer can insist that the person stop, stand there, and


listen to his pitch?


MS. MILLETT: No, absolutely not, Justice Scalia. 


There is a long - just there is a long historic


distinction between cars and homes, there's a long


historic distinction between cars and pedestrians, and the


reason - as a practical matter, you have to have a very,


very brief seizure here to protect the life and limb of


the police officer while he tries to make this approach. 


That's not needed when you're approaching pedestrians.


QUESTION: Why - why does the distinction -


you've mentioned it and - and Mr. Feinerman mentioned it -


why does the distinction between cars and pedestrians 

apply in a case in which the - the justification for


making that distinction, regulation, a risk of impaired


driving, does not apply?


MS. MILLETT: What - what is relevant is what


this Court has long recognized is - is the difference in


your reasonable expectations of freedom of movement


between people in cars and pedestrians on the sidewalk.


QUESTION: No, but my expectation of freedom of


movement in the car is that, yeah, the police can stop to


- for a sobriety checkpoint and I'll assume they can -

they can stop to - to check my - my license and the


registration of the car, but I also assume that they


can't, you know, barring today, the result of today's


case, I - I'm assuming that they - they can't stop me for


- for other reasons, barring some really exigent


circumstance.  And if that expectation is reasonable, and


I think it has been at least up until today, then I think


my expectation is - is the same as the pedestrian's


expectation, barring the - the regulatory authority of -


of exercising the regulatory authority, which is not in -


in issue here.


MS. MILLETT: Justice Souter, the essential


command of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and


there's nothing in the Fourth Amendment that says stops


for sobriety or stops to see if you have any aliens in 

your trunk are inherently reasonable and nothing else is. 


It's a balancing test, as this Court has long recognized,


and an important part of that balance is the expectations


that the individual brings to it, and the expectation of


the individual behind the wheel is that there are a number


of times that I will come into contact with police


officers and I will need to stop, I'm highly regulated,


I'm highly restricted, and I am engaged in a privilege of


driving on the public roadways.  Walking is not a


privilege.  Driving on the public roadways is and so the

question -


QUESTION: You're - you're saying that because


they might have observed or - or observed evidence in the


exercise of their privilege that that would be a


regulatory basis for stopping them in the cars, whereas


there wouldn't be any such basis for the pedestrian?


MS. MILLETT: The regulatory need for it is that


there's - you have a very common police practice here, and


one that we expect the police to do if a - a fatality has


been committed is try to find witnesses who were there at


the time.  The only way that principle can work -


QUESTION: And - and we understand that when -


when there's something pretty contemporaneous between the


stopping and the - and the accident.  That's what I had in


mind with exigency. 


But do we - is - is it such a common 

practice that a week later or two weeks later -


MS. MILLETT: It is extremely common for these


types of informational checkpoints.  There's two different


types of checkpoints.  There is the one that's trying to


catch the person right after the crime's been committed.


QUESTION: Yeah.


MS. MILLETT: But the witness checkpoints are


quite routinely done, either 24 hours, or very routinely,


a week after, because people are creatures of habit and


they tend to drive the same roads at the same time of -

the same days, and so it's very common - a number - a


number of Federal checkpoints have been done exactly like


this.  They've been done a week after a child's been


abducted.  In the Elizabeth Smart case, it was a week


later.  Federal checkpoints that I'm familiar with were


done exactly - exactly a week later, and you try to go at


the exact same time, because that is eminently sensible


for police officers.  If you want to look for the


witnesses, you want to find people who are most likely to


have been there at the same time.


QUESTION: Have they been successful?  Is your


knowledge of these things profound enough that you can say


how successful they've been? 


MS. MILLETT: I - I can't give you -


QUESTION: Do you know of any that have been 

successful?


MS. MILLETT: Yes, absolutely.  The - the Park


Police did one - the Federal Park Police did one here in


the Washington, D.C. area a couple years ago that found


four eyewitnesses to a hit-and-run fatality.  But also,


the ability to measure success here - we're not talking


about immediately removing a drunk driver from the road or


actually finding the alien - solving - you're successful


if you defined you solved the crime, and solving a crime


is not a linear project.  It involves a lot of information

coming in from a different -


QUESTION: But you couldn't - you couldn't do


this to try to get the perpetrator.  That would clearly be


Edmond, and there seems to be something odd about saying,


police, you can't have a roadblock in a neighborhood where


you think that it's likely the suspect is living, but you


can if you say what you're looking for, it's not the


suspect, but witnesses.


MS. MILLETT: Justice Ginsburg, I - two


responses.  First of all there are - Edmond leaves open


that there are at least some circumstances when you can do


this - maybe to approach is exigency - but where you can


do these types of checkpoints to catch someone.  The


language there was a fleeing dangerous criminal who was


going by particular routes, so it's not - that doesn't 

seem to be foreclosed in all circumstances.  But the


reason it makes a big differences for purposes of Fourth


Amendment principles, there's actually three reasons why


looking for witnesses is better and should be more


consistent with the Fourth Amendment than what - the issue


in Edmond.  And that is, there - there's a difference


between, just a practical difference, between police


taking action, seizing people first and looking for a


crime to go with them, which is what was going on in


Edmond, or having a specific crime and looking to solve it

in the most sensible and reasonable manner that police


officers do, and that is looking for witnesses.


QUESTION: Well, following Justice Ginsburg's


question, which is the easier of the two cases?  The one


we have here or a hypothetical case in which they have a


description of the hit-and-run driver and they stop


everybody to look in the car to see if the driver meets


the description?  Which is the easier of the two cases to


sustain?


MS. MILLETT: Assuming that this is not - it's


not right after the crime that I have the description -


QUESTION: A week later, everything else the


same.


MS. MILLETT: I think this Court's - I think both


of them are different from Edmond, but I do think this 

Court's doctrines establish why the witness approach is -


is more - is less intrusive on Fourth Amendment interests


for - for three reasons.  One is that there is a self-


incrimination component, self-protection component to the


Fourth Amendment and that has been very important in the


drug testing cases.  It was central to the resolution of


the Ferguson decision and mentioned in camera -


QUESTION: I - I wonder if you'd answer Justice


Kennedy's question.  Which is the easier case?


MS. MILLETT: I - I'm -

 QUESTION: You don't know?


MS. MILLETT: - oh, I'm sorry -


QUESTION: Pardon me?


MS. MILLETT: We would like to have them both


sustained, quite frankly, and we don't think they're -


they're exactly covered by Edmond -


QUESTION: Yes, yes, but which is more consistent


- which is easier to say is consistent with the Fourth


Amendment?


MS. MILLETT: There -


QUESTION: I would just - I'm mixed up with


easier because I don't - which is - the two cases that he


gave, in which do you think it's easier for you to win


your argument?


MS. MILLETT: I - I think the witness one is 

easier for three reasons, and one is because the Fourth


Amendment has this self-protection principle, which is not


implicated when you're - you're looking for witnesses. 


The checkpoint does not -


QUESTION: In other words, this case is easier?


MS. MILLETT: Yes, yes, the witness checkpoint,


the looking for information checkpoint.


QUESTION: All right.  I got mixed up -


MS. MILLETT: I'm sorry if I'm not -


QUESTION: This case is easier?

 MS. MILLETT: Yes.  This case is easier, but -


but there's - there's two other reasons besides the self-


protection principle.  One is, as a practical matter, one


of the balancing tests - factors - in Brown v. Texas is


the level of anxiety.  When a police officer approaches


you and says - even if it's permissible - I want to know


if you're doing something wrong.  Do you not have a


driver's license?  Are you drunk?  That's - there's a


little more anxiety there when a police - than when a


police officer comes and says, I would like your help,


someone was killed here.


QUESTION: And what's the third reason?


MS. MILLETT: And - and the third -


QUESTION: The Fourth Amendment is an anxiety


thing?  My goodness.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION: That is a factor but -


MS. MILLETT: It's all - it's all very - sorry.


QUESTION: - that - that cuts against you in this


case, though, doesn't it?  This was at midnight.


MS. MILLETT: No, no.  Part of the Brown v. Texas


balancing factors is - is of - one of the things that's


been mentioned is the level of anxiety, and the reason


that you don't have roving stops but you're allowed to


have checkpoints is when you see other people being

stopped around you, even if they want to know if you're


drunk -


QUESTION: I have a pending question about the -


the third reason.  I - what's the third reason?


MS. MILLETT: The third - thank you - the third


reason is - is a - is a - there's a sort of a practical


limitation on the use of these checkpoints when police are


not allowed to use it to do their run-of-the-mill


business.  Their job is to find crimes and criminals. 


Edmond was a checkpoint to find crimes and criminals that


we didn't know about, when instead all that's being done


here is this is an adjunct to a - adapting to the roadway


context the normal investigative processes of police


officers.  You - you don't have that abuse, and the same


way -


QUESTION: So this is a built-in limitation on


the frequency of its use?


MS. MILLETT: It is, and Justice Kennedy, you


also asked about doctrinal limitations in this Court's


cases, and in Atwater v. City of Lago Vista the exact same


argument was made dealing with misdemeanor arrests.  And


this Court's decision there specifically relied upon the


good sense and political accountability of police, for the


same reason that we know police don't arrest for every


crime and infraction that - vehicle code infraction that

they find.  A lot of police chiefs are arrested and


checkpoints are a great equalizer, especially these kind,


because the location is dictated by where the crime


occurred -


QUESTION: Arrested or elected?  What - did you


say arrested or elected?  That a lot of police chiefs are


-


MS. MILLETT: Oh, I hope I said elected.

MS. MILLETT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Millett.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD J. RAMSELL


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. RAMSELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


The mass, suspicionless seizure of innocent


citizens for the purpose of investigating ordinary


criminal wrongdoing without exigent circumstances is a


violation of the Fourth Amendment, and Indianapolis v.


Edmond is the controlling precedent.


QUESTION: Well, that sounds a little colorful,


but - but in my own mind I'm thinking that this is asking


people to help with crime investigation and to spend 10

seconds listening to the request.  Now, it's - I was


delayed 2 hours - not 2 hours, but like 2 minutes anyway,


or 3 minutes, this morning coming in, for the last couple


of days because they had some tree pruning equipment, all


right?  So maybe they could put that on the sidewalk and


not delay me, but I don't mind.  I did actually mind, but


I mean -


(Laughter.)


QUESTION: - but - you see, it's not - what their


argument is, and that's, at least for me, what I'd like


you to address, is this is not much of a - of a demand on


people to stop for 10 seconds when they're trying to find


out somebody who killed someone and - and we just want you


to listen for 10 seconds.  Now, why - why is that such an


unreasonable thing for the police to ask the public to do? 

Nobody has to take the flyer, they don't even have to


help.


MR. RAMSELL: Well, Justice Breyer, by definition


this is a seizure.


QUESTION: I - I don't care about the - I'm


asking you - I understand - I'm asking you why it's


unreasonable.  That's the word in the Fourth Amendment and


I tried to make it as - as reasonable-sounding as I could. 


Maybe somebody else could do better, but I want your


response to my effort to make this sound very reasonable.

That's what I'm interested in, your response.


MR. RAMSELL: It remains unreasonable for a


number of matters.  It's the aggregate of the


circumstances then by which other innocent persons could


be seized.  It's the fact that the gravity of the public


concern in this particular event is far less than the


reasonableness - reasonableness factors that have been


used in Sitz.  It's far less than the immigration factor


that was found in Martinez v. Fuerte.


QUESTION: I don't really want to hear cases so


much.  I want to hear in common sense why this isn't a


reasonable thing to do.  I'm not saying you even have to


convince me to win your case, I'm just saying that for -


I'd like to know why, in ordinary, common-sense English,


this isn't the most reasonable thing in the world?  Now,


I'm - I'm now overstating it so you'll be sure to give me


an answer.


MR. RAMSELL: It's midnight.  You're on a road


where you do not expect to be confronted by a police


officer.  You're waiting in line for several minutes as


various other cars are evidently being interrogated, some


are being transferred to secondary staging areas.  The


anxiety builds and you arrive at the front of the


roadblock to be questioned about where you were last week,


personal indications, what have you seen?  You feel

compelled to answer.


QUESTION: I didn't think that was the evidence. 


I thought they were given a flyer saying if you - read


this and see if you observed anything that could help us


find the hit-and-run driver.


MR. RAMSELL: Detective Vasil testified that they


were stopped, given a flyer, but also asked if they had


been in the area last week and if they had seen anything


unusual.  That second phase was relatively


interrogational, although field interrogational. 


Nevertheless, it is somewhat intrusive on what are


considered some of our privacy -


QUESTION: Well, suppose that there is a


roadblock but the only purpose of the roadblock is the


police are stopping people to see if they'll contribute to 

the police boys fund.  The same thing - exactly the same


thing happens with that roadblock has happened with your


client.  He comes up, almost hits the policeman, smells


alcohol on his breath and so forth, he's charged with


drunken driving and is convicted.  Does he have a Fourth


Amendment claim?


MR. RAMSELL: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it would


be a seizure, so the Fourth Amendment is implicated. 


However, applying the Edmond analysis, the programmatic


purpose of that seizure not being in the investigation or

detection of crime, I would submit it would not be a


violation of the Fourth Amendment.


QUESTION: So they can hold him up for 2 hours if


they're collecting for the police boys fund but they can't


hold him up for 10 or 15 seconds if they're trying to


solve a crime?


QUESTION: That doesn't make any sense.  Or hold


him up for no reason at all, just for a lark.  Hey, let's


hold up a bunch of people.


(Laughter.)


QUESTION: You - you say that passes the Fourth


Amendment test but if - but - but this very reasonable


investigation does not.  That can't be right.


MR. RAMSELL: I - I would submit, Justice Scalia,


that if you were to stop a person and seize them for no 

reason whatsoever that that would not survive a Fourth


Amendment analysis.  Ten to 15 seconds to deliver some


funds and put them in a can would certainly be reasonable


for that beneficent, non-crime control purpose.  Two hours


would certainly exceed -


QUESTION: Are you saying it would be okay to


have a roadblock to collect for the policemen's benevolent


fund?


MR. RAMSELL: Compulsive collection would be


questionable.  That would seem to be a tax.

QUESTION: I think if we endorsed -


MR. RAMSELL: But we do -


QUESTION: - your view that they can stop for the


chief just as a purpose, there's going to be massive


change in the way these organizations raise money.


(Laughter.)


MR. RAMSELL: It - it is often difficult to say


no when - when a fireman is seeking some funds.  However,


it is certainly not the detection or investigation of


crime, and the analysis that would take place there would


be different, and certainly 2 hours to put money in a can


would suggest that the scope and duration of that stop was


far beyond what was reasonable.


QUESTION: Maybe - maybe your response to Justice 

Breyer's question - I'm not sure that reasonableness for


Fourth Amendment purposes is the same as reasonableness in


general.  Do you think it would be - in general, if you're


not talking about the Fourth Amendment - an unreasonable


thing for a policeman to knock on your door and say,


excuse me, sir, we're investigating a crime, we really


need your help, do you mind if I - I come in and ask you a


couple of questions just to help us solve this crime?  Do


you think that's reasonable in - in - in a sense?  I guess


it is.

 MR. RAMSELL: It is considered a voluntary


encounter to the extent that if you choose to open the


door and engage in that conversation the Fourth Amendment


isn't even implicated there.


QUESTION: No, the person says, unreasonably says


no, and the policeman comes in anyway.


MR. RAMSELL: That would be a violation of the


Fourth Amendment.


QUESTION: Even though it isn't really the


policeman that's being unreasonable in the general sense. 


It seems to me it's quite unreasonable for the homeowner


to refuse to cooperate at all with the police in the - in


the solving of a - let's assume it's a major crime.  That


seems to me unreasonable, but even so, the policeman is


not allowed to come into the home.


MR. RAMSELL: That's correct, Your Honor, and


there's the difference between the voluntary consensual


encounter and what we have in this case was clearly


involuntary.  They even had an officer -


QUESTION: And so also here.  It might be very


unreasonable for the person not to want to cooperate, and


it might be quite reasonable for the policeman to seek the


cooperation, but that doesn't necessarily answer the


Fourth Amendment question.


MR. RAMSELL: I would suggest that the fact that

an innocent motorist would feel that he or she was


unreasonable by not cooperating suggests the compulsive


aspects of this scenario, make it more of a violation of


the Fourth Amendment, and more unreasonable to that


extent.  One -


QUESTION: Mr. Ramsell, did I understand your


argument to be that if the crime had been a child


abduction, that this kind of roadblock to try to get


evidence would be permissible?


MR. RAMSELL: In - in a general sense, yes.  Of


course, there would be other factors involved, but child


abductions generally fall within the exigent circumstance


analysis.  Clearly there would likely have to be further


evaluation of the facts behind why they felt that -


QUESTION: Well, why if - if it's the danger 

involved and wanting to save a life that we hope is still


in being, why isn't the same thing if you're trying to get


evidence about a hit-and-run person who kills people on


the highway?


MR. RAMSELL: Well, first off, the child


abduction is a continuing crime, to the extent that the


need for action in order to prevent the passable future or


immediate harm to that child, makes that an exigent


circumstance by itself.


QUESTION: So you think this would be different

if this was a serial hit-and-run killer, right?  He does


one a week.  Then - then you think it'd be a different


situation and maybe they could conduct the - the


roadblock.


MR. RAMSELL: Well, as we had in Sitz with the


imminent hazard of drunk drivers, if there were such a


thing as a serial hit-and-run driver, the imminency, the


exigency would be suggested within that hypothetical, and


so I believe that it would be more reasonable under that


circumstance, but what we -


QUESTION: And what about a rape murder that -


you know that that's not just a hypothetical case?


MR. RAMSELL: That had recently occurred?


QUESTION: A rape murder recently occurred and


the police set up a roadblock to get evidence. 

MR. RAMSELL: Again, if there was - if it was


very fresh, and the more fresh it is the more reasonable


it tends to become under a simply an exigency analysis,


the fresher the crime the more believability -


QUESTION: So would this - would this case have


been different if it had been the next day rather than a


week later?


MR. RAMSELL: If they had some independent


evidence to suggest that the person was still in the area,


that may have been a different set of facts.  Commonwealth

v. Burns was an example of a informational roadblock where


they had independent evidence to believe that the murderer


was still in the area.  I believe that was 2 days later.


QUESTION: So if you need a little - if you have


a little evidence, then you can seek more.  But if you had


none, you can't try to get a lead by this technique?


MR. RAMSELL: Justice Ginsburg, I believe the


exigency of the circumstances would certainly authorize


more - a possible information roadblock under those


circumstances.


QUESTION: Did this - is it the case that in this


very situation we're talking about it led to information


about the person responsible?


MR. RAMSELL: Justice O'Connor, my understanding


is that the roadblock itself was entirely ineffective.  It


had zero effectiveness in seeking to obtain information


regarding this event.  In fact, I believe that we've just


heard that it was the television which led to some


information, which is a standard police practice, does not


implicate the Fourth Amendment, does not require any


seizure of innocent persons -


QUESTION: Yeah, but it requires a roadblock.


MR. RAMSELL: I believe that in the television


context there's no roadblock at issue and no one's even


compelled to watch the television -

QUESTION: Nothing duller than watching a wall of


- of wanted posters, you know, and now, for our listeners,


we're going to pan the wanted posters at the post office.


I mean -


MR. RAMSELL: That would -

repetitious -


QUESTION: But if - if they hired someone like


Justice Scalia to go on the screen and describe it -


(Laughter.)


QUESTION: - big audience.


QUESTION: Can I ask you a question about the


facts of this case, please?  The blue brief describes it


as a - a roadblock - roadblock set up in the evening, and


as I understand it the crime was at 12:15 a.m., which I


interpret to be midnight.  It was a midnight crime and I


thought the roadblock was at midnight, and I wonder, how

long did it last?  Was it started in the evening and


lasted several hours or was it just -


MR. RAMSELL: To be frank, searching the record


it's - it's relatively unclear.  My understanding is 90


minutes to 2 hours at most.


QUESTION: And it - it was though in the dark at


- at night, not during the day?


MR. RAMSELL: Yes, it was at night.


QUESTION: And I also don't understand if they


handed something to read, how could you read in the - at


the - in the dark?


MR. RAMSELL: That would also be equally as


difficult, Your Honor.  I -


QUESTION: Does the record explain that they did


hand something legible to the person or use a flashlight 

or what - what was the -


MR. RAMSELL: Logic would seem to dictate that by


the time the person received the flyer and drove away they


would again be away from the scene of the event before


they even read the flyer, which also makes it somewhat


ineffective in that regard.


QUESTION: But did they - were there something


they were asked to read before they left or just left with


them to drive away with?  I just don't understand what


happened, to tell you the truth.

 MR. RAMSELL: Well, to - to take - to take the 10


to 15 seconds Detective Vasil describes as the duration of


handing the flyer, asking two questions, and obtaining two


answers, it would seem that reading the flyer would have


had to have occurred sometime after the seizure.


QUESTION: I see.


QUESTION: There wasn't very much on the flyer,


was there?


MR. RAMSELL: Well, it did have some - it - it


indicated the -


QUESTION: We - we have it someplace, don't we?


MR. RAMSELL: Yes.  It is in the joint appendix


and it's located on page 9 of the joint appendix, and


there is - there is a great amount of detail that's in


that flyer, certainly would suggest it would be difficult 

for one to read the entirety of it, understand the purpose


for which they were even being stopped that evening, which


is another point.  There was no advance signs, unlike


sobriety checkpoints, where as you're arriving, and even


before you have contact with - with the police officers,


there's a sign that says, warning, sobriety checkpoint


ahead.  At least you're putting - you're put on notice


what it is that's taking place in front of you.  Here,


people are waiting in line having no idea what it is -


QUESTION: Well, but that - that happens in a lot

of other contexts too.  You can be driving on a highway,


all of a sudden everything comes to a stop.  What's the


matter?  Is it an accident?  Are they having one-lane


repair?  And you just don't know, I mean, that's part of


the condition of driving.


MR. RAMSELL: Well, certainly we have to expect


that we'll be stopped more often than anyone would wish in


that context, but it - it's quite different when you are -


when there's six to twelve emergency vehicles there and


as you get closer and closer you see this encounter taking


place before you with every single motorist in front of


you.  That raises the anxiety of even the - the most


innocent citizen, I would suggest.


QUESTION: Might I ask another question about the


- the facts of the case? 


Reading the flyer, it's 

something you could have handed to a pedestrian too who


might have been at the scene.  Does the record show


whether they did hand this flyer to pedestrians who might


have been walking by at the same time the week after the


accident?


MR. RAMSELL: Well, my understanding of this


location, being familiar with the area, is that it's a


major thoroughfare with -


QUESTION: Right.  I know -


MR. RAMSELL: - multiple lanes.  It would be

highly unlikely at midnight that any pedestrian would or


should be walking on the shoulder of this high speed limit


-


QUESTION: Oh, there are no sidewalks there?


MR. RAMSELL: No.  There are rarely sidewalks in


our town, unfortunately.


QUESTION: Oh, okay.


QUESTION: Mr. Ramsell, there's something I'd


like you to comment on.  The - the Illinois Supreme Court


was - was concerned about the - the effect of - of this


practice, in effect, in opening the door to stops all the


time.  They said, you know, there are loads of crimes and


if it's justified here it will be justified in other cases


and so on, and there have been some questions from the


bench to that effect.


One answer to that might be that under the law


as it stands now the police can conduct sobriety


checkpoints and we will assume that they can make license


and registration checks and things like that.  So the -


the police already have an opportunity, to put it bluntly,


to abuse their right to stop if they want to do it.  Is


there any indication that there is this kind of abuse


going on, and hence, is there any reason to believe that


the abuse would be greater if this practice passed muster


than it is under the existing law?

 MR. RAMSELL: Well, I believe that law


enforcement is always appreciative of any techniques or


tools that they're allowed to use for investigatory


purposes.


QUESTION: But what - what do we know? 


Empirically, what we do know?  What is - has there - has


there been an indication of abuse?  Is there a reason to


believe that this invitation, this tool, would be abused


more than the tools that they now have?


MR. RAMSELL: I would believe that it would be


more - more likely for abuse if this Court were to suggest


that these type of roadblocks were a valid investigative


tool.


QUESTION: But why - why?


MR. RAMSELL: Because it would simply, number 

one, it is - it makes for great publicity for law


enforcement to use these roadblocks.  They feel that it's


a -


QUESTION: Well, it makes for great publicity to


- to have sobriety checkpoints.  That's one reason why


they have them.


MR. RAMSELL: And - I agree, even though


statistically roadblock sobriety checkpoints tend to be


far less effective than saturation patrols.  Most police


chiefs comment that they don't get the type of publicity

they receive from a roadblock that they get from


saturation patrols.


QUESTION: Is it true that -QUESTION: Suppose


they had done the same thing they did here, the same


thing, except that, in addition to giving them a flyer and


asking them about what happened - were - you know, were


you here a week before, they - it was also a check of


driver registration?


MR. RAMSELL: I would suggest the programmatic


purpose, the primary programmatic purpose employed in


Edmond would still remain that this was for the purpose of


crime detection and investigation, not for simply checking


licenses.  The same -


QUESTION: Well, they were actually checking


licenses. 
 I mean, they're - they're really doing it. 

MR. RAMSELL: And I -


QUESTION: And they - they pick up some people


who don't - don't have licenses, but while they're at it


they kill two birds with one stone.  And you say it would


make it bad because its primary purpose was the other?


MR. RAMSELL: Justice Scalia, I would suggest the


programmatic purpose, which would be a question of intent,


would still remain that it was truly for the investigation


of this particular crime and certainly the duration and


the scope of the seizure would exceed the license check

when questions were being asked about whether you had been


here last week, whether you had seen anything regarding a


hit-and-run or any other crime.  And that would seem to


exceed even the suggested appropriateness of a roadblock


for license checks in Prouse.


QUESTION: That - that incremental point of time


- you're really playing with a - an inconsequential -


inconsequential impingement upon the person's time.


QUESTION: Mr. Ramsell, do you know - going back


to Justice Souter's question - whether in the aftermath of


Sitz there have been an increase in sobriety checkpoints


in this country?


MR. RAMSELL: I know that a - a far greater


number have been reported since Sitz, but I cannot confess


to knowing what the statistics or the record-keeping was 

prior to Sitz, but it has - it has now crept into the


American psyche that roadblocks are a - a regular way of


life.


QUESTION: But do - do they exist in Michigan


anymore, these sobriety checkpoints?


MR. RAMSELL: No.  When the - when the case was


remanded to Michigan, Michigan found under their own State


constitution that this - that a sobriety checkpoint still


remained to be an unreasonable violation of the search and


seizure clause of their own constitution, so they do not

have them.


Now, in this case, what we have is we have a - a


very stale event.  In fact, the facts do not even suggest


that the driver was perhaps even negligent in how the


accident occurred.  We have a - a bicyclist on a major


thoroughfare at midnight in a place where it's highly


unusual to - to find pedestrians in a dark area, and


there's been no indication that the driver was at fault


other than failing to remain at the scene of the accident.


QUESTION: That's pretty serious, isn't it,


called hit-and-run?


MR. RAMSELL: It's hit-and-run as -


QUESTION: All right, so all that's at stake is


that it was a hit-and-run and the guy's dead, all right. 


So - so now what has that to do with the reasonableness of 

this?  I'm not - not asking you facetiously because I


think maybe you think you want to tie it in and I just


want you to do it.


MR. RAMSELL: Well, the consequences are very


serious.  However, hit-and-run would also fall within


dinging the car in the grocery parking lot next to you and


failing to remain at the scene.  These are single events -


QUESTION: So you mean that it might be


reasonable to do it for some serious crimes but not for

less serious?


MR. RAMSELL: I would suggest that it cannot be


done for any crime except in exigent circumstances, which


we do not have here.  This is a stale event -


QUESTION: So even - even if it were, say, a


carjacking, where there was a fatality, if it's stale it


can't be done?


MR. RAMSELL: Yes, Your Honor.  I would - I would


respectfully say that, under the analysis in Edmonds,


there is a lack of exigency.  Edmonds suggests that, but


for the emergency circumstances of an - an imminent


terrorist attack, otherwise that would be considered a


violation of the Fourth Amendment.  This is a single


accident.  It - it does not fall within the magnitude of


any of the previous issues that have been brought before 

the Court -


QUESTION: Now you seem - seem to be arguing the


same thing that, other things being equal, if you lose on


your other points you could only do it in a serious but


not non-serious.  Is that what you're - is that the point


you're making?  And if so, I want to know what the line


is.


MR. RAMSELL: Well, the line is exigency, and


exigency meaning there was no - there's an immediate


hazard on the roadway, which was what seemed to justify

sobriety checkpoints in Sitz, that there would have been


an effectiveness to removing then-hazardous drivers and


preventing the potential for future injury to life and


limb.  This is a post-event, non-exigent roadblock.  The


facts, nevertheless, don't have the gravity of the public


concern.  In the Brown v. Texas -


QUESTION: Well, what if - what if you've got a -


a license number and for - for a serious crime that was


committed, say, an hour ago?  Can - can you then conduct a


- this sort of program?


MR. RAMSELL: I would submit yes, that you could


under that circumstance.  Number one, you could tailor the


roadblock substantially less.  You have the exigency


because it is a fresh pursuit analysis.  You certainly


wouldn't need to pull over every car and question them if 

you had a license plate number to work from.  And so it -


it would certainly even be capable of being more


sufficiently tailored so that those who are admittedly


innocent are less likely to have their liberties


interfered with.


QUESTION: Of course -


QUESTION: Well, what if you - what if you just


had the information that it's - it's a black Ford SUV?


MR. RAMSELL: And it happened one hour ago?


QUESTION: Yeah.

 MR. RAMSELL: I believe under that set of


circumstances the exigency would suggest there would be a


potential for a reasonable checkpoint tailored in scope


and duration with sufficient guidelines in place.  In


fact, in this particular checkpoint, we have virtually no


guidelines in place.  We have a field officer who


testifies that what he did was to ask some questions. 


There's no indication as to why other persons were sent to


secondary staging areas.  We do not have any guidelines so


that if a motorist had said, yes, I was here last week,


and yes, I think I have some information, we have no


guidelines for those field officers as to what to do and


how to treat that motorist and how to detain that person.


QUESTION: You know anybody's that's challenged


these things who - for any reason other than the 

exclusionary rule?  This case wouldn't be here except for


the fact that your client during the stop was found to be


driving under the influence.  Had that not happened, don't


you think there's zero chance that anyone would have cared


enough, would have felt beset upon enough by the police to


bring some action to stop this Gestapo-like activity?


MR. RAMSELL: I do believe there are -


QUESTION: I mean, it's - it's really just the


exclusionary rule driving - driving this case.


MR. RAMSELL: Respectfully, Your Honor, I do -

there - I do believe there are people who care and there


are people who care about our right to be let alone, our


right of free passage.


QUESTION: Well, if people in Lombard care about


it, they can tell the police to stop doing it.


MR. RAMSELL: I certainly would hope that they


would also exercise their right to let them know that they


dislike these roadblocks as much as perhaps others in more


intellectual pursuits, but -


QUESTION: Are there indications nationwide that


the public makes objection to roadblocks, other than the


person that's caught for drunk driving?


MR. RAMSELL: I would suggest that most - most


persons are not pleased by roadblocks.  I believe that


most people feel that they do reflect on an invasion of 

their privacy and liberty.


QUESTION: I mean, is there evidence of that?


MR. RAMSELL: I - I cannot cite any polling


that's been taken one way or the other that would really


flesh that out.  Here we have far less than the drug


interdiction that was rejected in Edmond.  We have a


single accident.  We have far less than the concern about


protecting our national borders, as we had in Martinez v.


Fuerte, and certainly not the imminency of the hazard that


was found in Sitz.  There's frankly no empirical or actual

data to even support that this roadblock will advance the


interest, and by the fact that nothing was advanced in


this particular event suggests that even in a balancing


test we don't have the sufficiency, the gravity of the


public concern, nor do we have any indication of any


degree to which this seizure would advance the public


interest.  This is more akin to Prouse, where the Court


found that the - the likelihood of finding an unlicenced


motorist versus the likely numbers of persons that will be


stopped was so substantial that data was insufficient.


QUESTION: Well, Prouse was random stops, though,


wasn't it?


MR. RAMSELL: It was random stops.  However, the


effectiveness was mentioned as - as one of the factors,


and there were certainly reasonable alternatives that were 

suggested that could have avoided the random stop


scenario.  And here we have admittedly innocent drivers as


well with no escape route, so a person couldn't even avoid


the - the compulsory stop and questioning. 


I would also submit that this analysis, if - if


found appropriate here, would equally allow for the stop


of pedestrians at - on the sidewalk.  It would allow the


police to circle an office building and have the persons


run through the - with the gamut of brief questioning


before they were allowed to leave an office building.  And

it would be very unmanageable and unworkable to find an


appropriate balancing test, even though I would submit


that one thing the Court needs to do is to, of course, let


law enforcement know in advance what will be acceptable


conduct on their part and that it would be inappropriate


to allow for a case-by-case, fact-sensitive analysis based


on the plethora of crimes that could potentially lead to


it, the geographic area in a small rural town.  The rural


police chief may find roadblocks or - may find their most


serious crime to be the stealing of a purse and therefore


a roadblock of some form justifiable there, where that


same roadblock in an urban setting would be found to be


unreasonable and unjustifiable, and certainly those


politically accountable officials that feel that their


citizenry are more favorable to roadblocks may be 

encouraged to allow them to occur more often.  Thank you.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Ramsell.


Mr. Feinerman, you have 2 minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY FEINERMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. FEINERMAN: This Court in Edmond found that


narcotics check - narcotics checkpoints are so obnoxious


to core Fourth Amendment values that a per se rule of


invalidity was justified and the principal question here


is whether informational checkpoints present the same

Fourth Amendment dangers that general crime control


checkpoints present, and the answer to that is no.


And in order to answer that, we - we have to


figure out what the hallmarks are of a crime control


checkpoint, and we suggest that there are at least two. 


The first is that it's the purpose of the checkpoint to


incriminate the motorist as opposed to the situation in


Lombard, which was simply the police asking for help, and


that distinction makes a difference under the Fourth


Amendment for several reasons.  The first has to do with


privacy.  At a general crime control checkpoint, the


police are trying to learn something about you, whether


you've committed a wrongdoing, whereas at an informational


checkpoint there's just asking for help, somebody died


here last week, could you help us find the perpetrator. 

There's also a difference in terms of jeopardy. 


At a general crime control checkpoint you may be


interrogated, detained, arrested, prosecuted, and possibly


jailed, whereas at an informational checkpoint, again,


you're just being asked for help, and that's a critical


distinction that this Court drew in Ferguson between the


drug test that was invalidated in Ferguson and the drug


testing programs that were upheld in Skinner, Acton, and


Von Raab. 


There's also an indignity element to a general

crime control checkpoint.  You're being - it's - it's a


bit of an indignity to be suspected as being a potential


law-breaker, whereas in - in an informational checkpoint


there's really no impingement on dignity, you're just,


again, being treated as an ally of the police and being


asked for help, and in fact, it's an act of responsible


citizenship to provide help in that kind of situation. 


The second distinction is that a general crime


control checkpoint - the police are simply trolling for


hitherto undiscovered crimes, whereas in an informational


checkpoint, they're investigating a known, specific crime,


and that's who makes a difference.  There's a difference


between - as Ms. Millett pointed out - there's a


difference between knowing a crime and finding the


criminal and then simply rounding up a bunch of potential 

criminals and trying to peg a crime on them.  And that's


important not only for the fact that we're uncomfortable


with general - general surveillance, but also it's a


traditional police function.  When a crime happens, police


ought to return to the scene of the crime and find


witnesses.  Thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.


Feinerman.  The case is submitted.(Whereupon, at 11:03


a.m., the case in the above-entitled matter was


submitted.)
