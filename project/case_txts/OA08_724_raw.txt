 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-724, Smith v. Spisak.

 General Cordray.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. RICHARD CORDRAY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. CORDRAY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Because this case arises under the 

deferential standards of the AEDPA statute, Mr. Spisak 
must show that the Ohio Supreme Court's decision was 
contrary to Mills v. Maryland or that it unreasonably 
applied Strickland v. Washington.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why?  I -- I have been 
trying to figure out why the State court would know in 
its decisionmaking that Mills commanded a different 
result when Mills was issued after the State denied its 
petition for rehearing.

 MR. CORDRAY:  It's a bit of a conundrum, 
Your Honor, because Mills was issued after the Ohio 
Supreme Court's decision here, but before it became 
final on direct review when cert was denied by this 
Court in March of 1989.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, finality in that

sense is generally looked at in terms of AEDPA statute 
of limitations.  Why should the same rule apply to the 
question of whether a State has acted contrary to or 
unreasonably in light of Supreme Court precedent when 
the precedent didn't exist at the time it was rendering 
its decision?  How can a court act?

 MR. CORDRAY:  I'm perfectly willing, Your 

Honor, to back it up a step and say Mills was not 
clearly-established law at the time that the Ohio 
Supreme Court decided, although the issues were current 
at the time.

 But I would go further and say the extension 

of Mills that the Sixth Circuit's ruling made here is 
not clearly-established law even today, more than 
20 years later.  There is a -- the vast majority of 
Circuits, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Tenth, have 
rejected the position the Sixth Circuit took here, and 
in fact, this case is quite distinct from Mills even if 
Mills were applicable.  But I would take your point and 
I would agree with it that it's kind of tough to impose 
on the Ohio Supreme Court Mills when -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We don't have to go any 
further if we simply address the question, at what point 
in time are we talking about a State court's decision, 
correct?

MR. CORDRAY:  Fair enough.  Fair enough. 
Yes.  But I would say this case is distinct even from 
Mills, where the Court determined that the jury 
instructions gave the jury to believe that they could 
only consider mitigating factors that they had 
determined unanimously to be present.  And in this case, 
none of that was done.  The verdict form was quite 
different, and in fact the jury was only instructed to 
be unanimous on the ultimate question of whether the 
aggravators outweighed the mitigators, a common 
instruction and one that's upheld around the country 
consistently.

 Second -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Cordray, under 
the charge that was given, what happens if there is a 
juror who thinks that the aggravating circumstances 
don't outweigh the mitigating circumstances?  Under 
Ohio's current instruction that means no death penalty.

 But under the instruction that was given 
here, that all 12 must agree on -- on the aggravators 
outweighing the mitigators, what is the consequence of a 
failure of the jurors to agree on that question?

 MR. CORDRAY:  Even at the time, if the jury 

effectively hung -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes. 

5


Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

MR. CORDRAY:  -- on that question, the 

consequence would be that the court would then impose 
some version of a life sentence.

 The issue is whether the jury was required 

to be instructed that at the time, whether they were 
required to be instructed something that might push them 
away from unanimity.  This Court has never so held, and 
in fact, in Jones v. United States the Court rejected 
that rule in a ruling that was not dissented to by 
anyone on the panel.  Your dissent in that case at 
footnote 20 took no issue with the -- with the notion 
that the jury did not have to be instructed in ways that 
would push them away from rendering unanimous verdict on 
the ultimate question.

 Since that time, as a matter of State court 
practice the Ohio Supreme Court in State v. Brooks did 
say:  We are now going to add that instruction.  But 
they later themselves rejected that that was required by 
the Eighth Amendment in State v. Davis, and that also 
has been the consistent holding of most circuits, that 
that is not required.  If I could move -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It would be -- under the 
charge that was given in this case, you say it would be 
-- then the judge would be obliged to give one of the 
two life sentences.  It would not be a deadlock

requiring a resentencing hearing.

 MR. CORDRAY:  I believe that's the case at 

the time, Your Honor.

 At the time, the instructions pushed the 
jury toward unanimity one way or the other.  Do the 
aggravators outweigh the mitigators or do they not? 
Since that time, the Ohio Supreme Court as a matter of 
practice has been willing to go further and instruct the 
jury, or have the jury be instructed, that if a single 
one of you feels that the aggravators do not outweigh 
the mitigators, that will preclude a death sentence.
 But that has never been constitutionally 

required by this Court.  It is an extension of Mills v. 
Maryland that has never been so held by this Court, and 
in fact is a source of a -- of a significant 
overwhelming majority of circuits the opposite way.

 If I could move to the -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't your adversary's 

position -- I'm sure they will speak for themselves, but 
their position would be that this is a step further than 
Jones or other cases because if in fact -- what you are 
tilling us is that if the jury hangs, the court will 
have to impose a life sentence or some form of it.

 But the jury could believe that they could 

-- that it's either death or life, and one holdout juror

would say:  Well, I don't want to let this guy out; 
because those are the only two choices and 11 people 
want to go for dead -- death and I'm the only holdout, I 
have to vote for death to make sure that he is 
restrained in a way that I find acceptable.

 MR. CORDRAY:  This, as Your Honor notes from 
your time on the trial court, is the jury dynamic in the 
jury room.  It is the push towards unanimity.  The issue 
here is whether the Constitution requires an instruction 
to be given that would encourage a single juror to hold 
out and try to avoid reaching a unanimous verdict.  The 
Court has never held that that is constitutionally 
required, and if they did so hold in this case it would 
be an extension that is a new rule and would not be 
applicable on AEDPA review here.

 Second, on the ineffectiveness claim, 

Mr. Spisak loses sight of the fact that this was no 
run-of-the-mill trial.  His crimes were among the most 
infamous in Ohio history.  At the trial he groomed 
himself to look like Adolf Hitler, and on the stand he 
celebrated his victims' deaths, spewed his racist 
beliefs, and pledged to continue his own brand of 
personal warfare against society.  In the sentencing 
phase, defense counsel reasonably took the only tack 
available to him.  He used the sheer depravity of his

client's crimes and his disturbing character to tell a 
story about his client's mental illness, and he asked 
the jury to forego the death penalty for Mr. Spisak 
because he is mentally ill and thus, under the 
mitigating factor, lacked substantial capacity to 
appreciate or conform his conduct to the requirements of 
the law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  General Cordray -­
MR. CORDRAY:  That is not sufficient -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- in reading that 

closing argument, it is disjointed.  It goes off on 
tangents that have nothing to do with the sentence that 
the defendant is getting.  I mean, it really is quite a 
stream of consciousness.  And what's remarkable about it 
is at no point did counsel say, give him a life 
sentence.  He said that either one would be acceptable, 
either death or life would be acceptable.

 MR. CORDRAY:  First of all, I would disagree 
with that characterization of the closing.  It was not a 
perfect closing, but it had three identifiable pieces to 
it.  The first was, he -- he did go back and 
recapitulate the nature of the crimes, something this 
Court said in Yarborough is an acceptable defense 
strategy.  That's the elephant in the room.  The jury 
heard weeks of testimony about this crime.  The

prosecutor was surely going to highlight that.  He was 
attempting to take this sting out and identify with the 
jury that he understood how they would react to the 
crimes.

 The second piece of the closing -- this is 

at petition appendix, approximately 339a to 344a, he 
goes into the mitigating factor of mental illness.  He 
had presented three mental health experts in the 
sentencing phase to demonstrate that his client was 
mentally ill.  He had made a continued argument that 
there was a larger jar of not guilty by reason of 
insanity that he had not been able to fulfill, even 
though he had tried at trial, and that evidence had 
ultimately been struck by the trial court, which found 
they have not made out a defense of not guilty by reason 
of insanity.

 But he pursued the same theme here in 

sentencing, presenting evidence and saying:  We have at 
least fulfilled the smaller jar of mental illness, 
diminished capacity to intend, and because we are a 
humane society our general assembly has made that a 
mitigating factor that you should apply here, and you 
should not execute someone who has a diminished ability 
to intend.

may I -- you are basically arguing that he was not -­
not deficient in performance.

 MR. CORDRAY:  That's right.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Assume I am persuaded that 

there was deficient performance, for all the reasons 
your adversary argues, and I am focusing on the 
prejudice issue.  I think you make a very strong 
argument that this guy would have gotten the death 
penalty anyway.  But what if -- what if the deficiency 
had been even worse?  Supposing the defense counsel had 
got up and said:  I wish I could make an argument, but I 
really think you ought to give him the death penalty -­
just outrageously sided with the prosecutor.  Would that 
mean that we could still find no prejudice?

 MR. CORDRAY:  I think in Cronic the Court 

said that if there is effectively a structural 
breakdown -- I mean, if in fact counsel had gotten up 
and argued solely a prosecution argument and not pivoted 
at all to mitigating circumstances, perhaps it would be 
possible to presume prejudice in that situation.  That's 
not the situation in this case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  No, I -- I understand 

that.  But -- so you really are saying the question is 
whether Cronic or Strickland controls?

 MR. CORDRAY:  That's one of the questions.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.
 MR. CORDRAY:  Although in our cert petition 
question 2, we also argue that the Sixth Circuit erred 
by not deferring to the Ohio Supreme Court's application 
of Strickland v. Washington.

 And on the prejudice issue, this is 

Landrigan.  That is the case this Court decided and then 
granted, vacated and remanded this case back to the 
Sixth Circuit.  If you look at the prejudice discussion 
in Landrigan -- and I would direct attention to the 
quote near the end where the Court says that the court 
of appeals panel got it right, and what they said was 
that the -- the testimony was chilling.  The person in 
Landrigan had repeated -- had committed repeated murders 
and tried to kill again and again.

 The same with Spisak in this case.  He had 
been unrepentant in the court and in fact had flaunted 
his menacing behavior, just as Spisak went on for days 
on the stand expressing his white power views and how he 
would continue to war if he had the opportunity, if 
given the chance.

 In Landrigan this Court approved the court 
of appeals statement in the end that any further, minor 
mitigating evidence that could have been presented in 
the wake of that record could not have been helpful;

there is no prejudice.  That prejudice holding in 
Landrigan I believe controls this case.  In fact, this 
case may be even a stronger case than Landrigan for no 
prejudice.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But does your argument 
really depend on any deference to the State Supreme 
Court?  It seems to me that your argument is just sort 
of as a fresh matter there wasn't prejudice here.  And 
-- and isn't it also true that we really don't know what 
the Ohio Supreme Court's basis for its decision was, 
whether not competent, incompetence, or lack of 
prejudice.

 MR. CORDRAY:  I would say three things, Your 

Honor.  First of all, I would agree with Yarborough, 
where this Court said that the -- the determination 
about deficiency and prejudice is doubly deferential 
through the AEDPA lens.  We would defer, as Yarborough 
said, to reasonable tactical decisions made in closing 
argument, but we would be doubly deferential under AEDPA 
because we have to hold that the Ohio Supreme Court's 
rejection of the ineffectiveness claim was itself 
objectively an unreasonable application of Strickland. 
So that's one.

 Number two, the Ohio Supreme Court did 

reject this claim.  It cited Strickland v. Washington.

It did not go on in detail.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  But we don't know which 

prong of Strickland it relied on, do we?

 MR. CORDRAY:  We don't.  But this is not a 

case like Rompilla, where the -- where the Court was 
faced with a court that had held only on one prong and 
had disclaimed any attempt to review under the other 
prong.  If the court simply gives a summary affirmance 
or summary disposition and doesn't specify which prong, 
I think the Court has to give deference under both 
prongs, because the alternative would be to give 
deference under neither prong, which is inconsistent 
with the -- the AEDPA statement that we have to did 
defer to an adjudication on the merits by a State court. 
And so I think that is -- that is fair here.  But I 
certainly think -­

JUSTICE STEVENS:  So you'd say a State 
supreme court is entitled to more deference if it 
doesn't tell us the basis for its decision?

 MR. CORDRAY:  It -- it may seem a little 

odd, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Yes.
 MR. CORDRAY:  If they disclaim a prong, then 
I think it's de novo review, and Rompilla did say that. 
If they don't disclaim a prong, I think that the Court

has to defer because the alternative is it gives no 
deference to summary dispositions, and -- and that has 
been the general tenor of courts under AEDPA, is if 
there is a question you err on the side of giving 
deference.  That clearly was Congress's intent in 
enacting that statute.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, there are two 

extremes.  One is no defense whatsoever, Justice 
Stevens' hypothetical.  The attorney just comes in and 
says, kill him, okay?  And then there is another, which 
is your very eloquent explanation of this attorney's 
strategy.  If he had done what you did here, we may not 
be having this appeal.  But at some point you can have a 
strategy and execute it so poorly, so incompetently, 
that you're providing ineffective assistance of counsel. 
You are not accepting that that can occur, you are 
saying the minute an attorney says, I had a strategy, 
that that is effective counsel, regardless of how that 
attorney executed that strategy.  That appears to be 
your argument.

 MR. CORDRAY:  We, of course, Your Honor, 

don't have subjective testimony from the counsel as to 
what his strategy was.  But I think it's quite apparent 
from the record.  He at trial attempted to establish a 
defense of not guilty by reason of insanity.  He was set

back, he and his trial team, because in the end the 
trial judge rejected that defense and struck that 
testimony.  He renewed his effort at the sentencing 
phase by bringing several mental health experts and 
having them testify on the stand to show that at least 
they had met the lower standard of mental disease or 
defect under the Ohio Revised Code.

 He then argued, perhaps not as eloquently as 
-- as one might, you know, as -- as Justice Jackson once 
said, you know, in their bed that night, but he argued 
about:  Yes, these crimes were brutal.  He went on at 
some length about that.  But these crimes were brutal 
and the jury had heard all that and clearly had that in 
their minds.  He then pivoted to five pages of closing 
arguments, in addition to days of presentation on the 
subject, to say:  We have shown at least mental illness; 
it is a mitigating factor; the General Assembly made it 
a mitigating factor and we as a humane people should be 
proud that we do not execute someone who has substantial 
deficiency in ability to intend.

 He then went on to handle some rebuttal 

points that he was -- he was feeling the heat on from 
the prosecutor's presentation.  For example, that he had 
not necessarily met with these experts before they came 
and testified at trial; that he had perhaps shopped for

experts and other matters of that sort; that maybe the 
-- the jury was going to hold against him and his 
defense team their deficiency as counsel, because they 
had made this effort to get not a -- a not guilty by 
reason of insanity plea and the judge had knocked that 
out.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Have you ever heard or read 

a defense summation that was more derogatory of the 
defendant than the summation here?

 MR. CORDRAY:  I have not read a great number 

of defense summations, but this was derogatory.  But 
frankly, the bed that was made was made by his client, 
who got on the stand for days on end and spewed his 
racist propaganda, made it clear that he was not only 
unrepentant but was triumphant; that one or more of his 
murders were slick, pretty neat; that he celebrated the 
killings; that he went out to kill again, that if he had 
the opportunity now he would again go out to kill again.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But defense counsel -­
MR. CORDRAY:  That's the context.
 JUSTICE ALITO:  -- goes so far as to say: 

Don't look to him for sympathy because he demands none. 
But isn't that exactly what he has to appeal for in 
order not to get a death verdict, sympathy based on -­
on mental illness, despite the horrific crimes that this

person committed and the things that he said on the 
stand.

 MR. CORDRAY:  No, Your Honor.  And I think 
again counsel in the context of this proceeding judged, 
perhaps rightly, that it was very unlikely this jury was 
going to have sympathy for his client.  Instead he 
appealed to the jury's own sense of humanity and pride: 
We have this mitigating factor under the law, we are a 
civilized people, we do not execute people who have 
substantial diminished ability to intend; and I appeal 
to you, you jury, even though I can sense that you are 
not feeling sympathy for my client, do what -- what 
makes you a humane people, what makes us proud as a 
people, and do not give the death penalty to a person 
who is sick, demented, twisted, as my client has shown 
himself to be here on the stand.

 I think it's a coherent strategy.  In fact, 
I don't see easily how he could have done better.  And 
as in Landrigan, if he had said, give him sympathy, give 
him a life sentence, which was the thrust of the entire 
proceedings, I don't think that that created -- that 
lack of saying that created any prejudice on this 
record, which was very thoroughly established, in part 
by his client 's own testimony.

 I would also say in Yarborough, on the

deficiency point, this Court said that focusing in on 
one particular theme may well be a preferable strategy, 
and there has to be broad deference given to closing, 
which is only a part, after all, of the entire 
sentencing proceeding, in that taking an understated 
approach that -- that emphasizes the jury's autonomy.

 In Yarborough, if you remember, the defense 

counsel did not actually ask specifically in so many 
words for a life sentence.  The Court said that's not 
deficient.  He could count on the judge's charge to the 
jury.  They were going to charge the jury as to how to 
handle the evidence.  It was the thrust of the whole 
proceedings.  He presented three mental health experts 
to show mental illness and diminished ability to intend. 
And he argued that as part of his closing.

 I think it was not deficient, and I 

certainly think on this record, this stunning record 
created in part by his client's crimes, which were 
acknowledged and undisputed and there was no factual 
dispute about them and their heinousness, and then by 
his client's testimony on the stand, which graphically 
and at great length reinforced his, again, triumph in 
his -- in his warfare against trying to kill as many 
black people, Jewish people and gay people as he could 
find, and that he would continue that warfare if given

the chance.

 I think it's impossible to find that there 
is prejudice on this record for the -- for the -- for 
the -- even the medium-sized quibbles that are being 
raised here 20 years after the fact.

 If I -- if I may reserve the rest of my time 

for rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. BENZA

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. BENZA:  Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The Sixth Circuit evaluated performance of 

trial counsel in this case and found deficient 
performance for three primary areas.

 First, counsel presented and argued to the 

jury nonstatutory aggravating factors as reasons to 
impose the death sentence on Mr. Spisak.  In Ohio, the 
jury is allowed to consider only the statutory 
aggravator factors, not nonstatutory factors.  The 
counsel specifically identified and argued four reasons 
to execute Mr. Spisak.

 He then proceeded to tell the jury what was 
not mitigating evidence in this case, including factors

that have long been accepted as mitigating factors like 
performance in prison, adaptive skills and the issue 
regarding his family upbringing and childhood.

 Finally, the lawyer turned to what he argued 
was the only mitigating evidence that they were going to 
be arguing, and that was the issue of the client's 
mental health.  He then -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You say -- you fault 

him for not talking about performance in prison, 
prospective performance in prison?

 MR. BENZA:  That is correct.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It doesn't look like 

that's going to be a very strong argument.  I mean, he 
is still talking about people he wants to kill, and you 
are going to get up there and say he might perform well 
in prison?

 MR. BENZA:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  In 
fact, because it is directly related to the mental 
health evidence.  Had the lawyer identified the 
testimony of the mental health experts, including 
Dr. Resnick, who is the court clinic psychiatrist, who 
testified that while he has been incarcerated and 
receiving treatment his performance and his mental 
illness has resided -- that he has gotten better.  And 
that he is not -­

job he did killing these people, and he says he is going 
to do it again.  I think -- didn't the letter identify 
particular people he wanted to kill?

 MR. BENZA:  That is correct, it did.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And the jury is 

supposed to believe that this guy is going to do well in 
prison?

but that's what the experts testified to.  And this was 
the court clinic expert who was testifying, who 
evaluated him for the not guilty by reason of insanity.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I guess it gets 

back to the -- the point, we are talking about what a 
jury would think and isn't it possible.  You are 
suggesting, I think, he -- he should grasp any straws 
that are there, this might help.  But isn't it possible 
that that would have a negative effect on the jury?  In 
other words, they see this lawyer telling them this guy 
is going to do well in prison and the lawyer's 
credibility is -- is shot.

 MR. BENZA:  If there is no evidence to 

support that, that would be correct.  The problem that 
this case presents -- and this is what the Sixth Circuit 
found -- that had the lawyer then said, yes, for all of 
these reasons they may weigh in favor of death, but here 
are the reasons why you should consider life, we would 
have a very case than we have here today.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Benza, do you know of 

any case where ineffective assistance was found on the 
basis of a closing argument alone?  General Cordray 
pointed out that this lawyer had put on a number of 
witnesses to testify to the defendant's mental illness, 
and that he did play that theme in the closing.

Do you know of any case where the closing, 

not tied to the way the case was presented at trial, was 
held sufficient to constitute ineffective assistance of 
counsel?

 MR. BENZA:  No.  And that's because this 

case is such an outlier.  I have been litigating capital 
cases since 1993.  I have never seen a closing argument 
like this.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What would you have done? 

I mean, I'm -- I'm not experienced in this.  But I mean, 
I have heard the other side and I have read the 
argument.  And it makes sense logically to say he has 
the worst defendant he has ever seen.  He's murdered 
lots of people in cold blood.  He gets up on the stand 
and says:  I'm going to kill a lot more.  He sounds 
totally bonkers.  And -- and he says to the jury, I 
can't tell you that what he did was not aggravating; it 
was terrible.  I can't tell you that there's anything 
here that should make you feel better about him; there 
is nothing.  But we are a nation of people who are 
humane and our law says don't put a person to death when 
he fills with his nuttiness that third prong, which is a 
lower standard of insanity than I had to meet.  But it's 
clearly met and here are the experts; I point to their 
testimony, and that's what they said.  So be humane.

Now, you think he should have said something 

else.  What?

 MR. BENZA:  He -- what he should have done 
is what this Court recognized in Penry v. Lynaugh, is 
that mental health evidence is a double-edged sword. 
The job of the defense lawyer is to explain why the 
mental health evidence mitigates the crimes -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, he -- he said why.  He 
said.  He said:  We don't execute people who are crazy 
and this guy is crazy.  He might not be crazy enough to 
meet the standard of not guilty by reason of insanity. 
He's not crazy enough to meet the standard of 
incompetency, but you just heard three experts tell you 
that he's seriously crazy.  And if you don't -- if you 
doubt them, don't doubt your own eyes.

 I don't see -- how can I sit -- and we have 

courts, two courts who said, yeah, that was okay.

 MR. BENZA:  Well, we actually don't know 

what the State court said about -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Or we had at least one 

State court that found it okay.

 MR. BENZA:  For whatever reason we had the 

State court decision that affirmed this.  We have no 
idea why.

decided that this was the mitigation strategy that he 
was going to present, this was the evidence that he had 
available to argue to him, it is the role of the defense 
counsel to advocate.

 So once the lawyer makes the strategic 

decision, I am going to present the closing argument 
focused -- based on mental health mitigating evidence, 
then the lawyer's job is to stand up and explain to 
the -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  But I agree with all that 
you are saying.  What I am saying my hard time is here 
is why wasn't this advocacy, when indeed a reasonable 
decision as to what constituted advocacy in those really 
rare circumstances where it was the worst kind of 
defendant he had ever seen in his life who deserved no 
sympathy?

 MR. BENZA:  As the amici points out, there 
is no strategic reason for this closing.  The amici for 
Petitioner -- or for Respondent has identified that 
there can be no strategic reason to have provided this 
closing argument.  By any evaluation of the skill of 
closing argument this was deficient.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I think -- I think it 

was swallowing the worst evidence.  It was telling the 
jury that was going to think this is a hateful person

who had done hateful things.

 I agree with you.  I accept all of that, but 
even if you feel that way, I thought it was a brilliant 
closing argument.  You said you've -- you've conducted 
many capital cases.

 Have you ever conducted a capital case in 

which the defendant takes the stand with a Hitler 
moustache and says he's glad for what he's done and he 
will do it again?

 How many cases have you had like that?
 MR. BENZA:  No.  Spisak is the only one like 

that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  This was an extraordinary 

trial, and it seems to me that the -- that the technique 
that -- that counsel used to try to get mercy for this 
fellow was -- was the best that could have been done.

 MR. BENZA:  If that's your conclusion, then 
we -- we don't point on the merits of the claim.  I beg 
to differ -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, if -- if the 

strategy that Mr. Cordray and Justice Breyer and, to 
some extent, Justice Scalia have outlined is a correct 
strategy, would you go on to say that the implementation 
of that strategy was substandard?

get Mr. Cordray's very succinct explanation, you have to 
go through a couple of pages and drift it out, as 
Justice Sotomayor said, his argument was fine, and 
Justice Breyer -- but that is not the argument we have.

didn't -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what is the case 
that you have -- the best case that you have, maybe a 
case in the courts of appeals or the state supreme 
courts, where it is said that the implementation of the 
strategy was just inept -- totally inept.

 I mean, is that what your argument is here?
 MR. BENZA:  Yes, that the application, that 

the way the lawyer delivered the closing, the themes 
that he identified, the things that he said, was the 
deficiency -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Again, that depends on, 

oh, tone of voice, the ambiance of the courtroom. 
This -- this is very hard for us -- you know, he was 
trying to be folksy with the jury, obviously.

 These are things that are very difficult for 

us to assess.

 MR. BENZA:  They are very difficult, but 
this case doesn't present those nuances.  This case 
presents the case where the lawyer stands up at closing

argument -- and the only thing he didn't say that could 
have made this worse was Justice Stevens hypothetical of 
it's fine by me if you actually execute him.

 It's the only thing he didn't say in his 

closing that could have possibly made it worse for the 
client.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, he actually did 

say that.

 MR. BENZA:  Not in those words.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but, pretty much, 
he said, no one's going to fault you if you impose the 
death sentence.

 MR. BENZA:  And we will be proud of you, 

whichever you do.  Only those very words, I would like 
you to execute him as well, did not escape his lips.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But, I mean, it 

seems to me that you are imposing a strategic rule, and 
the counsel obviously made a decision -- or the record 
may reflect that the type of advocacy that you are 
telling us he has to have.

 Here's why you should give this guy 

sympathy.  Here's why.  Here's -- he's a good guy.  I 
mean, there is -- even standing at that podium, there is 
a different strategy that people sometimes employ, which 
is sort of the understated -- you know, well, he did

some terrible things, don't -- I'm not asking for 
sympathy for these things, but -- you know, we are very 
proud of the fact that we don't execute -- you know, it 
seems to me that this disagreement is over different 
styles of advocacy.

 And I don't know how to -- particularly in a 

case where you don't have much to work with, I don't 
know how to make a judgment that his choice was worse 
than the other.

 MR. BENZA:  But that's what we do under 

Strickland.  The court recognizes, in Strickland 
analysis, that there are multiple ways that various 
lawyers will try the same case; all of which can be 
effective.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You just told me that, 

under Strickland, under anything, there has been no case 
in which there has been a decision for the defendant, 
based on the inadequacy of the closing argument alone.

 So you are asking us to take a new tact and 

inviting arguments focused exclusively on the closing 
argument, to see if it meets the Strickland standard.

 MR. BENZA:  Yes, but this court has already 
recognized that the Sixth Amendment applies, the right 
to counsel applies at closing argument.

Court's opinion, the Court specifically stated that the 
right to effective assistance extends to closing 
argument.

 So this is not a redevelopment or an 

expansion of Strickland.  It's simply an application of 
the Strickland analysis, the particular facts of this 
case before the -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why -- why isn't it the 

Strickland analysis that you read the charge in the 
context of the case that was presented at trial, and, 
here, the case was.

 The only thing going for the defendant were 

the witnesses to his mental illness and whether, 
eloquently or not, that theme was played to the jury.

 This is a mentally ill man.
 MR. BENZA:  That's -- that's correct, and 

that's the theme that defense counsel said he was going 
to implement at the closing.  What -- the failure of the 
lawyer was to adequately and effectively make that 
closing to the jury.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, he talked about 

nothing else.  And I understand -- look, I am not an 
expert.  I haven't argued these things to juries, and I 
recognize some lawyers tell me, okay, this was very 
rambling.  I didn't think it was rambling.

I thought he was trying to spend a lot of 

time explaining away to the jury some prosecutorial 
remark, that you shouldn't pay attention to the expert 
because you, yourself, the lawyer, didn't talk to them 
enough.

 And so you describe that for a couple of 

pages and why it was irrelevant, and the reason he 
talked about the -- I thought, the reason he talked 
about the -- how you will feel when you go out of here, 
is because he recognizes this is the most sensational 
case in this community, ever, and all your neighbors are 
going to congratulate you.

 But what you are doing here is you are 

applying a standard, and you are proud to be an 
American, and that standard, as an American, is a humane 
standard that requires you to not give the death penalty 
when the man's insane.

 Now, I agree that he repeated that 7 or 8 or 
9 or 10 times, but it was the same point over and over. 
And how can I -- since there is a lower court that 
seemed to find this adequate, how can I sit here and say 
it wasn't?

 MR. BENZA:  Well, it -- first, as to the 
question of whether or not the lower court found it 
adequate, we have no idea, again, what the Ohio Supreme

performances or to prejudice or to strategy.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How many -- how many 

issues were before the Ohio Supreme Court?

 MR. BENZA:  There were 67 assignments of 
error raised to the Ohio Supreme Court.  This is the 
only case on direct appeal, where the Ohio Supreme Court 
issued a procuring of.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Didn't -- didn't they cite 

Strickland?

 MR. BENZA:  They did cite Strickland, along 

with 49 other claims.

concede the argument.

 MR. BENZA:  They dismissed this claim and -­

then?  If they cited Strickland, why do we have no idea 
what they -- ­

MR. BENZA:  We have no idea whether they 
decided that there was deficient performance, but no 
prejudice -- that there was, in fact, deficient 
performance, but no prejudice, that this was not 
deficient because it was reasonable strategy.

 It is also possible that the lower courts

for prejudice.

 MR. BENZA:  Well, because we don't know what 

the Supreme Court actually did.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  When we -- when you don't 

know what a lower court has done, the rule is you assume 
the best, not the worst.  Isn't that the standard rule 
of review?

 MR. BENZA:  That is.

it was a lawful basis.

JUSTICE STEVENS:  That's the rule on direct 

appeal, of course, not on collateral.

 MR. BENZA:  That is the rule on direct 

appeal.  It is also the implication of applying AEDPA. 
The problem that you have in that is, when you try to 
apply AEDPA to this particular claim, you don't know how 
the state court, in fact, decided this case.

 And, therefore, you don't know whether or 
not you are going to give the AEDPA deference to the 
decision that there was no deficient performance, that 
there was no prejudice.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  How -- how does that work? 

Certainly, it's a fairly common thing, that the 
defendant will make -- let's say, 20 arguments, maybe he 
would even number them.

 And it's fairly common to find a court of 

appeals in a state that says, as to argument number 17, 
and then they characterize it, we reject that argument.

 MR. BENZA:  That is true.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, that -- that happens 

all the time.

 MR. BENZA:  That is correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And, now, it's very, very

some bad grounds for rejecting it.

 So would we send -- do we send every case 
like that back, to say, I want to know if you rejected 
it for a good reason or a bad reason?

 MR. BENZA:  I would think, no, that you 

don't send it back, but what happens -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  What we do is we assume 

they did it for a bad reason?

 MR. BENZA:  I would -- I think the issue 
then would become that, when a state court chooses to 
summarily deny, without evaluation, an explanation of 
the merits of the claim, that, when it comes to habeas 
review, the constraints of AEDPA are lifted.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So the Ohio Supreme 
Court, faced with 67 issues, would have to write at 
least a per curiam opinion on each of the 67 to insulate 
itself against being overturned on federal habeas?

 MR. BENZA:  Not insulate from overturning, 

but to gain the benefit of 2254(d)'s restrictive reviews 
of habeas.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which insulates it from 

being overturned.

 MR. BENZA:  If, in fact, it is not contrary 
to our unreasonable application, it would be insulated

JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any authority for 

that?  Because, I mean, I'm not positive of this one, 
but I -- I do think hearing it that suddenly habeas 
opinions and district court opinions would grow by an 
order of magnitude, because it's very common to see 
arguments rejected summarily.

 MR. BENZA:  That is correct.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, is there any authority 

for the proposition that if they reject it summarily, 
that then we don't assume they are right, but rather we 
assume they are wrong?

 MR. BENZA:  No, this Court has never 

addressed how to apply 2254(d) to a summary decision. 
In Knowles v. Mirzayance, the Court noted that this was 
in fact an issue and reserved that for another day.

 In Early v. Packer, this Court recognized, 
though, however, that AEDPA constraints are looking at 
not just at the outcome of the lower court's -- the 
State court's decisions, but the reasoning behind it, 
because if you are going to have an unreasonable 
application of -- of a binding law from this court, the 
lower courts have to be able to apply it and explain, 
how did we apply it?  Otherwise every decision of the 
State court would be insulated from Federal habeas 
review, making the writ available but unavailable.

Because no decision would therefore ever be unreasonable 
if the standard is for a district court judge to say: 
Can I imagine a reasonable way for the State court to 
have reached this result?  I have; I'm a reasonable 
judge; the State court must have done what I have done; 
therefore, the review is limited, and the writ -- and 
the writ is denied.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if you're -- if 
you're right about that issue on which we haven't had a 
decision yet, then we would look at prejudice on our 
own, without deference to the State court findings?
 MR. BENZA:  It would review -- it would 

revert to pre-AEDPA habeas review to the standards, and

application in the -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that is not what AEDPA 
says.  AEDPA says that we have to give deference unless 
it is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law. 
The burden is on the appealing defendant to show that it 
was an unreasonable application.  In case of doubt, he 
loses.

 Now, AEDPA could have been written 

differently.  It could have been written the way you 
want.  The Supreme Court shall evaluate the 
reasonableness of the Supreme Court opinion.  It isn't

written that way.  It says the burden is on you to show 
that this was an unreasonable application of Supreme 
Court law.  And where there is a summary disposition, 
that's a hard road aho.

 MR. BENZA:  I would submit it is impossible.

relying on prior Supreme Court law doesn't get you 
there.  It's not impossible.

differ.  I would think that if the summary disposition 
is going to be held to that standard of an unreasonable 
application where we have no indication of how the State 
courts actually applied the law, it would have to be the 
extreme outlier that would demonstrate that that was an

statute and it should not say unreasonable application 
of Supreme Court law?

evaluating the State claim, the State court decision is 
given the deference that it is due, and that is that we 
simply cannot determine whether or not it properly 
applied Federal law, and therefore, it does not get the 
safe harbor of AEDPA evaluation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not how the -­

that's not how the statute reads.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, why wouldn't you do 
that as well, then, even a fortiori, where I'm just an 
appeals court judge and I get a district court opinion? 
Most common thing in the world, summary judgment denied, 
motion denied, this denied, denied, denied.  And if I'm 
going to start doing this for State cases, wouldn't I 
also have to do it for Federal cases whenever a Federal 
judge doesn't give all his reasons, which is the most 
common thing in the world?

 MR. BENZA:  The Court does that when it 
reviews those quarters constrained by what actually 
happened in the lower court.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  We did?  I mean, I've 

reviewed thousands and thousands of them and I've always 
thought that a trial judge doesn't have to spell out all 
his reasons.  And the question is really, given the 
circumstance, can we say that he acted contrary to law?

 MR. BENZA:  And that is -­

40 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

JUSTICE BREYER:  If it's trial-based, you 

look at what the facts are that he might have taken.

 MR. BENZA:  And that would be the evaluation 
that would continue on in habeas review of these claims, 
is evaluating the State court decision without, though, 
simply saying, well, we're going to -- and this is what 
happens in the lower courts.  When you have these 
summary decisions in 2254(d) analysis, those circuits 
that have applied this say, what we will imagine a way 
in which the State court could have reasonably applied 
this law to reach this result, and therefore, since that 
is a reasonable way, because of course we as Article 3 
judges have reasonably come up with that, it must be 
reasonable, it's not an unreasonable application, and 
the writ is denied.

 The problem that we face is when you look at 

that in comparison to cases like Wiggins and Rompilla 
where the State courts affirmatively denied applying 
Federal standards, you get a different level of review. 
And so you end up encouraging State courts in these 
types of cases to simply issue postcard denials:  Appeal 
denied.  Federal courts, you figure it out.

JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that's what 

AEDPA was intended to do?

 MR. BENZA:  I think AEDPA was designed that 

when the State courts, in fact, are doing their jobs 
under the Constitution to protect defendants' rights to 
review their claim, then they should receive the 
protections of AEDPA.  What that means for deferential 
review -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not what it says. 

That's not what it says.  It says that you have to show 
that it is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court 
law.  That's what it says.

 MR. BENZA:  It does.  And as this Court has 
explained, what happens in habeas is that the Federal, 
the district courts and the circuit courts have to 
evaluate the claim and determine whether or not there 
was an unreasonable application.  It still falls to the 
district court and the circuit court to -­

on you is to show that it's an unreasonable application. 
If you tell me we can't tell, you lose.

 MR. BENZA:  That's the other alternative is 
that then the statute doesn't apply, which as this Court 
has recognized, when it comes to applying AEDPA, the 
side that is left untouched regarding that is the issue 
of the suspension of the writ.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So you are saying -- I 

mean, this is very helpful to me for a variety of 
reasons, but is -- in your view, the correct role of the 
habeas judge vis-à-vis the State judge there is the same 
as the Federal appellate judge vis-à-vis the district 
judge?  That is, I'm thinking of a district judge makes 
a finding, doesn't fully explain it.  Now, I would think 
it would be unlawful if it's an unreasonable application 
of a Supreme Court case.  And I know how to review that. 
I mean, I -- I know how to review it, I think.

 Okay.  So you are saying however I do that, 

I should do the same thing and the -- but you don't -­
you don't think there is a more relaxed standard than 
that?  You think that's basically the standard?

 MR. BENZA:  It's still the same standard.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Same -- but if they had 

made an explicit finding, then maybe it would be a 
tougher standard.

when they have done their job, when they explained their

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Benza, you might want 

to use what time is remaining to deal with the other 
issue, which we haven't talked about at all.

 MR. BENZA:  If I may, if I'm turning -- if 

there are no further questions on the effect, I will 
turn to the Mills issue.

 The -- the question in front of the Sixth 

Circuit was whether or not the totality of the jury 
instructions in this case were such that they violated 
Mills' directive that an individual jurist's 
determination of a mitigating factor's existence could 
not be precluded from being considered by the injection 
of that -- of those factors by the other 11 jurors.

 What you have in this particular case is the 

totality of the jury instructions were such that a 
reasonable understanding of the instruction was that the 
jury had to be unanimous as to the understanding and the 
existence of a mitigating factor before it could even be

considered.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what is your answer to 

the first question that Justice Sotomayor asked?  Half 
of you say that -- that the State court's decision was 
contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of 
clearly-established Federal laws determined by the 
Supreme Court of the United States, i.e., Mills v. 
Maryland, when Mills v. Maryland hadn't been decided.
 MR. BENZA:  In Terry Williams v. Taylor, 

this Court recognized in the opinion authored by Justice 
O'Connor that the issue for contrary to or unreasonable 
application is going to be governed by the 
application of Teague.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  And are there -- are there 
not quite a few instances of contrary statements in our 
opinions?

 MR. BENZA:  As to the application of Mills? 

Or -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  As to the -- as to the time 
when the -- the law has to be clearly established by a 
decision in that court.

 MR. BENZA:  No, this Court has maintained 

that the issue regarding the application of -- of 
controlling established -- what -- clearly established 
law by this Court is going to be determined by Teague,

and Teague determines that Mills v. Maryland decision 
applies to this claim.  In -- it was adjudicated on the 
merits in State court.

 Now there is another -- underlying this is 

another AEDPA concern, is how does the Federal -- or the 
State court adjudicate the constitutional claim since 
Mills had not been presented.  It decided the merits of 
the claim were -- were to be rejected but it did not 
decide the case under Mills v. Maryland because of 
course Mills had not been decided and we know from this 
Court's decision in the Banks case that Mills was a new 
law.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  This Court has not said that 

clearly established Federal law refers to this Court's 
decision as of the time of the relevant State court 
decision.

 MR. BENZA:  That this Court has said, but 

this Court has also said that the decision to that 
question is based on the decision of Teague.  If a case 
applies to the Court based on Teague, then it will apply 
to the merits of this particular claim.  And what the

MR. BENZA:  This Court has held that the 
decision of whether a -- when a case is going to be 
clearly established for review in habeas is going to be 
based on Teague.  That was the opinion by Justice 
O'Connor concurring in the judgment in Terry Williams, 
that the decision for clearly established is going to be 
based on the decision of the applicability of Teague.
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does Teague say anything 

about time?

 MR. BENZA:  Teague says that the decision 

for application of a newly established law or a new 
established constitutional rule is predicated on the 
denial of direct appeal, which in this case would be the 
cert denied by this Court of the direct appeal of the ­
case, which happened in 1989, a year after the decision 
in Mills was handed down.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, the Mills 
opinion has one of those concluding paragraphs at the 
end that sort of sums everything up, and it says that we 
conclude there is a substantial probability that 
reasonable jurors upon receiving the judge's 
instructions in this case and in attempting to complete 
the verdict form as instructed may have thought they 
were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence

 MR. BENZA:  That is correct.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now how is that 

clearly established law that your claim is -- is 
contrary to Mills?

 MR. BENZA:  Because in -- in our case every 

jury instruction that was given to the jury told them 
that they had to be unanimous, including the specific 
instruction -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That is on death or 

nondeath, not on whether a particular mitigating 
circumstance exists.

 MR. BENZA:  Actually they -- they were told 

that, because they were also told that that included 
their decisions as to all disputes of fact.  The 
existence of a mitigating factor is of course a question 
of fact.  So the jury was in fact specifically 
instructed to be unanimous to every decision that they 
made including resolving disputes of fact.  They were 
told by both lawyers for the defense and lawyers for the 
prosecution that the first question they had to answer 
when they got into the jury room was to the existence of 
mitigating factors.

was a mitigating factor.  And when -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How does that work?  The 
instruction was all 12 must agree that the aggravators 
outweigh the mitigators before death is imposed.

 MR. BENZA:  That's correct, as to that 

instruction.  But the existence of the mitigator was the 
predicate question that the jury would have to answer 
and our position is that they also would have had to be 
unanimous per the instruction.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. CORDRAY:  Thank you, Your Honor.
 On the Mills instruction, it -- it's clear, 
Mills was not decided at the time the Ohio Supreme Court 
rendered its decision.  It was decided before this Court 
denied direct review.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that an argument 

you made before this Court?

 MR. CORDRAY:  I beg your pardon.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is this an argument 
that you've made before this Court in your brief, that 
we shouldn't consider whether Mills is the controlling 
standard because Mills came after?

 MR. CORDRAY:  No.  Nor am I making it now.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.
 MR. CORDRAY:  I am simply summarizing a 
response to Justice Sotomayor's question.  But this 
Court -- on -- on Teague, in Beard v Banks determined 
that Mills itself expressed a new rule and expressed 
some doubt as to whether that rule itself was even clear 
until McKoy v. North Carolina was decided in 1990, which 
was to finality in this case.  But the -- the jury 
instruction issue is entirely knocked out by the fact 
that this case is an extension of Mills that goes beyond 
anything this Court has ever held in the jury

instruction context.  It is an extension of Mills that 
has been rejected by the majority of circuits to 
consider it, even today 20 years later, and it couldn't 
possibly be understood to be clearly established law.
 The reference to page 326a and the jury 
instructions, that's quite distinct from the passage 
where the jury was told specifically they have to be 
unanimous only on the ultimate question, whether 
aggravators outweigh mitigators.  This was very 
different from the jury form in Mills which was itself 
was somewhat cryptic and -- and later was explained 
further in McKoy.

 If I could return then to the 

ineffectiveness issues.  Counsel argued that there was 
deficiency on a couple of different grounds.  First of 
all, that -- that defense counsel should have argued 
about family background and performance in prison.  The 
family background was uncontested; it was humdrum; there 
was nothing special there.  Performance in prison was an 
issue that was raised at trial.  The prosecutor read to 
Spisak on the stand a letter he had written from prison. 
I am not going to foul the record with his specific 
verbiage but it was after a card game in which he had 
gotten into a fight with inmates and said he would like 
to kill them.  When that was read to Spisak on the stand

his response was to say "Heil, Hitler" and give the Nazi 
salute to the jury.

 So the notion that we should be referring 

back to his performance in prison and that somehow would 
have helped mitigate the jury's consideration of the 
death sentence to me is -- is fanciful.

 In terms of the argument that defense 

counsel here argued, nonstatutory aggravators, that is a 
characterization that I don't think is accurate and it's 
not accurate as a matter of Ohio law.  In our reply 
brief we cited State v. Hancock which indicates that the 
nature and circumstances of crimes are always relevant 
in determining whether the aggravators outweigh the 
mitigators, and in fact the main aggravator here was 
that Mr. Spisak engaged in a course of conduct that 
involved the purposeful killing of more than one person 
-- two or more persons, or the attempt to kill two or 
more persons which he had done here and which certainly 
was going to be and was, in fact, in fact if you read 
the prosecutor's closing, the heart and soul of the 
prosecutor's closing.

 As to whether the mental health presentation 

was, quote, "not strong enough," obviously it wasn't 
strong enough in the end to sway the jury.  But you 
cannot judge by hindsight, this Court has said it again

and again, counsel's performance.  The court said that 
in Strickland v. Washington itself, emphasized that 
tremendously in rejecting the deficiency claim in that 
case.  And then in Yarborough as applied to closing 
arguments, the Court said very specifically we have to 
be doubly deferential to -- to strategic decisions made 
at closing, even if we might had made them differently 
or might have executed them somewhat differently, and 
particularly through the AEDPA lens.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What -- what is your 

answer to your friend's explanation that it's hard to 
defer when they don't even say anything?

 MR. CORDRAY:  I think that we have to read 

the statute.  The statute -- the AEDPA statute, 2254 
says we defer to what?  We defer to an adjudication by 
the State court on the merits.  There is no suggestion 
here that this adjudication was on some procedural 
grounds or default grounds.  It was a merits 
adjudication.  It wasn't a lengthy, eloquent, you know, 
long explained adjudication, but it was an adjudication 
on the merits and deference should be given.

 The alternative is that if they don't 

explain which prong they are using that you defer to 
nothing, and that seems to be not consistent with what 
Congress clearly intended under AEDPA, nor is it

consistent with the language of the statute.

 The claim was made that the deference only 

applies when the State court, quote, "has done its job." 
Under the statute the job is to adjudicate a claim on 
the merits, not to provide a lengthy discourse in doing 
so.  As to the prejudice point which I think is finally 
decisive and was the basis on which this Court GVR'd 
in -- in Landrigan, this is Landrigan -­

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Can we just go back to 

that one point for a minute.

 MR. CORDRAY:  Yes, sir.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Would your deference be 

exactly the same if, instead of listing all 47 claims or 
so, they simply entered a one-line order saying, 
"Affirmed"?

 MR. CORDRAY:  I believe, Your Honor, under 
the statute, it would be the same, although here they 
did more than that -- you know, they cited Strickland. 
We have to assume they applied Strickland.

 And, as for the prejudice claim, we have 

findings from the Ohio Supreme Court that, I think, bear 
on the prejudice claim.  In its decision -- this is 
309(a) through 311(a) of the appendix -­

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Let me -- let me go back 

to the question.

MR. CORDRAY:  Yes, sir.
 JUSTICE STEVENS:  Do you think they are 

entitled to more deference because they did cite 
Strickland if they -- than if they did cite nothing?

 MR. CORDRAY:  I think that the Ohio Supreme 
Court is entitled to deference because it adjudicated a 
claim on the merits, so -­

JUSTICE STEVENS:  So it would be exactly the 

same deference whether they say it's Strickland or not.

 MR. CORDRAY:  I would agree with that. 

However, if the Court was inclined to make gradation -­
this is a gradation beyond simply an unexplained order. 
Yes.

 As to prejudice, the Ohio Supreme Court at 

309(a) through 311(a) itself independently reweighed the 
aggravating factors against the mitigating factors, 
which is something the Ohio Supreme Court does under 
Ohio law.

 There had been some issues of merger of some 

of the aggravating circumstances.  On direct appeal, 
they had dealt with those issues, and then they went 
back and reweighed, and they found that, on this record, 
the aggravating factors heavily -- lie heavily and 
beyond a reasonable doubt to outweigh the mitigating 
factors.

That is, in fact, the same kind of 

determination that the Court would make in trying to 
determine if there was prejudice here.

 As to the implementation of the strategy 

here, it is coherent in understanding what counsel was 
trying to do.  Was it a bit rambling?  Perhaps.

 You know, were there -- were there side 

issues that he tried to take up, which he thought went 
to his credibility with the jury and the credibility of 
the mental illness defense with the jury?  Perhaps.

 But the strategy was twofold.  It was to 

reference the crimes, make it clear to the jury he 
understood the nature -- the horrific nature of the 
crimes, as he thought the jury understood it, and then 
pivot to the mental illness -- mental disease or defect 
prong as the mitigator that the -- that the jury should 
apply in not giving the death penalty in this case.

 I think the strategy here was coherent.  I'm 

not sure what else defense counsel could have done in 
this case, where his client had both committed these 
horrific crimes, undisputed, and then had reveled in 
them, in his flamboyant testimony from the stand.

 In the context of that and given the doubly 
deferential lens this Court has laid out in Yarborough, 
I think that there is neither deficiency, nor could
