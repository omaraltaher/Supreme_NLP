CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear 


argument now in No. 02-6320, John J. Fellers v. the 


United States.


Mr. Waxman.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 


please the Court:


Unlike the two cases in which you heard 


argument yesterday, and unlike Oregon v. Elstad, the 


original inculpatory statement in this case was 


elicited not merely in violation of a prophylactic 


rule, but of the Constitution itself, specifically 


the Sixth Amendment right of an accused to the 


assistance of counsel throughout his criminal 


prosecution, a right designed to protect equality in 


the adversarial process by a --


QUESTION:  What is your authority, Mr. 


Waxman, for saying that this is different from the 


Miranda warnings in the sense that it's -- it's an 


immediate violation rather than something --


something like Miranda?


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, it's -- Your Honor, I

guess I have a two-fold answer.  First of all, the --


the constitutional right involved is the Sixth 


Amendment right, unlike in Miranda, the Fifth 


Amendment right of self-incrimination.  And in -- in 


Oregon v. Elstad and Chavez v. Martinez, this Court 


recognized that although the Fifth Amendment 


self-incrimination right is not completed until the 


statement or its fruits are introduced at trial, the 


primary illegality, as this Court has used the 


phrase, is the coercion of the confession, and the 


Elstad rule doesn't apply where the primary 


illegality is constitutionally-proscribed conduct.


And here, this Court has not formally 


decided whether the Sixth Amendment is violated at 


the time the uncounseled, post-indictment statement 


is deliberately elicited, or only when the statement 


or fruits are admitted, that briefs of both sides 


rehearse for the Court somewhat conflicting 


statements in different opinions. 


We rely on the cases cited in footnote 5 


on page 8 of our reply brief, but for purposes of 


this case, Your Honor, it doesn't matter, because in 


Elstad, this Court made clear, and reiterated in 


Chavez, that although the Fifth Amendment violation 


is incomplete at the time a confession is coerced,

nonetheless the fruits of that confession have to be 


suppressed under the derivative evidence rule, unless 


the Government carries its burden to prove sufficient 


attenuation of taint.  And therefore, even if the 


conduct deliberately eliciting from Mr. Fellers his 


inculpatory statement at a time when the officers 


knew he had been indicted, and the prosecution knew 


that he had a right to the advice of counsel, the 


fruits of that statement under Nix and Wade have to 


be suppressed.  That's a rule that this Court has 


applied in Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and 


Sixth Amendment cases.


QUESTION:  Do police officers generally 


know this distinction, that when an indictment has 


been handed down, suddenly the Sixth Amendment is in 


the case as well as the Fifth?  There's an element of 


fiction to it in that the person doesn't have a 


lawyer yet.  As a bright line rule, I guess, we need 


some point to know when proceedings have commenced, 


but I - I still think there's an element of fiction 


in it.


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, Justice Kennedy, I 


don't -- I don't think I would call it fiction.  I'm 


no more able to -- to testify than the member of this 


Court would be as to exactly what training the police

are told.  But this Court has long established, long 


maintained that the Sixth Amendment cuts very bright 


lines.  It is specific to the offense and it begins 


only when, but when, the state makes the unilateral 


determination to change its formal relationship with 


an individual from one in which the individual may or 


may not be under investigation, but the --


QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman, you -- you're 


making a -- a very technical distinction, if I 


understand you correctly.  If we focus on the suspect 


in the case of no indictment yet, who has been 


arrested, and the person who has been indicted and 


then arrested, and they're both alone with the same 


police officers in the same jail cell, and they're 


both subjected to the same interrogation.  Why should 


the derivative evidence rule apply to the one or not 


the other?  If we're talking about constitutional 


rights, it seems to me that these two individuals are 


similarly situated.


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, they -- they aren't, 


Your Honor, and I don't think this is a matter of 


technicality or formality.  It is a matter of 


formalism, but the two different amendments -- the 


Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, 


and the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of

counsel throughout criminal prosecution, protect very 


different things.  The first protects voluntariness, 


and the second protects the right of someone as to 


whom the Government has formally set its face and 


invoked a formal adversarial process.


QUESTION:  The point is why -- why should 


that make a difference other than the convenience of 


the bright line?  As in Justice Ginsburg's 


hypothetical, it could be the same drug ring, the 


same investigation, just the grand jury has -- hasn't 


got around to indicting the second defendant until 


the next day and then their rights are different.


MR. WAXMAN:  Your -- Your Honor, it's --


it is entirely true that if the Court agrees with --


agrees with our submission here, that the Government 


can very easily conform its conduct simply by not 


conducting uncounseled interrogations or elicitations 


prior to changing its status.  But the -- the -- we 


have to examine, this Court has exhorted counsel over 


and over again to be clear about what the underlying 


right is protected in determining what the 


appropriate remedy is. 


And the right here is not coercion.  The 


right here is not just addressed at police.  It's 


addressed at the prosecution.  And there is a

difference.  You may call it technical, but it is in 


fact the hallmark of our adversary system that once 


the Government decides to invoke a formal adversary 


process, it proceeds on the supposition that each 


side deals with each other, A, at arm's length, and 


B, assisted by the advice of counsel, who will 


prevent each side, and in particularly the defendant, 


from, as this Court has explained in -- from 


conviction resulting from his own ignorance of his 


legal and constitutional rights, and that's what's 


being protected.


The unindicted individual, as to whom the 


Government may be conducting an investigation, 


doesn't have that formal right, but once the 


Government invokes our adversarial system, it invokes 


a set of protections that protect, not an 


individual's right to be protected from coercion or 


involuntariness -- that's protected no matter when 


the custodial -


QUESTION:  Well, how -- how far does this 


right go, Mr. Waxman?  Are you -- are you saying that 


police officers can't talk to someone who has been 


indicted?


MR. WAXMAN:  Oh no, of course not.  Your 


Honor has made clear for the - in his opinion for the

Court in Patterson v. Illinois -- I believe it was 


Your Honor -- in any event, the Court made clear in 


Patterson v. Illinois that the Sixth Amendment right 


to the assistance of counsel doesn't prevent the 


Government from eliciting statements from an indicted 


defendant.  It requires that the accused either have 


counsel or make a waiver of the right to counsel, and 


the Court --


QUESTION:  Well, but it's - it's - I'm -


I'm talking about a situation where, say the police 


simply say something to a -- an indicted defendant. 


There's no violation of a right there, is there?


MR. WAXMAN:  There only is a violation of 


a right, Your Honor, if what -- if the police 


statements and conduct amount to what this Court has 


deemed deliberate elicitation.  That is, that what 


the Court has said in a half a dozen cases is that 


the Government may not do without counsel is 


deliberately elicit incriminating statements in the 


absence of his lawyer.


QUESTION:  And you think that's what 


happened here?


MR. WAXMAN:  I am -- I am absolutely 


certain that that's what happened here, and the --


QUESTION:  That was the finding of the

magistrate and the --


MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.  The magistrate who 


heard that police officers, Justice O'Connor, found 


specifically that officers --


QUESTION:  He found deliberate eliciting 


of the comments at the first statement?


MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.  He said it was, quote, 


designed to elicit a response -- I'm quoting from 


page 103 of the joint appendix --


QUESTION: Is that a factual finding or --


MR. WAXMAN:  It is.


QUESTION: -- or a legal conclusion?  I 


mean, it seems to me he can -- he can find as a fact 


what the officer said, but whether it constitutes 


deliberate elicitation within the meaning of our - of 


our opinion, it seems to me, is a legal question.


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, it's - I think, Your 


Honor, Justice Scalia, it's -- this is a mixed 


question of law and fact under Miller v. Fenton and 


Thompson v. Keohane.  But because --


QUESTION:  And the Eighth -- the Eighth 


Circuit said, the Eighth Circuit is the closest court 


to this one, and I thought that the Eighth Circuit 


said, and that it's a threshold question in this 


case, that it wasn't anything like interrogation, and

that that's -- wasn't that the -- the --


MR. WAXMAN: The Eighth --


QUESTION: -- prime ground of the Eighth 


Circuit?


MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Ginsburg, the Eighth 


Circuit -- two judges, the majority, the panel in the 


Eighth Circuit, concluded that it wasn't 


interrogation.  The concurring judge --


QUESTION:  But wouldn't we have to answer 


that --


MR. WAXMAN:  -- pointed out, Judge Riley 


pointed out, that under the Sixth Amendment, unlike 


the Fifth, interrogation is not the standard.  The 


standard is deliberate elicitation, or, as this Court 


has also phrased it, whether the prosecution, quote, 


intentionally creates a situation likely to induce 


the accused to make incriminating statements without 


the advise of counsel.


QUESTION:  I thought the Eighth Circuit's 


position was that all this was was the police 


informing the defendant that he had been charged with 


this and this crime.


MR. WAXMAN:  That is -- the -- the -- I 


don't believe the Eighth Circuit made any such 


finding, but the magistrate who heard the two

officers testify and evaluated their credibility made 


a determination, Justice Scalia, that is a mixed 


question of fact and law.  The inquiry under the 


Sixth Amendment, deliberate elicitation or 


intentional creation of a situation, or purposeful 


conduct, which are the words this Court has used, 


involve a determination, among other things, about 


the credibility of what the officers said.


And when the magistrate concluded that 


they -- that their conduct was designed to elicit a 


response, and that it was not made for any purpose 


other than to get a response --


QUESTION:  Well, was - was there any 


debate or controversy about what they in fact said?


MR. WAXMAN:  There was no debate about 


what they said, but -- but there was a credibility 


finding made by the magistrate, because the --


QUESTION:  If there was -- if there was no 


factual dispute, why - why did -- why was credibility 


involved?


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, when you have -- when 


you -- because there is a subjective intent here, the 


subjective intent of whether Officer Bliemeister, he 


came to the house knowing that this man had been 


indicted, and said, we are here to discuss with you

your involvement with methamphetamine and your 


involvement with four individuals.


QUESTION:  Well, why -- why should 


subjective intent make any difference here?  I mean, 


the -- the effect on the -- on the accused is exactly 


the same.


MR. WAXMAN:  Your Honor, I'm -- I'm simply 


reciting back for -- for you the court's 


instructions, and -- and saying that if the standard 


is deliberate elicitation and intentionally creating 


a situation, it essentially, in terms of providing a 


line, it proscribes what the police may not 


deliberately do, and --


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. WAXMAN:  -- but deliberateness, I 


think, is a finding of the magistrate, which -- to 


which the Eighth Circuit and this Court owe 


deference.


QUESTION:  But deliberateness may refer to 


nothing more than intending the statement that was 


made, and whether it elicits or not, or whether it 


constitutes elicitation -- what a terrible word --


whether it constitutes elicitation, it seems to me, 


can be judged objectively, can't it?


MR. WAXMAN:  Your Honor, perhaps, but

designed to elicit, it strikes me as including a 


subjective component.  But even if I'm wrong, I 


submit that the magistrate was correct as an a priori 


matter in saying, look, these people -- these 


officers -- these agents of the prosecution, came to 


this man's house.  They not only knew he had been 


indicted, Officer Bliemeyer had been the witness --


QUESTION:  Bliemeister, I think.


MR. WAXMAN:  Bliemeister -- had been the 


witness before the grand jury, and he comes --


QUESTION:  Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, I -- I will 


assume that that is correct.  I mean, I -- the record 


looks to me just as you're describing it.  But 


assuming that, do you think there is any practical 


difference between what Deputy Bliemeister did here 


and what the officer did in Elstad?


MR. WAXMAN:  I don't remember what the 


officer did in Elstad.


QUESTION:  Well, in -- in Elstad, the --


there were two officers, one went with the mother of 


the suspect into the kitchen to tell her why they 


were there.  The other one -- excuse me -- stayed in 


another room with the -- with the boy who was the 


suspect and started telling them what they were there 


to -- to investigate, there was a burglary next door.

And at the end of the conversation that's quoted in 


the opinion he said, you know, I -- I think you may 


know something about that, and the boy said, yes he 


did.  And it seems to me that the elicitation there 


was functionally about the same as the elicitation 


here.

MR. WAXMAN:  Well, that --


QUESTION:  But I want to know whether you 


MR. WAXMAN:  I -- I actually don't agree. 


I think -- I think for other reasons, that is, the --


the fact that this is a Sixth Amendment it doesn't 


matter.  But I do think --


QUESTION:  Well --


MR. WAXMAN:  -- when the police officers 


come and say, we are here to discuss with you the 


following things, which happened to be the precise 


things that he has just been indicted for, that is a 


paradigm -- paradigmatic deliberate elicitation.


QUESTION:  Well, yeah, but --


MR. WAXMAN:  And --


QUESTION:  -- to -- to say to a kid, you 


know, I think you may know something about this, and 


the person making that statement's a cop, sounds like

 MR. WAXMAN:  Well, if -- if -- Mr. --


QUESTION:  Functionally -- if -- if 


functionally it is, let's assume -- I -- I tend to 


think it is -- and -- and functionally in each case, 


whether it's Fifth Amendment right or Sixth Amendment 


right, the statement doesn't come in unless there is, 


among other things, a voluntary waiver of the right 


to the presence of counsel then and there.  And in --


in each case we didn't have it.  It's hard for me to 


see why in functional terms it should make a 


difference whether we're talking about Sixth or Fifth 


and why there should be a difference between this 


case and Elstad.


MR. WAXMAN:  Because the functional 


analysis depends on the right being protected.  The 


Fifth Amendment right does not embed a policy against 


deliberate elicitation of information from suspects. 


In fact, our system embraces that.  And if there was 


a violation in Elstad, it was --


QUESTION:  Well, neither does the Sixth. 


The -- what the Sixth says is, before you try 


anything like that, you've either got to have his 


counsel present or his counsel permission or his 


waiver of it.  What's the difference?


MR. WAXMAN:  It -- the difference is

what's being protected.  What's being protected in 


the Fifth is coercion.  What's being protected in the 


Sixth in this instance is precisely what --


QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Waxman, isn't it also 


true that in one case there was an indictment, in the 


other there wasn't?


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, yes.  And what the 


Sixth Amendment protects in terms, Justice Souter, is 


that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall 


enjoy the right to the assistance of counsel.


QUESTION:  And -- and recognize he's got 


that right because there was the indictment.  And in 


the Fifth Amendment case, the Miranda case, we 


recognized that he's got that right, because this 


Court has said that's the only way you're going to 


make the Fifth Amendment work.  So we start with the 


assumption that he's got the right, and that in fact 


the elicitation or statements that produce his 


statement are -- are -- are improper.  His statement 


is inadmissible unless there's a waiver of the right 


to the presence of counsel at that time.


MR. WAXMAN:  Absolutely.  And that gets us 


right to Elstad, and the line that this Court drew in 


Elstad at the very outset of its opinion, which is 


that the consequences of an interrogation in

violation of Miranda differ importantly from the 


consequences of a violation of the Constitution 


itself, that is, primary illegality that goes 


directly, without prophylaxis, to what the 


Constitution proscribes.  And this Court said over 


and over and over again in Elstad that we will not 


apply a derivative evidence rule where the violation 


is only the former, but we will apply it in the 


latter. 


And that is the key distinction in this 


case.  The distinction is not that the statements 


that they elicited from Mr. Fellers at his home 


didn't also violate Miranda, if he was in custody and 


the court found that he was, they did.


QUESTION:  But most of our Miranda cases, 


we recognize that the -- the police nationwide 


understand the dynamics of Miranda.  I have no 


empirical basis, and apparently you don't know 


either.  My assumption is most police officers would 


be very surprised if there's a difference between 


Fifth and Sixth --


MR. WAXMAN:  But --


QUESTION:  -- their Fifth and Sixth 


Amendment obligations in -- in this -- in these 


circumstances.

 MR. WAXMAN:  But Justice Kennedy, I submit 


to you that it doesn't matter as a matter of 


constitutional prophylaxis.  It may very well -- what 


the police officers know is, they knew they had to 


give him his Miranda warnings there.  That we can be 


sure of.  And they also knew that there would be 


consequences for not doing it, and this is not just 


the police.  If it -- if it please the Court, this is 


the prosecution.  Once there is an indictment, the 


police are not acting on their own.  The police are 


part of the government prosecution, and if police 


don't know that, and are trying to game the system 


the way we heard it yesterday, it's the burden of the 


prosecution -- the prosecution and the Government to 


make sure that they do understand that.


What we're talking about here is the 


preservation of -- as this Court has said it --


equality -- equality of each side once the Government 


unilaterally define -- changes its posture with 


respect to someone so that that person is accused, 


and when it does that, it has to make -- it has to 


take steps to avoid interfering with the ability of 


the defendant at all critical stages and all 


confrontations to proceed based on ignorance or 


misapprehension of his rights or the legal

consequences. 


I realize this sounds like --


QUESTION:  Mr. Waxman, can I -- Mr. 


Waxman, can I just clarify that we do have the 


threshold question in this case, right?  Because as 


it stands in the Eighth Circuit, you don't even have 


a foot in the door because there was no 


interrogation, it was only -- so we have to overturn 


the Eighth Circuit on that point before we get to 


what you're now talking about.


MR. WAXMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  Now, the --


the Eighth Circuit was incorrect, because it applied 


the wrong standard.  It asked whether there was 


interrogation, when this Court made clear in Rhode 


Island v. Innis that that is not the test under the 


Sixth Amendment for good reasons, and in any event, 


this was the, quote, functional equivalent of 


interrogation.  I mean --


QUESTION:  Well, because of the Eighth 


Circuit's position on the original statements, it 


really didn't address the subsequent jailhouse 


statements in any proper fashion, did it?


MR. WAXMAN:  No.  It -- it said -- what 


the Eighth Circuit said is, look, we don't think that 


there was a primary illegality, and therefore, we

don't have to discuss --


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. WAXMAN:  -- what the fruits 


consequences are.


QUESTION:  So I suppose -- if we were to 


agree with you on the first statements and conclude 


they were deliberately elicited, we'd have to remand, 


I suppose --


MR. WAXMAN:  I don't think so, Your Honor.


QUESTION: -- on the second question.


MR. WAXMAN:  Because the question 


presented in the petition, the second question 


presented in the petition is, okay, assuming that 


there was a violation of the Sixth Amendment in the 


first interrogation, does the invocation, the mere 


invocation of Miranda warnings, cleanse that taint?


QUESTION:  No, it wasn't that --


QUESTION:  Well, except the Eighth Circuit 


didn't address that second question.


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. WAXMAN: That's correct.


QUESTION:  Well, would you like to say 


something about it --


MR. WAXMAN:  I would.


QUESTION: -- because I -- in looking at

it, I want -- would like you to address the 


particular argument.  First, the questioning at the 


house was about whether he'd ever participated in 


taking drugs with these people.  The relevant 


question was whether he distributed drugs at the 


station.  They did ask him if he wanted a lawyer.  He 


did consciously waive it.  And therefore, in fact, 


since this case is about a right to a lawyer, maybe 


if he'd had a lawyer it would have made a difference, 


but it's hard to see how the decision not to have the 


lawyer flowed from the first.


MR. WAXMAN:  Well --


QUESTION:  So they're different subject 


matters.  Time passes and it's pretty attenuated to 


say that that first violation led him to the second. 


All right.  Those are the arguments, et cetera.


MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.


QUESTION:  What do you say?


MR. WAXMAN:  I'll -- I'll answer Justice 


O'Connor's question first and then your question. 


Justice O'Connor, the -- the -- the point here is 


that this Court has uniformly held that where there 


is conduct that constitutes primary illegality in 


violation of the Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendments, 


not just a prophylactic rule, but the constitutional

requirement itself, the remedy is, you apply the 


derivative evidence rule, which puts the burden on 


the Government to prove that the taint has 


sufficiently attenuated.


QUESTION:  But certainly the -- the -- the 


defendant can waive his right to counsel later on, 


and he did.


MR. WAXMAN:  He absolutely can.  And our 


case doesn't --


QUESTION:  And he did.


MR. WAXMAN:  He --


QUESTION:  Do you think it's tainted 


simply because if we find a violation originally?


MR. WAXMAN:  Our -- our case, Your Honor, 


doesn't depend on any argument or showing that the 


second statement was either involuntary or that the 


waiver of the right to counsel was not knowing and 


intelligent.  Our submission is that the second 


statement is the fruit of the poisonous tree, just as 


if it were a piece of inanimate evidence.  There's 


nothing wrong if somebody said -- with what the -- if 


police going and finding the body in the Nix case, 


the Christian burial case, but it's tainted because 


they got the -- that information derived from a 


violation of the Sixth Amendment.  I had not up here

 QUESTION:  But he can certainly waive his 


Sixth Amendment right later.  I just don't understand 


why what you say necessarily follows.  We've never 


held that squarely, have we?


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, you -- you have never 


held in a Sixth Amendment --


QUESTION:  No.


MR. WAXMAN:  You've never held the -- the 


precise question that's presented here for sure.  But 


you have held that where there is conduct that 


violates the Sixth Amendment, this is Nix and Wade, 


the fruits of that conduct, regardless of what 


happens thereafter, are excludable as fruit of the 


poisonous tree, unless the Government shoulders its 


taint-attenuation burden.


And you have also held in a variety of 


cases that, starting with Wong Sun, that where the 


fruit is testimonial evidence, it too has to be 


excluded with the understanding that the administer 


-- the intervening administration of Miranda warnings 


are potent evidence, but they are not sufficient in 


and of themselves to establish taint attenuation. 


You said it in Brown.  You said it last term in Kaupp 


v. Texas.  You've said it in Dunaway and any number

of other cases.


QUESTION:  How is the second statement the 


fruit of the first?


MR. WAXMAN: The first statement in the 


first -- I mean, as a -- that -- this is a sort of a 


common sense, practical analysis, but in the first 


statement he was -- he acknowledged that he had used 


methamphetamines and he had associated with the four 


individuals that the police officer named.  And you, 


Justice Breyer, the indictment was conspiracy to 


possess methamphetamines with intent to distribute 


and to distribute.  He made very inculpatory 


statements.


Thirty minutes later, he executes a 


Miranda warning -- waiver -- in the station house, 


and he is asked, okay, tell us more about this 


possession and tell us person by person about your 


association with those four people.  They then go on 


and ask more questions about other people, but in 


this case, the link between the two is as direct as 


one can possibly imagine.  I mean, this Court has 


established a -- has long recognized a presumption 


that where the -- when the Government acquires 


evidence in violation of the Constitution, any 


substantially similar evidence obtained by the police

subsequent to that derives from it unless the 


Government can prove it doesn't.  That was waived.


QUESTION:  I can under -- I can understand 


the position, although I'm not entirely persuaded by 


it, that where -- when you are violate -- have 


violated the Fifth Amendment and gotten a confession 


that's already on the table, the second confession is 


sort of the fruit of that, because the person thinks, 


what the heck, I've already confessed, I may as well 


-- that's the argument that it's the fruit.


MR. WAXMAN:  The taint --


QUESTION:  But I don't -- but I don't see 


how the waiver of -- of counsel the second time is 


the -- is the fruit of the improper approach the 


first time.  I mean, I -- I don't see somebody 


saying, what the heck, I waived counsel the first 


time, I may as well waive it the second.


MR. WAXMAN:  Your Honor, the taint --


QUESTION:  That doesn't follow the way --


the way confession does.


MR. WAXMAN:  The taint, which this Court 


in Elstad, in part IIa of its opinion in Elstad, said 


was insufficient -- IIb -- was insufficient to prove 


involuntariness, is in fact what demonstrates that 


there is fruit of the poisonous tree here in the

link, and that is the accepted, common sense 


proposition that an uncounseled accused, from whom 


the Government deliberately elicits an unwarned, 


incriminatory statement after it institutes 


adversarial proceedings, is erroneously likely to 


believe that there is little to be gained and much to 


be lost from attempting to avoid further 


incrimination.


QUESTION:  Well, now, but is there -- is 


there some authority for that specific proposition 


that you just said?


MR. WAXMAN:  This Court recognized it in 


Bayer, in Brown, in --


QUESTION: Did it say -- I -- I'm -- you --


you just recited kind of a litany.  Did the Court 


recite that sort of a litany in Bayer?


MR. WAXMAN:  Well, in Brown, for example, 


it said that the second warrant statement, quote, was 


clearly the result and fruit of the first.  The fact 


that Brown had made one statement believed by him to 


be admissible bolstered the pressures for him to give 


the second, or at least vitiated any incentive on his 


part to avoid self-incrimination.


QUESTION:  But that -- that's a -- that's 


a first statement.  That's -- you're -- you're

talking here about a waiver of counsel and you're 


saying that's the same thing.


MR. WAXMAN:  It is the same thing.  In 


that case they were talking about the second 


statement, which was preceded by a waiver of counsel, 


and making not the, Your Honor, not the legal 


judgment that the second statement was there for 


coerced or involuntary, but the practical -- what 


this Court has described as the psychological and 


practical disadvantage of having confessed a first 


time can be regarded as a fruit of the first.


QUESTION:  Yeah, but isn't the -- the --


isn't the -- correct me if I'm wrong.  I think your 


theory is that the waiver itself is likely to be a 


fruit because a person is going to say, I've already 


let the cat out of the bag, what do I need a lawyer 


for.  Is -- is --


MR. WAXMAN: Yes.  That's -- as --


QUESTION:  -- that your position?


MR. WAXMAN:  -- as -- as Justice Harlan 


stated in his concurrence in Darwin, which is only a 


concurrence, but I think is sort of the --


QUESTION:  Well, but that -- that's -- the 


cat out of the bag is what we rejected in Elstad.


MR. WAXMAN:  You rejected it, Your Honor,

as evidence or as constituting or -- or eliciting a 


presumption of involuntariness.  But you did it only 


after -- in part IIa of your opinion in Elstad, you 


said, derivative evidence rule doesn't apply.  Fruits 


are not going to be excluded from Elstad -- from a 


Miranda violation.  Now, the Court said in part IIb, 


now we have to deal with the contention that he says 


it's involuntary, and his only evidence that it's 


involuntary is that it was the cat out of the bag and 


there was this psychological compulsion. 


That's too attenuated and hypothetical to 


constitute a presumption of compulsion, but it is 


precisely what this Court has recognized in Brown and 


Dunaway and Bayer and Taylor and Harrison as being a 


psychological fact --


QUESTION:  And that should make the case 


-- that case that we heard yesterday easier than this 


one if that's the standard, because there, the first 


unwarned set of questions was much more intense, much 


more detailed than in this case.


MR. WAXMAN:  Right.  And the -- the only 


burden in the -- in the case yesterday that I don't 


have is that the primary illegality was a violation 


of Miranda, and not of the Fifth Amendment 


prohibition against coerced confessions itself.

 Thank you.


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Waxman.


Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 


it please the Court:


On the central legal issue in this case, 


the critical fact is that, at the jailhouse, after 


petitioner was transported from his home, petitioner 


received a full set of Miranda warnings, which 


apprised him of his right to counsel, and knowingly, 


voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to 


counsel.


QUESTION:  Did the Eighth Circuit ever 


decide whether there was a knowing and voluntary 


waiver at the jailhouse?


MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  I believe that the 


Eighth Circuit did, Justice O'Connor, because the 


Eighth Circuit applied Oregon v. Elstad to reject 


what appears to be a Miranda-style argument that 


petitioner made in addition to his Sixth Amendment 


argument.


QUESTION:  I thought that perhaps since 


they didn't think the first statement posed a problem

25

that they never really got to the crux of the 


jailhouse inquiry.


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I -- I think in -- in 


part, Justice O'Connor, your reading of the opinion 


is correct.  The court did say that under Patterson, 


the Sixth Amendment argument that petitioner is 


making in this Court doesn't get out of the starting 


gate, because there was no interrogation, it used the 


word interrogation.  There was an issue about whether 


interrogation is equivalent to deliberate 


elicitation, and I'll try to address that.


But before the court got to the Sixth 


Amendment question, it addressed on pages 121 and 122 


of the joint appendix the argument based on Elstad, 


and the argument that the petitioner made was that 


the statements made at the jailhouse should be 


suppressed -- and this is on page 121 of the joint 


appendix -- because the primary taint of the 


improperly elicited statements made at his home was 


not removed by the recitation of his Miranda rights 


at the jail.


And then the court went on to discuss 


Oregon v. Elstad in detail and rejected that holding, 


that argument.  And the way that I interpret that 


passage is that the court affirmed the district

court's explicit finding of a knowing, voluntary, and 


intelligent waiver, and applied Elstad to reject that 


claim.


QUESTION:  Just so I understand what the 


Sixth Amendment rule is, if the Sixth Amendment 


prohibits the state from eliciting statements when 


the defend -- when proceedings have begun, outside 


presence of counsel, is it wrong for them to give the 


Miranda warning and if he's then silent, then go 


ahead and say, now you've had your Miranda warning, 


would you like to talk to us?  Is that consistent 


with the Sixth Amendment rules that we impose?  That 


is to say, can you elicit the statement after you've 


given the waiver, consistently with the Sixth 


Amendment right?


MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  Patterson v. Illinois 


specifically addressed the question of what does it 


take for officers to obtain a waiver of counsel.  The 


only point where I would disagree, Justice Kennedy, 


with your summary is that presence of counsel is not 


required.  The defendant has the right to choose 


whether to have or to waive counsel.


And in Patterson, the Court held that the 


Miranda warnings conveyed to a suspect who has been 


indicted all of the information needed to make a

knowing and a voluntary and intelligent waiver of 


counsel in custodial interrogation.  That's what 


petitioner got.


QUESTION:  And they can attempt to elicit 


that waiver consistently with the Sixth Amendment?


MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct.  They can 


approach the defendant, apprise him of his rights, 


and if the defendant then makes a knowing and 


intelligent waiver of his rights --


QUESTION:  No, that wasn't my question. 


Can they -- can they advise him of those rights, he's 


silent, and then try to elicit the statement?  Say, 


now we've apprised you of your rights and we want you 


to talk to us.  Is that consistent with the Sixth 


Amendment?


MR. DREEBEN:  I think so, if that's 


construed as seeking a waiver of his right to 


counsel.  Of course, there has to be a finding that 


there was in fact a waiver of the right to counsel. 


The police officers can't simply read Miranda 


warnings, provide no interruption whatsoever to make 


sure that the defendant actually understood them, and 


then barge right ahead.


Now, there are cases where the courts have 


to decide whether there was an implicit waiver of

case like that, because the Miranda waiver form in 


the record clearly indicates --


 QUESTION:  But, Mr. Dreeben, maybe I'm 


wrong on the facts, but you're relying on the waiver 


at the station house?


 MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct.


 QUESTION:  Do you agree that prior to that 


9 

waiver there had already been a violation of the 


10 

Sixth Amendment?


11

12

 MR. DREEBEN:  No, Justice Stevens.  Our --


 QUESTION:  Well, then -- then you don't 


13 

need the waiver.


14

 MR. DREEBEN:  That -- that is true.  I --


15 

my submission is on the critical legal question. 


16 

Even if the Court finds against us on what I would 


17 

acknowledge is a close question about whether the 


18 

interaction at the home constituted deliberate 


19 

elicitation under the Sixth Amendment --

22

 MR. DREEBEN:  No, I wouldn't say that it

was a -- an actual violation of the Sixth Amendment 


24 

at the time.  The Sixth Amendment is a trial right.

The right to counsel has to be evaluated by reference

 QUESTION:  So even if there was no waiver 


at the home, there -- there still was no violation of 


the Constitution?


MR. DREEBEN:  Not at that time.  I -- I 


want to make it perfectly clear, Justice Stevens --


QUESTION:  It seems to me a rather extreme 


position.


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I -- I don't think it 


is extreme, because I'm going to follow it up with 


what I think Your Honor is getting to, which is, can 


the police simply go to an indicted suspect's home, 


ignore his right to counsel, and engage in 


questioning?  And the answer is, generally no, 


sometimes yes.  The generally no is that once the 


defendant has been indicted, the right to counsel 


provides a -- a direction to the police not to 


interfere with or circumvent the right to counsel.


QUESTION:  Well, what is the sometimes 


yes?


MR. DREEBEN: Sometimes yes is that, this 


Court has recognized in its seminal case in this 


area, the Massiah case, and then again in Maine v. 


Moulton, that the Sixth Amendment, as it is 


offense-specific, does not preclude the police from

investigating ongoing criminal activity that's not 


charged.


QUESTION:  Well, but this is -- this was 


an offense-specific interrogation if it -- if was an 


interrogation.


MR. DREEBEN:  Yes.  I -- and this case 


doesn't involve the --


QUESTION:  It seems to me there's an 


analogy to civil cases here.  Supposing you just had 


a civil lawsuit pending against the person and after 


it's filed, wouldn't there be an ethical obligation 


on -- on behalf of the plaintiff not to send agents 


out to question your adversary in the proceeding?


MR. DREEBEN:  There may be a ethical 


obligation, even if the party is not known to be 


represented at the time, although --


QUESTION:  If he's known not to be 


represented, that's my case.


MR. DREEBEN:  He's known not be 


represented, I think it's a closer question whether 


-- whether the ethics rules would -- would bar the 


approaching of the defendant.  But this Court has 


made --


QUESTION:  Who -- who -- who would you go 


to?  If he hasn't appointed counsel and --

 MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Stevens --


QUESTION: -- and he's filed the case --


he's filed the case pro se.  Who would you approach 


if you don't approach him?


MR. DREEBEN:  I think, Justice Stevens --


QUESTION: Now, I'm assuming that the --


the Government is the plaintiff in the case.  That --


MR. DREEBEN:  The implication is that you 


couldn't approach him.  And this Court has clearly 


made it evident that whatever the ethical rules might 


be with respect to private conduct, the Sixth 


Amendment rules are not governed by them.  And the 


Sixth Amendment rule, in this area at least, is 


relatively clear.  The police can approach an 


unrepresented defendant, advise him of his rights, 


and obtain a waiver of the right to counsel.


QUESTION:  Well, can the police approach a 


person and deliberately elicit statements without 


advising him of his right to counsel after 


indictment?


MR. DREEBEN:  Not on the charged offense, 


Justice O'Connor, and have the information admitted 


at trial.  The -- the threshold question --


QUESTION:  Well, have we looked to whether 


the statement was deliberately elicited? Has that

been our understanding of what we'd look to?


MR. DREEBEN:  That -- that has been the 


way that this Court has formulated the test, and I 


would suggest that if --


QUESTION:  And so should we apply that 


test here to those early statements?


MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, but I think the Court 


should clearly reformulate it to make it in the 


context of overt interrogation by the police, known 


police officers, to be an objective test.  The 


deliberate elicitation standard, as so phrased, gives 


rise to some confusion, because it does suggest that 


there's a subjective component to it, where 


deliberate elicitation does have a different 


application than interrogation for purposes of 


Miranda with respect to undercover agents.  The Court 


has made clear that once a suspect is indicted, the 


police cannot use an undercover agent, not known or 


identified as such to the defendant, to circumvent 


his right to counsel.  And in that respect, 


deliberate elicitation is broader.


But in footnote 12 of Maine v. Moulton 


where the Court was discussing deliberate elicitation 


in some detail, the Court made clear that intent is 


hard to prove, and it's really not the main issue

here anyway.  What we should be interested in is 


whether the Government must have known that its 


conduct would be likely to elicit incriminating 


statements, and that is essentially the same as the 


Rhode Island v. Innis standard for interrogation.  In 


fact, it's a little bit more onerous for the 


defendant, because it says, must have known, and the 


Rhode Island v. Innis standard is should have known.


In any event, the Government submits that 


the Court should make it clearer that when you're 


dealing with identified police officers interacting 


with suspects post-indictment, the Rhode Island v. 


Innis standard, the objective test should be the 


definition of deliberate elicitation.  Then the 


question becomes, was there deliberate elicitation on 


the record in this case?


What happened is, the officers arrived at 


petitioner's home.  The officers knew petitioner. 


This was not somebody that they had never met before. 


They'd met him on prior occasions.  And they said in 


one continuous statement, we're here to discuss your 


methamphetamine activities, we have a warrant for 


your arrest --


QUESTION:  Didn't they say, we're here to 


discuss with you?

 MR. DREEBEN:  Justice --


QUESTION:  Wasn't it Bliemeister's 


statement, I'm here to discuss with you?


MR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, on three 


occasions when Officer Bliemeister was asked to say 


what he said in his own words, he said, we're here to 


discuss your methamphetamine activities.  On one 


occasion, when defense counsel in cross-examination 


reformulated what Officer Bliemeister said, and said, 


didn't you say you're here to discuss with petitioner 


his methamphetamine activities, Officer Bliemeister 


answered yes.  Both the magistrate judge and the 


district court did not use the with you language in 


describing what the officer said.


And to the extent that this case turns on 


a rather subtle distinction in language, I think the 


distinction is relevant, because what the officers 


were essentially doing is introducing the topic of 


what they were going to tell petitioner, namely, your 


methamphetamine activities have landed you in 


trouble, we're here to arrest you, we have an 


indictment for your arrest.  And then petitioner 


began to speak primarily --


QUESTION:  Telling -- telling is not 


discussing.  I mean, I don't see why the phrase, with

you, is essential when the only person in the room is 


-- is -- is you --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION: -- and somebody comes in and 


says, I'm here to discuss, you know, whatever.  Who 


else are you going to discuss it with then?


(Laughter.)


MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think there was any 


ambiguity about the object of the statements, but the 


question of what the officers were intending to do is 


somewhat informed by the way they phrased it.


QUESTION:  No, but the -- the usual sense 


of the word discuss is something that involves other 


than -- something involving more than a monologue. 


So I mean, I -- as Justice Scalia said, I -- it might 


make it clearer if he had said with you each time, 


but without the with you, discuss implies give and 


take.


QUESTION: At -- at least if there's nobody 


else in the room.  I mean, if there's a crowd of 


people and you say, I'm here to discuss something, 


maybe you're going to discuss it with the other 


people.  That's fine, but -- but it -- this was 


one-one-one.


MR. DREEBEN:  I readily acknowledge that

this is a case that could be reasonably decided more 


than one way, but I would submit that if you look at 


what the officers did, the officers in the -- at his 


home, basically informed him about the fact that he 


was under arrest and indicted.  He spoke 


uninterrupted except by one completely irrelevant 


question to the topic of the indictment, until the 


officers interrupted him, cut him off, and said it's 


time to go, John, you know.  And John said, can I 


please get some shoes on?  And they accompanied him 


downstairs, he got shoes, then they took him down to 


the jailhouse.  No questions about the topics that 


were later discussed at the jailhouse.


QUESTION:  Well, if we were to conclude 


that there was a violation of the so-called 


deliberate elicitation standard, modified or not, 


then what, with regard to the subsequent conversation 


of the jail, after the warnings had been given?


MR. DREEBEN:  Then I think, Justice 


O'Connor, that this Court should apply its rule in 


Oregon v. Elstad that the knowing, voluntary, and 


intelligent waiver of the right to counsel 


constitutes an independent act of free will that 


breaks any causal link that might otherwise have been 


posited between the statements that were made in the

initial unwarned session --


QUESTION:  And you think that that 


determination has been made knowing and voluntariness 


as to the jailhouse statement --


MR. DREEBEN: I --


QUESTION: -- by the court below.


MR. DREEBEN:  Not only do I think that it 


was made explicitly in the district court and 


implicitly in the court of appeals, but I don't 


believe that petitioner contests it.  I don't believe 


that petitioner's position is that the waiver of 


rights was actually tainted.  What I understand 


petitioner's position to be is that there was a 


violation of a primary constitutional norm at home 


when -- when petitioner was interrogated or 


statements were deliberately elicited.  Accordingly 


--

QUESTION:  The fruits --


MR. DREEBEN:  Exactly.  The same fruits 


rule ought to apply that applies under the Fourth 


Amendment and then petitioner relies on Fourth 


Amendment precedents, which the Government does not 


think are -- are applicable here.


QUESTION:  I - I think -- I think he would 


say it is a fruit because it is not totally

voluntary, given the fact that he had already let the 


cat out of the bag.  I -- I -- I don't think -- I 


don't think he would acknowledge that the second 


waiver -- that the waiver of counsel in the second 


interrogation was entirely free, given what had 


preceded.


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Scalia, I'll 


have to let petitioner's briefs speak for what --


QUESTION:  Well, we -- we've destroyed his 


right of rebuttal, so --


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  And that's the question 


basically, because I think that's an important 


question and -- and the question is whether there is 


a right to a lawyer, and when the Government violates 


the right to the lawyer, like the Fourth Amendment or 


any other amendment, they can't use a fruit.  Now, 


Oregon v. Elstad is talking about a right that isn't 


complete until you fail to introduce the -- until you 


use it as testimony at trial, and therefore Oregon v. 


Elstad is a different, and considerably more lenient 


test.  I confess I always would have thought until 


this moment that our Court cases said you apply the 


fruits because the violation is complete. 


Now, it seems to me in advocating the

second, you're advocating a considerable change, but 


whether it's a change or not a change, I want to know 


the reason for it.


MR. DREEBEN:  There are two critical 


reasons, Justice Breyer, why Oregon v. Elstad should 


apply in this context.  The first is that the right 


that the defendant did not get, by hypothesis now, at 


home, was the right to make an informed waiver of the 


right to counsel.  When the defendant got the Miranda 


warnings at home, that fully cured any deficiency in 


knowledge that the defendant previously had about his 


right to counsel, and enabled him to make an act of 


free will that broke any causal link between the 


first statements and the second statements.


And the second crucial reason why Elstad 


should apply here is Elstad is not simply limited to 


reasoning that is only applicable in the context of 


compulsion under the Fifth Amendment.  It also 


clearly and explicitly said, it's very speculative 


and attenuated to posit that a defendant who spoke at 


one time is therefore going to believe that the cat 


is out of the bag and I should speak again, I don't 


really have a choice.


QUESTION:  Right.  But as to the first, my 


Constitution says you have a right to a lawyer, not 


45

-- of course you can waive it, like anybody -- other 


right.  But that's quite different than the Fifth 


Amendment right, which is a right not to testify 


against yourself, which is in complete to a trial. 


As to the second, of course, attenuation 


is relevant.  It's relevant under the tree -- fruits 


doctrine.  It's relevant under Elstad.  So if you 


prove attenuation, fine.  So, given those two things, 


why do we have to change the law here?  Or is it a 


change?


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I don't think it's a 


change, Justice Breyer, because the Court has never 


addressed the specific dynamic involved in this case 


under the Sixth Amendment of a defendant who makes an 


unwarned statement --


QUESTION:  Well, the Nix v. Williams case 


bears on it to some extent, doesn't it?


MR. DREEBEN:  It does --


QUESTION:  That was a Sixth Amendment 


case.


MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, Justice O'Connor, and I 


-- I accept, although I think it's fair to say that 


Nix did no more than assume that there would be a 


fruits rule as to physical evidence.


QUESTION:  Yeah.  And the Court in Nix

made it pretty clear that we assumed there would be a 


fruits suppression.


MR. DREEBEN:  Correct.  As to physical 


evidence.


QUESTION:  But applied some other reason 


to let the body --


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, the Court -- the Court 


there relied on inevitable discovery.


QUESTION:  Right.


MR. DREEBEN:  Here, our basic position is 


that the voluntary testimony of the defendant himself 


is different from physical fruits or from the 


situation involving a tainted line-up, which was 


involved in Wade, and that the decision, made 


voluntarily and intelligently by a defendant to waive 


counsel, is a per se break in any causal chain that 


would be positive.


And our second argument is that the Court 


has already rejected in Elstad the idea that there is 


a causal link between a defendant's letting a cat out 


of the bag in the first statement and then being 


confronted with the question whether to waive his 


rights in the second.


QUESTION:  Mr. Dreeben, do -- do I 


understand correctly that essentially you are saying

that Mr. Waxman in wrong in bracketing the Sixth 


Amendment with the Fourth Amendment, that it belongs 


with the Fifth Amendment?  And one, it seems to me, 


large difference between the two of you is Mr. Waxman 


describes the Sixth Amendment violation of -- as 


occurring on the spot.  You have said in your brief 


it's just like the Fifth Amendment.  It's sort of 


inchoate until the Government seeks to introduce it 


at a trial.  Is that still your view, so that the --


the right to counsel isn't complete -- the violation 


isn't complete until the Government makes an effort 


to introduce it at trial?


MR. DREEBEN:  It is.  My view that the 


violation is not complete until the evidence is 


introduced at trial, but I think where I put the 


Sixth Amendment is not numerically accurate, but it's 


somewhere in between the Fourth and the Fifth 


Amendment rules, in that there are circumstances in 


which I believe that there is a fruits rule attached 


to conduct that infringes a Sixth Amendment norm. 


The right itself may not be a completed violation 


until evidence that results from infringing a Sixth 


Amendment norm is actually used against the 


defendant.  Adversarial fairness is the goal of the 


Sixth Amendment.  If it is not infringed, neither is

the Constitution.


QUESTION:  Because if -- if the -- we 


describe that right, that Sixth Amendment amendment 


right as a right to counsel at every critical stage 


in the criminal proceeding, then that sounds like 


there's a critical stage and you haven't been told 


and haven't waived your right to a lawyer, the 


violation is complete.


MR. DREEBEN:  No, I don't think so, 


Justice Ginsburg.  And one example that I think makes 


the point very clear is this Court's ineffective 


assistance of counsel cases.  Those cases require not 


only that a lawyer performs deficiently, below any 


reasonable professional standard, but also that there 


be an effect on the fairness of the trail in the form 


of prejudice.  It's a two-part standard.  There is no 


constitutional violation merely by interfering with 


the right to counsel.  Another case that makes that 


point --


QUESTION:  Well, there's a constitutional 


deficiency.  I mean, we're playing with words.  What 


we're saying in the counsel cases is, if we have to 


go back and unring the bell, we want something more 


than simply the deficiency. 

We want to know that 


requiring a new trial or whatever is likely to make a

difference.


The question here is -- is asked, I think, 


Justice Ginsburg's question is asked on a prospective 


basis.  And that is, at the time the -- the police 


question without counsel, is that a violation of the 


-- of the Sixth Amendment?


MR. DREEBEN:  And my --


QUESTION:  Your -- your answer a moment 


ago was, the only violation of the Sixth Amendment 


was the denial of the -- of the opportunity to waive. 


But he's got to have an opportunity to waive 


something, and I suppose that implies that he has, at 


least on a prospective basis, a right to the presence 


of counsel there if the police are going to question 


him, absent a -- a waiver.


MR. DREEBEN:  I -- I think that there's a 


lot in your question, Justice Souter, but I -- I 


think I basically agree with the thrust of it.  He 


does have the right to choose whether to have counsel 


or not after he's been indicted when the police 


approach him for interrogation.  The question in this 


case is, what do you do if that didn't happen?  And 


--

QUESTION:  Of course, the -- the other way 


to look at is upside down.  I mean, if -- if you

concede that there's a Sixth Amendment violation 


immediately, you're still free to argue that -- that 


in -- in the Miranda case, there's also a Fifth 


Amendment violation immediately.  Now, you couldn't 


do that with Elstad, but after Dickerson, you can 


certainly argue that.


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, as we discussed 


yesterday, Justice Scalia --


QUESTION:  Yes, I know.


MR. DREEBEN:  I -- I believe that the 


violation in a Miranda case consists precisely of the 


admission of the defendant's statements in the 


Government case in chief.  The Fifth Amendment is an 


evidentiary rule.  That's what the nature of the 


violation is.  It's not a conduct-based rule.


QUESTION:  Well, and that has a textual 


support in the constitutional language itself.


MR. DREEBEN:  That -- that's correct.


QUESTION:  But you don't have quite the 


same thing on the Sixth Amendment?


MR. DREEBEN:  No, but I don't think that 


it matters because we're conceding that the Court 


engages in fruits analysis.  Our primary position in 


this case on the legal issue is that the defendant's 


independent, untainted decision to waive counsel is a

act of --


QUESTION:  But Mr. Dreeben, it's -- the 


thought runs through my mind that if he were to waive 


counsel in front of a judge in a trial setting, the 


judge would ask him a lot of questions and be sure 


the waiver was intelligent and voluntary and so 


forth.  And you're suggesting, at the time he's first 


indicted when the police approach him, he doesn't 


need any of that guidance as all.  If he just answers 


the question, that's sufficient.


MR. DREEBEN: Well, that -- that is --


QUESTION:  It's a rather dramatic 


difference in the kind of waiver of this very 


important right.


MR. DREEBEN:  True.  But that's what the 


Court held over Your Honor's dissent in Patterson v. 


Illinois.  The Court explicitly considered the issue 


of what kind of a waiver is necessary, and the Court 


held that the issuance of Miranda warnings provides 


the defendant with all the information that he needs 


to know.


QUESTION:  But, of course, you didn't even 


have the Miranda warning here --


MR. DREEBEN:  No, but --


QUESTION: -- at the home.

 MR. DREEBEN:  And we're not claiming that 


there was a waiver of the right to counsel.  Our --


our claim for whatever favor it may meet with the 


Court is that there was no deliberate elicitation of 


statements.  We're not claiming a waiver at the home. 


We are unequivocally claiming a waiver at the 


jailhouse.


QUESTION:  Don't you think it is a rather 


-- rather strange that the judges are as careful as 


they are in a trial setting, whereas the police can 


just do what they did here?  Does that -- doesn't 


trouble you?


MR. DREEBEN: No, I don't think it's 


strange at all, because as the Court explained in 


Patterson, the question of a waiver is a functional 


question that turns on what the role of counsel might 


be at a particular setting.  Now, the role of counsel 


at trial is considerably more complex in dealing with 


evidentiary matters and legal claims than the role in 


pre-trial interrogation.


QUESTION:  Actually, in -- in a situation 


like this, the whole outcome of the proceeding is 


determined by what happened in his home.


MR. DREEBEN:  Well, in this particular 


case, and this is my third and final point, if the

Court should determine that the waiver of rights is 


not a per se independent act that attenuates any 


taint, on any record the Court should not find that 


there is any taint that is unattenuated.  The 


violation at home, if there was any, was an extremely 


mild violation.  If the defendant let the cat out of 


the bag, it was really at most one paw, not an entire 


cat.


(Laughter.)


MR. DREEBEN:  The -- the defendant barely 


spoke at all about his activities relating to the 


charges that were identified in the indictment.  He 


said that he had business and personal problems and 


he was a methamphetamine user, and he rambled on for 


a while until the police cut him off.  At the station 


house, he was asked specifically person by person 


what his relationship was with the individual and 


what the activities were, and of course, he gave more 


elaborate information at that time, but -- and this 


is critical too.  It was not information that 


admitted the charges in the indictment.  This wasn't 


a case where a defendant said, well, I've confessed 


once, I might as well confess again now that I have 


my Miranda warning.  This was an individual who spoke 


about his problems at his home, then he gets down to

the station house and he's essentially talking about 


all the things that make him not liable, criminally 


liable under the indictment. 


It was an instance in which, I would 


submit, the motive for the defendant to talk was not 


that the cat was out of the bag, but that he was 


hoping to minimize any suggestion of guilt and 


persuade the officers that the indictment was not 


properly founded.


And finally, of course, the officers never 


exploited any prior statement and they did give him a 


thorough, complete administration of Miranda 


warnings, and under the circumstances of this case, 


even if the Court were to apply a taint analysis 


sometimes, or to assume that a taint analysis 


applies, the facts of this case demonstrate enough 


attenuation so that the jailhouse statements should 


be admitted, while the statements at home were 


suppressed.


QUESTION:  Are -- are you arguing that the 


fruits rule does not apply, or are you arguing that 


this is not the fruits?


MR. DREEBEN:  I am arguing that a fruits 


rule applies under the Sixth Amendment.  I'm 


conceding that by virtue of the Court's assumption in

Nix v. Williams and its holding in United States v. 


Wade.  But the case of a defendant's own voluntary 


statements should be treated as a special case under 


a fruits rule in which there is per se attenuation in 


the form of an independent act of free will that 


intervenes between the violation and the ensuing 


waiver.  And that comes about when the defendant 


receives full and complete information about his 


rights.  There is no suggestion of involuntariness in 


his waiver and he decides to speak.


The ultimate test in attenuation law is 


was there an independent act of free will when you're 


speaking of a confession that breaks the causal link 


to the prior illegality.  Here, we submit as a matter 


of law under Oregon v. Elstad's reasoning, there was.


Thank you.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. 


Dreeben.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the 


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
