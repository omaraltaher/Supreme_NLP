 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MR. FREDERICK:  Thank you, Mr. Chief 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

5

7
8
9
10
11
12  Act to ensure the safety of locomotives in use on 
13  railroad lines, not to regulate hazards to mechanics 
14  conducting repairs of locomotives.
15
16
17  do you make of the ICC in 1916, in the Tiller case, 
18  regulating the lights that railroads had to have, 
19  locomotives had to have in the yard, and that those 
lights had to differ when the railroad was in use? 
20
21
22  pursuant to the Safety Appliance Act, Justice Sotomayor, 
23  if I'm not -- if I'm not mistaken.  And the principle 
24  behind the safety in use regulation that this Court 
25

 The doctrine of implied --
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, what do you -- what 

construed in Napier was to ensure that locomotives were 

 MR. FREDERICK:  That was actually I think

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm not sure I 

understand.  It prescribed different lights when the --

1  safe for fit use on the line.  And that was the 
2  consistent construction both in the ICC's statement that 
3  it made in 1922 and in this Court's post-Napier --
4
5
6  when the locomotive was in the yard. 
 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes. 
7
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That had nothing to do 
8
9  with safety in use.  It had to do with safety in repair.
 MR. FREDERICK:  Our position is that it was 
10
11  not pursuant to the Locomotive Inspection Act that the 
12  ICC promulgated that rule.  As the Court has said in 
13  numerous cases, the ICC had rules in place with respect 
14  to different aspects of the train at different points in 
time, but the Locomotive Inspection Act was designed to 
15
16  address a very specific problem, which was boilers 
17  exploding on the line when the train was in operation. 
18  And that is the consistent way that the ICC, and 
19  subsequently the Federal Railroad Administration, has 
20
21
22  reasoning in the Ray case. 
23
24
25

 MR. FREDERICK:  I'm sorry. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Distinguish for me the 

difference in the Ray case, that had to do with 

construed the Act. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Distinguish for me our

 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, of course in Ray you 

 But what the Court was getting at in Ray was 

1  navigation and where we held that the agency, in 
2  ensuring safety in navigation, controlled design 
3  completely, whether in repair or not.  So, how do we --
4  why don't we apply the logic of Ray to this case?
5
6  addressed the Port and Tanker Safety Act, as well as the 
7  Port and Waterway Safety Act.  And in the United States 
8  v. Locke case, the Court subsequently looked at Ray in 
9  terms of design in a statute that also specifically 
included the word "repair and maintenance," which is 
10
11 
absent here. 
12
13  to ensure that States were not using their law to 
14  interfere with the design of equipment.  Of course, that 
15
16
17  here, which is --
18
19
20
21  interfering with what available components there are for 
22  locomotives. 
23
24  about that, Justice Sotomayor.  That's not actually 
correct.  The first is anything that the Court might 
25

 MR. FREDERICK:  No. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- once you regulate 
what -- what the design or use of asbestos is, you're 

was for --

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the argument 

 MR. FREDERICK:  If I could make two points

Official 

 MR. FREDERICK:  No.  My second argument is 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, you're giving up all 

fitness for service standard that this Court announced 
in Napier or that has consistently been applied.  The 
asbestos harms that the repair workers here faced are 
unique to the repair process, where they are scraping 
off the --

1  think about design does not impair our failure-to-
2  warrant claims, which entail no challenge to the design 
3  of a locomotive at all, only to the instructions for its 
4  safe use.  But to the --
5
6  of your other claims? 
7
8  that the design claim here involves repair work or 
9  problems uniquely; it does not include or intrude on the 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16 
17 
18 
19
20
21 
22
23  it also says on page 612 that the power delegated by 
24  Congress is to determine fitness for service.  So, the 
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but, counsel, 
looking at Napier, the power that Justice Brandeis said 
was conferred in that case was to specify the sort of 
equipment to be used on locomotives, right? 

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes, but on --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, this is 

equipment that was used in locomotives. 

 MR. FREDERICK:  Yes, but, Mr. Chief Justice, 

words about the --

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

 MR. FREDERICK:  No, it's not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It doesn't say 

they are outside the repair yard and are on the 
locomotive -- on the railroad line, are -- are safe to 
operate.  That standard in Napier had --

1
2  same -- that's the same thing, I'll give you that, 
3  fitness for service. 
4
5
6  something that's going to cause harm while it's actually 
7  being used. 
 MR. FREDERICK:  But, Mr. Chief Justice, the 
8
9  principle here is to ensure that the locomotives, when 
10
11 
12 
13
14  depend -- you want to know if this equipment is safe to 
15
16  going to be used.  If you have a --
17
18
19  that's going to be used, that's within the power that 
was confirmed.  It's not merely to inspect as, again, 
20
21  Justice Brandeis said. 
 MR. FREDERICK:  But the point here is that 
22
23  it is not to be broken down.  And the locomotive repair 
24  workers here face unique hazards in repairing 
25

 MR. FREDERICK:  Not to be broken down. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If you have a boiler 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why does it 

operate, right?  To be used, whether -- whether it's

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, but that's the 

locomotives whose safety standards are to ensure that

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, how do we know 

 MR. FREDERICK:  -- a unique hazard faced by 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, but if there's 

that --

1  they work properly on the railroad line, not when 
2  they're being taken apart and repaired.  That they --
3
4  argument isn't limited to being taken apart.  Your 
argument does depend on the fact that the asbestos 
5
6  doesn't come out during use; right? 
7
8  That's why this is --
9
10
11
12  the repair workers. 
13
14  an accident or something, does the asbestos come out 
15
16
 MR. FREDERICK:  If it did, it would be 
17  covered under the Locomotive Inspection Act safety 
18  standard, and that would be covered by Federal law. 
19
20
21  no longer in use.  I suppose that's what you'd say. 
22
23
24  that's what you'd say.
25

 MR. FREDERICK:  That's correct, and --
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's unrealistic, but 

during the use of the locomotive? 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you would say once 

there's an accident and the locomotive is disabled, it's

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess your 

 MR. FREDERICK:  No.  Well, it's governed by

used as a car anymore; and, therefore, the insurance 

predated the Locomotive Inspection Act, and it provided 
that when there was a crippled locomotive, the railroad 
did not face liability, civil penalties, to bring the 
crippled locomotive back to the yard, but it 
specifically said if a worker was injured during that 
process, the railroad would face liability. 

1  a different statute, which is found at 49 U.S.C. 303. 
2
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's the old 
3  insurance cases we've had, that, you know, when the car, 
4  you know, slams into a pole or something, it's not being 
5
6  doesn't cover it. 
7
8  answer to your previous question, Mr. Chief Justice, 
9  there's a specific statute on that point, and it 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16
17  Inspection Act's field should be construed narrowly 
18  because in 1970 Congress expressly and comprehensively 
19  legislated in the Federal Rail Safety Act and provided a 
conflict pre-emption regime in which if a State had a 
20
21  rule in place, that rule would be permitted to survive 
22  unless and until the Federal Rail Administration issued 
23  a regulation.  And there has never been a regulation on 
24  asbestos.

 Our point here is that the Locomotive

 And the argument is made in Napier that this 

Justice Brandeis did write it, and it's been the law a 

and, therefore, it's not pre-empted.  And the answer to 
that was not sickness and disease are an object of the 
statute, too.  The answer was the Federal and the State 
statutes are directed to the same subject, the equipment 
of locomotives; and, therefore, it is pre-empted.

1  think is the same thing that the Chief Justice 
2  mentioned, the particular language in Napier.  And 
3  whatever -- however this might come out today if Napier 
4  were decided again, it did come out the way it did.  And 
5
6  long time. 
7
8  particular State regulation is aimed at preventing 
9  sickness and disease, not at making locomotives safe, 
10
11 
12 
13 
14 
15
16  without overturning what seems to be that key sentence 
17  in Napier?  That is the problem that's bothering me. 
 MR. FREDERICK:  Well, first, I would urge 
18
19  you not to read Napier like a statute, although Justice 
20
21
22  the problem with (a) is that it's been followed and 
23  followed and followed and followed, and really read for 
24  all its worth, and so forth.  So -- so one question is, 
to what extent can I go back and revise that sentence? 
25

 Now, how could we come out in your favor 

Brandeis is obviously --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I see.  Okay.  That's a --

 MR. FREDERICK:  (B) is that he was 

reasonable way, not some far-out way -- but you win your 
case on this, and it does not affect the manufacturers' 
way of dealing with their equipment? 

1  That's (a).  Okay?  What's (b)? 
2
3  addressing himself to fitness for service standards on 
4  the line, the Wisconsin and Georgia statutes at issue 
there purporting to regulate what the locomotive could 
5
6  do while it was in operation on the line.  That's not 
7  what the claims in this case entail. 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Not -- now, is there any 
8
9  way that you could win your case -- reasonably, in a 
10
11 
12 
13
14
15
16  proposition that warning claims are valid negligence 
17  claims.  The warning claims are not -- do not affect the 
18  equipment, how it is made at all.  It's simply how do 
19  you use the equipment safely.
 Secondly, the design claims here go to the 
20
21  unique hazards faced by repair workers.  You could use 
22  asbestos, under our theory of the case, on the 
23  locomotive in exactly the same way that the locomotive 
24  equipment manufacturers have done, so long as there's a 
safer way to take the asbestos off the locomotive in the

17  the design of a locomotive.  There are, and there is 
18  evidence that there are, safer and were safer ways -- I 
19  remind you that asbestos isn't used on locomotives 
anymore, so this is part of an historical debate here --
20
21  but in ways that could be removed that would not create 
22  the cloud dust.  That's the essence of the design defect 
23  claim.  And the LIA and the FRA do not regulate in the 
24  repair shop.  So, there's a complete gap here in

 MR. FREDERICK:  Both.  The dust cloud is

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the Secretary cannot do

3  to issue a regulation saying railroads should no longer 
4  use these asbestos-containing brakes because of the

6  could not do that under the statute? 
7
8  absolutely can do that under the Federal Rail Safety 
9  Act, which, again, empowers the Secretary.
10
11  that under LIA?  Is that the idea? 
12
 MR. FREDERICK:  It -- it very well could 
13  because it's a fitness for service standard.  But it 
14  always -- and if you look at its regulations, in parts 
229 and part 230 of 49 C.F.R., it always issues these 
15
16  regulations under both authorities because the FRSA 
17  expanded it. 
18
19  lost.  If the Secretary can issue such a regulation 
20
21  regulation, and then isn't it also in the scope of 
22  what's pre-empted? 
23
24  the B&O Railroad case in the early 1930s -- there was 
another Justice Brandeis opinion -- in which it would

1  have to make a finding that to make that regulation that 
2  you posit, Justice Kagan, was necessary to avoid 
3  unnecessary peril to life or limb.  In that case, the 
4  Court struck down the ICC's attempt to issue a

17  conflict pre-emption to displace any State rule, but 
18  what they are seeking to do is to take the doctrine of 
19  implied field pre-emption, gain immunity from State law 
liability, and not be subject to any Federal rules.  And 
20
21  it's that proposition that is an extraordinary 
22  proposition of implied field pre-emption.  We found no

 Now, Respondent would have the Court expand 

the only issue properly presented in this case is

3  separate out the field pre-emption issues from the

5
6  whether Petitioners' tort claims fall within the field 
7  pre-empted by the LIA, and our view is that they do not 
8  because they arise from injuries that occurred when the 
9  locomotive was not in use.
10
11  the field that's pre-empted by the LIA to include any 
12  claim that has anything to do with locomotive equipment, 
13  regardless of whether the equipment or the locomotive 
14  was in use at the time injury occurred.

17  the purposes of the legislation, which everybody

requirements that go to the design, construction, or

would be conflict pre-empted.

 And so, what that means is if -- if the 

 MS. HARRINGTON:  No, I'm sorry.  And let me 
clarify.  I appreciate the opportunity to clarify.  In 

1  which says your engine is safe if you do this.  And 
2  you're telling me the manufacturer can no longer assume 
3  that. 
4
5
6  our view, what the conflict is, is not a conflict with a 
7  Federal rule saying you have to use this piece of 
8  equipment and you can't use that piece of equipment. 
9  The conflict is with one of the purposes of the LIA, 
10
11  regulator of equipment that will be used on a 
12  locomotive. 
13
14  Federal Government hasn't spoken as to whether piece of 
equipment A can be used on a locomotive, that means that 
15
16  it can be, that the manufacturers know that it's okay. 
17  And if you have a State rule that would have the effect 
18  of dictating the equipment that can be used on a 
19  locomotive, that would conflict with the single 
20
21
22  then?  How do you do it?  How do you -- how do you --
23  what is it you're thinking of that the manufacturer's 
24  going to have to do in respect to his locomotive in 
25

order to comply with the State law about warning that is 

regulator objective of the LIA. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So, what's the difference 

19

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, I think it depends on 

1  not going to mean that he changes the locomotive when it 
2  runs on the railroad? 
3
4  what the warning claim is.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, give me an example. 
5
6
 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, under the -- under 
7  the Respondents' -- under the Respondents' view of the 
8  field that's pre-empted, a State could not regulate the 
9  disposal of equipment that's removed from a locomotive 
10
11
12  do with this case, the removal, never further -- no 
13  further use of a bit of a locomotive? 
14
15
16 
17
 MS. HARRINGTON:  Also, in Respondents' view 
18  a State could not regulate workplace hazards, such as by 
19  requiring that workers wear goggles or masks.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, I didn't know anybody 
20
21  denied that, that the State could regulate the repair 
22  shop, indeed require what warnings they wish, indeed 
23  require what equipment workers have to have.  I thought 
24  we're only talking about those rules of State law that 
would affect what the manufacturer has to put by way of 
25

 MS. HARRINGTON:  No.  But also --

outer space.  This isn't reality.  So --

1  design in his locomotive. 
2
3
4  trouble thinking of one that would only affect repair 
shops and repairs, but -- maybe there's some kind of 
5
6  equipment that you could stick on the front of it, and 
7  it is a hook or something -- and it holds something, and 
8  before it goes back on the line, you take it off and put 
9  it in a locker.  And -- but, you know, the more I 
10
11 
12
 MS. HARRINGTON:  No.  I think you could --
13  I'm sorry.  I think you could imagine a world where a 
14  State says when a locomotive comes into a repair shop, 
the railroad or the repair shop has to attach a certain 
15
16  kind of clamp on the wheels, a certain kind of brake, 
17  that makes sure that the locomotive won't move while 
18  it's in the repair shop.  And when you're done repairing 
19  the locomotive, you take them off, and the locomotive 
20
21
22  have more than theoretical value in this case? 
 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, I think in this case 
23
24  the claims that we say would not be conflict pre-empted 
25

goes back --

 JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, does that 

or within the field are claims -- are the

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If the manufacturer is 

that the manufacturer tell the purchaser of the products 
to pass the warning along, to post warnings in a repair 
shop.  You know, there --

1  failure-to-warn claims.  Now, how a manufacturer 
2  actually issues the warning that would be required I 
3  think is a question that could be worked out as the case 
4  proceeds.
5
6  really not controlling the repair shop, of what value is 
7  this failure-to-warn claim? 
 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, again, I think it 
8
9  depends how the warning is issued.  You could require 
10
11 
12 
13
14  control whether they do or don't.
15

21  question.  And --
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, on that question, Ms. 
22
23  Harrington, I'm still confused about the scope of your 
24  regulatory authority and whether you think you have the 
capacity to issue rules that are meant to protect repair 
25

 Again, in our view, the only question 

squarely presented in this case is the field pre-emption 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How -- they can't

kind of reverse gear instead of a different kind of 
reverse gear. 

1  workers on railway equipment.  So, can you issue a rule 
2  under the LIA that says no asbestos-containing brakes 
3  because we're afraid that these brakes injure the -- the 
4  guys in the roundhouse.
5
6  standard of care under the LIA only goes to whether a 
7  locomotive is safe for use, and that is also the limit 
8  of the FRA's regulatory authority.  This Court, in the 
9  United States v. B&O, addressed that issue.  The ICC at 
10
11 
12 
13
14  self-abnegation by the Federal Government, that "safe 
for use" does not include safe for use when it's being 
15
16  repaired. 
17
18  safe for use on -- safe for use on the line.  It's safe 
19  for use on lines of interstate commerce.
 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But this does seem a very 
20
21  limiting construction.  Napier seems to have a broader 
22  construction, and if I read some of your history right, 
23  you've taken a broader understanding of your regulatory 
24  authority in the past.  So, why this narrow view?
25

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Because the statute says 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, what -- what

 MS. HARRINGTON:  No.  The LIA -- the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but if you're 

-- any broad statements that were made in Napier and 

1  broader view of our regulatory authority under the LIA. 
2  In Napier, again, what's important to remember is that 
3  the State statutes at issue applied only to locomotives 
4  that were in use.  And so, I think it's hard to take any 
5
6  read them as applying outside that context.

19  broken that you could fix while it's in use would not 
20
21  a violation of the statute to use it while --
22
23  been talking about between the repair shop and the 
24  locomotive on the tracks, that's not really the line at 
25

fix while it's under way, right?  We're not always 
talking about brakes.  So, let's suppose there's one of 
those things.  You get to the shop and the guy says: 
Boy, you got to fix this.  And they said:  Well, the 
train's leaving, and we're going to go in 10 hours.  And 
he says:  Okay, I can fix it during the -- while it's in

 MS. HARRINGTON:  Well, if it's -- if the 
fact that it's broken makes the locomotive unsafe to 

1
2  not in use.  And that tends to match --
3
4  then what's the answer to my question?  This is 
something you can fix in either place.  It's covered 
5
6  while it's -- if you fix it while the train is under 
7  way, but it's not covered if you wait until it's in the 
8  shop? 
9
10
11  use, then the railroad cannot use it, cannot repair it 
12  while it's in use. 
13
14  whether it's in use or in the shop.  It's whether it is 
15
16  whether it's --
17
 MS. HARRINGTON:  That's right.  But here the 
18  injuries occur when the locomotive is not in use because 
19  it's in the repair shop.  And in those situations, the 
LIA's substantive heightened duty of care doesn't even 
20
21  apply.  And so, it doesn't make sense to think of those 
22  claims as being within the field that's pre-empted by 
23  the LIA because they're not governed by the LIA.  Now, 
24  those claims might bump up against the LIA in a 
25

something that affects whether the locomotive can go, 

different way by conflicting again with the --

7  any practical significance at all in this case, because 
8  I thought you agreed that the design defect claim would 
9  be barred?
10
11  might be barred.  I think, you know, this case comes to 
12  the Court without any real development of the 
13  plaintiffs' claim.  All we have is what they stated in 
14  their complaint.  Their complaint incorporates a master 
complaint which applies to all sorts of different kinds 
15
16  of plaintiffs.  And so, I think it's really hard to 
17  understand exactly what their claims are, what the 
18  effect of their claims would be with respect to the 
19  design defect claims.  And so, in our view, they would 
-- the design defect claims would be pre-empted if they 
20
21  would have the effect of dictating the character of 
22  equipment that could be on a locomotive while it was in 
23  use.

those brakes pose to the repairmen. 

 MR. HACKER:  I -- frankly, I would have 

not safe to operate if it can't be safely repaired. 
Because there's no point in having a locomotive ready to 
go on the line if it -- as soon as it comes off the line 
with a problem it's going to injure those who work with 
it.  But we don't need to assert that position to defend 
the proposition we have now --

1  whether you agree or disagree with the Government's 
2  point that the agency cannot, under the LIA, issue the 
3  kind of rule that I suggested just, you know, saying no 
4  asbestos-containing brakes because of the danger that 
5

20

22  because we're no longer in the field? 
 MR. HACKER:  Because the field is not --

1  locomotive itself.  What States cannot do -- what DOT
 
2  has exclusive authority over is the design, the
 
3  materials, and the construction of the locomotive.
 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But only the design,
 
4
5
6  concession, it's only those aspects of design, 
7  materials, and construction that pertain to use.  And if 
8  you take the position that use includes only use on the 
9  line and not use when it's being repaired in the repair 
10
11
 MR. HACKER:  I think we're not, Your Honor, 
12  because the design doesn't change between the line and 
13  the repair shop.  And that's the key.  If a State comes 
14  in and says --
15
16
17
18  word "design"; I'm talking about "design for use." 
19
20
21  locomotives are safe for use on the line.  But in order 
22  to accomplish that objective, the power they have is 
23  plenary over the design itself.  They -- only one entity

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Why would their law be

21  pre-empted, a State law that says since the railroad 
22  knows that asbestos is dangerous when revealed and since 
23  it would be revealed in a repair shop, the railroad has 
24  to provide the repair shops with appropriate worker 
safety equipment; or alternatively, and lesser, the

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 Now, in respect to that, which I'll lump 

 MR. HACKER:  I would say two points, Your 

1  railroad has to provide for the repair shop's documents 
2  to be given to the workers which explain the risks and 
3  how they can overcome them. 
4
under various kinds of failure-to-warn claims, how does 
5
6  the Act pre-empt those?  It doesn't affect design of the 
7  railroad, nor does it affect the use.  Neither. 
8
9  Honor.  First of all, it does affect the design because 
a way to comply with that regulation is to use something 
10
11 
other than asbestos, to change the design.  It's the 
State saying, because you're using this design, you can 
12 
13 
only use it lawfully in this State if you do the 
following two or three things.
14 
15
16  not the nature of the notice claim.  The design is 
17  whatever it is.  But the manufacturer has to issue 
18  warnings so that the worker can protect himself against 
19  that hazard.  So, I thought that the defective design --
yes, I understand your argument.  You would have one 
20
21  standard for on the line and another when it's in the 
22  repair shop.  But this is not telling them to change the 
23  design in any respect.  It just says:  Asbestos -- you 
24  could take these measures to protect yourself.
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that that was 

 MR. HACKER:  At common law, a design -- a 

31
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 The LIA and the FRSA and SCAA and OSHA all 

to ensure the safety of workers.  We are not, to be 
absolutely clear -- Ms. Harrington was incorrect when 
she said:  We don't believe that repair shop -- States 
have the power to impose workplace conditions to protect 
employee safety in the repair shop.  They do.

1  failure-to-warn claim was a type of design defect claim. 
2  It was a way of saying you can't use that design 
3  lawfully unless you have the following type of warning. 
4  If you -- you can't assume away the design aspect of it 
because it still turns on -- it's a State conditioning 
5
6  the design. 
7
8  together solved this problem by -- and FELA, solved this 
9  problem by saying it is the repair shop's responsibility 
10
11 
12

14 
 JUSTICE BREYER:  But -- no, no, no.  That 
15
16  argument would prevent States doing what they can do 
17  lawfully, which is to regulate the repair shop because 
18  with any given repair, with many of them, you could say, 
19  well, we wouldn't have to -- we can just change the 
20
21  so that the workers who are repairing it get adequate 
22  sleep.  I mean, that isn't an answer to the argument 
23  that it doesn't affect design to say, well, they could 
24  comply with it by changing design, I don't think.

 MR. HACKER:  Well, what we would say is that 

32
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What would apply to the 

repair shop would also apply to the locomotive in use, 

working.  But what they can't do is tell manufacturers 

1  generally applicable laws that govern the repair shop --
2  States have authority -- to the extent not pre-empted by 
3  OSHA, States have authority to require workplace 
4  conditions and to require employers to protect employees 
5
6  here's the conditions under which you can use this 
7  design, sell this design, distribute the design and 
8  these materials lawfully within the State --
9
10
11  I suppose, and it would be of little comfort to the 
12  manufacturer that although the engine he has 
13  manufactured has been certified as safe for use by the 
14  Secretary, he is liable unless he warns the engineer: 
15
16  to give you warning. 
17
 I mean, I cannot imagine that that's what --
18  that that's what the statute means as applied, at least 
19  to the use of the engine on the -- on the tracks.
 MR. HACKER:  Well, we agree with that, but 
20
21  we also think it applies with respect to manufacturers' 
22  liability in the repair shop for the reason I said 
23  earlier.  The locomotive doesn't change.  So, when it's 
24  certified as safe for use on line, it can't be -- and 
the locomotive manufacturer knows everything they know 
25

Oh, it isn't safe for use in these circumstances; I have 

33
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

JUSTICE BREYER:  No, what they're saying 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What they're saying is 

 MR. HACKER:  -- because this will make it 

1  by looking at DOT regulations.  It can't be that a State 
2  can come along and say:  No, no, you can't use any of 
3  that design; you have to use this completely different 
4  one --
5
6  is --
7
8  safe in the repair shop. 
9
because when you open up the box, something no one does 
10
11  on line, you will expose yourself to risk, and what we 
12  are saying is, therefore, you must post a notice that 
13  tells workers about those risks.  And, indeed, if there 
14  is a conflict, conflict pre-emption will take care of 
it.  But why should that kind of thing fall within the 
15
16  scope of field pre-emption even under Napier, which, of 
17  course, referred to equipment while this rule doesn't? 
18  It refers to a sign.  You're not going to change the 
19  equipment.
20
21  earlier, Your Honor, which is, you don't know in 
22  advance.  If you say, in theory, a State can adopt a 
23  warning requirement specific to a design otherwise 
24  approved by the DOT, you don't know in advance whether 
the warning requirements -- the manufacturers will be

 MR. HACKER:  -- as to what designs are 

1  able to easily comply with all 50 different types of 
2  warning requirements and whether or not the warning 
3  requirements -- some will be so stringent that it will 
4  be easier to simply adopt a different design.  The point 
of the LIA is to take that kind of decisionmaking out of 
5
6  the State's hands and put it into a Federal authority 
7  which can make the relevant and appropriate decisions --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let me ask this question: 

 MR. HACKER:  We don't have a problem with 

1
2  Is it your position that the -- that the engine is as 
3  much in use when it's in the shop as when it's running 
4  on the track?  Is that your position?
5
6  that position.  We don't have -- we don't have a --
7  because we don't believe you have to establish that it's 
8  in use in the repair shop to establish that the 
9  pre-emption described by Justice Brandeis in Napier 
controls, because the pre-emption he was describing 
10
11 
was -- the regulatory authority was over the equipment 
itself which is the same exact equipment.  A railroad --
12 
13 
a locomotive designed a particular way doesn't change 
when it enters the repair shop; so, it's designed to be 
14 
fit for service. 
15
16
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the reason it seems 
17  to me somewhat important is that I can't conceive of 50 
18  different State regulations for the kind of gloves and 
19  things that the engineer has to wear on -- when he's 
running the train on the track.  And if that's so, it 
20
21  seems to me it would help you to say that the shop was 
22  the same, but you seem to say the shop was different. 
 MR. HACKER:  Well, I only mean to say that 
23

different because it's not -- the LIA pre-emption -- LIA

themselves what a better or more preferable or -- a 

1  regulation isn't about repairing.  The DOT may well have 
2  authority -- they seem to think not -- over repairs 
3  under the LIA, but what the LIA is about is the design 
4  and the materials themselves.  And States can't say for 
5
6  locomotive design is for any other reason.  The 
7  Respondents' brief and reply brief on page 5 makes an 
8  interesting point.  They think they've proved their case 
9  when they say the LIA doesn't for example permit the DOT 
to impose a U.S. steel requirement, a domestic content 
10
11  requirement, on locomotives.  The implication would be, 
12  of course, that a State could because it's outside the 
13  field as Petitioners define it, that a State could say 
14  locomotives can only be used within our State if they're 
15
16
17  It can't possibly be right, and the reason it's not 
18  right is that it misunderstands pre-emption under the 
19  LIA as described by Napier.  Of course, it's within the 
20
21  locomotive should be made with U.S. steel, but that 
22  authority can be abused.  It might be arbitrary and 
23  capricious; it's not permissible for them to do that. 
24  But the content of locomotives is exclusively within the 
25

jurisdiction of the DOT, and States can't decide for

use asbestos, then you have to warn.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Hacker, do you think we 
would decide Napier the same way if it came to us today? 
 MR. HACKER:  I do think so, Your Honor.  Of 

1  itself. 
2
 What we would say is the State has to take 
3  the locomotive equipment as a given.  It is what it is. 
4  And then if that locomotive equipment creates risks for 
workers, the employer may have to do things to account 
5
6  for those risks, but the equipment can't be regulated by 
7  the State.  The equipment itself can't be regulated by 
8  the State in any respect. 
9
10
11
12  course, I don't think that matters because Napier is 
13  what it is and has been relied upon for 85 years.  But I 
14  think there would be a very good argument that it would 
be decided the same way today under the Ray case that 
15
16  Justice Sotomayor mentioned.  That was a very similar 
17  kind of delegation of regulatory authority, and the 
18  Court held that there was the same kind of field 
19  pre-emption.  There are some differences one could 
20

 If The Court has no further questions, I'll 

discuss, but Napier is what it is, as I say.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DAVID C. FREDERICK 

43
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

 MR. FREDERICK:  Manufacturers clearly have 

going to be exposed to risks. 

 With respect to the point about being on the 

1
2
3  the best information about the dangerous aspects of 
4  their products, and they issue warnings and instructions 
in manuals and provide all kinds of information so that 
5
6  persons working on their equipment are going to know the 
7  special hazards.  It doesn't make sense to inoculate 
8  those manufacturers from liability where they have the 
9  best information to ensure that repair workers are not 
10
11
12  line, the whole idea behind the Locomotive Inspection 
13  Act was not just for use, Justice Kennedy, but also safe 
14  to operate on the railroad line.  Under the 
15
16  limits are drawn outside the bowl where switching 
17  operations and repair operations occur, so that 
18  everybody knows where the Federal LIA standard applies 
19  and where it doesn't.
20
21  of history with respect to repair work goes to the 
22  history of -- behind this Court's recognition of the 
23  commerce power.  Up until the New Deal era, it was well 
24  settled that Congress could not legislate on intrastate 
activities, which are peculiar to repair yards.  And so, 
25

regulations -- and this is well established -- yard 

 And the reason why the LIA has had this kind 

44
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

 So, if you look at this case from an 

historical perspective, Justice Kagan, it's not clear 

1  this Court when it decided the Shanks case in the mid 
2  1910s held that a railroad worker could not bring an 
3  FELA claim because his work was not in interstate 
4  commerce; it was only in intrastate commerce.  And that 
is why the ICC throughout this entire period never 
5
6  devoted regulations to repair yards, because this 
7  Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence precluded Federal 
8  regulatory activity for that. 
9
10
11  that the full parameters of the way the Court would 
12  explain Napier would be the same, because its approach 
13  to field pre-emption is so different after the New Deal 
14  era than it was before the New Deal era.  And that is 
15
16  implications of common law claims, it has had no problem 
17  allowing State law to have design defect claims with 
18  respect to planes, cars, motorboats, and trucks, even 
19  though the implications of a State law claim might find 
liability for the insufficiency of the design imposing 
20
21  an unreasonable risk to the person who is exposed to 
22  that risk with respect to that interstate modality. 
 There's no reason why you have to have a 
23
24  broad and expansive view of the field here because 
25

Congress subsequently has enacted in this very area to 

also why when this Court looks at regulatory

3  Government says --
4
5
6  years, and if it wants to pull back on the pre-emptive 
7  effect of the provisions interpreted in Napier, it's 
8  free to do that, too.
