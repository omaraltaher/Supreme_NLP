 The issue before the Court today and the 

only question litigated to decision in the courts below 

is whether a prisoner's claim that seeks only access to 

evidence for DNA testing may be brought in Federal court 

under the Civil Rights Act.

 The Fifth Circuit summarily answered that 

question "no," adhering to its long-standing view that 

any Federal claim that might conceivably set the stage 

for a subsequent collateral attack, however removed in 

time, must itself be brought via habeas.  That rule so 

clearly cannot be squared with the decisions of this 

Court, especially since Wilkinson v. Dotson, that the 

Court should reverse and remand. 

 I'd like to begin by describing the contours 

24 

of the Heck rule, and -­

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I ask you about -­

Wilkinson was a parole, parole eligibility, so it didn't 

touch the conviction or the sentence, where this one 

does.  So the cases are distinguishable on that basis. 

 MR. OWEN:  I -- Justice Ginsburg, the reason 

that we argue our case does not touch the conviction is 

that the relief that we are seeking, to have access to 

the evidence for testing, if we won, if we win in 

district court and we get that access, it does not 

necessarily imply -- which is the language this Court 

10

used in Heck and repeated in Dotson -- that the 

11 

conviction is lawfully invalid.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I understand that 

argument, but there is the distinction of the type of 

case of where the -- the one, conviction and sentence 

were never going to be questioned, only parole 

eligibility; where here, the discovery that you seek in 

1983 is not a destination.  The destination is to 

further litigation that may or may not arise. 

 MR. OWEN:  That's true, Your Honor.  We -­

we don't see that as a distinction that compels the 

conclusion that Dotson isn't the model to follow, 

because in our view, what Dotson said -- again, the 

prisoners, as Justice Ginsburg says, were before the 

court seeking a declaration about parole procedures that 

Ohio planned to use in their cases.  Those parole

procedures had been adopted after those prisoners were 

sent to prison, and they complained that was an ex post 

facto violation. 

 And Ohio argued, both in the Sixth Circuit 

and in this Court, that the fact that these prisoners 

expected at some point to come back to court armed with 

a judgment in their favor and seek a reduction in their 

sentences was enough to conclude that the case should be 

within the core of habeas.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It does seem odd, 

though -- and I don't want to jump into your argument 

too much, because you have got planned out what you want 

to tell us.  It does seem odd that if your suit for DNA 

testing is not attack -- an attack on the sentence, that 

you asked for a stay. 

 I mean, if it's not an attack on the 

sentence, why shouldn't that factor into our decision 

not to grant a stay or to grant a stay?  It's -- it's an 

irony in your position.

 MR. OWEN:  I think it's an irony -- I -- I 

accept the Court's point that that -- that that seems 

unusual, but I think that the reason that the Court's 

cases, at least as to the relief that we're seeking and 

not the stay that the Court entered in order to hear 

this case and decide the question, that the relief we 

5
 

Alderson Reporting Company

3

are seeking does not necessarily imply the legal 

invalidity of the conviction. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, we don't grant a 

4 

stay in order to decide a question.  We grant a stay 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13

because there's a likelihood of success on the merits. 

And that goes to the sentence.  And now you're telling 

us that your attack doesn't go on the sentence.  I don't 

see why we don't just lift the stay, under your own view 

of the case.

 MR. OWEN:  No, Your Honor.  I think -- if 

I -- if I was understood to say that, then I -- let me 

clarify. 

 I think that our success -- when the Court 

14 

applies the stay standard, it asks the question:  What 

15

16 

17 

18

is the likelihood of success on the merits?  Success on 

the merits, for purposes of our lawsuit, means getting 

access to the evidence.  That's -- that's what it means. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If that's all it means, we 

19 

shouldn't have granted a stay.

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. OWEN:  I don't -- I don't think so, Your 

Honor, because I think once we had demonstrated that we 

were likely to prevail on the merits of the case, I 

think the Court was within, you know, appropriate 

judgment to -- to make sure that the case didn't become 

moot by Mr. Skinner's execution, because I do think that

the demonstration that we had to make was not about 

whether his ultimate -- or whether, ultimately, he might 

get relief from his conviction, but whether we had a 

chance of prevailing on this civil rights claim that 

asks for access to the evidence. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But that disconnects 

the irreparable harm alleged with respect to the stay 

and your claim that you now say -- you say now your 

claim is not going to necessarily affect the -- the 

sentence.  The irreparable harm, if I remember, is quite 

obviously the execution.  But it's -- there is no 

irreparable harm from your failure to get access to the 

DNA evidence, unless it's linked to the sentence. 

 MR. OWEN:  Your Honor, I -- I guess I don't 

have a better answer than the one I gave 

Justice Kennedy, and that is that I think that the stay 

standard doesn't have to link those two things.  I think 

that if the Court finds that Mr. Skinner is going to die 

before he can litigate his claim and it finds he has a 

reasonable chance of prevailing on that claim, that's 

21 

sufficient to -- to enter the stay. 

22

25

 JUSTICE ALITO:  In the real world, a 

prisoner who wants access to DNA evidence is interested 

in overturning his conviction.

 MR. OWEN:  Absolutely.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you deny that?

5

6 

7 

8

10

11

of the absurdities that pursuing the 1983 path produces? 

Because habeas is not subject to claim preclusion, is 

it? 

 MR. OWEN:  No. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  It's not subject to 

Rooker-Feldman? 

 MR. OWEN:  No, it's not subject to those, 

12 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  But since you've squeezed

issues. 

 MR. OWEN:  I think that the -- the 

reason that -- I think the reason the Rooker-Feldman 

issue has arisen at this juncture in the case is that 

the pleadings in the district court were not permitted 

to -- because of the sort of -- the fact that we were 

dismissed at a very early stage in the process, 

essentially on the threshold of the case, there was no 

opportunity to develop in full what the legal arguments 

are for both sides.  I -­

the yellow brief, where you did have time to explain 

your doctrine, you say a Federal constitutional issue 

arose only because the Court of Criminal Appeals' 

decision regarding the State law issue turned out to be 

so arbitrary and unreasonable as to denying 

6 

Mr. Skinner's Federal due process rights.

 MR. OWEN:  No, I think, Your Honor, that -­

I -- I don't agree about the Court's reading of 

Rooker-Feldman if you think that -- if the Court 

believes that that would preclude it.  And the reason is 

this:  In the Feldman case itself, the -- the plaintiffs 

in that case, who were unsuccessful lawyers who are, 

what, a law school graduate and an attorney who was 

barred outside the District of Columbia, and were trying 

to get a waiver for a requirement for taking the bar 

here in the District of Columbia -- they filed a number 

of claims against the application of that rule by the 

District of Columbia Court of Appeals in their 

circumstances. 

 But -- and this Court said those claims 

can't proceed.  Those claims challenge the application

 But this Court went on to say in Feldman -­

the last paragraph of the opinion says they have also 

raised other claims, and those claims are that this 

rule, as authoritatively construed by the District of 

Columbia Court of Appeals, is -- is unconstitutional. 

It violates the Constitution.  And the Court said, in 

Feldman, those claims may proceed.  And -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Owen, as I -- as I 

read -- I'm sorry. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  What's the 

rule that's arbitrary and capricious that you're 

challenging? 

 MR. OWEN:  Your Honor, the rule that we are 

challenging is that when the Court of Criminal Appeals 

construed the fault provision of the Texas DNA testing 

statute in our case, it created a wholesale 

classification that said everybody who falls into 

Mr. Skinner's situation who did not ask for testing at 

trial is forever foreclosed from getting testing.  And

-­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me how 

that's different than what Alaska did in the Osborne 

case that we upheld; their procedure?  I thought that 

was one of the elements of the Alaska rule as well. 

10
 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. OWEN:  I think -- I'm sorry. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That if you had an 

opportunity to ask for it and gave it up, that you lost. 

So how are we getting to that here?  And how are you 

going to get past Osborne here? 

 MR. OWEN:  I think in Texas we have -- the 

difference, I think, Your Honor, is the difference 

between a substantive due process claim, as I understand 

it, and a procedural due process claim.  That in Osborne 

1

the claim that was being made was that the State was

denying a Federal right in denying access on that basis. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

 Our argument is that the Texas -- the Texas 

statute was enacted to grant, essentially, protection to 

a class of inmates who were -- inmates who were 

wrongfully convicted and can prove that with DNA 

evidence -- and then -- and then interprets that statute 

in a way that needlessly chops a bunch of those inmates 

out, and that that's arbitrary, at least to the extent 

that it doesn't have reference to the specific facts of 

the case, the likelihood of innocence, the reasons for 

21 

not doing the testing, and so on. 

22

23 

24 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Osborne expressly 

considered both procedural due process and substantive 

due process.

 MR. OWEN:  But the reason, Your Honor, as 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

I -- as I read Osborne, that it did not reach a 

decision on the procedure, or it didn't -- that it 

rejected Osborne's procedural due process claim was 

because he hadn't tried at State court.

 I mean, that was the premise of Osborne, 

was he was -- I think the Court's language in Osborne 

was if he hasn't tried those procedures, he's in no 

position to complain about them in Federal court, 

whereas we did try the procedures, and it's precisely 

that that is the basis for our claim in Federal court. 

 If I -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you -­

 MR. OWEN:  I'm sorry. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you -- one of the 

criticisms by your adversary of your proposal to bring 

these actions via 1983 is a prospect that the courts 

will be used to collaterally attack convictions by all 

sorts of due process allegations concerning discovery 

disputes.  Could you address that point, and why either 

you agree with them that that's what is going to happen,

or if you don't, why not? 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. OWEN:  I don't agree with them, Your 

Honor, and for a couple of reasons.  First of all is 

that experience doesn't suggest that.  The rule that we 

are asking the Court to adopt for the whole nation has 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5

been the rule for some time in six different circuits, 

and there's no evidence that in those circuits there 

have been a very large number of prisoners going into 

court under section 1983 and trying to leverage 

discovery under the circumstances that are suggested by 

6 

Respondent's brief.  So that's the practical reason.

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 As a legal -- as a legal reason, I think 

that our claim turns on the existence of the liberty 

interest in the State statute for DNA testing that Texas 

has created, and that there is no statute in Texas for 

other kinds of general discovery; for example, access to 

the prosecutor's file, police reports, or other kinds of 

documents.  That's not -- there's no legal hook for 

that.

 Our legal hook is the existence of that DNA 

testing statute and the existence under State law of 

opportunities to bring claims of actual innocence after 

the evidence is tested. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The critical 

formulation in Heck, "necessarily implies," is a little 

difficult.  I mean, the adverb points one way and the 

verb points the other.  And how -- "necessarily implies" 

strikes me as a little less conclusive than you seem to 

think.

 MR. OWEN:  I think -- I think if that word 

13
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

5

6 

7 

8

10

were in isolation, Your Honor, there might be more 

uncertainty about what "implies" means.  But if the 

Court looks at the cases -- looks at Preiser, looks at 

Heck, looks at Edwards, looks at Nelson, looks at Hill 

-- what you'll see is the word "necessarily" is in all 

those cases.  And, in fact, in Hill, I think -- or maybe 

it was Nelson; one of the two Florida cases -- the Court 

italicizes it twice in the same paragraph.  And -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you -- you 

read "necessarily implies" to mean "conclusively 

11 

establishes," right? 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21

 MR. OWEN:  Not that strong, Your Honor.  But 

to finish, the other answer I was going to say is that 

in other cases -- I was going to say, "necessarily" is 

everywhere.  "Necessarily" is in all the cases.  But the 

Court also -- "implies" is not in all the cases.  In 

Dotson, for example, the Court uses the word 

"demonstrate" -- "necessarily demonstrates" -- that the 

judgment underlying the custody is invalid.

 So I think that there is some -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you are asking 

22 

for an expansion of Heck from "necessarily implies" -­

23

24

25

 MR. OWEN:  No, I think we are -- I think -­

"demonstrates"?

 MR. OWEN:  No, Your Honor.  I think that -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if "implies" 

doesn't mean the same as "establish" or "demonstrates," 

give me an example of a case where the 1983 claim would 

not establish innocence but would still be covered by 

6 

Heck.

 MR. OWEN:  I think that -- I think Edwards 

is an example of that, Your Honor, where -- in Edwards, 

the defendant, the prisoner, was suing in Federal court, 

alleging that, in his words, the procedures that were 

used to deny him -- I think it was deny him parole or 

convict him of disciplinary offenses, but the procedures 

that had resulted in the disadvantage he was complaining 

about were unconstitutional.

 But when you looked at his complaint, what 

he said was this -- the reason those procedures are 

unconstitutional is because the decision maker was 

personally biased against me, which is less a complaint 

about the procedures and more a complaint about the 

merits of that adjudication.  And if you believe it, if 

you credit that, and say, okay, we're going to win, 

fine, that's what happened, the adjudication was biased 

against you, that necessarily implies the invalidity of 

the judgment reached by that procedure.

I think there's no harmlessness test there.  But I think 

that -- at least in an adjudication, there wouldn't be. 

But I think that "necessarily implies" is all that the 

Court needs to continue embracing in order to find 

that -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What would you do with 

the Brady violation?  Is that a "necessarily implies" or 

11 

is that more akin to your claim?

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. OWEN:  For a couple of reasons, Your 

Honor, it's not akin to our claim.  First is this: 

Brady is a trial right.  And I don't mean necessarily 

that it arises at trial, because sometimes it arises 

at -- the discovery that makes a Brady claim colorable, 

you know, arises after trial.  But Brady is a right to 

have certain evidence when you go to trial so that you 

can use it in an attempt to get the jury to find you not 

guilty. 

 And, therefore, if that right is violated, 

if you don't get that evidence and it's discovered later 

that you were denied this stuff that you needed to have 

a fair trial, that implies the invalidity of the trial 

judgment, the judgment that results in the custody.

13

 In our case, the judgment that we are 

challenging is the judgment of the Court of Criminal 

Appeals denying us DNA testing, which does not in the 

same way demonstrate or necessarily imply that the 

custody judgment in our case is legally invalid. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Owen, could I take you 

back to Rooker-Feldman with that as the premise?  You 

said that what you are attacking is the judgment.  I 

read your complaint as having an important strand where 

you were not attacking the judicial judgment, but 

instead were attacking actions of the prosecutor's 

office, independent of any judgment of the State courts. 

 Are you abandoning that part of your 

14 

complaint, or are you continuing to maintain it? 

15

16 

17 

18

Because certainly, if you talk about the judgment alone, 

it at least gets you into Rooker-Feldman territory, 

whereas if you talk about the prosecutor, it does not. 

 MR. OWEN:  I think, Your Honor, that we -­

19 

that we are in the territory of talking about the 

20

21 

22 

23

judgment.  And I think for the reasons I've described 

earlier that that does not lead inexorably to a 

Rooker-Feldman bar. 

 But I think that the nature of our claim, 

24 

which follows from Osborne, what we understood the Court 

25

to be recognizing in Osborne, or acknowledging in 

17

Osborne, is that the State's administration of its DNA 

testing scheme is where a due process violation might 

theoretically arise, depending on how it's administered. 

So I think -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't -- I don't 

understand the argument you're making.  Are you 

challenging the constitutionality of the Texas statute? 

 MR. OWEN:  As interpreted in our case, or as 

9 

construed, I think is the right -- is the better word.

As -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, "as construed" -- I 

mean, it's their statute.  I mean, you say somewhere in 

your brief that -- that they gave it an arbitrary and 

capricious interpretation.  It's up to them how they 

want to interpret it.  We don't -- we don't reinterpret 

State statutes because the State Supreme Court 

interpreted it strangely. 

 It seems to me you're either challenging the 

19 

statute or -- or you don't belong here.

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. OWEN:  I think, Your Honor, we are 

challenging the statute.  And I think once the Texas 

Court of Criminal Appeals says here is what the default 

provision means, that is the same thing, for the 

purposes of this Court's review, as if the legislature 

had written that in.  So -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  Just so long as 

2 

we're clear about that.

 MR. OWEN:  Yes, sir.  So that's what we are

challenging.  I certainly agree if we were saying they

got it wrong on their own terms, that would be a 

Rooker-Feldman bar, because we couldn't bring that 

claim. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I assume that this whole

case focuses on paragraph 33 of your complaint; is that 

right?

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And what is the "but"? 

 MR. OWEN:  I think there has been a lot of 

discussion about the allegations in the complaint, 

particularly those paragraphs.  I think that is maybe 

missing the larger point, which is this:  As we said 

earlier, I think that the Federal rules permit 

complaints to be notice pleading.  They permit 

amendment.  They permit development of the issues. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So, what's -- look, 33 says 

the District Attorney has violated my rights under the 

law by refusing to give me the DNA evidence, so make him 

do it.

 That's how I read 33.

Federal District Court, to release Mr. Skinner from 

custody.  We're not asking them to accelerate the 

release date on his sentence, for which there is none. 

We're not asking them to modify the status of his 

custody.

 All of those things which are at the core of

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, you are -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but what you 

say in the rest of paragraph 33 is that you want the 

biological evidence because by refusing to turn it over, 

he prevented you from gaining access to exculpatory 

evidence that could demonstrate he is not guilty of 

capital murder, which is usually what we -- what habeas 

corpus is for:  To show you are not guilty of what you 

are in prison for. 

 MR. OWEN:  I -- I think ordinarily, Your

action.  We would seek clemency, or we would file a 

State habeas petition.  We would do something where the 

court would have the power to -­

I think that "necessarily implies," as the Court 

interpreted that phrase in Dotson, means somewhere down 

the road you may come back to court and you may attempt 

to undo your custody, and that's not enough to put this 

case into habeas, that that -­

where people are seeking the DNA evidence might come out 

differently under Heck.  In other words, if it's the 

type of DNA evidence that could conclusively establish 

he's innocent.  I mean, there are types like that.  It's 

somebody else's, you know, DNA and that's what's 

necessary for the conviction. 

 And there's others -- other types of DNA 

evidence that doesn't.  I mean, it just happens to be on 

the scene of the crime and it turns out that it's not 

him that was in the room, but, you know, he was 

somewhere else, and it might or might not mean he's 

22
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

1 

innocent. 

Official 

2

 In the former case, do you say that has to 

3 

go under habeas, but in the latter it doesn't? 

4

5

 MR. OWEN:  I think when we are seeking 

access to evidence which has never been tested for 

6 

testing, that could be brought under 1983.

11 

12

 I think if the evidence has been tested and 

test results exist and are known and are exculpatory, 

that is a -- that's a different case and that's probably 

habeas, because then it's the fact that the results are 

known and we know they are exculpatory that does 

necessarily imply that there's something about the 

judgment that could be undone. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Owen, you're fitting 

your case into our decisions about the line between 1983 

and habeas.  But if nobody -- if you didn't know 

anything about that and you looked at what's presented 

here in a civil case, it seems as though you are 

splitting your claim; that is, you want discovery, and 

if the discovery is favorable, then you ask for relief 

21 

from the conviction. 

22

23 

24 

25

 So it's the -- it's quite unlike I'm 

complaining about prison conditions.  Here, the whole 

purpose of your seeking this discovery is so that you 

will be able, if it turns out to be in your favor, to 

23

 MR. OWEN:  The whole -- I agree, Your Honor, 

that the whole purpose for seeking this evidence and 

pursuing this lawsuit is so that Mr. Skinner can have a 

meaningful opportunity to pursue the liberty interest he 

has under State law in trying to secure release based on 

innocence.  That is correct.  But I don't think that 

leads inexorably to the idea that this lawsuit, which 

is -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could you have sought 

habeas?  Is it 1983 is the exclusive relief, or could 

you have sought habeas relief? 

 MR. OWEN:  I think, Your Honor, that since

our allegation is that the Court of Criminal Appeals

decision denying us DNA testing, which is not the 

judgment that results in Mr. Skinner's custody, is the 

problem -- that's the bad, invalid judgment from our 

legal theory -- that could not have been brought in a 

habeas corpus proceeding, because I think that the 

relief that a Federal habeas court would have available 

to itself is limited to release, to accelerating release 

or changing custody status.  I don't think that there is 

power in the Federal habeas court under that statute to 

say, even though this will not affect the judgment as to 

which you are in custody, I'm going to act on this way

and order this person to do that or the other thing.  I 

think that it wouldn't be available in habeas, Your 

Honor. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, couldn't the habeas 

court say the conviction was invalid because of the 

failure to turn over this -- this DNA evidence, which 

was relevant to the defense and which was 

unconstitutionally denied?  Why wouldn't that be a basis 

for setting aside the conviction?

 MR. OWEN:  Your Honor, this Court has never 

said -- and I know the Court's aware of this; I want to 

make sure I'm clear on that -- this Court has never said 

that it would be a constitutional basis for habeas 

relief if you could demonstrate that, factually, you 

were not guilty. 

 So that's the claim that would have to be 

brought in such a Federal habeas.  It's not presently 

available because this Court has never held that.  And I 

think, given the constraints of the Federal habeas 

statute and the requirement of clearly established 

Federal law from this Court, before a prisoner can get 

relief, that's a necessary prerequisite for us seeking 

that relief.  And -- and I'm sorry.  I hope that is 

responsive, Your Honor.

it's the same problem as described earlier with the 

Brady framework.  If we knew today that the -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'll tell you what the 

problem is.  The problem is Rooker-Feldman.  That's -­

that's why all of these things don't make much sense.  I 

mean, it wouldn't happen because you had the opportunity 

to raise that in the State court, and now you're 

retrying what the -- what the State court did decide.

 MR. OWEN:  I think to the extent, Your 

Honor, that the question goes to the opportunity that we 

had to raise this issue in State court, that's a 

preclusion issue, and there may be preclusion issues 

back in the district court.  We may have a dogfight over 

whether or not this claim should have been raised in 

16 

State court. 

17

19 

20

21 

22

 But that's not the Rooker-Feldman question, 

as I understand it.  I think the Rooker-Feldman question 

is:  What are we asking the Federal court to review? 

And what we are asking the Federal court to review is 

the Criminal Court of Appeals' authoritative 

construction of the statute. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but that would be an

obstacle to habeas.

I think that over time the courts who are wrestling with 

this issue in the wake of Osborne will identify what 

aspects of a State's statute and construction of such 

statutes violate due process or don't. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why isn't it a correct 

formulation of your answer to Justice Scalia to say what 

we are seeking is a determination that the State court's 

judgment, State court's decisions, State court's order 

was a violation of due process?  If you say that -­

 MR. OWEN:  That's -- that's a much simpler

answer, Your Honor, and I will adopt that answer.

think, again -- and this is where we started, and I'm 

not trying to -- to bring us back full circle, but I 

think that our understanding of Rooker-Feldman is that 

that is not one of the things that the Rooker-Feldman 

doctrine prohibits.  And, of course, this Court has 

emphasized in recent years, in the Exxon case and 

elsewhere, that lower courts have been reading 

Rooker-Feldman too broadly.

24

 To decide this case, the Court only needs to 

make two stops.  First is paragraph 33 of Mr. Skinner's 

complaint.

 That complaint, that statement of his 

complaint clearly alleges against Ms. Skinner -- Ms. 

Switzer herself that she has withheld -- and the word he 

uses is "exculpatory" evidence -- and violated his due 

process rights through that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, he says

7

exculpatory evidence that could demonstrate that he's 

not guilty.  There's a lot of exculpatory evidence that 

might imply, necessarily imply guilt, but there's a lot 

of exculpatory evidence that simply is helpful and 

doesn't mean it will demonstrate.  He says it could. 

 MR. COLEMAN:  There -- there are two points 

in response to that, Chief Justice Roberts, and the 

first is that this is the classic statement of a Brady 

claim.  When you file a Brady claim, you don't know 

exactly what it is and whether it will definitely be 

exculpatory or not.  You have learned information that 

makes you think that it would be, and you're able to -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The substantive right in 

14 

Brady was to have that material at trial, so that it is 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

-- that's the substantive constitutional right.  Here 

the substantive right that's been identified in Osborne 

is the liberty interest created by State law.  And that 

only happens after the conviction.  So it's not quite 

the same.  It's not comparable.

 MR. COLEMAN:  I'm not -- I'm not saying that 

legally that there isn't some difference to be made from 

Osborne.  Osborne rejected the substantive claim that 

you could bring a Brady claim.  What I'm saying is the 

language of the text of his complaint is a Brady 

allegation, and at page 19, footnote 6 of his own brief, 

29
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1

3 

4 

5

8

he acknowledges that Brady claims have to be brought in 

habeas and is left simply arguing that, one, that I can 

describe to the Court a different theory of my 

complaint, or that regardless of how I describe the 

complaint, I can break out the discovery aspects of that 

complaint and do it under 1983 and not in habeas.  And 

part of the problem with that -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  To -- to win a Brady claim 

9 

in habeas, wouldn't you -- you have to show not just 

10

11 

12 

13

that the -- that it was withheld, but that it was, 

indeed, exculpatory and could have affected the outcome 

of the trial.  No? 

 MR. COLEMAN:  Yes.  But that claim -- that 

14 

showing is to be made, if at all, in habeas.  And he has 

15

16

17 

18 

19 

20

the opportunity -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  But he doesn't have to make 

that showing here.  I mean, that's -- that's what he 

says distinguishes this case from habeas.  In habeas, 

you would have to show that, indeed, it would justify a 

different outcome in the trial, whereas here he says I 

21 

don't have to show that; I just want the evidence. 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. COLEMAN:  There is some ambiguity.  I'm 

not sure I fully understand what you mean by "here."  He 

has alleged that that's what he is going to prove.  What 

he -- what he says in his brief and what he stands 

30
 

Alderson Reporting Company

before the Court today and says I'm going to show are -­

are different things. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what he is going to

do with it.  But he doesn't -- he doesn't say that I 

5

6 

7 

8

need to show that in order to be entitled to -- to the 

relief I'm asking for, whereas he would have to say that 

in habeas. 

 MR. COLEMAN:  I disagree.  With respect to 

9 

the relief that he is ultimately seeking, the question 

10

11 

12 

13 

14

15

is -- if you're saying that the 1983 suit is simply a 

retrying of the article 64 proceeding, then I -- I would 

have to concede that article 64 does not require the 

same showing as a habeas claim.  But part of the -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, aren't -- aren't 

the -- the exculpatory nature of the evidence and its 

16 

materiality elements of the Brady claim itself? 

17

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. COLEMAN:  Well, as -- as the Court and 

your concurring opinion in Osborne made clear, that -­

that "exculpatory" is really defined as demonstrating 

that you're innocent and that it's material. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  I agree think that sounds 

like -- I would interpret his complaint as what he wants 

is the DNA.  He thinks it's going to be exculpatory.  He 

doesn't know that till he gets it.

 So look at Dotson.  Dotson says that you go

into habeas if winning -- i.e., getting the DNA -- would 

necessarily spell speedier release.  End of the matter. 

I'm reading to you from Justice Scalia's concurrence 

where he quotes my majority with great praise.

 (Laughter.) 

 MR. COLEMAN:  Justice Scalia -- Justice 

Scalia also makes the point at the end of his Dotson 

concurrence that the question -- the real question is 

whether you could make out this type of claim or this -­

10

make out this type of proceeding in habeas.  Ultimately, 

11 

Preiser and Heck -­

23

25

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No, not whether you -- what 

he's worried about -- he can speak for himself -- but as 

I read the concurrence, he was worried that if you win 

and take 1983 away, all kinds of things will be stuffed 

into habeas which don't belong there.  And that may be a 

true and correct criticism, but whether it is or not, he 

has agreed, indeed, nine members or seven members or 

something of the Court agreed, that the test I read to 

you is the test. 

 And now, if that's the test, getting the DNA 

does not necessarily spell speedier release; it all 

depends on what the -- on what that DNA shows.  So why 

isn't that end of the matter?

 MR. COLEMAN:  Because I disagree that the 

32

two words "necessarily implies" are in fact sort of the 

end of the battle and the end of the test.

required to be brought in habeas and what may be 

10

brought.  A couple of boundaries on those rules, but

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Coleman, if you could 

answer Justice Breyer's question, because there are two 

phrases, "necessarily imply the invalidity of the 

conviction" and "necessarily spell speedier release"; 

and either you think that your case fits one of those or 

both of those standards, or you are asking us to abandon 

that standard. 

 MR. COLEMAN:  I don't think that that's 

true.  I think that what the Court has always 

recognized, an article 64 proceeding is a motion in the 

criminal case.  If you look at the docket number on the 

motion, it is a motion in the criminal case. 

 What "necessarily implies" has always been 

used for is defining the outer bounds of the rule in 

33

terms of prison disciplinary proceedings, parole, other 

things outside the criminal case itself.

proceeding.  This is a post-conviction motion in the

criminal case itself.  It's like a rule 60 -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Filed in the -- in the

 MR. COLEMAN:  It's not only in the court of

 JUSTICE BREYER:  So that's a totally 

different area, because in Dotson when -- I think what 

we did do was go through every of these -- every one of 

the prior cases, and they did involve for the most part 

the attack, as you say, on prison procedure.  And those 

cases where the attack on the proceeding would have 

restored good-time credits, there it was shortening the 

-- the length of confinement. 

 In those cases where there was a general 

19 

attack on procedures, but the procedure would simply be 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

carried on better later, like parole, there wasn't.  You 

suddenly focused me on a whole new set of areas.  Where 

in the case law is this different rule that the rule we 

just said has nothing to do with it, if it's in the 

case?  That's basically what you are arguing.  What 

should I read to show that you were right on that?

 MR. COLEMAN:  I think Preiser and Heck both 

stand for the fundamental proposition that Congress set 

up habeas as a means of allowing collateral attacks. 

Nowhere else does Congress specifically permit 

collateral attacks on criminal proceedings.  Then 

Preiser and Heck say what we allow from that is those 

things that may be brought in habeas should be brought 

in habeas because the congressional intent behind the 

habeas statute is that we expect the safeguards that 

10

Congress has put in place to respect comity and

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  But how could this be 

brought in habeas?  If Mr. Skinner wants this evidence 

and -- and we say you file a habeas petition, what would 

that habeas petition look like? 

 MR. COLEMAN:  Well, the habeas petition -­

we know it can be brought in habeas because, one, he has 

already brought it.  He brought a habeas petition based 

on ineffective assistance of counsel that is, as a 

matter of argument, indistinguishable from the no-fault 

arguments that he is making here.  The complaint's 

against the no-fault aspect of the article 64 

proceeding. 

 He can bring that.  Many courts -- this 

Court has never fully said that you can, but many courts 

35
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official

2 

3 

4

do allow actual innocence-type claims to go forward, and 

so he can bring an ineffective assistance habeas, he can 

bring an actual innocence habeas, he can do discovery as 

part of that habeas; and when he does that -- when he 

does that, Congress says you must respect those criminal 

proceedings.  You must show deference.  You must require 

exhaustion. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Coleman, the habeas 

9 

statute says, 2254(a), a Federal court can entertain a 

10

habeas petition only on the ground that the petitioner 

11 

is in custody in violation of Federal law.

16 

17 

18

 Tell me how he can write a complaint that 

says the violation, due process violation of access to 

DNA, means that this defendant is in custody in 

violation of Federal law as opposed to having had a 

statutory right improperly denied him.  Tell me how does 

he write that complaint to get into habeas? 

 MR. COLEMAN:  Well he -- he's stood before

the Court today and explained how he would write that

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's not his claim 

here.  His claim here is that he was denied DNA evidence 

improperly under State law -- in violation of Federal -­

the Federal Constitution. 

 MR. COLEMAN:  That's correct.  And the -­

the last part of my answer to Justice Kagan I think is 

the answer to your question, and that is if you make out 

either an ineffective assistance claim or an actual 

innocence-type claim, the congressional intent that you 

observe and show deference and exhaustion and all those 

things require that to be given to every step of the 

process. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  In the particular -­

MR. COLEMAN:  But the moment you file the 

complaint through discovery, through every substantive 

aspect of that -- what Mr. Skinner wants to do is say: 

I want to engage in artful pleading, and so I'm going to 

make attacks.  Today they are on DNA evidence; tomorrow 

they may be a Brady claim; next week it may be a claim 

against procedures used in State habeas.  But as long as 

I don't expressly ask that my custody be undone, I -- I 

expect those claims to be allowed to go forward in 1983 

without any of the protections of habeas, and then -­

then if it looks after a year that they are going pretty 

37

well, then I will flip it over to habeas and go forward

 And we have the Dotson point, and you said 

there are two other cases, Preiser and Heck.  So what 

Dotson says about Preiser is that the plaintiff there 

wanted the shortening of his term of confinement.  He 

wanted good-time credits to be restored.  And as we read 

it then, the shortening of the term of confinement is 

what made it proper in habeas.  But we added that if it 

hadn't been for that, if it hadn't attacked the duration 

of the physical confinement, it wouldn't be habeas; it 

would be 1983.

 In Heck, the same thing.  They were 

establishing the basis for a damages claim that 

necessarily demonstrated the invalidity of the 

conviction.  Where that was so, there would be habeas. 

Where that was not so, even if successful, it would not 

demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal 

judgment, the action should be allowed to proceed in 

1983.  So as we read those two cases, they stood for the 

exact principle I described. 

 Now, you want, perfectly fairly, to say: 

But we didn't read them correctly, or we shouldn't have 

38

read them as exclusively to say what I've just read.

1983 from habeas corpus if we were to abandon as an 

exclusive test what we said, and I just read you in 

those three cases:  Dotson, Preiser, Heck?  What's your 

contrary approach? 

 MR. COLEMAN:  I -- I think the approach is 

if these things may be properly made the subject of a 

habeas corpus claim, then congressional intent and the 

habeas statute require that it be brought in habeas.  I 

think that responds -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then you are -- you are 

asking for a modification of the Wilkinson-Dotson 

formula, because the formula is, I think, quite clear. 

It says:  "Would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity 

of the conviction or the sentence."  Wouldn't 

necessarily demonstrate, and the Petitioner is telling 

us, it may not demonstrate it at all.  It may 

demonstrate that my client was, in fact, guilty.  So it 

wouldn't necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the 

conviction. 

 And I think to get -- to get -- to say that 

you should prevail, you would have to say:  Court, you

15

were wrong in using that formula, because here we have a 

petitioner who says, I'm not claiming that what I'm 

seeking would demonstrate the invalidity of the 

conviction.

 MR. COLEMAN:  I -- I disagree with that, 

Justice Ginsburg.  I don't think that we're saying that 

the Court is wrong.  What I think I'm saying is that 

"necessarily implies" is not a magic words test that is 

the sort of complete and ultimate statement of the 

Preiser-Heck rule, but rather -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you are asking for 

something in addition.  You say:  Court, don't just look 

at the words in Wilkinson v. Dotson.  This is a 

different case, as I suggested originally.  This does 

not involve parole.  The ultimate destination in this 

16 

case is the conviction and sentence. 

17

18 

19 

20

 MR. COLEMAN:  I think that that is correct, 

in the sense that if you look at Dotson, which was -­

involved a specific claim for process -- which is not 

what they are asking for.  They are asking for actual 

21 

relief, not process. 

22

23 

24 

25

 But you look at those types of cases, 

whether it's Heck, it's a civil case that went about 

attacking it, these cases on the periphery of what goes 

in and out of Heck, the "necessarily implied" language, 

40
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

2 

3

I think, is a good descriptor for what is at -- was at 

the periphery. 

 But when you attack the core of the criminal 

4 

proceeding itself, what his rule is simply -- is an 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13

attempt to take the two words or the phrase from Dotson 

and turn it back on itself and say -- says that, under 

Heck, I can attack motions in the criminal proceedings 

themselves, in the State habeas itself, as long as I 

stop short of asking for that ultimate relief.

 So Heck said the case is about avoiding 

artful pleading, but now what he wants to turn it into 

is a rule that encourages artful pleading and -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe -- maybe we need -- I 

14 

mean, we've never had a case like this, and it's 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

conceivable to -- to me that we have to expand what we 

said in Heck and Preiser.  I'm not sure, however, that 

what we ought to say is what you propose:  That the test 

is whether it could be brought in habeas.  You say it 

could be brought in habeas by claiming ineffective 

assistance of counsel, but you would lose that -- that 

21 

habeas. 

22

23 

24 

25

 You can bring anything in habeas.  I mean, 

you can file a habeas petition.  I assume you mean you 

could possibly win in habeas.  You couldn't win in 

habeas with this claim because you couldn't show that it 

41
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

1 

would have affected the outcome.  Isn't that so? 

2

3 

4 

5

6 

7 

8

 MR. COLEMAN:  Well, as you noted in your 

concurrence in Dotson, the question is not whether you 

win, but whether you could.  And the question is, if 

it's properly the subject of habeas, then Congress has 

demanded that all of the safeguards and protections for 

habeas be in place.  And that -­

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well -- well, that doesn't 

9 

quite give us the added formulation that some of the 

10

11 

12 

13 

14

15

16 

17 

18

questions suggest we need, if we're going to adhere to 

Dotson and still rule for you.  There has to be some 

slightly different qualification.  I'm not quite sure 

what it is. 

 MR. COLEMAN:  Well, I -- I'm not sure 

exactly what you're angling for there.  But at the end 

of the day, I think that there is also a -- a 

misunderstanding about what article 64 is. 

 Skinner treats article 64 as simply:  I 

19 

asked for evidence, and I get evidence.  And you denied 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

-- you denied me the DNA.  What article 64 actually is, 

it's a motion, as I mentioned, filed in the criminal 

case itself, that says:  Judge, I want a ruling that if 

this additional DNA evidence were known at the time of 

trial, then I probably would not have been convicted.

 And the process for obtaining that ruling is 

42
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

to make an initial threshold showing that suggests the 

materiality of the DNA evidence.  If you get over that 

threshold, then you move on to testing, and you get a 

hearing and an ultimate determination.

 But there are really only two results in 

article 64.  One is a ruling that you probably would not 

have been convicted.  Or, two, I reject your request for 

a ruling that you probably would not have been 

convicted.  And that's what he got.  It is a motion that 

goes to the core of the conviction itself. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But if -- in Heck itself, 

we said a 1983 action, where it is -- even if 

successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity of any 

outstanding criminal judgment, a 1983 action should be 

allowed to proceed. 

 Now, I take it what you're suggesting is we 

say that sentence is wrong or overstated, that there is 

another circumstance. 

 MR. COLEMAN:  Well -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Even though it will not 

demonstrate that the judgment was wrong, it still should 

not be allowed in 1983 if it is, quote, "related to" the 

criminal case itself.  Something like that is what 

you're proposing.  Or what is it you're proposing?

whether it's invalid.  We don't know.  What we want is 

to get the information that will help us make that 

decision.  We think there is a law that entitles us to 

that right.  Can you bring that in habeas or not?

 MR. COLEMAN:  The discovery provisions of 

habeas allow you to seek that as part of your habeas 

claim, and when you do that, all the safeguards and 

protections of habeas apply. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So that means FOIA 

requests, where your only purpose is to seek out the 

police files because you're hoping, just like you are in 

DNA testing, that those files will show exculpatory 

material.  Then FOIA requests have to be brought in

it has no certainty at all of doing so.

right specific to him -- for instance, if I seek DNA 

evidence, it's because I want to attack my conviction.

 But -- but what we are talking about here 

really is ultimately if you are convicted in one county 

but you're serving time in a different part of the 

State, you bring your habeas claim and then at the same 

time you bring a 1983 suit, you ask for discovery and 

say I don't want -- and this could be DNA; it could be 

some other Brady materials; it could be an attack -- you 

say I want to litigate the first half of my claim out 

here without any of the protections of habeas, and then 

if it turns out, well, I'm going to just move them over 

and use them in my habeas, that -- without any of the

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I was going to ask if 

you have a few moments to address the Rooker argument. 

What -- what is your response to the Petitioner's 

counsel's explanation of why there is no Rooker here? 

 MR. COLEMAN:  There -- there is a way. 

When -- when the court said in Osborne you should use 

these State statutes and you may -- you might have a 

procedural due process, the court was not saying we are 

going to create out of whole cloth an entirely new 

category of procedural due process.

 You do it like you do any other procedural 

due process.  If you go into the system and you -- you 

file -- and again litigation is different from an 

administrative procedure, which is what Dotson was 

about.  You're in litigation and you're in court.  And 

if somebody says, well, there's this prong that you 

can't meet, and you think it violates due process, you 

have an obligation to raise it then, and then you have 

an opportunity, if the court rules against you, to file 

a cert petition.

 And if you don't do that, what we do know

is, from this very limited area, is that the one thing 

that you can't do is file a Federal 1983 lawsuit saying 

I think that what the State court did is arbitrary and 

capricious.

 And, so, Skinner is asking you to create a 

1983 lawsuit that is always Rooker-Feldman barred and 

always preclusion barred, because you're asking the 

court to declare that the State courts violated your -­

the constitutional rights in the way they went about it. 

And -- and so he's asking you to create a category of 

1983 suits that runs exactly contrary to Rooker-Feldman 

and exactly contrary to what Heck said is this 

overriding interest in ensuring that these types of 

collateral attacks are brought, if at all, in habeas and 

not through generalized 1983 lawsuits that don't provide 

any of the protections that Congress has insisted by 

statute be applied in these types of suits. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, then, can you give us 

19 

your best modified statement of Wilkinson against 

20

21

Dotson?  I think you were telling us that that formula

necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the

conviction; nonetheless, you say it falls on the habeas

ask -- if you could say what that would be, what that 

precise modification would be?

 MR. COLEMAN:  Well, first, I don't believe 

the Court has ever acknowledged the existence of a cause 

of action for discovery separate and apart from the 

merits of what you are seeking to do. 

 The merits of what he's seeking to do is to 

attack his custody.  That is something that can and 

should be brought in habeas.  And the Court should not, 

for many reasons, create a cause of action that -- whose 

sole purpose is to run counter to Rooker-Feldman and 

whose sole purpose is to avoid the protections of 

habeas. 

 Again, this is not an expansion of habeas. 

It's simply a recognition that he has a claim that he 

can bring in habeas, it -- it probably is a loser and we 

think it certainly would be a loser, but the question 

is, can he bring it, and if he can, it should be subject 

to these types of things.  And at the end, when you 

recognize what he is trying to do, this is fundamentally 

a question or a -- he is seeking to invalidate his 

conviction, and that it comfortably fits within the 

policy choices that the Court has made all the way -­

the conviction, it is a request that the Court declare 

that the conviction is probably invalid, that because 

that is what he is attacking, he is saying the result 

that is -­

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but just -­

MR. COLEMAN:  -- that -- that we do fit 

within the "necessarily implies," because any proper 

attack on an article 64 ruling is an attack, but that 

within the broader context, if the Court feels a need to 

rule on these cases in criminal proceedings, then -­

then it should recognize it should be brought in habeas. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- if I can have just 

1 minute.  Then if you do not file an article -- in a 

State court at all and you just go to 1983, you're back 

under Heck, and you haven't given us a qualification 

that works under Heck.

if the only claim you brought -- you say, I'm -- I can 

never meet article 64 because it says only applies to 

convictions after January 1st, 2000.  I -- I can't meet 

that.  I think it's unconstitutional.  You file a 1983 

lawsuit.  You say I think that provision is 

unconstitutional.  That's really Dotson saying rule that 

that prong is unconstitutional, but let me go back and 

have process.  That's Dotson -­

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY ROBERT C. OWEN 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. OWEN:  Mr. Chief Justice -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Owen, I know I'm 

19 

pushing you, but I really would like a clear statement 

20

of what the procedural due process violation that you 

21 

are claiming occurred here is. 

22

23 

24 

25

 MR. OWEN:  Your Honor, our -- our claim is 

that in its construction of the statute, the Texas Court 

of Criminal Appeals construed the statute to completely 

foreclose any prisoner who could have sought DNA testing

prior to trial, but did not, from seeking testing under

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're not -- you -­

 MR. OWEN:  -- that speaks too broadly. 

So -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then let me follow this 

through.  You're not attacking the constitutionality of 

article 64 on its face, right?  Or are you? 

 MR. OWEN:  Your Honor, this -- this came up 

as we were preparing for our presentation, and I think 

there's -- there's -- here's what I would like to say: 

We are not suggesting that article 64 -- that there's no 

way to interpret article 64 that the court could have 

chosen to -- to construe the statute that would always 

be unconstitutional in every case.  That's what -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, what -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  It chose to construe it the 

way it construed it.  You -- you can't attack the way -­

the way the State Supreme Court construed its statute.

 MR. OWEN:  That's right, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're attacking the 

22 

statute. 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Are you saying -- and 

24 

that's -- this is where I have difficulty -- that by 

25

failing to acknowledge Petitioner's ineffective

assistance of counsel claim, that that was the court's 

error? 

 MR. OWEN:  No, Your Honor.  Our claim -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that was a good 

enough excuse to excuse the fact that he didn't do 

DNA -- DNA testing at the time of trial?  Because that's 

what the statute says.  You can't get it if it was 

present at the time and -- meaning if that actual test 

that you're seeking was available at the time of trial, 

or you don't prove that you couldn't have done it for a 

good reason.  So what is it exactly that the court did 

in applying this that was unconstitutional? 

 MR. OWEN:  Your Honor, I think it's not the 

14 

specific question to whether in our case they didn't 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

consider our ineffective assistance of counsel 

arguments.  It's that it made no provision for any 

exception to its rule.  In other words, that it 

interpreted this as a blanket proscription on seeking 

testing for anybody who didn't seek it prior to trial.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But, wait a minute. 

That's what the statute says.  The statute gives the 

conditions under which a petitioner can seek DNA 

evidence, and it said you didn't meet those conditions. 

I'm still trying to figure out what you're arguing -­

MR. OWEN:  I think -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- was the procedural 

due process violation in their application of those 

items.  So are you challenging it facially, or are you 

challenging it as applied, but as applied how?

 MR. OWEN:  Once -- once the Court of 

Criminal Appeals construes the statute, that's what the 

statute means, and we are challenging that.  If that's 

what the Court's -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And so what do you 

think -­

 MR. OWEN:  If that's what Your Honor 

12 

described as facial.

14

23 

24 

25

 MR. OWEN:  That it -- that it is not -- that 

it does not admit of any exceptions and that it doesn't 

have any reference to the purposes of the statute, the 

reasoning the testing might not have been sought in a 

particular case, or the fact, particularly that, in our 

case, Mr. Skinner at the time of his trial, this -- the 

postconviction DNA testing statute was still 6 years in 

the future.  So that -- so that to the extent the Court 

of Criminal Appeals portrayed Mr. Skinner as making a 

choice, that's -- that's not accurate, because he didn't 

make a choice.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I don't even -- I'm not 

even sure what that argument ties to, because I thought 

what the court said was:  This DNA testing was available 

then.  You could have gotten it.  Strategically your 

trial attorney chose not to, and so that disqualifies 

6 

you from seeking it now.

 I'm not quite sure what the date of the 

statute's passage, whether it makes any difference, 

because -- because why?

 MR. OWEN:  Well, let me then -- I -- I've 

always felt that it was intuitively, especially unfair 

to accuse him of laying behind the log when there was no 

log to lie behind.  But that's -- that's not our point 

in responding to your question, Your Honor.  Our point 

is simply that we think that the exception that they 

crafted in construing the statute or the statute as 

construed sweeps too broadly.  The exception sweeps too 

broadly. 

 Now, the Court may not necessarily -- we may 

not prevail on that eventually.  We're going to litigate 

that, and I think that we will fight that out in the 

district court.  But the question for this Court is 

we -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, Mr. Owen, if I 

understand you correctly in how this understanding of 

56
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official 

the claim relates to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, what 

you are saying is that the statute as construed was 

unconstitutional? 

 MR. OWEN:  Yes.

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  And that that falls outside

6 

the bounds of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine?

 MR. OWEN:  Yes, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  Whereas, if you were saying 

9 

that the statute -- that the application of the statute 

10

11 

12 

13

in this particular case was wrongful, that would not 

fall outside of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine; is that 

right?

Skinner.  That's not what we're challenging.  We're 

challenging the statute as construed.
