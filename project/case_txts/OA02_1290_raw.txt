CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


now in No. 02-1290, the United States Postal Service v.


Flamingo Industries.


Mr. Kneedler.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


The Ninth Circuit held in this case that the


United States Postal Service may be sued for treble


damages under the Federal antitrust laws.  The court of


appeals fundamentally erred in this holding.  Throughout


the nation's history, postal operations have been carried


out by the United States Government itself, pursuant to


the express authorization in article I of the


Constitution, for Congress to establish post offices and


post roads.


As this Court explained in the Council of


Greenburgh case about 20 years ago, the furnishing of


postal services has historically been regarded as a


sovereign function, indeed a sovereign necessity, to


promote intercourse among the states and bind the nation


together.  Such functions of the United States Government

are not regulated by the antitrust laws.


Indeed, more than 60 years ago, in the Cooper


Corporation case, this Court held that the United States


is not a person for purposes of the antitrust laws. 


Although the precise question before the Court in that


case was whether the United States could sue as a


plaintiff under section 7 of the Sherman Act, the Court


noted that the same word, person, is used to describe who


may be held liable as a defendant, either in a civil


action or in a criminal prosecution.


QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, in your view, are there


any instrumentalities of the United States that you think


could be considered a person under the Sherman Act?


MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I - I think that there are 

no instrumentalities that are constituent parts of the


United States Government itself that could - that could be


held liable.  The word instrumentality is used in a - in a


somewhat vague sense, elastic sense, and I think it would


be necessary to look at the particular statute to see how


much of a governmental character a particular entity has.


QUESTION: Of course, I guess the court whose


judgment we're reviewing thought that the change in the


structure of the Postal Service affected the nature of


that instrumentality.


MR. KNEEDLER: It - it - it did, but the - the

court of appeals was wrong on that.  First of all, after


the - the court of - after the - this Court's Cooper


decision, a number of lower court decisions have held,


beginning with the D.C. Circuit's decision in the Sea-


Land case involving the Alaska Railroad, that agencies of


the United States or instrumentalities just like the


United States itself is not a person subject to the


antitrust laws.  The Ninth Circuit didn't -


QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler - Mr. Kneedler, but I


don't think in that case there was - the question was


raised whether the Alaska Railroad was an agent of the


United States that would - would carry the immunity of the


United States.


MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the - the - it was - the 

Court regarded it as an - as an instrumentality, and in


fact the - the Court there recognized that the railroad


and the officials of the Government responsible for


supervising the railroad could be sued under the APA, and


that, therefore, there had been a waiver of sovereign


immunity to that extent, and to the extent of allowing


injunctive relief.  So the - the Court certainly focused


on the question that the Alaska Railroad and those


responsible for managing it were part of the United States


Government.


QUESTION: I didn't think it was a contested

issue in - in that case.


MR. KNEEDLER: It may not have been contested,


but it - but it - the Court certainly addressed that


question and then went on to hold that as an


instrumentality of the United States, the - the railroad


was not subject to suit under the antitrust law.


QUESTION: Is the Postal Service subject to the


Administrative Procedure Act?


MR. KNEEDLER: It is not.  It - it - Congress


specifically accepted it that there's - in section 410 of


the act, there's a very detailed enumeration of the


provisions that Congress did want and did not want to be -


the Postal Service to be subject to.  But the - the


important point for present purposes is that in 1970, when 

Congress enacted the Postal Reorganization Act, it carried


forward the essential governmental character of the Postal


Service, just as it had been up until that point.


In fact, section 101(a) of the act says that the


United States - and I quote - the United States Postal


Service shall be operated as a basic and fundamental


service provided to the people by the Government of the


United States.  And then it says, the Postal Service shall


have as its basic function the obligation to provide


postal services to bind the nation together.


QUESTION: So you say it carried forward the -

the essential governmental character.  What - what does


that consist of?  Doesn't it consist of the nature of the


entity, not just - just the - the tag?  It can't just put


a tag on it and - and say it has an essentially


governmental character.  I thought that the - that the


purpose of the reorganization was to make the Postal


Service function like a regular business.


MR. KNEEDLER: In - in a - in a limited sense. 


Congress -


QUESTION: Well, I'll - I'll qualify it.  A


regular business, a regular public utility -


MR. KNEEDLER: No, I - I -


QUESTION: - which has - which has certain


obligations, yes. 


They have to do universal - universal 

mail service, just as a telephone company has to give


universal telephone service.  But on the other hand, the


rest of their operations were supposed to be business-


like.


MR. KNEEDLER: In the - in the description of -


of how the Postal Service was to be operated carrying


forward, the - the Congress repeatedly referred to the


Postal Service as - as a governmental function, a public


service to be operated in a business-like way.  But what


Congress meant by that was to insulate the Postal Service


from the prior political interference that had come up by

imposing the duty on Congress to repeatedly raise rates

QUESTION: Insulated from the Government.


MR. KNEEDLER: Not - but by -


QUESTION: You're - you're saying on the one hand


it's part of the Government, but on the other hand, what


Congress wanted to do was to insulate it from the


Government.


MR. KNEEDLER: No.  By - by no means insulate it


from the Government.  The Postal Service - the governors


of the Postal Service are denominated officers of the


United States, so the people responsible for the Postal


Service are officers of the United States.


QUESTION: Are they - are they removable by the 

President?


MR. KNEEDLER: They're removable for cause.


QUESTION: For cause.  Just like the heads of


independent agencies.


MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, but - but certainly the other


independent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and


agencies like that are part of the United States


Government performing a governmental function.


QUESTION: Congress never said that they were


supposed to operate like a business, which was the purpose


of the Reorganization Act.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Actually, in the - in the text of


the act itself, there - there is - there is not an express


directive that the Postal Service will be operated like a


commercial entity.  What Congress had in mind was to - was


to rationalize the internal operations of the Postal


Service, but it did not change any of the fundamental ways


in which the Postal Service operated.  It - it maintained


the postal monopoly, which, under the private express


statutes, about 80 percent of the revenues of the Postal


Service are - are protected by the private express -


QUESTION: It - it did - it did retain that


monopoly and - and the Government's position here is that


the Postal Service has the power to extend that monopoly


into fields that the Government did not specifically 

confer upon it, right?  Because the Government's position,


as I understand it, is not only that the Postal Service


can't be sued under the antitrust laws, but that the -


that the Postal Service is not subject to the antitrust


laws.


MR. KNEEDLER: It is not a person within the


meaning of the antitrust laws.


QUESTION: So it can - it can go ahead and extend


the monopoly conferred by statute beyond the - the narrow


context granted by Congress.


MR. KNEEDLER: That is not a - that is not a new

feature of the - of the Postal Service.  As we point out


in our reply brief, quoting this Court's decision in the


Emergency Fleet Corporation case, there the Court pointed


out, with respect to the Post Office, it said the Post


Office has since 1872 competed with bankers through money


orders, it competed with savings and loan association


through savings accounts, which the Postal Service


operated -


QUESTION: Suppose there - suppose there were an


actionable violation of the antitrust laws and there was a


conspiracy between two private suppliers, and the Postal


Service, through some of its high officers, joined that


conspiracy.  Would there be any liability, individual


liability, on the part of the officers of the Postal 

Service?


MR. KNEEDLER: I - I'm not sure about that.  The


Postal Service itself would not be - would not be liable,


and I - and I think if the - I guess it depends on what


one means by a - by a conspiracy as well, because if the -


the Postal Service has brought authority in procurement,


for example, to - it's exempt from some of the Federal


procurement statutes, but Congress granted it the


authority to have its own procurement arrangements.  So if


the - if - if a - if the Postmaster General decides on a


particular procurement methodology that - that was alleged

to be anti-competitive, I don't think that could be fairly


characterized as a conspiracy, even -


QUESTION: Is the private express statute still


in effect?


MR. KNEEDLER: It is, it is, and that has - that


has not been changed, and the Court discussed that in the


California Board of Regents case and other - and other


decisions of this Court.  Really, the - all the Ninth


Circuit relied upon in - in this case was the presence of


a sue-and-be-sued clause in the Postal Reorganization Act,


which simply says that the Postal Service may sue and be


sued in its official name.


There is a - there is virtually no discussion of


that provision in the legislative history of the act, and 

the Ninth Circuit essentially said that because the Postal


Service may sue - may be sued in its official name,


therefore, it has - its sovereign character has been cast


off and it can be sued just like a private party.


That - that analysis is in direct conflict with


this Court's decision in FDIC v. Meyer, where the Court


reversed a similar determination with respect to the FDIC,


saying that the Ninth Circuit had conflated what are two


analytically distinct questions.  The first is whether


there is a waiver of sovereign immunity.  We do not


dispute that there is a waiver of sovereign immunity here

under the sue-and-be-sued clause.  But the - the second


and critical question here is whether the - the


substantive law that the plaintiff relies upon provides an


avenue for relief.


In this case, that is the antitrust laws, and


Congress has never amended the antitrust laws to make an


agency or an entity of the United States Government


liable.  After the decision in Cooper - Cooper


Corporation, Congress amended the Clayton Act to allow the


United States to sue as a plaintiff if it's injured in its


business or property, but it did not do that by changing


the word person.  It - it explicitly provided a cause of


action for the United States as the United States, but it


did not, as the D.C. Circuit pointed out in the Sea-Land 

case, amend the definition of person or otherwise make the


United States or its constituent parts subject to the


antitrust laws as a - as a defendant.


QUESTION: What happens - I'm sorry, go on.


QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, is this - section 201 of


Title 39 says, there is established as an independent


establishment of the executive branch of the Government of


the United States the United States Post Office.  Was that


in the statute before the reorganization or is that part


of the reorganization?


MR. KNEEDLER: That's part of the reorganization.

There was a Post Office Department before that was part of


the Cabinet, and what - what Congress wanted to do was to


take the post - postal operations out of the Cabinet and


put them under - under the Board of Governors, who are


officers of the United States but not part of the Cabinet. 


And the - the phrase, establishment of the executive


branch, is used with respect to other undeniably Federal


agencies, as we point out in our - in our brief, the OPM,


Office of Personnel Management, the Transportation Safety


Board.


And I - I think it's just intended to make


clearer that the Postal Service was not to be under the


President's direct control, and in fact there were


proposals to make the Postal Service a corporation, and 

Congress emphatically rejected that.  And instead, as


President Nixon proposed in - in submitting a proposal to


Congress, the Postal Service would be constituted as an


agency like the SEC or NASA or the Board of Governors of


the Federal Reserve System.  All of those entities are -


are performing quintessentially governmental functions


that are not subject to the antitrust laws.


QUESTION: If I get into a car accident with a -


with a postal delivery truck, do I sue the United States


under the Federal tort claims?


MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, yes, you do.  And - and -

it's - it's an important thing to - to be clear about in


the Postal Reorganization Act.  Pervasively throughout


that statute, Congress treated the Postal Service as a


governmental entity.  The torts are subject to the Federal


Tort Claims Act.


QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, where does the money


come to pay the judgment?  Is it -


MR. KNEEDLER: Out of the - out of the Postal


Service fund, but that is a fund in the Treasury.  There's


a separate provision -


QUESTION: But it isn't the general judgment


fund?


MR. KNEEDLER: No - no, it's - no, it's not, but


- but there are other - other situations in which


appropriated funds from a particular agency are used to


reimburse the judgment fund if there's a particular


appropriation set aside for that purpose, so this is not a


unique feature of - of the - of the Postal Act. 


But if I could also mention, torts are subject


to suit against the United States, but with respect to


contracts, Congress subjected the Postal Service to the


Contract Disputes Act.  The Court of Claims held almost 20


years ago, soon after the act was passed, that the United


States itself could be sued under the Tucker Act based on


a breach of contract with the Postal Service, because of

the close connection between the Postal Service and the


United States.


The Postal Service could be sued in district


court in its own name under the sue-and-be-sued clause for


breach of contract, but the Court of Claims held that -


that the United States itself can be sued, and therefore


is responsible for the contracts of - of the Postal


Service, and it -


QUESTION: Could the United States sue - bring an


antitrust suit as plaintiff on behalf of the Postal


Service?


MR. KNEEDLER: We - we believe it could.  It


would - it would be brought in its own name, but - but the


United States - if the Postal Service, just like any other 

entity, purchased goods, for example, and was a victim of


- of a - of a - of an antitrust violation, the United


States would be able to sue and - and collect treble


damages.  That was the purpose of the Cooper Corporation


case, where there was a procurement of tires by a number


of different Federal agencies, and Congress authorized the


United States to bring a suit to recover for the injuries


sustained to Federal agencies generally in that situation.


QUESTION: Under this sue-and-be-sued clause, is


it your position that there must always be a Federal


statute authorizing the suit before the post office has

any substantive liability?


MR. KNEEDLER: As a general rule, yes.  There -


before the Federal Tort Claims Act was passed though, it


was assumed that tort claims could be brought against


Federal entities that had sue-and-be-sued clauses,


although a lot of those were private corporations that


were instrumentalities, not - not Federal agencies.  And


also with respect -


QUESTION: So the sue-and-be-sued clause does


have some substantive force in some other cases?


MR. KNEEDLER: It's - it's been - it's unclear


because back when they were first put in the - in the


statutes, the - the separation of a - the existence of a


waiver of sovereign immunity and the existence of a cause 

of action were - were not separated the way they are


today.  For example, under the - under the Tucker Act, a


plaintiff can bring a breach of contract action against


the United States, even though there's no statute that


specifically provides a cause of action for breach of


contract.  It's thought that - that the reference to


contracts in the Tucker Act is a sufficient basis for


that, and we -


QUESTION: Does the Post Office have the power of


eminent domain?


MR. KNEEDLER: It does, it does, and it has - it

QUESTION: What about - what about inverse


condemnation?  Supposing the post office takes property


without the ability to pay for it.


MR. KNEEDLER: I don't know that the question has


arisen, but I - I would assume that a - a suit could be


brought against the United States under the Tucker Act on


the same theory that I mentioned with respect to a breach


of contract by the Postal Service.


QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler -

entities have the power of eminent domain?

right of eminent domain on - on Federal agencies, but it's


part of a general pattern in which the United States -


excuse me, in which Congress treated the Postal Service as


a - as a governmental entity.


I did want to point out one particular way that


illustrates the - the way in which the antitrust laws are


unsuitable here.  The precise - this is - this is at


bottom a routine - a routine procurement dispute.  And as


the Ninth Circuit held in this case, the plaintiffs here


had a cause of action, in fact, brought one under the


Administrative Disputes Resolution Act that is essentially


a bid protest statute.


And there are two features of that statute that


are inconsistent with antitrust liability in this setting. 

First of all, Congress expressly provided that the


standard of review in such an action is the arbitrary and


capricious standard of the APA, meaning that the Postal


Service, like any other Federal agency subject to that,


has to have broad latitude -


QUESTION: It seems to me, Mr. Kneedler, this is


an argument that you don't have an antitrust violation


here, but we're concerned with the problem of whether you


had a classic violation, say they agreed with somebody


else on the prices they would charge for advertising the


Olympics or something like that, where you had a clear -

here you don't have it clear.  I think it's arguable


whether the alleged violation - but that's not the issue


before us.


MR. KNEEDLER: Well, except - except to this


extent.  In - in virtually every direction you turn, in


looking on how - on how disputes involving the Postal


Service are handled, you find a governmental dispute


resolution mechanism, and that - this was the point about

QUESTION: Supposing there was a - one of these


antitrust violations that involved abuses of patents in


order to extend a monopoly or something like that, that


could be a classic antitrust violation.  But you say there


are other Federal remedies there?


MR. KNEEDLER: There - there might be - there


might be remedies under some of the statutes mentioned


here.  There - I mean, Congress has expressly subjected

the United States to suit under the Lanham Act, under the


copyright statute, under - under the trademark laws, under


the patent laws, but - and - and then there are these


procurement statutes that I mentioned that are applicable


in this particular case.  But in this case as well,


Congress did not provide for treble damages.  The only


monetary relief a plaintiff could get in this procurement


situation, as we point out in our brief under the


Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, is bid preparation


costs, not treble damages.


QUESTION: What if - what if the Post Office buys


a lot of paper from somebody and doesn't pay for it? 


What's - what is the remedy of that person on a contract?


MR. KNEEDLER: There would be an alternative


remedies.  Before the Contract Disputes Act was passed,


the Postal Service could have been sued itself in its own


name under the sue-and-be-sued clause, or in the Tuck -


under the Tucker Act in the - in the Court of Claims.  Now


under the Contract Disputes Act, Congress has made that


statute applicable to the Postal Service just as it has to


other Federal entities.


QUESTION: And that could be - that sort of an


action could be brought under the Contract Disputes Act?


MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.  And there is specifically a


Postal Service board of contract appeals, just there - as

Postal Service enters a final decision after - after


receiving the input from the Postal Rate Commission, there

for the review?


MR. KNEEDLER: Under - under the Postal


Reorganization Act, the provisions beginning in - in


section 3601 of the act address rate-making and


classification, and there are specific standards there


that the Postal Rate Commission and the Postal Service


must adhere to.


QUESTION: And - and would it eliminate this


possibility of predatory lowing - lowering rates for -


MR. KNEEDLER: They - they are designed to.  The


- the - the way the - the way the act operates, it


specifies that each classification - first - two things:


one, overall, the Postal Service rates are to be set at a


rate so that they - the income will roughly equal 

expenditures.  And then within each class, Congress has


provided the direct and indirect costs of that class are


to be allocated to it, along with some - an appropriate


portion of the institutional costs, the things that are


difficult to - to allocate to any one - any one class.


QUESTION: Of course, this only becomes a real


problem when the Postal Service turns a profit on its


monopoly business, which it has not yet succeeded in


doing, has it?


MR. KNEEDLER: Well, and - and it's not - over


the long term, over the long term since the Postal

Reorganization Act, I believe that the Postal Service is


within about a billion dollars of breaking even.  There


are times when it is in a deficit.  There are times when


it is in a surplus, but the statutory goal is that it -


that it be roughly equal balance between - between income


and expenditures.


QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a basic


question I just kind of forgotten that I thought I knew


about, but I thought the Postal Service had a monopoly of


the business of delivering letters and packages, and that


these competing services are only allowed to exist by some


special privilege granted by the Postal Service.


MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.  That's true for letters, but


not for parcel post.


QUESTION: But not for parcel, I see.


MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.  There's - there's an - the


Postal Service adopted an exception to the private express


statutes for urgent letters, which - which has allowed


organizations like Federal Express to carry letters for


urgent delivery.  Absent that exception, they would - that


practice would be prohibited by the - by the private


express statutes.


But the - the idea that the Postal Service


competes with non-Federal entities is not new.  As I - as


I pointed out, the Postal Service began competing with

money orders before the turn of the last century, for 50


years have had savings deposits with up to 4 million


depositors that competed with savings associations, so and


- and it's competed - it went into the parcel post


business, the parcel delivery business in 1913 alongside


of other businesses.


So that - that sort of competition with private


businesses has - has occurred since well before the Postal


Reorganization Act, and nothing in the Postal


Reorganization Act changes the way in which that should be


regarded under the - under the antitrust laws.


If the Court has no further questions, I'd like


to reserve the balance of my time.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. 

Mr. Krent, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD J. KRENT


ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS


MR. KRENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:


As Justice Scalia noted, Congress launched the


Postal Service into the commercial world in 1970,


authorizing it to compete in any market of its own


choosing, and this new commercial entity fits comfortably


within the term, person, under the antitrust laws for at


least four distinct reasons.

 First, this is unlike any other Federal entity


in the fact that the Postal Service has been authorized to


decide which markets it wants to compete into.  It's not


competing in order to fulfill a specific congressional


mission, but rather to compete in order to break even to


make money.


Second, Congress has directed the Postal Service


enter these markets with scant regulatory oversight.  The


APA, the Postal Rate Commission, the Federal acquisition


regulations, all do not apply when the Postal Service is


acting under its non-monopoly powers.


QUESTION: You're saying then that the Cooper


decision doesn't affect your argument, because the - the


Congress has separated the Post Office Department from the 

- from the executive?


MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.  And in


many other contexts, though, it's clear that this Court


has recognized that the Postal Service should be distinct


from the United States, the Franchise Tax opinion, the


Loeffler decision, and I think the other -


QUESTION: Well, neither of those are quite in


point.


MR. KRENT: Neither are involved in separate


cause of action, but both involve this Court's recognition


that the Postal Service is not the same as United States

and should be treated differently.


QUESTION: But what do you do with the statutory


language that it's an establishment of the executive


branch of the Government of the United States?


MR. KRENT: Well, I think it is an establishment


of the executive branch, and it keeps some kind of


connection to the United States, and so, for instance,


Congress evidently cared about the fact that, given the


monopoly given over letter mail, that there would be some


tie.  I mean, the - the President cannot, can neither


appoint nor discharge the Postmaster General, but yet


there is some link between the President and the Postal


Service.  Yet financially, the Postal Service is


independent.


QUESTION: There isn't any Postmaster General


anymore, is there?


MR. KRENT: Well, there - there is, Your Honor,


in terms of the individual who's so-called under the


statute the executive official of the - of the United


States, and that individual is to - is also a member of


the Board of Governors of the Postal Service and is to


direct and execute the business operations of the Postal


Service.


QUESTION: How is he selected?  By the Board of


Governors?

 MR. KRENT: Chosen by the Board of - yes, Your


Honor.  And I think that, again, Evans is the separation


or the insulation of the Postal Service from direct


executive branch control.  But financially, as I


mentioned, the debts of the Postal Service are not the


debts of the United States.  Any kind of - of recovery


against the Postal Service does not come from the judgment


fund, it comes from the Postal Service fund.  Again, these


two things reflect the fact that the budget, as well as


the overall financial structure of the Postal Service, is


independent.


And - and the fourth reason, Your Honor, of why


the Postal Service is a distinct entity is - is the fact


that there is a sue-and-be-sued clause that differentiates


this case from the Sea-Land case, in which there was no


sue-and-be-sued clause.


QUESTION: It doesn't differentiate though from


the Meyer case?


MR. KRENT: No, Your Honor, and indeed, we think


though that the - these four factors together amply


demonstrate that this is a - there is a congressional


intent that the Postal Service be considered a separate,


distinct entity that can qualify under the term, person,


in antitrust laws.  And indeed, this is not an unadorned


sue-and-be-sued clause.  Congress sat and thought about

the ramifications of the sue-and-be-sued clause and


thought about what specific limitations should be grafted


on to the waiver of immunity.  It decided to make sure the


Postal Service complied with the Federal Tort Claims Act. 


It wanted to make sure that the Postal Service, despite


the distinction with the United States, viewed its own -


had different venue - had the same venue.


QUESTION: But Meyer says you have to have


something more than a sue-and-be-sued clause, that you


have to show that there's a cause of action available.  So


a sue-and-be-sued clause itself is not enough for you in


this case, don't you agree with that?


MR. KRENT: I agree, Your Honor, and indeed it's


the fact that the antitrust laws say that every person 

should be subject to the anti-competitive measures, or


pro-competitive measures, in - in the statutes.


QUESTION: Well, yes, but the - that was true -


they said that in the Cooper case too, that person, and


the Cooper Court said, no, the United States is not a


person.


MR. KRENT: That's right, Your Honor, but I think


the Cooper case must be looked at in the structure of the


decision itself, because the Cooper Court was very clear


to limit its decision.  It said that person did not equal


United States because of the fact that there were other

remedies given to the United States explicitly in the act,


and indeed, that that conformed to -


QUESTION: But certainly after the Cooper


decision, it was clear that the United States could not be


a defendant either, was it not, as well as not be a


plaintiff -


MR. KRENT: Well, it didn't matter Your Honor,


because there was no waiver of immunity.


QUESTION: Well, answer my question, will you?


MR. KRENT: I believe that it was clear, because


- but, again, I think that nobody tried to avail


themselves of that remedy because the United States had


not waived its immunity.  But this Court extended the


notion of the - of person, and to as broad as possible, 

including states, including foreign governments, as well


as associations and public corporations.


QUESTION: Didn't the Court say in Cooper, the


reason why we're not letting the United States be a person


as plaintiff, because if we did that it would follow like


the night day that they would be a person as a defendant,


and we certainly don't want them to be a person as a


defendant?  So that's right in the -


MR. KRENT: Well, we have no quarrel -


QUESTION: That's right in the opinion.  It's not


something subtle.  One of the driving forces for saying

they couldn't be - they weren't going to read into the act


plaintiff status was that this Court thought that would


mean they would be a person for defendant status.


MR. KRENT: I agree that it's in the opinion,


Your Honor, but this Court, in Georgia v. Evans, and this


Court in Pfizer, made clear to cast the Cooper decision in


the light of the fact that it was a narrow decision,


predicated not specifically on that point, Your Honor, but


rather on the notion that there was an election of


remedies, the fact that the United States could sue to


seize property under the act, the United States could


pursue criminal penalties under the act, and that


linguistically, the United States doesn't seem to fit in


within the terms, an organization or association existing 

under the law as the United States.


QUESTION: Well, the - what, the Postal


Reorganization Act was 1970?  Have any other antitrust


suits been brought against the Postal Service in that 34


years?


MR. KRENT: Not to my knowledge, Your Honor. 


However, the Department of Justice in 1977 and again in


1978, made findings suggesting that the Postal Service was


likely to be subject to the antitrust laws.


QUESTION: That's no longer the position of the


department, is it?

 MR. KRENT: That's correct.  It was soon after


the enactment of the 1970 statutes.  And indeed, there are


other entities, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority,


which has been found to be a person under the antitrust


acts, but I think it's - the fact that this is rising,


this question arises under the Postal Services is no


surprise, because the Postal Service has a roving mandate


to decide to go into the business of greeting cards in


competition to Hallmark, to go into the fact that it can


sell bicycling gear, to go into the market of the package


industry, to go into the market of calling cards and


compete against AT&T.


There is no other Federal entity to my knowledge


which has this kind of roving mandate to make money from 

Congress, and indeed, it has used this ability -


QUESTION: Well, it's an -


QUESTION: It didn't - excuse me - I didn't think


it had a mandate to make money.  I thought the statute had


ordered it to break even.


MR. KRENT: Well, it has a statute - it - it's -


it's a rough balance.  It's unclear whether it's supposed


to make a little money or lose a little money.


QUESTION: But it - but it's unlike most profit-


making institutions that are primarily engaged in trying


to make as much money as they can.

 MR. KRENT: That is correct, Your Honor, but in


the non-postal activities, the only objective is to make


money.  Certainly for universal service there are other


objectives limiting and channeling the actions of the


Postal Service, but with respect to selling bicycling gear


or selling greeting cards, the only objective the Postal


Service has is to make money, and it has tried to use this


power, and indeed, there were surpluses, as mentioned by


counsel for the Solicitor General, in several years.  So


the Postal Service can be successful at least at times,


but other times, of course, especially after 9/11, it has


seen hard times.


QUESTION: But even - even when it is, I take it


the object of the money that it makes is essentially to 

break even, maybe break even and a little bit more, on -


on the mail delivery operation, which the statute itself


recites as being a sovereign responsibility of the United


States.


MR. KRENT: Well, I think that's -


QUESTION: So, I mean, that's - that's a long way


from General Motors.


MR. KRENT: I think it - it's - there is no


shareholders, for instance, looking for a profit, but the


goal of the Postal Service in these other areas of


business, whether it's the package business or the

greeting card business, is to make money.


QUESTION: Well, it is to make money, but it is


to make money in order to subsidize a particular activity,


and I don't think - maybe I'm missing something - but I


don't think there's an indication that there's a mandate


there to maximize profits to in - in effect subsidize the


rest of the Government.


MR. KRENT: Not - not the rest of the Government


at all, because there is a segregated fund.  But it is


there to - to make sure that any kind of losses that the


Postal Service may sustain in its monopoly business can be


overcome by profits generated in the non-monopoly


business.


QUESTION: And that monopoly business is 

described in the statute as being the discharge of a


sovereign obligation of the United States, isn't it?


MR. KRENT: Absolutely.  The - the Congress has


been very clear that there is a monopoly business to be -


to be pursued here, and the Postal Service is pursuing


that.  But that's not what the Postal Service is only


about.  The Postal Service is also constructed as a


business, and that's what this Court has recognized in


Franchise Tax and in Loeffler case, and according to that


business principles, is pursuing other tasks as well.

 QUESTION: What is - what is the - what is the

MR. KRENT: It's a corporation-like form, Your


Honor, and indeed -


QUESTION: Well, but it's not a separate


corporation.


MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.  I mean,


the Postal Service has described itself as a corporation.


QUESTION: Is it - is it a partnership?


MR. KRENT: It's - it's a board of directors-


type organization with the Board of Governors serving as a


type of Board of Governors - as a board of directors - and


the Board of Governors, as mentioned earlier, chooses the 

head or the chief executive officer of, or the Postmaster


General, of the Postal Service itself.

unlike anything that one would find in - in a - in a


private profit-making organization.


MR. KRENT: That's correct.

partnership.


MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION: I mean, it is - has a distinct


structure, but I think that the Congress that launched the

Postal Service in the business and suggested that the


Postal Rate Commission, the APA, and the Federal


acquisition regulations wouldn't apply, would not have


wanted then the Postal Service to use any kind of monopoly


powers to have a tying arrangement with an entity such as,


you know, Emery Air Freight or Federal Express, it


wouldn't wanted to have -


QUESTION: Well, why isn't this the kind of


policy judgment that we ought to leave to Congress to make


explicitly?  The Post Office, as reorganized, has two


aspects to it, as you've pointed out effectively, but how


it should relate to the Antitrust Act seems to be the kind


of judgment that Congress should address expressly.  Isn't


that so?


MR. KRENT: I think, Your Honor, that the


Congress has already made that judgment by suggesting that


the Postal Service have the right to be sue and be sued,


suggesting the Postal Service -


QUESTION: Well, I thought we had already


discussed that.  I mean, the mere fact that there's a sue-


and-be-sued clause is not enough under the Meyer approach


to answer the question.  You have to -


MR. KRENT: Sure.


QUESTION: - take another step -


MR. KRENT: Right.  The -

 QUESTION:  - beyond that.


MR. KRENT: Sure, Your Honor.  The question is


whether or not the Postal Service fits within the term,


person.  We know under the antitrust laws, we know that


person can be applied to public corporations, as this


Court has held.  We know that person can be applied to


states, as this Court has held.  We know that person can


be applied to foreign governmental entities, as this Court


has held.  So the only question is whether this person can


also apply to Federal governmental entities, and we think


that it's clear that some, but very few, governmental


entities would qualify under the term, person.


QUESTION: But you - you - you concede that


before the Postal Reorganization Act, the answer to the 

question would be no?


MR. KRENT: Absolutely.


QUESTION: So you - you have to - I mean, you're


- you're not writing on a blank slate.  You - you have to


find enough in the Postal Reorganization Act to change


that answer from no to yes, and that's really the burden.


MR. KRENT: I - I agree, Your Honor.


QUESTION: Given that the Postal Service was not


subject to the antitrust laws before, something so


fundamental happened in 1970 that it is now a person under


the antitrust law.  That's - that's your -

 MR. KRENT: I fully agree with that.


QUESTION:  - your burden.


MR. KRENT: I full agree with that, and I think we can


discharge that burden if you look at the fact that the


Postal Service is financially independent, it's


administratively independent, it doesn't have to comply


with the pro-competitive measures and the Federal


acquisitions regulations, it has a sue-and-be-sued clause.


QUESTION: But its employees, are its employees


subject to the Taft-Hartley law, or - or - or are they


like - like Federal workers?


MR. KRENT: They are the only employees in the


entire government to my knowledge that must comply with 

the Taft-Hartley law, and indeed, Congress specified that


it must comply within the law, because it wanted them to


act more like a business and not have this restrictures of


other organizations within the United States as they -


following the fellow labor relations authority, Your


Honor.


QUESTION: So - so - would - would their


employees be members of the American Federation of


Governmental Employees or other unions?


MR. KRENT: I believe it's the American Postal


Workers Union, Your Honor.

 QUESTION: Postal workers union?


MR. KRENT: Yes.  So it's a - it's a separate -


they're separated again from the Government with respect


to labor relations.  And indeed, they are one of the few


governmental entities that have signified their own


operations under www-dot - dot-com.  All right, they have


decided not to become a governmental player.


QUESTION: But of course, the Reorganization Act


itself specified that they'd be subject to Taft-Hartley,


did it not?


MR. KRENT: That's correct.  And that's part and


parcel, I think -


QUESTION: So why didn't it specify that they


would be subject to the Sherman Act?


MR. KRENT: Because -


QUESTION: You see, I - I don't think that helps


you, I think it hurts you.


MR. KRENT: I don't -


QUESTION: It - it is a significant feature that


- that the - their employees are subject to Taft-Hartley,


but that - that is more than answered by the fact that it


says so in the Reorganization Act.  Why doesn't it say so


about the - about the antitrust laws?


MR. KRENT: Well, I think it's important to think


about what the Postal Reorganization Act does say.  When

it waives immunity, it makes limitations.  The limitations


are that the Postal Service must comply with the


limitations in the Federal Tort Claims Act, that it has a


different - the same venue provisions as by the United


States, and that it has some of the jurisdictional


qualities as the United States, though the - so the


limitations and ramifications of the waiver are grafted in


section 409 very clearly.  There is no other limitation,


and I think it's important to realize -


QUESTION: Yeah, but there's one - one sticking


point that - running through my mind.  The fact that they


had to waive the immunity in the sue-and-be-sued clause


suggest that they're a sovereign.


MR. KRENT: We agree that they're part of 

government, Your Honor.  There's never been any kind of


question about the fact that the Postal Service is part of


the Government.


QUESTION: And is a sovereign.


MR. KRENT: And - yes, Your Honor.  And it takes


- takes part of the - in the - in the sense that it would


have immunity, but for the waiver, clearly because


Congress created the entity, and therefore Congress


decides whether to waive the immunity.


QUESTION: Of course, if you're right, they're


subject to criminal liability under the Sherman Act too.

 MR. KRENT: Well, so are states theoretically, as


well as cities.  I don't think that would ever arise, but


that is at least a theoretical possibility and this Court


has averted to that in prior decisions as well.  The same


thing is true, of course, for cities under -


QUESTION: A criminal case with the United States


against the United States Postal Service.


MR. KRENT: Well, I don't think that's likely to


happen, Your Honor, but I think it's important that this -


this waiver allows the Postal Service also to vindicate


its own interests, right.  But for this waiver, Postal


Service could not go in and sue for any kind of antitrust


injuries, and that's not clear.


QUESTION: But Congress could have said the 

Postal Service is authorized to sue and omitted the be-


sued clause.  It could have done it that way -


MR. KRENT: That -


QUESTION: - in which there would have been no


waiver.


MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.  That


would have made this case go away.  But Congress chose not


to follow that path, and indeed, if one could think that


one launches a - an organization into the commercial


marketplace and takes away the constraints of the APA, the


FAR, the Postal Rate Commission -

 QUESTION: Well, to say launch into the


commercial marketplace, they're basically selling stamps


and nobody else is selling stamps.  What kind of a


launching is that?


MR. KRENT: Well, I think it's now for the


monopoly business, Your Honor, but the launching with -


with respect to the package delivery business, the


greeting card business, the fact that they are sponsoring


Lance Armstrong's bicycling team, these are all the areas


in which the Postal Service has decided to venture outside


of its mandate, and it's - the danger is allowing the


Postal Service to extend its monopoly power into these new


fields. 


QUESTION: Mr. Krent -


QUESTION: But when it goes into all those fields


anyway - we've made this point about 15 times - it - it


doesn't set the prices it wants.  It sets prices


controlled by a commission under a mandate that says it's


supposed to break even.


MR. KRENT: No - no - if I understand your -


QUESTION: Isn't that right?


MR. KRENT: That's not right, Your Honor.  In


terms of all these different areas, the Postal Rate


Commission does not operate whatsoever.


QUESTION: It has no - in greeting cards and so

forth?


-


MR. KRENT: No jurisdiction.  The Postal Service


QUESTION: So is it - it - and it's free?  In


other words, it doesn't - it isn't - well, you - I thought


you answered Justice Souter by saying that they do have an


obligation even there to break even overall?


MR. KRENT: Oh, overall, Your Honor, but the


Postal Rate Commission has no jurisdiction whatsoever on


the Postal Service's actions with respect to greeting


cards, bicycling gear, and the package delivery business. 


And I think that points out the danger of the monopoly


practices.  One could easily see -


QUESTION: So if in - in the greeting card 

business, they decided to go into an agreement with three


other companies, Hallmark and Smith's greeting cards, and


they were to fix their prices at $14 a greeting card,


which seems about right nowadays -


(Laughter.)


QUESTION:  - the - the - then under those


circumstances, there would be no remedy -


MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.


QUESTION: - for the consumer of the stores. 


There's no government agency anybody could appeal to?


MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.

 QUESTION: All right.  So that's -


MR. KRENT: Absolutely none.  And indeed, if


there was a tying arrangement of trying to say, if you


want our postal services then you have to buy our greeting


cards, to follow your example, no remedy whatsoever there


as well, so that all these kinds of fear of predatory


pricing, tying arrangements, monopolistic prices, the -


there's a danger -


QUESTION: Well, but there - there wouldn't be a


remedying as the Postal Service, but I assume you could


sue American Greetings and Hallmark and whoever else had


conspired with the Postal Service.


MR. KRENT: You might, unless it was a tying


agreement, Your Honor. 


If it was just the universal, 

unilateral action of the Postal Service with a tying


arrangement, there would be no remedy.


QUESTION:  If it was unilateral action, they'd


be -


QUESTION: We won't sell you any stamps unless


you buy our greeting cards?


MR. KRENT: You never know.  One never knows.


QUESTION: It might happen, I suppose.


QUESTION: Mr. Krent, can we go back to Sea-


Land, where I thought that the first point made in that


decision was indeed as a result of the change in the APA

that Alaska Railroad could be sued for injunctive relief. 


The Court said, yeah, they could be sued like any person,


not for damages, but for injunctive relief.  And then it


said, but this is the question of whether Congress


authorized them to be a defendant in an antitrust case is


a totally discrete question, it has nothing to do with the


waiver of sovereign immunity.


MR. KRENT: Well, indeed, that - that's right,


Your Honor, and indeed, the difference in - in Sea-Land is


the fact that the Alaska Airlines never had a - never had


to argue that they were separate from the United States. 


Their argument was that the United States could be sued


for its proprietary activities under the Sherman Act. 


They didn't argue that they were a distinct entity, so 

they never said that - there was no - they agreed that


there was no sue-and-be-sued clause, and so that whole


argument that we're making in this case was never even


raised in Sea-Land.


QUESTION: Well, I'm - from the Court's point of


view, it - the Court made as a threshold determination


that the railroad could be sued for equitable relief, so


it could be sued.  And then it says, but that doesn't


answer the question, we have to determine whether there is


a claim, any claim under the antitrust laws, and on that


the Court relied on Cooper.

 MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor, because


of the Court's holding that the Alaska Airlines did not


qualify under the term person under the antitrust laws. 


And it's our contention, because the Postal Service is not


structured anywhere like the Alaska Airlines, because it's


- Alaska Airlines did not have a separate budget, the


Alaska Airlines could not sue and be sued, the Alaska


airlines had to comply with the APA, unlike the Postal


Service, that the Postal Service is a person, whereas the


Alaska Airlines and the SBA and the Department of Commerce


and HUD would not be persons under the antitrust law.  So


it's a very narrow argument predicated on the structure -


QUESTION: Eleven people running this, nine of 

whom were appointed by the President of the United States,


I take it that's your -


MR. KRENT: I'm sorry -


QUESTION: I take it that the directors are


appointed by the President of United States, almost all of


them.


MR. KRENT: Except for the Postmaster and the


Deputy Postmaster.


QUESTION: All right.  So nine out of the eleven


are appointed.  Are they confirmed by Congress?


MR. KRENT: By the Senate, sure.

MR. KRENT: Well, I've never seen their license


plates, your Honor, but I'm -


QUESTION: But, I mean, and - and they say that


they're part of the Government, and 80 or 90 percent of


what they do is not what private industry does at all and


you have remedies against all of it except - under other


statutes or powers of review within the Government, except


for a small portion, I take it it is a small portion, this


greeting card business.


MR. KRENT: Well, we're focusing on the 20


percent we agree -


QUESTION: All right, then, so you're - in other


words, I thought you were selling them sacks, you wanted


to sell them burlap sacks.


MR. KRENT: Well, they're not burlap, but yes,


they are -


QUESTION: Well, whatever they are -


MR. KRENT: - they are sacks.


QUESTION: - they're some kind of sack.


MR. KRENT: Sure.


QUESTION: Aren't they used for mail?


MR. KRENT: They are used for international mail,

QUESTION: All right, so - and they make

Motors now can make a treaty.


MR. KRENT: I agree with you, Your Honor.


QUESTION: All right, so - so it wouldn't help


you if we said that in the vast bulk of their business


where they have all of these characteristics I just


mentioned -


MR. KRENT: Well, I think it would, Your Honor.


QUESTION: - that it - it would help you?  How?


MR. KRENT: I think it would because I think the


argument here -


QUESTION: They're selling the sacks for the 

greeting cards too?


MR. KRENT: I think that what - actually that


they probably do, but the - the - the gravamen here is


that there was a conspiracy to monopolize the mail sack


business, as well as the -


QUESTION: Of course there was.  Don't they have


a right to monopolize the mail sack business or not? Isn't


there some -


MR. KRENT: No.

 the monopoly -


QUESTION: Statute.  Then why don't you go to the


commissions that run them and tell them they can't do it?


MR. KRENT: Well, there - there is a procurement


claim pending, Your Honor, but the Postal Rate Commission


would not have jurisdiction over the - the mail sack


purchase at all, Your Honor.  And so the - the fear is


that these kind of - of trade practices that are anti-


competitive can go on without any kind of direct


restraint.  Certainly there is an overlap between


procurement and antitrust, but it's not congruent in that


sense.


I think it's helpful to think about what


Congress intended by waiving the Postal Service's immunity 

in the sue-and-be-sued clause.  Clearly it has to apply to


something.  There was some point in waiving the immunity


of the Postal Service.  We know, for instance, at least I


think that the Government has conceded, that the Postal


Service is now subject to torts at state law torts.  The -


Franchise Tax suggested that the Government -


QUESTION: Well, I - I thought conceded they were


subject to Federal Tort Claims Act?


MR. KRENT: But the waiver was for torts and then


the limitation in the waiver said that the procedures of


the Federal Tort Claims Act must be applied, but clearly

there's a waiver -


QUESTION: Even though it's a state court action


against the Post Office?


MR. KRENT: That's correct, just as it would be


in any - for other Federal entity, but, for instance, the


-


QUESTION: So the - the Post Office can be sued


in state court then for a - for a state tort?


MR. KRENT: Well, it could be, except for the


fact that the - the limitations of the Federal Tort Claims


Act apply by virtue of 409.


QUESTION: Well, that's - that what I thought I


asked you a minute ago -


MR. KRENT: Well then -


QUESTION: - and you said something different.


MR. KRENT: Well, I'm sorry if I misunderstood


your question, Your Honor, but the - the argument then is


that - that in other kinds of cases, such as the state law


that said person in the Franchise Task - Tax - whether


that - the question is whether that applies to the Postal


Service as well, and of course in this Court, upheld the


determination that the Postal Service would comply under


the term person under the state law as well.


So how far does person apply?  Contract law,


tort law, what about the Lanham Act, the trademark case?

Before the recent amendments to the Lanham Act that were


mentioned recently, the - all the statute said was that it


was applied to persons, and three courts of appeals


suggested that even though person could not apply to the


United States, person could apply to the Postal Service,


by virtue of its distinct status.


QUESTION: But I thought the Lanham Act,


definition written right into the Lanham Act was that a


person within the meaning of that act is an organization


capable of suing and being sued.MR. KRENT: Yes, but courts


had said that the United States, previous to that, did not


fall within the term person, because the person doesn't


refer to governmental entities at all. So there the courts


had distinguished -


QUESTION: It said it with respect to the


antitrust law in Cooper, but the Lanham Act defined person


differently.


MR. KRENT: But just slightly, Your Honor.  The


only difference was the capable-of-being-sued part.  The


United States is also capable of being sued.


QUESTION: But I - I thought that was what was


critical, that any organization capable of suing and being


sued was within the Lanham Act.


MR. KRENT: But the United States, Your Honor,


can also be sued and is capable of suing itself, so I'm

not sure that that distinguishes it, and indeed, under

liable, and yet the Postal Service had registered


trademarks in its own name, the Postal Service had


registered copyrights in its own name, even though the


United States cannot hold copyrights, and there is an


exception -


QUESTION: But isn't there a good reason for


that?


MR. KRENT: Well, I think there is a good reason.


QUESTION: To stop people from engaging in


designed piracy in stamps?


MR. KRENT: And indeed, if that were all that the


Postal Service had filed for, I would be - I would be in 

total agreement with Your Honor.  But the Postal Service


had filed for 300, at least 350, I believe, copyrights,


books, training manuals, things that have nothing to do


with the protection for the legitimacy of - of stamps.


So again, the Postal Office has defined itself


through its actions as a person in comparable commercial


tort situations.  It's only logical that if a Postal


Service in the commercial world, saying that it's not like


the United States for copyrights, for trademarks, then


it's not like United States with respect to antitrust.

Honors, and it took away the APA, the Postal Rate


Commission for these non-monopoly actions, as well as the


Federal acquisition regulations, certainly there was a


quid pro quo.


If you streamline the operations of the Postal


Service, launch it into business, you would expect the


private commercial torts in antitrust laws to be the


restraint to make sure that the monopoly is not extended


to the other kind of operations.  And so I think that


Congress' intent is quite clear that the Postal Service is


unique, does not partake of the United States, and


therefore, just as the Postal Service can be sued in tort


law and under the Lanham Act, be it the old Lanham Act,


the new Lanham Act, it can be sued under the antitrust 

laws as well. 


The burden, therefore, on the Solicitor General


to explain why Congress would have wanted the Postal


Service's monopoly to be extended, and why Congress would


have wanted the Postal Service to be sue - to be able to


be sued and to sue themselves without really being able to


take advantage of the opportunity to sue in their own name


under the antitrust laws or under trademark and copyright


law, et cetera, and why they shouldn't be sued as well. 


If there are no further questions, thank you.


QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Krent.

 Mr. Kneedler, you have six minutes remaining.


REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


MR. KNEEDLER: Several points, Mr. Chief Justice. 


In addition to the other statutes that I've mentioned with


respect to the right to sue, there are a number of other


respects in which Congress has treated the Postal Service


as a Federal entity.  It's subject to their Freedom of


Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Inspector General


Act, it's subject to the Federal sector OSHA regulations,


and as this Court pointed out in the Loeffler decision,


it's subject to the Federal sector Title VII prohibitions,


not - it's not treated as a private corporation for


purposes of Title VII.


It is subject to the National Labor Relations


Act, but this act was passed in 1970 before the Federal


sector labor - labor management provisions came in in the


Civil Service Reform Act, and as you pointed out, Justice


Scalia, that's an express provision subjecting the Postal


Service to something that otherwise applies to private


entities, but in - but in virtually every other respect,


Congress has specified that it would be subject to Federal


law.


And in section 409 of the act, with respect to


judicial proceedings, Congress specified that the Postal

Service would be - would be treated just like the United


States, not just with respect to Tort Claims Act, but


venue, removal jurisdiction, and representation by the


Attorney General.


But the - the most fundamental point, however,


to be made is that this is not a situation in which


Congress has created a new entity and launched, in that


sense, that entity into a private commercial world.  Here,


Congress has carried forward the nation's tradition of


treating postal services as sovereign functions performed 


by the Government of the United States.  These are - these


are - to the extent they're commercial functions and - and


they are unusual commercial functions, the Constitution


treats them as - as something of particular interest to 

the United States Government.


I should point out that with respect to the


postal services, all postal services are subject to the


jurisdiction of the Postal Rate Commission, not just those


that are subject to monopoly, that - that the Postal


Service has monopoly control over, Justice Breyer.  So


even in those areas in which the Postal Service is subject


to competition in - in parcel and express mail, for


example, the Postal Service - the Postal Rate Commission -


does have regulatory jurisdiction over those -

 MR. KNEEDLER: It does not over greeting cards,


but the non-postal functions of the Postal Service


constitute less than 1 percent of the revenues of the - of


the Postal Service.  We're talking about a very minor


aspect of the Postal Service's operations, and the


affirmative authorization for the Postal Service to engage


in that in section 404(7) of the act is cast in the same


terms as the Postal Service's authorization to engage in


all the other functions and they're really incidental.


QUESTION: But the fact that it's only - the fact


that it's only 1 percent means they're only liable under


the antitrust laws for 1 percent of their business.


MR. KNEEDLER: No, I think - I think it shows


that - that - that the predominant character of the Postal 

Service is as it always has been, and these - these other


services are really in most ways incidental to - to postal


services like greeting cards and - and that sort of thing.


QUESTION: But they're the services that they


want to bring suits under.  That's -


MR. KNEEDLER: This - this is - this is not -


this is not that.  This case is a - is an ordinary


procurement dispute that - all Federal agencies engage in


procurement and - and -


QUESTION: That's the curious thing about this


suit.  It actually represents a portion of the monopoly

business, of using the monopoly to - to monopolize


procurement.


MR. KNEEDLER: And in procurement, and in


procurement in particular, Congress has treated the Postal


Service like all other - all other Federal agencies under


the Contract Disputes Act, particularly with respect to


the disputes at issue here.  So in the end we believe


that, as Justice O'Connor said, this is essentially a


policy choice for Congress.  If - if in the current


climate the Postal Service is to be subject to the


antitrust laws, notwithstanding the fact that it remains a


governmental entity, that is a - that is a choice that


Congress should make, whether these governmental


activities should be regulated by treble damage actions, 

which was extremely unusual under - under Federal


statutes. 


And where Congress has chosen to subject the


United States to liability under statutes such as this,


but not nearly as free-ranging in the patent laws, et


cetera, it has done so expressly, and we think 30 years


after the passage of the Postal Reorganization Act, that


if the - if the Postal Service is now to be subject to the


antitrust laws, that is something for Congress to do and


not for the courts to try to divine from complete silence


in the Postal Reorganization Act or its legislative

history on that point.


If there are no further questions.


QUESTION: Do they really sell biking gear?  They


don't sell biking gear.  Do they sell biking gear?


MR. KNEEDLER: I - I'm not sure whether they - I


- I don't know whether they sell biking gear.  The fact


that they - the fact that they use the Postal Service team


in - in - in promoting Postal Service products, I think,


doesn't say anything about whether they're subject -


QUESTION: They might deliver some mail on


bicycles, I mean -


(Laughter.)


MR. KNEEDLER: It's entirely possible.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. 

Kneedler.  The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 10:59 a.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
