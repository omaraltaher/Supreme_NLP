 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear 


argument now on number 03-472 -- 475, Richard B. 


Cheney vs. United States District Court.  General 


Olson? 


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS


 GENERAL OLSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 


10 

it please the Court: 


11

 This is a case about the separation of 


12 

powers.  The Constitution explicitly commits to the 


13 

President's discretion the authority to obtain the 


14 

opinions of subordinates and to formulate 


15 

recommendations for legislation.  Congress may 


16 

neither intrude on the President's ability to perform 


17 

these functions, nor authorize private litigants to 


18 

use the courts to do so. 


19

 As this Court has construed the Federal 


20 

Advisory Committee Act to avoid what the Court 


21 

regarded and described as formidable constitutional 


22 

questions, FACA does not permit the litigation and 


23 

discovery the Respondents wish to pursue. 


24

 QUESTION:  Would you say it's also a 


25 

separation of powers question, Mr. Olson, to the


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

3 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

2 

3 

4

extent that it involves the ability of the courts to 


formulate rules to prevent them from deciding 


questions unnecessarily? 


 GENERAL OLSON:  I'm not sure I understand 


5 

the thrust of your question. 


6

7 

8 

9 

 QUESTION:  Well, you said this is a case 


about separation of powers.  And I wanted -- I asked 


whether or not the authority of the courts is not 


also involved here, because there is a concern that 


10 

we should have rules designed to prevent us from 


11 

unnecessarily deciding questions. 


12

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, with respect to 


13 

the -- I'm not sure whether you are asking a question 


14 

about the jurisdiction of the Court, because that's 


15 

an issue that's before the Court, or with respect to 


16 

construing the Federal Advisory Committee Act to 


17 

avoid the constitutional questions that are implicit 


18 

in that statute. 


19

 We think that there is jurisdiction in 


20 

this Court.  We think that what the Court did in 


21 

Public Citizen was make it very clear that because of 


22 

the formidable constitutional questions, in fact, the 


23 

Court referred to the constitutional questions in 


24 

that case as undeniable. 


25

 The Court construed the Federal Advisory 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

4 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

2 

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8

Committee Act not to apply in that case.  If that 


same rationale is applied here, the Court will not 


get to the constitutional question which FACA would 


inevitably raise if it intruded upon the President's 


power to obtain opinions from his subordinates, and 


to make recommendations to Congress with respect to 


legislation. 


 QUESTION:  General Olson, we would also 


9 

not get to it if we adhered to the firm final 


10 

judgment rule which is the first hurdle that you have 


11 

to overcome.  You wouldn't get to the merits if there 


12 

is no jurisdiction for us to review at this point. 


13

 GENERAL OLSON:  That's true, Justice 


14 

Ginsburg.  This case fits squarely, we submit, within 


15 

what the Court decided unanimously in the United 


16 

States vs. Nixon for two reasons.  In the first 


17 

place, a denial of immediate review would render 


18 

impossible any review whatsoever of the claims, the 


19 

separation of powers claims that are being made here, 


20 

because the Vice President -- and the Vice President 


21 

is acting as the subordinate and surrogate for the 


22 

President here.  This is the President's authority. 


23

 QUESTION:  Well, of course, in the Nixon 


24 

case, the President exercised his privilege and it 


25 

was overruled.


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

 GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, Justice Kennedy


 QUESTION:  So it's not, it's not on all 


3 

fours in that sense. 


4

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, it's not all fours 


in that sense, but the principle as articulated by 


the Court on pages 683 -- I mean 691 to 692.  What 


the Court was concerned about there is that the 


traditional contempt avenue or any aspect of what 


would be required of the President of the United 


10 

States to defy a court order would be both unseemly 


11 

and would unnecessarily provoke a constitutional 


12 

confrontation. 


13

 What the Court said in that case, when we 


14 

are talking about, when the Court is talking about 


15 

important separation of powers questions, the 


16 

President is in the position of having to defy a 


17 

court order, risk sanctions of some sort. 


18

 QUESTION:  But you are not defying a court 


19 

order if you exercise a privilege.  Or if you assert 


20 

a privilege. 


21

 GENERAL OLSON:  With respect, Justice 


22 

Kennedy, this case, the separation of powers issue in 


23 

this case goes far beyond the assertion of executive 


24 

privilege.  Executive privilege concerns itself with 


25 

particular documents or a concern over the 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

9 

relationship that particular documents refer to.  The 


objection here is to the process. 


 The President and the Vice President are 


being subjected to litigation and discovery which 


goes far beyond what the statute would require here. 


 QUESTION:  It's essential to the 


Government's position, I take it, that this Court 


reject the de facto doctrine that was developed by 


the Court of Appeals. 


10

 GENERAL OLSON:  We think, Mr. Chief 


11 

Justice, that the de facto doctrine is wrong.  It's 


12 

inconsistent with Public Citizen, and if the Court 


13 

were to construe -- find that somehow that the 


14 

statute could be construed to create a de facto 


15 

doctrine, which no court has ever done, finally done 


16 

in connection with a case, that the case, the statute 


17 

would be unconstitutional as it applied to these 


18 

circumstances. 


19

 However, Mr. Chief Justice, we believe 


20 

that the Court does not need to get there by 


21 

construing the statute narrowly, as the Court did in 


22 

Public Citizen, unanimously, I might say, because 


23 

three of the eight justices felt that the statute, if 


24 

it were construed any other way, would be 


25 

unconstitutional.  Construing the statute in that

fashion -­

9 

 QUESTION:  When you say construe it 

narrowly, but nonetheless, retain the de facto 

doctrine? 

 GENERAL OLSON:  No.  Not deal with it at 

all.  I mean, the statute itself, we submit, 

addresses -- I think in the context of this case, 

Mr. Chief Justice, the statute may be construed in 

the context of a Presidential advisory group 

10 

explicitly excluding a committee that's formed of all 

11 

government employees, and as construed by the Court 

12 

in that case, either -- the words used in the statute 

13 

are established or utilized.  As construed by that 

14 

case, this commission was established by the 

15 

President.  It would be exempt on its face from 

16 

application of FACA. 

17

 QUESTION:  But what if it's, what if 

18 

it's -- what if the manner in which it's utilized is 

19 

that, in fact, outsiders, nongovernment employees, 

20 

were actually given a vote, that when the committee 

21 

took a vote, there were some nongovernment employees 

22 

who were counted? 

23

 GENERAL OLSON:  We submit, Justice Scalia, 

24 

that that would raise very serious constitutional 

25 

questions.  As an antecedent to that, there was no 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

9 

intention when Congress passed a statute to prohibit 


or regulate ex parte communications between the 


executive branch and members of the public. 


 QUESTION:  Well, this is, this is more 


than ex parte communications.  It's that the 


committee is in fact, as utilized, not a committee 


composed exclusively of government employees.  All 


I'm saying is the people voting, the people voting, 


why would that be such an intrusion upon the 


10 

executive?  Simply to require knowledge of whether 


11 

anybody that voted on the various recommendations of 


12 

the commission was a nongovernment employee.  Why 


13 

would that be such a terrible -­

14

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I'm going to, I'm 


15 

going to quote from the Public Citizen decision 


16 

itself, which authoritatively and specifically 


17 

defined the term or utilized in a way which would be 


18 

flatly inconsistent with this question that you just 


19 

raised. 


20

 But I also want to mention, and would want 


21 

to go on to say, that would require that the courts 


22 

ignore the presumption of regularity which applies to 


23 

the executive, particularly when the executive is 


24 

performing core executive branch functions, which it 


25 

clearly is in this case.

 But to get back to your question, the 


court in Public Citizen, on page 462, specifically 


defined what or utilized meant in that case.  And 


defined it in this way, in order to avoid the 


undeniable formidable constitutional questions that 


would be raised if it was defined as you suggested. 


The Court said -­

 QUESTION:  General Olson, would you 


9 

clarify why we are dealing with the merits.  I 


10 

thought, and correct me if I misunderstand this, that 


11 

the merits will have to be resolved in the first 


12 

instance by the court below.  If we find that there 


13 

is jurisdiction, if we agree with you, for example, 


14 

that this discovery should not have been allowed, 


15 

then why should we take the first view of the merits 


16 

of this case? 


17

 GENERAL OLSON:  It seems to me in the 


18 

context of this case, Justice Ginsburg, that once 


19 

jurisdiction is acknowledged, the context of the 


20 

case, the administrative record, which specifically 


21 

contains within it the Presidential directive which 


22 

created the advisory committee only to include 


23 

members of the executive branch.  The report of the 


24 

committee, which specifically identifies as members 


25 

only members of the executive branch, and the

affidavit or declaration that's on file from the 


deputy director, which said that the only 


participants were members of the executive branch, 


and the presumption of reliability, of regularity 


that the Court consistently, U.S. vs. Armstrong is 


one case, the Court consistently, absent clear 


evidence to the contrary, accords executive branch 


action -­

 QUESTION:  But you would still be asking 


10 

us to resolve the merits in the first instance, not 


11 

to review any lower court decision because they said 


12 

there ought to be discovery first. 


13

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, but we are 


14 

submitting that the discovery itself violates the 


15 

Constitution, violates FACA as properly construed. 


16

 QUESTION:  All discovery, not -- you are 


17 

not -­

18

19

 GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, because -­

 QUESTION:  But isn't that simply the basic 


20 

argument on the merits again.  The reason -- I think 


21 

you're saying the reason we can't have discovery is 


22 

because the whole statute is unconstitutional as 


23 

applied to the President.


24

 GENERAL OLSON:  Unconstitutional if it --


25 

if applied in these circumstances.  Now, it may be

9 

 QUESTION:  Yes.  If we go -- I mean, if we 


do what Justice Ginsburg is trying to do, and that is 


get to the jurisdictional issue without passing, in 


the first instance, as accord in the first instance 


on the merits, then it seems to me that the 


jurisdictional question, boils down to me at least


to this.  Why should we accept your position on 


jurisdiction when jurisdiction goes to the propriety 


10 

with constitutional overtones, of course, of 


11 

discovery, and we don't have the discovery order 


12 

refined yet. 


13

 If this case goes back or if it had indeed 


14 

not been appealed in the first place, you would have 


15 

been fighting with your colleagues on the other side 


16 

about what specific discovery to allow.  Once we knew 


17 

what the District Court specifically was going to 


18 

allow, we would have a fairly sharply focused 


19 

question, and that arguably would be subject to an 


20 

appeal regardless of the final judgment rule.  But we 


21 

don't have that focus yet. 


22

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, there is two answers 


23 

to that -- at least two, Justice Souter.  In the 


24 

first place, the discovery was ordered by the 


25 

District Court.  It may be found at pages 215 to 220.

 QUESTION:  But you never came down -- I 

realize that, I have read the orders.  But you never 

came back, or the Government never came back and 

said, well, that order is too broad because, and we 

think it could be allowed to this extent, and there 

was -- there was no, as I understand it, there was no 

process of trying to refine the discovery order down 

to anything beyond the generalities that we have on 

the record. 

10

 GENERAL OLSON:  Every effort was made with 

11 

respect to the actions of the litigants in the 

12 

District Court to refine it as much as possible.  The 

13 

District Court finally said this is what I order.  I 

14 

order the Petitioners not to file any dispositive 

15 

motions.  I order the Petitioners to respond to the 

16 

discovery, to reply to nonprivileged discovery 

17 

requests and assert executive privilege, which we are 

18 

saying -­

19

 QUESTION:  And you did not assert any 

20 

executive privilege. 

21

 GENERAL OLSON:  No.  We did not.  We did 

22 

not. 

23

 QUESTION:  So we don't know what might be 

24 

subject to executive privilege, and sustained, 

25 

perhaps, and what would not be.  And it's the what 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

9 

would not be that would raise the constitutional 


issue that you are trying to raise.  And it seems to 


me, until we know exactly what that is, there is a 


pretty good argument that the final judgment rule 


should not be subject to exception at this point. 


 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, I think that there 


is a very strong case that it should be, Justice 


Souter.  The Court of Appeals addressed this issue, 


too, and said, well, the District Court might have 


10 

been too broad.  In fact, the Circuit Court, the 


11 

Court of Appeals recognized the constitutional 


12 

implications and then said, but maybe that can be 


13 

narrowed down, but that the Respondents should be 


14 

entitled to whatever discovery they need to prove 


15 

their case. 


16

 QUESTION:  Was the District, was the 


17 

District Court's discovery order unconditional? 


18

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, it was -- I don't 


19 

know what you mean by -­

20

 QUESTION:  Well, I mean, did it say, you 


21 

know, the Government must produce thus and so, thus 


22 

and so, thus and so? 


23

 GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, it did, Mr. Chief 


24 

Justice, although it did say that the Government 


25 

could assert privileges with respect to burden or 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

executive privilege, and so forth.  But if one looks 


at those discovery orders and they are in the joint 


appendix, they were much broader than the statute 


itself, broader than the relief that possibly could 


 -­

 QUESTION:  But now we are dealing with the 


situation at the two, the two justices, judges on the 


Court of Appeals both said, this is too, this 


discovery order was too broad.  It ought to be 


10 

trimmed.  Now the District judge would have that 


11 

message, so you could have gone back there and said 


12 

see, District judge, this has to be narrowed. 


13

 GENERAL OLSON:  Inevitably what would have 


14 

happened, because what the Court of Appeals said, and 


15 

this is at Petition appendix 18-A of the Court of 


16 

Appeals decision is that however refined the District 


17 

Court's order would be, they would be, the 


18 

Respondents would be entitled to whatever discovery 


19 

they needed to prove their case. 


20

 Now, what they need to prove their case, 


21 

notwithstanding the presumption of regularity that 


22 

the Court has always applied to the executive, absent 


23 

clear evidence to the contrary, there is no clear 


24 

evidence to the contrary here, Justice Ginsburg.  All 


25 

there is is a pure unadorned allegation which the

1

Respondents say they get from media reports that 


there were contacts, nothing beyond that. 


 But what they would need to prove, to 


prove their case is precisely what the District Court 


was going to allow them to utilize. 


 QUESTION:  Well, can we get to -­

 GENERAL OLSON:  In the form of -­

 QUESTION:  Can we get to the jurisdiction 


9 

point?  Why is it that you went to -- that you are 


10 

justified in going to the Court of Appeals?  Because 


11 

there is a new exception to the collateral order 


12 

doctrine, or because you are seeking mandate? 


13

14

 GENERAL OLSON:  Both, Justice Kennedy. 


 QUESTION:  What is the exception?  Is it 


15 

something new under Cox or is it on one of the before 


16 

Cox exceptions? 


17

 GENERAL OLSON:  This fits squarely within 


18 

Nixon.  When the Court said to require the President, 


19 

and remember, we are talking about the President as 


20 

the real party in interest, to place himself in the 


21 

posture of disobeying a court order, merely to 


22 

trigger the procedural mechanism. 


23

 QUESTION:  We have already discussed that 


24 

he did not -- the Vice President in this case did not 


25 

exercise his privilege.  Wasn't close to being held.

 GENERAL OLSON:  When the -­

 QUESTION:  When it involves the Vice 

8 

President, it's different? 

9

 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, it certainly does 

10 

when it involves the President or the Vice President 

11 

in core constitutional functions.  And U.S. vs. Nixon 

12 

stands for the proposition when the President must 

13 

choose between submission to an unconstitutional 

14 

order, which participation in this discovery, the 

15 

process of participation, having to prove every time 

16 

the President consults with someone, to submit to 

17 

litigation, and potentially submit to discovery, to 

18 

submit to the violation of the separation of powers, 

19 

or, or violate or challenge either sanctions or some 

20 

order from the District Court. 

21

 QUESTION:  You wouldn't have to do that if 

22 

you just asserted executive privilege as to each 

23 

discovery request that you thought would be 

24 

burdensome.  And then if that's granted, you have no 

25 

problem.  And if it's denied, you immediately come up

 QUESTION:  I know that's your legal 


argument, and you may be right about that.  But 


assuming you are right about that, you bring up the 


broader issue on an appeal from the case.  See if you 


10 

lose it.  And as to your being right, being right I 


11 

guess isn't enough to get you to appeal a discovery 


12 

order if -- but maybe you can if you really need to. 


13

 So my question is, why did you really need 


14 

to since you could have asserted executive privilege 


15 

as to each individual. 


16

 GENERAL OLSON:  Because the act of forcing 


17 

the President to invoke executive privilege every 


18 

time someone files a lawsuit, notwithstanding the 


19 

presumption of regularity which was completely 


20 

ignored here, that means that FACA would be used in 


21 

every case to file a lawsuit to challenge the 


22 

President and the Vice President's ability to -­

point, I think the Government made a Section 12(b)(6) 

motion to dismiss this suit because the statute was 

unconstitutional.  And that was denied. 

 Now, could the Government not have sought 

review either under the collateral order doctrine at 

that time, or even by mandamus to address directly 

whether the statute is constitutional? 

 GENERAL OLSON:  Potentially, Justice 

9 

O'Connor. 

10

 QUESTION:  Why didn't the Government do 

11 

that? 

12

 GENERAL OLSON:  Because the Government was 

13 

anxious -- because there was another way to resolve 

14 

this whole problem, notwithstanding the denial of the 

15 

12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. 

16

 QUESTION:  But wouldn't that have given 

17 

the courts a chance to go directly to the issue of 

18 

whether the statute is constitutional? 

19

 GENERAL OLSON:  We submit that what the 

20 

Government did here was try to work out the delicate 

21 

constitutional problems that were involved here, the 

22 

balancing of the executive's prerogative with the 

23 

litigation function and that sort of thing, and to go 

24 

the extra mile.  I don't think the Court would want 

25 

to encourage filing a mandamus or collateral order

appeals every time there is a denial of a motion to 


dismiss. 


 QUESTION:  I take it, General Olson, that 


from the rest of your argument that traditional 


executive privilege doctrine would not cover all of 


the constitutional issues that you think exist here? 


 GENERAL OLSON:  That's precisely correct, 


Mr. Chief Justice.  The forcing of the President to 


submit to litigation and discovery, which if 


10 

permitted in this case could be in any case 


11 

comparable to it, any time advice is being sought 


12 

from a citizen or from subordinates who may have then 


13 

talked to citizens, notwithstanding the clear four 


14 

corners of the directive when the President created 


15 

the body within his own Administration from which he 


16 

sought advice, every time there would be a lawsuit, 


17 

every time they would say, well, Mr. President, come 


18 

into court and claim executive privilege. 


19

 QUESTION:  I see that.  I see that.  But 


20 

that's an argument which you made in response to my 


21 

question which is an argument on the merits.  And I 


22 

want you to focus on the fact that -- assume I agree 


23 

with you on the merits.  You will have a chance to 


24 

make that argument on the merits, even if you lose 


25 

here and if you lose the case.

 Now, my question is addressed to the need 


2  for an interim appeal from the discovery.  And as to 


3  that, what is your response to the fact that you 


4  could get your interim appeal or at least preserve 


5  yourself from harm if you had asserted executive 


6  privilege to the individual bits of the discovery 


7  order with which you disagreed.


8

 GENERAL OLSON:  There is two answers to 


9  that, one of which the Chief Justice suggested in his 


10  question.  Executive privilege may not have covered 


11  every scrap of paper.  It would have required the 


12  President and the Vice President to spend time with 


13  documents deciding whether or not to assert executive 


14  privilege. 


15

 And it is the process -- more importantly 


16  than that, it is the process itself of submitting, as 


17  it would be if someone, if the Congress had applied 


18  this statute to the Supreme Court of the United 


19  States or even to itself, and then allowed litigants 


20  to bring the Court or members of Congress into court 


21  to explain why they wouldn't produce information with 


22  respect to who they talked to. 


23

 QUESTION:  Well, but Mr. Olson you know better than 


24  most the dynamics -- than most attorneys, the dynamics of 


25  the discovery system.  I hear in your argument echoes 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

21 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

of every discovery dispute I've ever listened to. 


2

3 

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9 

 GENERAL OLSON:  Yes.  There are several 


differences, Justice Kennedy.  As I said at the very 


beginning, this discovery dispute involves bringing 


the President and the Vice President of the United 


States into court to defend themselves with respect 


to textually committed obligations and 


responsibilities that they have under the 


Constitution. 


10

 Every other discovery dispute that I have 


11 

experienced, and I submit this Court has experienced 


12 

except for perhaps U.S. vs. Nixon, maybe another 


13 

case, did not involve those circumstances.  This is 


14 

at -- this puts the President, in order to challenge 


15 

the constitutionality of a process that's invasive to 


16 

fundamental Presidential prerogatives and 


17 

responsibilities into court to defend himself, 


18 

notwithstanding the questionable constitutionality of 


19 

the statute that triggers it, that mandamus may not 


20 

be brought against the Vice President which is the --


21 

the Federal Advisory Committee Act, it's worth 


22 

mentioning, does not create a private right of 


23 

action.  The APA did not create a right of action 


24 

against the Vice President here. 


25

 So the litigants in this case, not having 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

22 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 

1 

2 

3

5

8 

9 

a right to even bring this case under the statute, 


then sought mandamus, it's important to mention. 


 QUESTION:  Well, then why did the 


Government turn over 36,000 pages of paper from the 


agencies that were also a part of this action if the 


whole thing is so misguided, if the application of 


this Act violates the separation of powers, why did 


the Government respond to the request for information 


from the agencies? 


10

 GENERAL OLSON:  There are several answers 


11 

to that.  One, the agencies occupy a different 


12 

statute under the APA.  They occupy a different 


13 

position under the Freedom of Information Act.  And 


14 

therefore, the obligations were different with 


15 

respect to the President's core function.  Arguments 


16 

-­

17

 QUESTION:  But those documents that were 


18 

turned over were, as I recall, documents that would 


19 

have been available under FOIA, is that right? 


20

 GENERAL OLSON:  Yes, Mr. -- Justice 


21 

Scalia, they would have been arguably available under 


22 

FOIA, and they were produced under FOIA. 


23

 QUESTION:  But you didn't get, you didn't 


24 

make the argument that no discovery, you are very 


25 

clear about that, no discovery is appropriate under 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

23 

Alderson Reporting Company

this statute.  And yet you didn't, whether -- whether 


the information that was turned over could have been 


gotten under FOIA, this wasn't a FOIA suit. 


 GENERAL OLSON:  There was more than one 


action, Justice Ginsburg.  There were several FOIA 


actions brought against the various different 


departments. 


 QUESTION:  Well, specifically, these pages 


9 

that had been previously disclosed to other 


10 

requesters under FOIA.  The request in this case, 


11 

wasn't it made to them under the FACA? 


12

 GENERAL OLSON:  Yes.  But the documents 


13 

having already been produced and made available to 


14 

the public under FOIA, it seemed to the government 


15 

that would be foolhardy and unnecessarily 


16 

confrontational and would serve no purpose whatsoever 


17 

to withhold producing another set of those documents. 


18 

Again, this is effort -­

19

 QUESTION:  General Olson, would you 


20 

clarify one thing for me?  Were these documents 


21 

produced by agencies or were they produced by the 


22 

energy policy group.


23

 GENERAL OLSON:  They were produced by 


24 

agencies. 


25

 QUESTION:  So there has been no discovery 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

24

at all from the policy group, and you claim, of 


course, that they are totally exempt under the plain 


language of the statute.


 GENERAL OLSON:  Yes.  And Mr. Chief 


5 

Justice, if I may reserve the balance of my time. 


6

 QUESTION:  Very well.  Very well, General 


7 

Olson.  Mr. Morrison, we'll hear from you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN B. MORRISON


 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT SIERRA CLUB


 MR. MORRISON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 


11 

it please the Court: 


12

 The threshold question before this Court 


13 

is whether the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that 


14 

it lacked jurisdiction over Petitioners' attempt to 


15 

obtain interlocutory review of the District Court's 


16 

order. 


17

 In seeking review in this Court, 


18 

Petitioners paint the picture of having been backed 


19 

into a corner.  They claim that if they do not obtain 


20 

immediate appellate review that they will lose all 


21 

meaningful opportunity to obtain review of the legal 


22 

positions that they have taken in the District Court. 


23

 The basis for this claim, as the Solicitor 


24 

General said, is United States against Nixon.  The 


25 

Court of Appeals correctly distinguished that case, 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

and said that under neither mandamus or the 


collateral order was review proper. 


 The Petitioners -­

 QUESTION:  The Court of Appeals based 


that, as I recall, on the fact that in Nixon, 


executive privilege had been asserted, right? 


 MR. MORRISON:  They certainly made that 


observation, but that was not the only reason relied 


upon by the Court of Appeals.  There is some question 


10 

as to the extent to which the Court of Appeals 


11 

opinion can be read in that regard.  We do not rely 


12 

on the fact that executive privilege was not claimed 


13 

because here the Government's position is that no 


14 

discovery of any kind whatsoever, other than the 


15 

previously produced documents, is available here. 


16

 QUESTION:  I'm surprised to hear that.  I 


17 

was, I was going to talk to you about executive 


18 

privilege, because I thought that your briefs did 


19 

rely on the fact that executive privilege was not 


20 

claimed, and that doesn't seem to me a very 


21 

significant factor. 


22

 MR. MORRISON:  I thought I had been pretty 


23 

clear in my brief saying that executive privilege was 


24 

certainly something that could be claimed down the 


25 

road.  And we certainly -- the District judge had not 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

26 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Washington, DC 20005 



1 

2 

3

precluded that from happening.  But as far as we were 

concerned -­

 QUESTION:  It should make no difference to 

4 

the outcome of this. 

5

 MR. MORRISON:  It makes no difference.  It 

6 

makes no difference. 

7

8 

9 

 QUESTION:  But there is an interim 

position in which one would say, well, it makes a 

difference to this extent, that until the executive 

10 

privilege has been claimed and has been ruled upon, 

11 

the extent of -- to which they have a plausible 

12 

separation of powers argument is not clear. 

13

 I mean, we could take that position, I 

14 

take it, you would agree? 

15

 MR. MORRISON:  Yes.  That would require 

16 

accepting the notion that -- that everything else 

17 

that they can -- they can refuse to turn over 

18 

everything else, which is essentially their position 

19 

here.  The Solicitor General's brief is very clear, 

20 

no discovery, period, in this case. 

21

 QUESTION:  It would also require 

22 

acceptance of the position that executive privilege 

23 

is a definable doctrine only applicable to certain 

24 

matters, and that it is, it is the function of this 

25 

court to decide what it can be asserted for and what 

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1 

2 

3

5

9 

it can't be asserted for.  And that is not my view of 


executive privilege. 


 I think executive privilege means whenever 


the President feels that he is threatened, he can 


simply refuse to comply with a court order.  And the 


same thing with Congress.  And it ends up in a, you 


know, a struggle of the two branches.  I don't view 


that as some legal doctrine that enables him to 


withhold certain documents. 


10

 He is, he has the power as an independent 


11 

branch to say, no, this intrudes too much upon my 


12 

powers, I will not do it.  And after that, it's a, 


13 

it's a struggle between two branches.  And if you 


14 

view executive privilege that way, forcing him to 


15 

assert executive privilege is really pushing things 


16 

to an extreme that should not very often occur in 


17 

this Republic. 


18

 MR. MORRISON:  Well, leaving aside the 


19 

question of the interpretation of the United States 


20 

against Nixon as to whether that decision agrees with 


21 

Your Honor's interpretation, we don't have to get to 


22 

that issue in this case, and -- and the -­

23

 QUESTION:  I don't want to delay this. 


24 

But to me this is important.  Assume that their 


25 

interpretation of the statute is completely right. 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

28 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

Assume that. 


2

3

4 

5 

6 

7 

8 

9

 MR. MORRISON:  Yes. 


 QUESTION:  I know you don't want to, but 


for argument's sake, then what they are really asking 


for is a separate exception from the collateral 


order.  I mean, and a separate exception that allows 


them, the Vice President and the President, and 


nobody else, to take an appeal from discovery. 


 Now, executive privilege in my mind came 


10 

in by asking, well, shouldn't they at least have to 


11 

assert that it's that kind of imposition upon the 


12 

President's office prior to being able to carve out, 


13 

under whatever name, a separate exception that would 


14 

permit an appeal. 


15

 MR. MORRISON:  I don't read the 


16 

Government's brief as being that narrow.  But to the 


17 

extent that what they are saying is that they have 


18 

some kind of special immunity from discovery, it 


19 

would, as Justice O'Connor suggested earlier, have 


20 

been perfectly apparent the day of July 11th when the 


21 

court denied the motion to dismiss, and ordered that 


22 

discovery is going to take place.  That that was the 


23 

time in which the Government should have taken an 


24 

appeal if they claimed some sort of immunity like -­

 QUESTION:  Mr. Morrison -­

 QUESTION:  You can't appeal from, you 

can't appeal from the denial of the motion to 

dismiss.  That's really interlocutory. 

 MR. MORRISON:  Well, Your Honor, but --

the notion that there is a special kind of immunity 

from discovery of the President and Vice President, a 

situation like this which is what I understand their 

argument to be, that's the functional equivalent of 

10 

an immunity defense for which there is an exception 

11 

under the collateral order rule.  I disagree with the 

12 

merits of that, but if that's their argument, that's 

13 

when they should have taken the appeal. 

14

15

 QUESTION:  Are you saying -­

 QUESTION:  I wonder about that.  I can see 

16 

you coming up here and saying, everyone knows that 

17 

the motion to dismiss was denied is not 

18 

interlocutory.  There has been no discovery yet. 

19 

There's been no order.  They haven't been heard.  I 

20 

can hear that. 

21

 MR. MORRISON:  But nothing has happened of 

22 

any legal significance in the case from that time on. 

23 

The Solicitor General said the Government was trying 

24 

to work things out. 

25

 QUESTION:  Discovery order.  That's

30 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

2

significant.  The mere denial of the motion to 


dismiss did not automatically determine that there 


would be a discovery order.  The court, the court 


might have found, in accordance with the arguments of 


the Government, that discovery would be 


inappropriate. 


 MR. MORRISON:  Your Honor, with all

 QUESTION:  And so that is a new injury to 


10 

the, to the executive which they are trying to bring 


11 

up here. 


12

 MR. MORRISON:  With all respect, Your 


13 

Honor, if you read the District Court's opinion, the 


14 

principal grounds on which the District Court refused 


15 

to dismiss the case was that discovery was required 


16 

both with respect to the de facto officer issue and 


17 

with respect to -­

18

 QUESTION:  Ordinarily, that would be 


19 

summary judgment, not motion to dismiss.  Motion to 


20 

dismiss just deals with the pleadings.  You are not 


21 

talking about discovery at that stage. 


22

 MR. MORRISON:  Well, the Government, Your 


23 

Honor, had offered in evidence the Executive Order 


24 

creating the task force and a copy of the final 


25 

report.  The Knutson affidavit did not come in until 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

 QUESTION:  Then why wasn't that the end of

win the lawsuit?

 MR. MORRISON:  We can get a declaration

that it was -- that de facto has to apply.  We then

get access to all the drafts.

 QUESTION:  And are they right? 

 MR. MORRISON:  They could be interpreted 

as being right, but not in light of what the District 

Court said in his order denying the motion to 

dismiss.  He said, we are going to have very narrow, 

10 

tailored discovery designed to find out first and 

11 

foremost is the de facto officer applicable.  If you

look at our plan of discovery, which is in the joint 

13 

--

14

 QUESTION:  What is this de facto officer? 

15 

Where does that come from?

 MR. MORRISON:  It comes from a case that

Hillary Clinton task force was composed entirely of 


government employees and the working subgroups were 


also composed entirely of government employees.  The 


first question was, was the First Lady a government 


employee. 


 QUESTION:  Yes.  I understand.  But the --


as to the working groups, they were found not to be

 MR. MORRISON:  It is arguably different. 


But as Justice Ginsburg suggested earlier, since the 


Court of Appeals was the one who created this 


doctrine to begin with, it would seem inappropriate 


for this Court to try to distinguish this case from 


that one on the basis of when we, A, don't have a 


record, and B, when the Court of Appeals had never 


been allowed to pass on that particular issue. 


 QUESTION:  That's a rather strange 


10 

doctrine, that we can't tinker with what the Court of 


11 

Appeals has done, even though we disagree with it. 


12

 MR. MORRISON:  No.  It hadn't done 


13 

anything, Your Honor.  It has not ruled on that 


14 

doctrine in this case at all.  It hasn't reached the 


15 

merits.  The Court of Appeals decided nothing but 


16 

jurisdiction. 


17

 QUESTION:  And so you say that we then are 


18 

prohibited from saying the Court of Appeals de facto 


19 

doctrine is wrong? 


20

 MR. MORRISON:  I didn't say prohibiting, 


21 

Your Honor.  I said in the exercise of your 


22 

discretion, it would be appropriate to allow the 


23 

Court of Appeals in the first instance to pass on it. 


24

 Judge Randolph, by the way, Justice 


25 

Stevens, thought in his dissenting opinion that the

only way he could distinguish the two cases was to 


overrule the prior decision.  He may or may not be 


right, but it suggests to me -­

 QUESTION:  Well, why isn't it wrong?  Why 


isn't, why isn't the Court of Appeals wrong on that, 


the argument being that this is not a discovery 


statute.  This is not an ex parte communications 


statute.  This is not a Freedom of Information Act 


statute.  This is a blue ribbon committee statute. 


 MR. MORRISON:  No, Your Honor -­

 QUESTION:  And if you turn it into the 


12 

latter, you will stop -­

13

14

 MR. MORRISON:  It is partially -­

 QUESTION:  -- you will stop every --


15 

you'll stop every lower level official in government 


16 

when he is creating legislative policy from getting 


17 

on the phone and calling up whoever he pleases.  You 


18 

understand that argument.  I want your response. 


19

 MR. MORRISON:  All right.  Two responses. 


20 

First, to some extent, it is an open government 


21 

statute because part of the relief under FACA is 


22 

getting access to all the documents that the 


23 

committee prepares, including its minutes. 


24

 Second is that this statute does not 


25 

apply, except to committees.  A committee under the

Public Citizen case requires a substantial level of 


formality.  We concede that both this committee and 


the Executive Office of the President and anyone else 


can call anyone they want at any time without 


triggering FACA.  Only if you have a formalized 


committee and if you bring people in to participate 


in the same manner as other committee members -­

 QUESTION:  That would require voting. 


 MR. MORRISON:  Not necessarily, Your 


10 

Honor. 


11

 QUESTION:  I have -- I have always been 


12 

puzzled by that in your briefs, to participate in the 


13 

same manner as other committee members.  It seems to 


14 

me the essence of being a committee member is having 


15 

a vote in the outcome.  So it seems to me the only 


16 

discovery you would need is discovery as to whether 


17 

anybody who was not a government employee voted. 


18

 MR. MORRISON:  That, Your Honor, I suggest 


19 

is a question of law as to whether voting is 


20 

required, but we believe that if outsiders 


21 

participated in the marking up of drafts, they had 


22 

input into the drafts, particularly at the subgroup 


23 

level, even though they had no formal vote -­

24

 QUESTION:  Why is that?  If I bring 


25 

somebody else from my agency with me, I expect all of

these cabinet members didn't come to the meetings 


alone.  They certainly had assistants with them. 


Were those assistants members of the committee? 


 MR. MORRISON:  They were -­

 QUESTION:  Certainly not. 


 MR. MORRISON:  They didn't lose the 


exception, Your Honor, because they were full-time 


government employees. 


 QUESTION:  I'm not asking whether they 


10 

lost the exception.  I'm asking whether they were 


11 

members of the committee, and the answer has to be 


12 

no.  Now, suppose I bring instead of another 


13 

government employee with me to give me advice, I 


14 

bring a private individual with me to give me advice. 


15 

Suddenly, that private member becomes -- private 


16 

individual becomes a member of the committee even 


17 

though a government agency member -­

18

 MR. MORRISON:  It is certainly a plausible 


19 

interpretation, Your Honor. 


20

21

 QUESTION:  Not plausible to me. 


 MR. MORRISON:  Well, the statute says the 


22 

exception is composed of, wholly composed of 


23 

full-time government employees.  Congress was well 


24 

aware of this problem and it decided that it wanted 


25 

to have a very narrow exception.  At least it's an

arguable basis and we are now here on interlocutory 


appeal without any facts in the record whatsoever as 


to how these committees operated, how the subgroup 


operated.  They may have had a vote at the subgroup 


level. 


 QUESTION:  What do you say about the 


presumption that high officials of the government 


obey the statutory provisions that they are supposed 


to follow? 


 MR. MORRISON:  Well -­

 QUESTION:  You don't have any information 


12 

and belief that the people who are said to have been 


13 

appointed were really not appointed, do you? 


14

 MR. MORRISON:  They were appointed.  If I 


15 

may, Your Honor, a quote from the staff director's 


16 

affidavit, which appears in the, in the joint 


17 

appendix on page 76.  He admits, and the Government 


18 

admits, that there were substantial numbers of 


19 

meetings between outside people and the task force. 


20

 The question is what happened at those 


21 

meetings, and that's what we seek discovery.  This is 


22 

not simply an allegation.  The General Accounting 


23 

Office -­

you won the suit, and it goes back to Justice

Stevens' question.  Isn't the posture of this case 


one in which what happens at the end of discovery if 


you prevail and get discovery is substantially the 


same as if you won the suit. 


 MR. MORRISON:  Your Honor, we would get 


properly reined in discovery, as the District Court 


understood it, we would get the basic information 


about who went to the meetings, who had access to the 


drafts, whether anybody had the right to vote.  At 


10 

that stage of the proceeding, that's all the 


11 

discovery we think we are entitled to. 


12

 QUESTION:  Do you think those are fairly 


13 

concluded within the separation of powers privilege 


14 

that the Government is asserting? 


15

 MR. MORRISON:  I do not think that the 


16 

Government has any right to withhold that kind of 


17 

information in this kind of case.  And if the 


18 

Government makes -­

19

 QUESTION:  But that's, but that's the 


20 

issue. 


21

 MR. MORRISON:  Yes.  And if the Government 


22 

asserts that it has the right to withhold that 


23 

information, it may continue to assert that right. 


24 

The District Court will then proceed under Rule 37, 


25 

enter an order against it.  It can then take an

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. ORFANEDES


 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT JUDICIAL WATCH, INC.


 MR. ORFANEDES:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 


14 

it please the Court: 


15

 Judicial Watch submits there was no 


16 

jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals to review the 


17 

District Court's discovery orders, but assuming for 


18 

purposes of argument that there was jurisdiction, we 


19 

respectfully submit that the District Court properly 


20 

denied Petitioners' motion to dismiss, both as a 


21 

matter of statutory construction and consistent with 


22 

Circuit precedent and separation of powers. 


23

 QUESTION:  Well, that surely is one thing 


24 

that's not before us, is it, is the District Court's 


25 

denial of the motion to dismiss?

 MR. ORFANEDES:  Well, no -­

 QUESTION:  I mean, it's not appealable. 


 MR. ORFANEDES:  That's correct. 

The 


Government is arguing, however, that the discovery 


that the District Court did order should not have 


been ordered because of the underlying merits of the 


motion to dismiss is my understanding of the 


Government's argument.  We submit that that's a -­

 QUESTION:  They are arguing that it's not 


10 

before us -- what they are arguing is that this 


11 

statute doesn't apply, so therefore there was no 


12 

discovery.  The statute isn't one under which you can 


13 

go behind the certification of the President, the 


14 

Vice President, et cetera.  We both read their 


15 

briefs. 


16

 MR. ORFANEDES:  I think that's 


17 

indistinguishable from arguing -­

18

 QUESTION:  Okay.  Well then go ahead and 


19 

make the argument. 


20

 MR. ORFANEDES:  If you could allow me to 


21 

proceed.  The District Court ordered discovery 


22 

because it believed that it was necessary in order to 


23 

avoid the constitutional issues that the Government 


24 

is raising in their briefs.  In denying the motion, 


25 

the District Court properly applied what was Circuit

precedent at the time and is Circuit precedent, the 


AAPS case, allowing for this de facto membership 


doctrine that we have talked about. 


 The District Court thought that if 


discovery yielded information that would show there 


were no, there was no involvement of private 


individuals in the task force, then there would be no 


reason, no reason to even reach the constitutional 


issues. 


10

 QUESTION:  Involvement of private 


11 

individuals in the task force does not equate with 


12 

membership of private individuals in the task force, 


13 

and I wonder what your view is about the question 


14 

that I asked to Mr. Morrison.  What, what is it that 


15 

makes you a de facto member?  It surely can't be just 


16 

sitting there next to somebody else who is even at a 


17 

full committee meeting.  It can't be sitting next to 


18 

the cabinet member. 


19

 MR. ORFANEDES:  I think the court in the 


20 

AAPS case, that the District Court was relying on, 


21 

and that the Circuit Court was also -­

22

 QUESTION:  Yes.  Well, that case may be 


23 

wrong.  What is it that makes you de facto member? 


24 

What -- I assume it's the same thing that makes you a 


25 

member, that is the power to determine the action the 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 

43

committee will take.  That is the power to vote.

 MR. ORFANEDES:  I think it's not looking 

just at voting, but whether or not there is anything 

that functionally distinguishes the members, the de 

facto members from the actual members. 

 QUESTION:  There is.  The vote.  Let's 

assume that's the only thing that distinguishes them, 

the vote.  Isn't that enough? 

 MR. ORFANEDES:  It could be a vote.  But 

10 

there could also be -- it could also be more than 

11 

that, in this particular instance -­

12

 QUESTION:  If it's more than that, you are 

13 

not talking about de facto members.  You are talking 

14 

about de facto participants, and that's a different 

15 

--

16

 MR. MORRISON:  In this particular 

17 

instance, there was one allegation we set forth in 

18 

our complaint of policy recommendations that were 

19 

conveyed to the Vice President and those 

20 

recommendations did end up mirroring recommendations 

21 

that were -­

22

 QUESTION:  Exactly.  Now, their problem 

23 

with your interpretation of the statute, I take it, 

24 

is the following.  Forget the Vice President.  You 

25 

are Assistant Secretary of Antitrust.

 MR. ORFANEDES:  That's correct. 


 QUESTION:  You are Assistant Secretary of 


HHS in charge of drug policy.  You are trying to 


develop a legislative proposal.  Every staff person 


in the Congress, given such a task, would phone 


everyone in sight who knows about it outside the 


Congress to try to develop sound proposals. 


 And if it's a serious matter, they'd have 


9 

50 meetings with everybody under the sun.  And if you 


10 

assigned the same thing, try to do the same thing 


11 

under your interpretation of the Act, every one of 


12 

those outside people could be hit with a discovery 


13 

order, what meetings did you go to, what did you say, 


14 

what did you do. 


15

 And their final point is that Congress 


16 

could not possibly have intended in this statute to 


17 

have created that circumstance, putting government in 


18 

a cocoon when it develops legislative policy.  Now, I 


19 

have overstated what they said, but I'm trying to get 


20 

a response from you as to what I take is their basic 


21 

point. 


22

 MR. ORFANEDES:  I think that's correct, 


23 

Justice Breyer.  I don't think -­

25 

correct.

 MR. ORFANEDES:  I don't think -- I don't 


think Congress would have created such a statute, and 


I don't think they did create such a statute. 


 QUESTION:  Cause. 


 MR. ORFANEDES:  The case law that has 


interpreted the statute and the statute themselves 


requires a certain degree of formality, structure and 


continuity to an advisory committee before, before 


the requirements of the statute begin to apply. 


10 

Circuit Court precedent, including the Nader vs. 


11 

Baroody case, that I think all the parties have cited 


12 

in their brief held exactly that.  That there has to 


13 

be -- there cannot be ad hoc committee meeting or ad 


14 

hoc committee members. 


15

 QUESTION:  Explain the degree of formality 


16 

that you think triggers the statute. 


17

 MR. ORFANEDES:  Well, certainly there has 


18 

to be an establishing document, according to FACA.  I 


19 

think there has to be some degree of understanding of 


20 

what the membership of the committee is going to be. 


21 

There talks about an end point to the committee as 


22 

well. 


23

 QUESTION:  The Attorney General of the 


24 

United States turns to the head of the Antitrust 


25 

Division and says I want a legislative proposal about

Webb-Pomerene acts.  You get together with your 


counterpart at State, create an interagency task 


force and give me a document, and he announces the 


whole thing in a public speech.  Now, do we have the 


application, in your opinion, of FACA that would 


trigger the questions I mentioned? 


 MR. ORFANEDES:  That, that may trigger the 


questions that we made.  And I think there is one 


thing that's important about this particular 


10 

committee, and the document that established it. 


11 

It's a January 29th memorandum from the President. 


12 

It's in the appendix at 157, I believe. 


13

 And in that document, the Vice President 


14 

was given the discretion to create subordinate 


15 

working groups.  There is nothing in that document 


16 

that limits subordinate working groups to consisting 


17 

only of private employees. 


18

 QUESTION:  If the interagency task force 


19 

creates the FACA situation in your view, imagine that 


20 

I have repeated my first question, but simply applied 


21 

it to interagency task forces.  If you remember my 


22 

first question, it had to do with the cocoon. 


23

24

 MR. ORFANEDES:  Sorry. 


 QUESTION:  All right.  Now, what is your 


25 

response?

 MR. ORFANEDES:  I think again what becomes 


important is the membership of that task force.  And 


if that, if the idea behind creating that task force 


allowed for, in the AAPS case, outside consultants or 


consultants of undetermined origin, in this instance 


subgroups, without any limitation as to whether or 


not they would be Federal employees or not Federal 


employees, in that instance, the requirements of the 


statute could be triggered. 


10

 QUESTION:  Those subgroups would report to 


11 

the full committee, I assume, they would not have any 


12 

dispositive authority over what the report of the 


13 

committee says, would they? 


14

 MR. ORFANEDES:  Well, there was nothing in 


15 

the originating document that described who those 


16 

subgroups would report to. 


17

 QUESTION:  Well, they are called 


18 

subgroups, aren't they?

 MR. MORRISON:  That's whether or not -­

21 

they are under somebody.  And I gather what they are

under is the committee.

 MR. ORFANEDES:  They are not the

of a committee. 

 QUESTION:  Well, if the, if the statute 

requires disclosure of all these things, at the end 

of the day, as a final order, and discovery, when 

10 

they are hit with a discovery order, it gives them 

11 

all the same information, why isn't the Government 

12 

right, that this really is the essence of the suit 

13 

and we should hear the merits of it now. 

14

 MR. ORFANEDES:  I don't think it is the 

15 

essence of the suit.  I think the appellate court 

16 

gave some strong advice to the District Court to 

17 

limit discovery to two points, really.  Number one, 

18 

being the involvement, whether there were private 

19 

individuals involved.

 MR. MORRISON:  Well, I think -- and also a 


significant point to be considered in that regard is 


that the Government did not object to the scope of 


this, of the discovery that it was -- as it was 


served.  They had the opportunity, they had every 


opportunity to submit particularized objections, 


including privileges, but not just privileges, also 


objections as to scope, relevance, materiality.  The 


usual long litany of discovery objections that any 


10 

party is able to.  They declined that opportunity. 


11

 The District Court was very careful.  I 


12 

think he bent over backwards in inviting them to 


13 

assert objections on several occasions.  They chose 


14 

not to do so.  So for them to come back -­

 QUESTION:  Suggesting that they -- they

consented to the discovery, but just they did not

objections.  No.  I'm not saying they consented to 


20 

it.  They were, they were clear in their objections 


21 

to any discovery whatsoever, discovery that the 


22 

District Court felt it needed as a means of 


23 

constitutional avoidance in order to determine, first 


24 

of all, whether the statute applies.  And secondly, 


25 

in order to narrow any constitutional issues that it

Appeals has clearly given them now to whittle that 

order down. 

 MR. ORFANEDES:  That's correct.  They have 

7 

not. 

8

 QUESTION:  But you are -- am I correct in 

9 

thinking your case in the District Court was just a 

10 

mandamus action, right?  There is no cause of action 

11 

under the statute.  And so in order to establish 

12 

relief on mandamus, you have to show a clearly, clear 

13 

right to relief and jurisdictional defect, something 

14 

along that kind.  You don't normally file a mandamus 

15 

action and then get discovery to see whether you are 

16 

entitled to mandamus. 

17

 MR. ORFANEDES:  Justice Stevens, we had 

18 

actually several different counts in our complaint, 

19 

which included, first of all, we did assert a count 

20 

under FACA.  That was dismissed.  We also asserted a 

21 

--

22

 QUESTION:  The FACA doesn't create a 

23 

private cause of action. 

24

 MR. ORFANEDES:  That was ultimately the 

25 

basis for the dismissal.

 QUESTION:  That's why it was dismissed.


 MR. ORFANEDES:  But we also had an -- an

APA claim.  And then ultimately -­

7

 QUESTION:  But you don't -- that also has 


no merit because the Vice President is not an agency, 


and neither is the group. 


 MR. ORFANEDES:  Well, the reasoning behind 


8 

the APA claim -­

9

 QUESTION:  The only viable claim you had 


10 

was the mandamus claim, as I understand it. 


11

 MR. ORFANEDES:  Well, the APA claim is 


12 

continuing with respect to the agency defendants. 


13 

The heads -- I shouldn't say the agency defendants. 


14

 QUESTION:  And they have given you 


15 

the discovery you asked for, if I understand it? 


16

17

 MR. ORFANEDES:  Actually, they have -­

 QUESTION:  It's only the group itself that 


18 

refuses to give any discovery.  And if I understand 


19 

their position, if we give you discovery, that's just 


20 

the same as giving you a victory in the lawsuit. 


21

 MR. ORFANEDES:  The agency defendants have 


22 

given us some discovery, but at the same time, they 


23 

also asserted objections as to executive privilege 


24 

and deliberative process in answering our questions. 


25 

They did not give us any information about what role,

if any, independent individuals, private individuals 


played in the deliberations of the task force. 


 QUESTION:  Could you just embellish your 


answer to Justice Stevens' question a little bit? 


And that is, if you, if you get some discovery, and 


you win your case, what do you get when you win that 


you will not already have gotten by the discovery? 


 MR. ORFANEDES:  I guess I just want to --


9 

is this as a comparison to the discovery that, that 


10 

was ordered? 


11

 QUESTION:  Whatever the discovery is. 


12 

Whatever the discovery is.  You got enough discovery 


13 

to win your case, you win it.  What do you get then 


14 

besides a statement saying they were wrong, you win. 


15

 MR. ORFANEDES:  If discovery is limited to 


16 

the narrowing that the appellate court suggested, 


17 

none of that information, I believe, would be 


18 

something that we would get under the statute if we 


19 

were to win.  Under the statute, we are entitled to 


20 

basically the documents of the committee as limited 


21 

by any properly applied exemptions of FOIA. 


22

 QUESTION:  You are saying you get more 


23 

discovery? 


24

 MR. ORFANEDES:  I wouldn't -- no, we don't 


25 

get more discovery.

 QUESTION:  What are these documents that 


you would get that you would not already have gotten 


at the discovery stage? 


 MR. ORFANEDES:  Well, the documents the 


appellate court was talking about, and in addition to 


interrogatories which we don't get -- and actually, 


at one point the Government actually suggested that 


discovery take place on the basis of interrogatories. 


We wouldn't get any interrogatory answers.


 QUESTION:  So you would get documents? 


 MR. ORFANEDES:  We would get documents.


 QUESTION:  And what documents would you 


13 

get? 


14

 MR. ORFANEDES:  We would get, I believe 


15 

the statute allows disclosure of all of the documents 


16 

of the task force subject to the limitations of FOIA. 


17 

The documents are produced as if the task force was 


18 

an agency subject to FOIA, and all the exemptions 


19 

that FOIA applies, I believe, apply to these 


20 

documents.


21

 QUESTION:  So you'd get a broad disclosure 


22 

is what you are saying? 


23

 MR. ORFANEDES:  That's right.  I think the 


24 

discovery as suggested or as narrowed by the 


25 

appellate court is a much smaller subset of the

information we would get if we were entitled to -- if 


we ultimately prevail on the merits of the lawsuit. 


 There has been a couple of statements with 


respect to our complaint being based on nothing more 


than mere unsupported allegations.  That is a false 


statement, in our view.  In order to support our 


claims, we are relying first and -- first and 


foremost on the statement in the memorandum creating 


the document that says the Vice President has 


10 

discretion to create subordinate working groups. 


11

 Then we also attach several statements, 


12 

acknowledgments by the Government, that describe 


13 

meetings between task force representatives and 


14 

representatives of Enron and representatives of other 


15 

working groups.  I believe the Government itself 


16 

acknowledged there were at least five such meetings. 


17 

We know that the Vice President met with the chairman 


18 

of Enron, Ken Lay.  The Vice President himself in an 


19 

interview he gave on Nightline said we met with all 


20 

kinds of folks, we met with energy groups, we met 


21 

with environmental groups -­

 QUESTION:  They talked to a lot of people, 


got a lot of advice, but does that make them de facto 


members of the committee? 


 MR. ORFANEDES:  Well, that's the question 


that we are seeking to answer through our discovery. 


The point is that this is not an unsupported, these 


are not mere unsupported allegations. 


 QUESTION:  Well, I'm not sure that's 


10 

right.  Just because you said they talked to a lot of 


11 

people doesn't really prove anything, it doesn't seem 


12 

to me. 


13

 MR. ORFANEDES:  Well, if you put that 


14 

together, the allegations of the individuals that 


15 

were met with, with the statement in the memorandum 


16 

that allows the Vice President discretion to create 


17 

working groups, we think it does at least raise a 


18 

significant question as to whether outside 


19 

individuals were participating in these working 


20 

groups and participating in the committee as a whole. 


21

 In any event, the District Court firmly 


22 

believes that it needed this discovery in order to 


23 

answer these questions.  I see my time is up. 


24

 QUESTION:  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Orfanedes.

General Olson, you have five minutes left.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS


 QUESTION:  General Olson, I hope you'll 


address the point whether you'll, whether you'll have 


to disclose anything more at the end of the suit than 


you will under the discovery.  Is there a big 


difference between what they get under the discovery 


order and what they would get if they win the suit? 


 GENERAL OLSON:  Thank you, Justice Scalia. 


10 

I was going to address that point because it's been 


11 

addressed by Justice Souter, Justice Stevens, Justice 


12 

Kennedy.  What the discovery -- and I don't have time 


13 

to read the interrogatories or the requests for 


14 

admissions, but those require the production of all 


15 

information with respect to any contacts at all 


16 

between any member of the task force or any 


17 

government employee that assisted with it or any 


18 

agency -­

19

 QUESTION:  Those were all within the scope of 


20 

the order that the District Court gave? 


21

 GENERAL OLSON:  Yes.  Those were the 


22 

discovery and requests for admissions.  Now, the 


23 

Court of Appeals didn't refine that.  It said that, 


24 

well, that's pretty broad, and it should be narrowed 


25 

down, but it should be whatever is necessary to prove

their case.

 They thought what was necessary to prove 


their case was to have all outside contacts.  FACA 


does not require the production of that degree or 


that scope of documents.  It has to do with minutes 


and drafts and things that were actually considered 


by the committee.  So the discovery is vastly broader 


than the relief that would be available if FACA 


existed.  Secondly -­

10

 QUESTION:  General Olson, I thought that 


11 

the, what the Court of Appeals said is there could be 


12 

discovery on two issues.  And one was what 


13 

non-Federal offices participated, and two, to what 


14 

extent.  Judge Tattle and Judge Edwards were both 


15 

pretty clear on that, that that would be the nature 


16 

of the discovery permissible. 


17

 MR. ORFANEDES:  Well, of course.  But 


18 

that's exactly what those requests for admissions in 


19 

those interrogatories seek.  All contacts between any 


20 

member of the committee or any other government 


21 

employee and any outside person.  And then what Judge 


22 

Tattle and what -- went on to say at page 18-A, that 


23 

is to say the discovery they need to prove their 


24 

case. 


25

 QUESTION:  The point is it's different, 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

isn't it?

 GENERAL OLSON:  It's -­

 QUESTION:  They want stuff on discovery 


that has to do with who said what to who.  And if 


they win, they get a different set of things which 


are the documents of agendas, et cetera. 


 GENERAL OLSON:  Well, it's -­

 QUESTION:  Is that right? 


 GENERAL OLSON:  It's different, but it --


10 

everything that they have asked for in those requests 


11 

for admissions and those interrogatories, Justice 


12 

Breyer, include everything they would get under FACA 


13 

and a whole lot more.  So -- and there is no question 


14 

about that. 


15

 Now, with respect to the subordinate 


16 

working groups, a point was made with respect to the 


17 

President's directive, that the President said the 


18 

Vice President may establish subordinate working 


19 

groups to assist.  The declaration that's in the file 


20 

at page 240 of the Joint Appendix specifically says 


21 

that the Vice President authorized that, but the Vice 


22 

President did not establish any such subordinate 


23 

working groups. 


24

 And then the declaration goes on to say 


25 

that there was only a public citizen that was 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

9 

involved in developing graphics and that sort of 


thing.  And that was the only person that was 


involved.  No such individuals, the individuals named 


in the litigation, participated in the working group 


formulation. 


 What we are saying here is that the 


constitutional immunity from discovery that we are 


talking about here is rooted in the overriding 


presumption of regularity, which, if repealed in this 


10 

case, would repeal -- if overridden in this case 


11 

would repeal the exemption under FACA for all 


12 

government working groups. 


13

 And these are exclusive functions, 


14 

textually committed to the President of the United 


15 

States getting opinions from his subordinates.  As 


16 

your question suggested, Justice Breyer, virtually 


17 

anything that the President might do, asking the 


18 

Attorney General or the Assistant Attorney General 


19 

for this or that to formulate something, and they go 


20 

out to talk to people, that could be a -- that would 


21 

be a FACA lawsuit in a heartbeat. 


22

 There is no statute that creates the right 


23 

that the Petitioners seek here.  There is no, there 


24 

is no cause of action under FACA, and there is, no, 


25 

Justice Stevens, no clear remedy, no clear right to 


1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

which they are entitled to ministerial duty and 


therefore a remedy.  And they just jumped over the 


fact that the statute didn't give them the right to 


bring this case and brought it in the form of 


mandamus. 


 Mandamus is no substitute.  It's not 


appropriate here.  It's a pure circumvention of the 


statute.  There is, we submit, no such thing as a de 


facto member of an advisory group under FACA.  FACA 


10 

was intended to address the creation of de jure 


11 

working groups where the President would cloak 


12 

himself in the benefit of public citizens who have 


13 

come up with this proposal.  It's not, I think your 


14 

question, Justice Breyer, it's not a FOIA case.  It's

not a -­
