 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LINDSAY C. HARRISON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. HARRISON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 In 1996 Congress provided in 8 U.S.C. 

1252(b)(3)(B) that courts may stay an alien's order of 
removal pending appeal.  The question in this case is 
whether Congress intended that temporary stays of 
removal be governed by the normal standards applicable 
to States or instead by the special standard that 
Congress separately set forth for injunctions in 
1252(f)(2).  There are three primary reasons why the 
normal stay standard should apply.

 First, Congress used different words to 
describe these different forms of relief, "stay" in 
(b)(3)(B) and "enjoin" in (f)(2).  Congress used 
different words because it saw these forms of relief as 
different.

 Second and related, a stay is in fact 

different from an injunction.  It is a temporary vacatur

of a court or vacancy order pending review.  It is not 
directed at a party and does not order a party to take 
action.

 Third, even an alien with a strong 

likelihood of success on the merits who will face 
certain persecution if deported cannot get a stay under 
the (f)(2) standard, a result Congress should not be 
presumed to authorize in the absence of a clear 
statement to that effect.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I'm not 

sure this matters very much, But do you know if -- are 
stays usually granted in this type of case?  Not this 
type of case:  A removal case as opposed to an 
application to reopen.

 MS.  HARRISON:  In a removal case stays are 
granted in eight circuits only if the individual meets 
the traditional --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, I understand 
it.  I am just saying if you happen to know empirically 
if most people who are facing removal get a stay.

 MS. HARRISON:  I have seen no empirical --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did the government -- I 
thought the government said that an empirical database 
would be the Ninth Circuit, which has the more generous

rule.

 MS. HARRISON:  That's --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My understanding is that 

stays are granted in a very high percentage of those 
cases.  I would be curious to know, A, the percentage of 
the cases in which it's granted; and B, the percentage 
of those cases that are ultimately decided in favor of 
the government?

 MS. HARRISON:  The data that I believe Your 
Honor is referencing was the rate at which petitions for 
review are filed, and not the rate at which stays are 
granted or filed.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, is it true that 

there are more petitions filed in the courts with the 
more generous standards?

 MS. HARRISON:  Again, I have not seen a 

comprehensive study.  There are more petitions filed in 
the Ninth Circuit, but there is no evidence of the cause 
of that.  And -- and I think it's important that stays 
are in fact denied under the traditional standard, 
because what that demonstrates is that the traditional 
standard effectuates Congress's purpose of passing 
IIRIRA and eliminating the automatic stay and making it 
in fact more difficult for an individual to obtain a 
stay on appeal.  That -- the traditional standard does

have real teeth and it does not result in an automatic 
stay.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How many years ago was 
the automatic stay eliminated?  When did this -- the 
current law come into effect?

 MS. HARRISON:  At the same time in 1996. 
Congress both eliminated the automatic stay, and it 
replaced it with the language in 1252(b)(3)(B), which 
indicates that a stay is not automatic unless a court 
orders otherwise.  And -- now, that language was nearly 
identical to the language that had previously existed, 
where a stay was automatic except for aggravated felons. 
For aggravated felons, the statute provided that a stay 
was not automatic unless a court otherwise directs.  And 
courts had interpreted that language to provide for 
application of the traditional stay standards.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is it possible in 
this case to kind of split the baby?  You have a more 
appealing fact case than is typical, because yours 
involves a denial of a motion to reopen and doesn't 
really go to the ultimate merits.  Most of the petitions 
I think do go to the ultimate merits, and it's easier to 
see that (f)(2) may apply there as opposed to your case.
 Now, is there a coherent way of saying that? 

In other words, in your type of case, you apply the

traditional stay standards, but in a case where the 
issue that is before the court is whether to order 
removal or not on the merits, the other approach 
applies.

 MS. HARRISON:  I think that the way to do 

that, Your Honor, is to apply (f)(2) where the alien is 
seeking permanent relief.  And where the alien is 
seeking to enjoin his or her removal, the (f)(2) 
standard makes a lot of sense, but the (f)(2) standard 
doesn't contain any predictive language.  It doesn't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that's 

just really saying the way that you avoid that is to say 
you win across the board.  I mean, it -- my 
understanding is that in situations in which they are 
going to be seeking an injunction to enjoin are quite 
limited.  They are typically just seeking to vacate the 
legal order.

 MS. HARRISON:  And if you then apply the 

(f)(2) standard across the board to stay requests, then 
what that would mean is that the court of appeals is 
deciding the merits twice:  It's deciding it at the 
outset when determining whether or not the individual is 
entitled to a stay; and then it's deciding it again when 
the court decides whether the individual's entitled to 
have the order of removal vacated.  And that just

doesn't seem like what Congress had in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, I think I 

understand that point when they're seeking to have the 
order -- the removal order vacated.  But here you are 
seeking the reopening of the proceedings, which I guess 
is a little different, isn't it, than the underlying 
decision on the merits?

 MS. HARRISON:  Technically, the order of 
removal is the order denying the motion to reopen, so 
they are one and the same, in this case and in any case 
where the petition for review is of an order of removal, 
which is what the statute provides for.  And I think 
that point is very important --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is that right?  How 
can that be?  I mean, you have an order of removal, and 
then you move to reopen the proceedings.  Aren't they 
two separate things?

 MS. HARRISON:  Well, the statute provides 
that an order denying a motion to reopen is itself an 
order of removal, and that it's consolidated with the 
original order of removal on appeal.  So that they 
become one and the same case, and the order denying the 
motion to reopen is the order of removal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where does it say 

that?

MS. HARRISON:  I do not believe that it is 
in 1252 itself, and I don't have the citation for you. 
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.
 MS. HARRISON:  Back to the point that it's 

important to recognize that the (f)(2) standard contains 
no predictive language, it doesn't allow a court to say, 
is this individual likely to succeed on the merits?  It 
says can this individual show, by clear and convincing 
evidence, that the entry or execution of the removal 
order is prohibited by law, not likely to show, not we 
are likely to find.

 And so if courts were required to apply this 

standard at the stay stage, they would be deciding the 
very same question twice.  They would be deciding both 
the merits question of whether the individual removal 
order is prohibited by law and also the stay question of 
whether it should be stayed pending --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That wouldn't be deciding 
it the same way twice.  Initially, they would just have 
to decide whether -- whether the alien has shown by 
clear and convincing evidence that he should win, and if 
they decide no, he hasn't, then at the merits stage they 
have to decide which one prevails by a preponderance of 
the evidence.  So it's really a different call the

second time.

 MS. HARRISON:  Well, Your Honor, the 

government has stated in its brief that it believes 
these two standards to be virtually identical.  And in 
the event that a stay was granted, it would certainly 
render the merits decision superfluous because, if a 
stay was granted and you could meet this higher burden, 
then perforce you could meet the lower burden.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's true.
 MS. HARRISON:  And so, in that situation, 

(b)(3)(B) would be superfluous.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you claim that 

(f)(2) covers, if it doesn't cover these stays?

 MS. HARRISON:  It covers any time an alien 
seeks an injunction, now, both in the courts of appeals 
and in a district court case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How can that be?
 MS. HARRISON:  Well, the Catholic Social 
Services case is one example where individuals were 
challenging the procedures whereby their legalization 
applications were adjudicated under the Immigration 
Reform and Control Act.  And in that case, they sought 
injunctive relief as a class to enjoin their removal 
pending that case and permanently, in fact, because they 
said they were entitled to legalization, which was an

amnesty statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's --

that's kind of a systemic challenge, but you wouldn't 
have a situation where you get an injunction in far more 
typical individual cases, right?

 MS. HARRISON:  Well, if an individual in 
that case, Your Honor, attempted to enjoin his or her 
removal, then the (f)(2) standard would certainly apply 
to that individual.  And there's -- there's a reason why 
an individual couldn't have brought that challenge as 
opposed to a class.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why would he seek to enjoin 
his removal when he is subject to a much lesser standard 
when he just seeks to stay the removal?  I mean, does he 
have a bad lawyer or what?

 MS. HARRISON:  Well, in that case, it would 
be in a district court, which doesn't have supervisory 
authority over the court of appeals -- I'm sorry --
over the BIA's order.  And so the district court 
presumably couldn't stay an order that it wasn't 
reviewing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why wouldn't he go to the 

court of appeals, is the next question.

 MS. HARRISON:  Well, he perhaps might, but 
if there was a delay in the procedure or if there was

some reason why --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a fluke.  I mean, 

that is a flukey situation.  And I find it hard to 
believe that (f)(2) was meant to address just that.
 MS. HARRISON:  Well, it would be in any 

case, even in the court of appeals, where an individual 
sought an injunction as opposed to a stay.  For example, 
if it was a situation like the Singh case in the Ninth 
Circuit, where there was a stay of removal in place, but 
the agency was deporting the individual anyway.  Then 
the individual would need to obtain an injunction, and 
in fact that was essentially what the Ninth Circuit 
ordered, was a remand for the imposition of an 
injunction against --

JUSTICE SCALIA:  Also a fluke.  We don't 

expect the -- the executive to ignore a stay.

 MS. HARRISON:  No, Your Honor.  I think --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  I think it's a fluke, too, 

but you gave -- to my recollection, I forget where it 
was -- I think you gave citations to three or four cases 
in which that actually happened.

 MS. HARRISON:  The Singh case, Your Honor, 
is one of those cases.  There's also the Lindstrom case 
from the Seventh Circuit.  And it does happen that, 
either because of a miscommunication or some other

reason, that the stay is not effective, and in that case 
an injunction would be.

 And I think, in order to address the Court's 
concern that (f)(2) is a fluke, it's important to take a 
look at where it appears in the statute and its context. 
Now, originally, the statute contained only (f)(1), 
which says that you cannot obtain injunctions as a 
class, but that individuals can obtain injunctions. 
There was no (f)(2).

 The bill went to conference and then 

Congress added in (f)(2), I think to make very clear 
that, although they had carved out this exception in 
(f)(1) for individual cases, that it was not to be 
granted as a matter of course, that even in particular 
cases, which is the subtitle of (f)(2), the standard 
should be very strict.  And so I think Congress saw 
itself as closing a potential hole here, because it had 
created this opportunity to obtain an injunction as an 
individual without articulating a standard.  Then 
Congress went about articulating standard in (f)(2). 
And it's a very high standard.

 Now, Congress did not cross-reference 

(b)(3)(B), which is the stay provision, and in fact, in 
the transitional rules, what Congress did was it only --
it only included a provision that was identical to

(b)(3)(B).  It did not include (f)(2) in the 
transitional rules, which -- all of which demonstrate 
that Congress did not see (f)(2) and (b)(3)(B) as 
related; they saw them as separate with (f)(2) governing 
injunctions and (b)(3)(B) governing stays.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe I'm missing 

something but -- and, again, I don't know which way this 
cuts, but the dispute strikes me as very academic as a 
practical matter:  Judges looking at whether someone is 
likely to prevail on the merits versus judges looking at 
whether the person has shown by clear and convincing 
evidence that he shouldn't be removed.  The judge that's 
going to find one in one case, depending on the 
standard, and the opposite in the same case I can't 
visualize.

 MS. HARRISON:  Well, the key I believe, Your 

Honor, is the equities.  Now, the (f)(2) standard does 
not permit consideration of the equities in determining 
whether removal is prohibited by law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It doesn't?  You're 

talking about equities or irreparable harm?
 MS. HARRISON:  Both, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Both standards?
 MS. HARRISON:  Yes.

cannot consider that at all under (f)(2)?  There's no 
way in which the removal would be prohibited as a matter 
of law under provisions that are concerned, for example, 
about whether the person would be tortured or something 
like that?

 MS. HARRISON:  Well -- well, Your Honor, 
under the (f)(2) standard, take, for example, someone 
who had applied for asylum, and it was denied on a 
procedural technicality, and the question is:  Was the 
entry of the execution -- entry or execution of the 
removal order prohibited by law?

 That -- the issue of whether the 

technicality was a -- was a correct finding or was not a 
correct finding permits no consideration of whether or 
not that individual, if they are deported, is going to 
face persecution, torture, death, et cetera.  Only under 
the -- the traditional --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Because the 

objection is on this procedural matter?

 MS. HARRISON:  Correct.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if the objection 
is that I am going to be tortured so you shouldn't order 
my removal, he would be able to -- the court under 
(f)(2) would be able to consider that, wouldn't it?

Honor, unless the very question that was being decided 
is whether the individual had met the -- met the 
standard for relief under the Convention Against 
Torture.  But there are also cases where an individual 
is seeking asylum, and there are questions about whether 
-- whether the persecution is on the basis of a 
protected class.

 Now, the question there is not whether or 
not the person is likely to suffer irreparable harm if 
they go back, but, rather, what is the basis on which 
they may be entitled to asylum?  And so the Court in 
Bohegan --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Don't they get to 
pursue that even after they are sent back?  There are 
provisions that -- that their case does not abate just 
because they have been removed?

 MS. HARRISON:  That is true, Your Honor. 

However, their case may abate because they are killed, 
they are put in jail, they are not in a position to come 
back to this country.  And that is why consideration of 
the equities in this context is so critical and why 
Congress would not have eliminated the equities from the 
consideration without a very clear statement-

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I guess that's 

why -- I guess that goes back to my earlier question,

which is, I see that if they are killed the case is 
probably not in very good shape.  But -- but the 
situations in which they are likely to face that sort of 
difficulties upon removal it would seem to me are 
situations where the removal would be prohibited by law.
 MS. HARRISON:  Well, Your Honor, that was --
the court of appeals would only be allowed to consider 
that if the question presented was whether they had 
proven that they were likely to be killed if they were 
returned to the country.  But that often is not what --
the question that the court of appeals is deciding.

 It is deciding a procedural question.  It is 

deciding whether the persecution was on the basis of a 
protected class, those sorts of considerations, which 
are not the same question as:  Is this person likely to 
be killed if they are returned?

 That's why -- that's why the -- this Court 
has held that unless Congress demonstrates very clearly 
that it intends to take away the court's ability to 
consider the equities, that we don't interpret 
Congress's --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Excuse me, but I'm not 

following.  I have the same difficulty that perhaps the 
Chief Justice is trying to get at.  In the case where it 
appears to the -- the judge that the -- that the alien

would be murdered when he is returned, wouldn't his 
deportation be prohibited by law?

 MS. HARRISON:  Well, not always, Your Honor, 

if the question that the court was considering wasn't 
whether in fact the individual was going to be killed if 
returned.  If the question the court is considering is 
whether -- whether a crime he has committed subjects the 
individual to deportation, then the fact that that 
individual is going to be killed when he is returned to 
the country is not part of the (f)(2) calculus.
 And -- and I don't believe that the 

government has -- has argued that the equities would be 
part of the consideration.  The government has argued 
that for legal -- for factual questions you need to 
prove them by clear and convincing evidence, and for 
legal questions you need to prove you are entitled to a 
judgment as a matter of law.

 Where the equities fall into that calculus 

is -- is unclear, and I think they would only fall under 
that calculus if the very question presented to the 
court was that one.  And -- and then, moreover, when you 
say --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When you say "equities," 
is the fact that he has applied or his wife has applied 
for adjustment of his status, is that an equity?

MS. HARRISON:  No, Your Honor, I don't 

believe that that itself would be an equity.  But the 
fact that he does have a wife and he does have a young 
child in this country would be a permissible 
consideration in the equitable analysis, in the analysis 
of -- of irreparable harm that would come to him and his 
family.  The -- the basis for his motion to reopen was 
not the denial of adjustment -- of his adjustment of 
status.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It was changing 

conditions.

 MS. HARRISON:  That's right, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Alleged changing 

conditions.

 MS. HARRISON:  Yes, Your Honor.
 And I also think that -- that it's important 
to emphasize this Court's clear-statement rule, which is 
that the court doesn't take for -- lightly statutes that 
do not very, very clearly take away the power of the 
courts to grant the stay, to grant an injunction.  And 
if it's not very clear from the face of the statute that 
that is what Congress intended, that the court will not 
interpret as having done so.

 I also think that it's important to 

emphasize that when Congress wanted to be expansive in

getting rid of forms of equitable relief, it was.  In 
1252(e)(1)(A), for example, which if you would like to 
look appears on page 11a of the appendix to the gray 
brief, that's the provision where Congress limited the 
forms of equitable relief available to aliens facing 
removal in expedited situations.  And there Congress's 
language was very clear that:  No declaratory injunctive 
or other equitable relief.  There is no language of that 
sort in (f)(2); the same with (f)(1).

 In that provision Congress said no court in 

-- in a class situation can enjoin or restrain the 
removal of an alien.  Not in (f)(2).  In (f)(2) Congress 
only used the word "enjoin" in its omission of other 
equitable relief, and its omission of restrain are 
instructive.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think 

references to equitable relief and restrain are clear 
enough to cover the Court's authority to grant a stay?

 MS. HARRISON:  I don't believe that restrain 
is, Your Honor, because I think restrain -- it's unclear 
whether Congress is talking about a stay versus a 
temporary injunction or a restraining order.  I think 
other equitable relief does capture stays, because we 
don't deny that a stay is a form of equitable relief. 
It's simply not an injunction, because it's not directed

at a party, and it doesn't order a party to do 
something.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just to refresh my 

recollection, what -- what is the major difference 
between the standards that -- or the findings that the 
judge must make, (a) to grant a preliminary injunction 
and (b) to grant a stay?

 MS. HARRISON:  That has to be the same, Your 
Honor, in the usual situation, because both arise at the 
same stage in the proceedings where it makes sense that 
the court would want to consider:  What is the 
likelihood that this person is going to succeed down the 
road?  What -- what is the risk if I don't grant relief 
at this stage?

 But those two things are also treated 

differently in the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 
in Rule 8 and also Rule 18, which governs only stays of 
agency orders and not injunctions.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My -- my concern is that I 
sense in this statute a congressional concern that stays 
are too frequently granted.  And one thing we could do, 
if we were to accept your view of the statute, is to 
say:  And you must be very careful.

 Well, the courts don't listen to that very 

much.  And short of granting the -- accepting the

government's position, I don't know what you could do if 
there were a -- a submission and understanding that 
stays were being granted routinely and too frequently.

 MS. HARRISON:  Well, Your Honor, the -- the 
standard that Congress intended, the traditional one, is 
not a standard under which stays are -- are routinely 
granted.  They -- they have been denied in some of the 
very cases where the circuits decided whether (f)(2) 
applies or -- or whether the traditional standard 
applies.

 And this Court has given guidance, for 

example, this term in Winter, that you have to -- not to 
show some likelihood of -- of suffering or irreparable 
harm, but you have to show a strong probability of 
success on the merits, and you have to show a strong 
probability of irreparable harm.  And so if down the 
road it seems that courts are not faithfully 
implementing that standard, then the Court could again 
provide guidance to that effect.  But I don't think --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That case -- this case 
could come out the same.  If we remand and we say that 
it's the traditional standards, this case might well 
come out the same way.  The -- the court might say, 
well, it doesn't make it under the traditional -- it 
hasn't shown a likelihood of success on the merits.

MS. HARRISON:  That's right, Your Honor. 

And -- and it very well could, and we feel we are 
entitled, obviously, to make that showing before the 
Fourth Circuit and have the Fourth Circuit apply the 
traditional test and make a decision under that test in 
the first instance.  But it is true that the State could 
be denied, and that there is no guarantee.  It is not 
automatic.

 And that's why I think before '96 Congress 
used the same language for aggravated felons then that 
it does now for everyone.  Because it knew that "unless 
a court otherwise directs" doesn't mean automatic.  It 
means that only where there -- there is a likelihood of 
success and where the equities counsel in -- in favor of 
the stay, it should be granted.

 That's also how this Court interpreted that 
similar language in Hilton in interpreting Federal Rule 
of Appellate Procedure 239(c), which concerns a stay of 
a grant of a writ of habeas corpus on appeal.  This 
Court said that the traditional stay standard should 
apply in that situation interpreting virtually the same 
language that Congress then chose to use in this 
provision, (e)(3)(B).

 I would like to reserve the remainder of my 

time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
 General Kneedler.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The statutory text, context and background 
of section 1252(f)(2) all demonstrate that that section 
applies to orders granting a stay of removal pending a 
court of appeals decision on a petition for review. 
Indeed, if section 1252(f)(2) does not apply to such an 
order barring removal, it is difficult to see what 
function it would serve.

 Now, Petitioner's counsel has suggested that 

1252(f)(2) must be directed to what I think had been 
referred to as fluke kind of district court orders, and 
couldn't really be directed at the situation that we 
have here. There are two very powerful responses to 
that, if I may make them both.

 The first is that subsection (f)(2), which 

appear on page 14a of our brief refers, it says no court 
shall enjoin the removal, et cetera, under this section, 
meaning that the provision is specifically directed to 
court orders that are entered as part of the proceedings 
on judicial review of final orders under section 1252.

It's not -- it's not principally directed at collateral 
orders that might arise in some other class action or 
some other sort of suit.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  Were the examples that she 
gives, the two or three cases, properly examples under 
this section, in your --

GEN. KNEEDLER:  Well, I think there were two 

different types of examples that she gave, if I may. I 
think the first one was a situation where a Department 
of Homeland Security officer might have erroneously 
carried out an order of removal not realizing that there 
was a -- a stay entered.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  May I interrupt you just a 
second?  When I meant examples, I meant the cited cases. 
There were two or three cited cases.

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  The -- the cited cases, we 

don't think, are examples of this. (F)(2) was not at 
issue in those -- in those cases.  The question in 
several of them was whether the separate provision 
1252(g), which this Court discussed in the American-Arab 
case, whether that applied, and there was at least one 
other case, it involved the transitional rules under 
which (f)(2) doesn't apply.

 But I think the more fundamental answer to 

your point was the second point that I was -- that I was

going to make. There are -- there are three provisions 
of section 1252 that make unmistakably clear that 
Congress did not intend any challenge to a final order 
of removal, any form of judicial review which would 
include an injunction to take place outside of 1252 
itself. And 1252(a)(1) provides the judicial review 
shall be pursuant to chapter 158 of -- and that's on 
page 1a of the brief -- shall be pursuant to chapter 158 
of title 28, the Hobbs Judicial Review Act.

 And then (a)(5), which is on page 4a of our 
brief, says notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
a petition for review filed with an appropriate court is 
the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of the 
removal order.  Unless there be any doubt, the last 
sentence the in that section says for purposes of this 
entire chapter.  Any time there is a reference to 
judicial review, it refers to any sort of statutory or 
nonstatutory provision.

 So any time an alien would try to get an 

injunction in any form of judicial review, Congress has 
expressed barred it not only by this, but then also by 
subsection (b)(9).

 JUSTICE BREYER:  On that particular point, 

just specifically -- this is awfully complicated and you 
have had to go through it pretty quickly, and so have I.

All right.

 So, it seems to me, looking at these three 
sections, as soon as you get to (a)(2), it says certain 
matter are not subject to judicial review, and it 
includes 1225(b)(1), which I take it is the case where 
somebody comes in, knocks at our door, and the 
immigration judge says good-bye and he says, no, no, I 
am entitled to be a refugee or asylum.

 Now, we look at that, it says in there it's 
subsection (e) gives you judicial review of that. Now we 
look at the thing you cited which is (5) -- (a)(5), and 
you read it completely correctly, but you left out these 
words "except as provided in subsection (e)."

 So now we go to subsection (e). And lo and 
behold, what is subsection (e) talking about, but just 
the case I have mentioned. It talks about -- it talks 
about judicial review for orders under 1225(b)(1).  Now, 
those are the people who knock at the door and they want 
asylum. And there is some procedures for them.

 So, now we look at (e) to see what are the 
procedures for them.  And lo and behold, right there in 
(2), it says you can have a habeas corpus procedure as 
to certain matters, whether he is an alien, whether he 
has been admitted as a refugee, et cetera. So it says 
there are some you can have habeas corpus.

So I imagine a person who has been ordered 
removed under (e). All right.  Now it says you can have 
a habeas corpus and now the judge says good-bye. And 
they go to a reviewing court, which is going to be a 
habeas corpus court, and that court decides, the alien 
is right, I am going to issue an injunction.

 Now, just in case he's thinking that, in the 
very next section (f), what we have are two provisions, 
(f)(1) that says if his case is a case involving mass 
action against the whole thing, you can't enter an 
injunction.

 And then we look at (2), and it says if his 

is just a normal case, you can't enter an injunction 
unless it meets this specific standard. So I looked at 
that. And I admit this is pretty quick, and I thought 
it's (e) and it's (f), and (f) is dealing with (e), 
(f)(2). And it makes perfect sense. They don't want a 
habeas corpus judge telling that immigration judge what 
to do with the guy knocking on the door and saying "I 
need asylum," unless they meet clear and present 
danger -- clear and -- whatever it is, clear and 
present -- yeah.

 Okay.  Now, I will admit I read that 

quickly. And therefore, I am probably missing something. 
And I don't expect you necessarily to be an expert, but

can you do your best to tell me what I am missing or if 
you think I might be right?

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Yes, if I could.  1225(b)(1) 
governs the special -- what is called expedited removal. 
It's a special procedure, as you identified, for people 
essentially knocking at the door, and it has very 
limited review, as you suggested.  Almost everything is 
unreviewable except possibility of asylum.

 But it's -- that is the only provision for 

district court review. It's the, shall we say, 
functional equivalent of a petition for review in the 
court of appeals and everybody else. Congress just 
decided to have two different -- two separate 
procedures, and I think for 1225(b)(1) it's really a 
carryover orders of exclusion prior to 1996.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  What it says here 

specifically is it says habeas proceedings.

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Yes, it does -- it does 

say -- it does say habeas, but (f) -- there is no 
suggestion that (f), either (1), which is general 
application, or (f)(2) in particular is limited to 
subsection (e). It -- it speaks of any injunction.

 And that is instructive because the term 

"injunction" is used in the Hobbs Judicial Review Act to 
describe an interlocutory order by a court of appeals on

judicial review that suspends the enforcement of an 
agency order pending judicial review.  And we quote the 
Hobbs Judicial Review Act in our brief.

 And as I mentioned before, that is very 

important to understand here, because Congress 
provided -- other than the habeas review for this 
special category, Justice Breyer, Congress provided that 
judicial review in the norm is in the court of appeals 
pursuant to the Hobbs Act. And if you look at the Hobbs 
Act provision for interlocutory stays, it refers to 
interlocutory relief as an injunction.  It uses the 
word --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, let me add one other 
thing, because all I am trying to do is find some work 
for this section (f)(2) to do.  And I think I found 
some.  And I think what you say is wait a minute, we 
agree it's like habeas.  But and I think it would be 
like an exclusion order rather than a removal order.

 And I did notice previously when it talks 
about 1225, sometimes it uses the word "exclusion" and 
sometimes it says "removal." But if you were that 
district habeas judge and you get a thing saying 
removal, you don't really vacate it.  I think what you 
had do is order an injunction against its enforcement. 
Here I don't know --

GEN. KNEEDLER:  I think the habeas court 

would have the authority -- would have the authority to 
vacate just as -- just as a court of appeals would have 
the authority to vacate.

 But my basic point is that both of them are 

forms of judicial review.  And if this heightened 
injunction standard applies to the form of judicial 
review that Congress has decided to leave in habeas, 
then there is no reason to imagine why Congress wouldn't 
want the same injunctive standard to apply to somebody 
who is seeking judicial review in the normal way, in the 
court of appeals, especially since Congress used the 
word "injunction" to describe this very sort of 
interlocutory relief under the Hobbs Judicial Review Act 
when -- when a person seeks judicial review in a -- in a 
court of appeals.

 And this conforms to the ordinary meaning of 

the word which is "enjoin," which is to prohibited 
something, to require a party to abstain from carrying 
out an act. That's exactly what a stay of removal does.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you -- do you 

agree with your friend that the basic difference between 
your two positions is that under the stay factors you 
are allowed to consider irreparable harm but are not 
allowed to consider that under (f)(2).

GEN. KNEEDLER:  No, I think (f)(2) -- (f)(2) 
is -- is a necessary condition for granting relief.  It 
doesn't -- it doesn't eliminate the requirement that an 
alien show -- show harm from the -- from the removal. 
It's -- it's a condition --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  What difference would it 

make?  I mean, if he can satisfy the clear and 
convincing standard, which is tantamount to saying that 
on final judgment I win, hands down, what need is there 
to -- to go into irreparable harm?

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  And that -- and that -- that 

-- that may well be.  I think it may well be in the 
typical case.  If I -- if I could just --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  But -- but -- but that's --

no, but in any case, if he's got to show by clear and 
convincing evidence that he is going to have success on 
the merits, I don't see any point in any case of going 
into irreparable harm.  If he goes into irreparable harm 
without the clear and convincing standard, he loses.  If 
he satisfies the clear and convincing standard, there is 
nothing for irreparable harm considerations to -- to add 
to -- to the mix of factors.

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Well, as we understand the 

reference to clear and convincing evidence, and

that standard to apply in this context.  As we 
understand it it is -- it is a standard of review 
slightly more favorable to the alien than the 
substantial evidence review standard, which is what 
would apply -- one final --

JUSTICE SOUTER:  It's certainly more than a 

preponderance?

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  But -- but in no 

event, even on review of the final order, is the court 
reviewing for a preponderance of the evidence; the court 
is reviewing the case on the administrative record under 
the substantial evidence test, in which case the court 
at final judgment cannot set aside the -- the agency 
order, except -- unless it finds that no reasonable 
factfinder could conclude that the order should stand. 
That's the substantial evidence test.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But the ultimate -- the 

ultimate standard to which they look is a preponderance 
standard.  In other words, the substantial evidence 
standard is keyed to what a reasonable factfinder could 
find reasonably, based upon substantial evidence.  Is 
the substantial evidence sufficient for such a 
factfinder to find by a preponderance that this person 
has failed to meet, or, put it the other way around, 
that the factfinder has unreasonably failed to find that

the Petitioner has met the standard?

 So ultimately you are talking about a 

preponderance standard, which is -- which is the key, 
isn't that correct?

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  That -- that is -- the court 

-- you are correct in the sense that the court is 
reviewing to see whether substantial evidence supports 
the IJ's determination by a preponderance of the 
evidence.  But (f)(2) is written in terms of the sort of 
showing that the alien must make to the court, and --
and not -- not what he would have made to the IJ.  And 
as -- and as we read it, as we try to apply the language 
in the context of a stay, we thing that means that the 
alien must show something a little bit short of -- of 
the substantial evidence, that no reasonable factfinder 
could find it, at least clear and convincing evidence 
that as -- that the IJ was incorrect or that the alien 
has a successful case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are there other cases in 
which clear and convincing -- the clear and convincing 
standard applies to appellate courts?  It seems to me 
clear and convincing is more appropriate for a factual 
determination at the trial court level.

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  It -- it -- it ordinarily 
is.  And that --and that's why the phrasing, as I was

trying to discuss with Justice Souter, I think, is a 
little awkward.  Another possible way to think about it, 
and this may be what Congress was really driving at, 
when it was -- when it was saying clear and convincing 
evidence, it really meant a clear and convincing 
showing; that the -- that the courts shouldn't take this 
too casually.

 As we point out in our brief, the Second 

Circuit has a standard that the alien just has to show 
more than a negligible likelihood of success on the 
merits to prevail.  Well, that -- that's way below what 
even the traditional standard would be.  So it's 
possible to read clear and convincing evidence as really 
driving at clear and convincing showing, which is 
language that is -- that is somewhat reminiscent of what 
this Court has said for preliminary injunctions 
generally.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So I take it at 

least in the Seventh Circuit these things are usually 
granted?

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  They're -- uh -- we do not 

have empirical data, and I wish we did, on the 
percentage, but they are -- in the Ninth Circuit in our 
experience -- again we don't have percentages, but they 
are granted quite frequently.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the standard is 

probable success on the merits, and that's not an easy 
standard.  Irreparable harm and probable success on the 
merits, both.

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Well, if -- if the courts 

actually applied that standard, there would at least be 
some improvement in the stay standards, but the courts 
sometimes apply a sliding scale, where they say if there 
is -- you know, a serious question and a showing -- a 
showing of substantial harm would be sufficient.  Well, 
this Court has twice reaffirmed in the last term, in the 
last term --

JUSTICE BREYER:  What are we supposed to do? 
What would you had do?  Suppose you are a district court 
judge and at 2:00 in the afternoon on Friday a petition 
comes in and it's from someone who says, "I'm going to 
be on the 5:00 airplane to Hong Kong and I have a real 
case here.  I think I am right."  And he has eight pages 
attached and you read through that.  And you say, "He 
has a point.  Now how good this point is, I don't know. 
So I would like to put this -- I would like to have 
everybody in here on Monday, and then I could figure it 
out."

 Now, that probably happens.  Now what is 

worrying me about your position on this -- which,

although most -- I think every circuit is against you on 
this, except for this one.

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  And there are others.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  And it seems to me that 

would make it impossible for the district judge to do, 
because the district judge cannot honestly say that it's 
clear and convincing that this man is going to win.  All 
he knows is he has a point and he would like to hear 
more about it and he doesn't want him on the airplane 
three hours from now from Hong Kong.  So I -- so how is 
it supposed to work?

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Well, it would be the court 

of appeals, not the district judge.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.
 GEN. KNEEDLER:  But it -- we believe that 

that -- that 1252(f)(2) allows a court to take the time 
necessary to rule meaningfully on the stay application. 
We do not believe Congress intended to divest the court 
of the ability to rule on the merits.  It has a 
substantive standard that the alien has to make a clear 
and convincing -- has to show by clear and convincing 
evidence.  It presupposes that the alien has to make a 
showing; therefore it presupposes that the court must be 
able to evaluate that showing.  We also believe that it 
presupposes that the government is permitted to respond

to it.

 So we -- we do not object and have not 
objected in the lower courts to the courts taking 
sufficient time to -- to freeze the status quo by 
issuing a short stay if necessary to do that.

 Now, in the Eleventh Circuit, for example, 

which has operated under this heightened showing for 
some period of time, it tends to work out, because when 
a -- a -- a petition for review and stay application is 
granted, the court contacts the Office of Immigration 
Litigation which works with DHS to inform the court on 
how soon the order might be issued, and then the court's 
aware of how quickly it might act.

 So -- so it wouldn't often be necessary for 

the court to do it, but we did not challenge that 
authority.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But and -- and I applaud 

the fact that you don't, but I don't know how you can do 
it consistently with your view that "stay" in (b)(3)(B) 
means the same thing as the "injunction" in (f) when 
"injunction" in (f) is restricted as much as it is.

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Well, I --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  God bless you, but I don't 
know how -- I don't know how under the statute, on your 
reading of the statute, you -- you can do it.

GEN. KNEEDLER:  There are two responses. 
One, we -- we think it is necessarily implicit in the 
statutory framework that Congress would have wanted the 
court to be able to rule on the interlocutory 
injunction, but the -- but the second point I think that 
-- that reinforces this proposition, again, if you go 
back to the Hobbs Judicial Review Act, it has a 
provision not only for interlocutory injunctions, which 
is what we're really talking about here, but a provision 
for a temporary -- for a court to issue a temporary stay 
upon a showing of irreparable injury to allow the status 
quo to be maintained pending the court's ruling on the 
interlocutory injunction.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  All right.  Then why 
doesn't that provide the broader authority under 
(b)(3)(B) stay provision that your friends on the other 
side are arguing for?

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Well, it may -- that may 

well be the right answer, is to read (b)(3)(B) --
(b)(3)(B)'s opening that -- which says a petition for 
review does not in itself stay the order -- is very 
similar to the language in the opening of 2349(b) which 
is the interlocutory injunctive language of the Hobbs 
Judicial Review Act.  It says the mere filing of the 
petition doesn't stay or suspend the order.  It says

stay or suspend the order, and it says stay, and then it 
says but a court may -- I forget the precise language --
restrain or suspend the order reflecting pending 
judicial review; and it refers to that as an 
interlocutory injunction.

 But it says if the Petitioner shows that 
irreparable injury would occur before the court has a 
chance to rule even on the interlocutory injunction, it 
can issue what's called a temporary stay to maintain the 
status quo until it can look at the -- at the -- at the 
interim relief.

 Well, if -- if that -- if that background 

rule is not misplaced, that would allow for some 
separation of the sort of emergency motion for a stay, a 
hold fast sort of situation, for the court to be able to 
evaluate the merits.  But when it gets to what the Hobbs 
Act refers to as an injunction, then (f)(2) kicks in, 
interlocutory injunction pending -- pending judicial 
review.

 So that would be -- that would be an 

underlying statutory basis for allowing the court to --
to issue a temporary order to allow the -- to allow the 
proceeding to go forward, but we think it should be done 
in a timely way.  The Hobbs Judicial Review Act 
contemplates a rather casual, up to 60 days that such a

temporary stay should remain in effect.  We think in 
many cases under the immigration laws the court should 
be able to act on the stay application more quickly than 
that.

 I did want -- I did also want to stress the 
-- the policy purposes that Justice Kennedy raised in --
in an earlier question, and that is the -- the thrust-
the whole thrust of the 1996 amendments to the 
Immigration Act was to expedite the removal of aliens, 
particularly criminal aliens, but not all -- but all 
aliens in fact.  And Congress did several things when it 
did that.  It repealed the prior provision where that 
said the mere filing of petition for review 
automatically stayed the removal unless the courts 
ordered -- ordered otherwise.  And it also repealed the 
prior provision that said that the alien -- if the alien 
left the country, including -- that was construed to 
mean pursuant to deportation order, he could no longer 
challenge the removal order outside the country.

 Congress changed completely that and it said 

you had can now challenge the order of removal from 
outside the country, and it basically reversed the 
presumption with respect to whether - whether the filing 
of the petition for review stays -- stays the order of 
removal.  Congress said, No, it does not unless the

courts ordered otherwise.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And you would expect the 
standard to be in the (b)(3)(B) provision.  It says that 
no automatic stay unless the court otherwise orders, 
period.  That's the end of it.

 So one wonders whether this would think that 

the normal standard for a stay would apply.  And then 
(f)(2) is separated by several pages and (f)(1) is 
dealing with something where we understand it.  It says 
no mass injunctions against the enforcement of a 
provision.  But (2) is really puzzling what it relates 
to, is it supposed to have some relationship to (1)?  1 
says you can't enjoin the enforcement of a provision of 
the law.

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Well, (f)(1) is directed at 

-- in large part at programmatic challenges.  It 
provides -- it prohibits courts from enjoining or 
restraining the operation of part 4 of the INA which --
which is the provision that deals with deportation, 
adjudication of deportation and exclusions and carrying 
out those orders, which by the way we think is the 
reason it says enjoin or restrain, because it's talking 
about programmatic type actions, and restrain -- the 
word restraint is sometimes used to be something in an 
absolute prohibition, just -- just to limit it, whereas

on "enjoin" is necessary under (f)(2) because it --
because what is being enjoined or stayed is a vary 
discreet act.  You can have an injunction barring 
removal or -- or you don't.

 But I -- I think a further answer to your 
question, Justice Ginsburg, is that (f)(2) says under 
this section, which means that it is obviously referring 
to court orders entered in the course of -- of removal 
proceedings under section 1252, and when a court finally 
gets to the merits in a petition for review in a court 
of appeals, the court if it decides that there is a flaw 
-- excuse me -- a legal flaw in the BIA or immigration 
judge's decision, it vacates the decision and -- and --
and remands.

 Injunctions are not necessary in that -- in 

that kind of review, so-

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So in this -- in 

this case involving a denial of a motion to reopen, what 
the court of appeals is supposed to do is to look ahead 
and see if this person has shown by clear and convincing 
evidence that they shouldn't be removed; and if they 
haven't, then their -- their removal can't be blocked, 
even for example if the court of appeals thinks, well, 
yes, they should have gotten their motion to reopen.

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  No, no.  The way -- the way

I would understand it to operate is that the -- the 
alien would have to make a clear and convincing showing 
that he is entitled to have the motion to reopen 
granted.  Because if the motion to reopen is granted, 
that vacates the final order of removal and therefore 
there is no longer a final order of removal pursuant to 
which the alien could be removed.

 And I did want to respond to your suggestion 

that maybe the standard should be more lenient with 
respect to motions to reopen.  With respect, I think 
that's the opposite of what the rule should be, if 
anything; because the final -- the review of the final 
order of removal is the main show; and in that -- in 
that situation, the alien is actually challenging the 
order of removal.

 In a case like this where the order of 

removal was a long time ago, and the -- and the -- the 
alien sought judicial review of that and that was 
denied, the only thing before the court is the -- is the 
motion to reopen.  And staying -- a judicial order 
staying the denial of a motion to reopen is meaningless. 
In order to get the relief preventing removal you need a 
stay of removal, which really effectively directs DHS-
as we think it does in all cases -- directs DHS not to 
execute the order of removal that was -- t hat was

already previously entered.

 And also the denial of a motion to reopen, 

especially like the one at issue in this case, where the 
question is whether the alien has shown -- has produced 
material evidence of changed circumstances, that is 
reviewed as this Court said in its decision in Abudu, 
under an abuse of discretion standard.  So it would be 
very likely -- very unlike that an alien would prevail.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  This provision 

applies to us as well, I take it, right?

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Yes, we -- we believe it 

would.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if there is a 
cert petition filed on behalf of an alien subject to 
removal, and he asks for a stay of removal, we have to 
decide whether he meets the clear and convincing 
evidence standard.

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  For -- for purposes of 

granting a stay, yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We should have -- we 

should have done this in this case, but I assume you 
suspended removal of the Petitioner on your own?

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Well, the Court granted the 

stay in connection with the -- with the granting of --
of certiorari in my case.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I ask just a 

technical point?

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  One of the -- the motion 

to reopen was based on changed circumstances in the 
Cameroon.  But there was also this independent 
application for adjustment of his status, which was 
turned down because it was a successive motion.

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  My understanding is that 

that adjustment could not have been asked for earlier 
because his wife didn't come with -- until after.

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  If I -- yes.  Well, he -- he 
did seek -- he did seek, the first time around he sought 
a remand for consideration of his adjustment of status 
application, but one of the requirements to be eligible 
for that is that a visa be available, and a visa was not 
then available, and nothing in the Act requires that 
deportation hearings be held up until a visa becomes 
available.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but now he would 
qualify, except that it's a successive motion.  So it 
seems earlier he was premature and now he's too late.
 GEN. KNEEDLER:  But -- but Congress was 
quite explicit; it only wanted one -- one motion to

reopen, except in the case of asylum or withholding of 
deportation.  It wanted -- it wanted the proceedings to 
come to an end.  And that's -- the circumstances of this 
case powerfully reinforce what Congress --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I just ask a 

question?

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Yes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This person is married to 
a citizen, has an American citizen child.  Is there any 
way that his status could be adjusted?  It can't in this 
procedural situation because it is a successive motion.
 GEN. KNEEDLER:  He could -- he could apply 

for an immigrant visa from abroad.  Now there may be 
situations in which -- in which by virtue of having been 
removed, there is a bar to his getting that, but that is 
subject to waiver.  So really what the alien's 
adjustment status in the United States is discretionary 
if there is a piece of available -- it is discretionary 
from abroad.  All -- it's really a alternate venue 
provision, where the alien applies from abroad.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  GEN. KNEEDLER, when we 

entered this stage, did we violate (f)(2)?

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  I -- I think it would be 

analogous to what I was saying before, that the -- this 
Court like a court of appeals has the authority to -- to

freeze the status quo while it can decide the pertinent 
legal issue, and the pertinent legal issue before 
this --

JUSTICE STEVENS:  Where -- where do we get 

that authority if (f)(2) means what you say?

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Well, as I explained, we do 

not -- we do not challenge the ability of a court to 
decided -- to freeze the status quo while ruling on the 
motion for stay.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what court would ever 

do anything else?  I mean, why if you were granting a 
stay, would you not want to do that so you can fully 
consider the issues?

 GEN. KNEEDLER:  Well, but there's -- it's 
not two stages; it's three.  The -- a stay of removal 
is, under the Hobbs Act terms, an interlocutory 
injunction.  That can last -- judicial review in the 
Ninth Circuit can last four years, so if a stay is 
granted, you could have an interlocutory injunction in 
place for a long time.  The temporary stay is just while 
the court is ruling, considering the interlocutory 
injunction.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:  But this is a longer 

temporary stay than you conceded a few moments ago.  I

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LINDSAY C. HARRISON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. HARRISON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
 I'd like to start with the point that the 

government contends that this Court or any court of 
appeals could impose a stay to consider the stay motion. 
And, respectfully, I don't believe that is consistent 
with the text of (f)(2), and I think that the fact that 
the government must stray from the text is a sign of how 
absurd the results would be if (f)(2) were applied to 
stays.

 Now, the reason they must stray from the 
text is that the text says "notwithstanding any other

provision of law," which means notwithstanding the Hobbs 
Act and notwithstanding the All Risk Act, which is where 
I believe my brother was indicating this Court would get 
authority to impose such a stay.

 Now, I think the fact that there are cases 
where such a need would arise, as in Justice Breyer's 
hypothetical, is exactly why this Court applies a 
presumption against interpreting statutes as restricting 
the equitable authority of the courts, unless there is a 
clear statement to the contrary, which --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes, but you still have a 
differential on the Friday to Monday night hypothetical. 
You wouldn't apply, or would you, the same standard that 
you would apply on Monday for the next -- on Monday for 
the next year and a half?

 MS. HARRISON:  Well, Your Honor, the (f)(2) 

--

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Because you have the same 
problem under your standard as the government does under 
its.

 MS. HARRISON:  Well, that's true.  You'd 
have to show likelihood of success.  But in -- in the 
situation where you could consider the equities, if the 
equities were strong enough and demonstrated in the stay 
application, then it wouldn't be difficult for the court

to decide whether the balance of the factors justified 
implementing a stay in that situation.  Under (f)(2), 
the court would have to decide the question outright. 
And, again, (f)(2) does not mean any predictive 
language; it just says, has the individual demonstrated 
and shown by clear and convincing evidence that removal 
is prohibited by law?  Under the traditional standard, 
there is a -- the court is allowed to consider whether 
the individual is likely to show success on the merits.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You think that if you do 

not prevail, and we say clear and convincing evidence is 
the standard, that courts are not entitled to consider 
equity?

 MS. HARRISON:  Well, Your Honor, I heard my 

brother as indicating that if you meet the (f)(2) 
standard, then -- then the court can consider the 
equities so as to deprive the individual of the stay, 
but that if you cannot meet the (f)(2) standard, then 
the question is closed and there is no consideration.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  About your position, is it 

your contention that if we grant -- if we determine 
clear and convincing is the standard, that equities are 
not relevant to that calculus?

 MS. HARRISON:  Yes, Your Honor, in the event 

that the individual does not meet (f)(2).  If the

individual meets (f)(2), then I do believe the court 
would go on to consider the equities.  But in the event 
that the individual has met the (f)(2) standard, the 
court could simply grant the petition on the merits, and 
there is no need to go about considering the equities 
because the individual has shown that -- by clear and 
convincing evidence -- that removal is prohibited as a 
matter of law.

 And that is the second point I want to get 
to, which is Your Honor's question about, isn't this a 
standard that sounds a lot more like it is directed at 
district courts because -- I think you are right, Your 
Honor, and I think it does sound like that standard 
because I so think that was where it was intended to 
apply.  And the phrase "under this section" does not 
modify the word "enjoin"; it modifies the word "final 
order of removal."  And to ascribe the government's 
reading to it would require you to move that phrase from 
where Congress placed it in the statute, to after the 
word "enjoin."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess General 

Kneedler's point is that clear and convincing shifts a

convincing enough based on what I have had a chance to 
look at.  But -- and therefore you could enter, I guess, 
what may be called the temporary stay to get more 
briefing from the government or whatever.  But you may 
find out when you look at it a little more deeply that 
it's not clear and convincing.  What's wrong with that?

 MS. HARRISON:  Well, Your Honor, if the 

Court were to interpret clear and convincing as a more 
flexible standard, then I don't think -- you know, I 
don't disagree with Your Honor's characterization of it. 
But I still think that, regardless of how you interpret 
clear and convincing, that the equities would not be 
part of the calculus.

 And I also think that the fact that clear 
and convincing sounds like a standard Congress would 
have addressed to district courts, the fact that (f)(2) 
says "no" courts, not -- not just the "courts of 
appeals," the fact that it references an "alien" and not 
a "petitioner" are -- and the fact that it is addressed 
to instances where the entry or execution is prohibited 
by law as opposed to the order itself being unlawful are 
all signs that Congress intended this provision to apply 
both in the district courts and in the court of appeals.
 And I would also note that (a)(5), which is 

a provision the government pointed to, was not in the

1996 statute it was added in 2005, and the 
constitutionality of that provision continues to be 
litigated.  And, moreover, there are habeas cases in the 
district courts that persist where (f)(2) has real 
application and where Congress's intent that an 
injunction, not a stay, but an injunction be very 
difficult to obtain --

JUSTICE BREYER:  1225?
 MS. HARRISON:  Yes, sir.
 JUSTICE BREYER:  Was I right or wrong?
 MS. HARRISON:  I believe you are right, and 

I believe that --

JUSTICE BREYER:  Are you sure?  Because --
(Laughter.)
 JUSTICE BREYER: -- you didn't mention it. 

If I am right, why didn't you mention it?

 MS. HARRISON:  I did not mention it in my 
opening, Your Honor, and that was my error.  I believe 
habeas is one example -- and habeas in the expedited 
removal context, where the provisions would apply.  And 
-- and I think, as this court made clear in Saint Cyr, 
Congress did intend for some habeas actions to persist 
in the '96 IIRIRA statute.  And in those cases, (f)(2) 
would apply, would have real impact.

 And I would also note that if the Court were

to accept the government's interpretation of the term 
"enjoin," that it only applies in stays and that doesn't 
have application elsewhere, then you would be required 
to interpret Congress's use of the word "enjoin" to be 
not really inclusive of stays but as coterminous with 
the word "stay."  But Congress didn't use the word 
"stay" it (f)(2).  It used the word "enjoin."  And the 
fact that that word choice was different from the word 
it used in (b)(3)(B) I think is a clear indication that 
Congress had something different.  It didn't 
cross-reference stay and didn't use the word "stays," 
and it articulated a standard that seems more 
appropriate for district courts adjudicating permanent 
injunctive relief than courts of appeals hearing a 
temporary application for a stay.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the standard you 

think should apply under (b)(3)(B) is a standard that 
describes as applicable to temporary injunctions.  The 
word -- there is substantial likelihood of success on 
the merits and irreparable harm -- that is the standard 
preliminary injunction, not preliminary stay.  The 
preliminary injunction standard.  So the two words 
certainly overlap.

 MS. HARRISON:  Yes, Your Honor.  There is 

overlap, and the standard that is applied by the courts,

if there is no statute to the contrary, is the same. 
But here Congress expressed an intention to treat 
injunctive relief differently and articulated a standard 
that was higher than injunctive relief.

 JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I just ask this one 

real quick:  Do you understand -- is your understanding 
that the government's interpretation of the statute that 
our stay in this case violated the statute?
 MS. HARRISON:  Yes, Your Honor.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Ms. 

Harrison.

 General Kneedler, Ms. Harrison, the Court 

entered a very expedited briefing and arguments schedule 
in this case that unfortunately fell over the holiday 
season, and we appreciate very much that this must have 
imposed a burden on you had and your colleagues.  Thank 
you.

 The case is submitted.
 (Whereupon, at 2:02 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
