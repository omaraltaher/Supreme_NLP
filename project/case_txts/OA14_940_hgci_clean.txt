Abbott.                     Mr. Consovoy.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM S. CONSOVOY                   ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS                 MR. CONSOVOY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it         please the Court:               This appeal presents a fundamental question.       That question is whether the one­person, one­vote rule        affords eligible voters any reasonable protection. We        submit that the answer must be yes under this Court's          decisions, and as a consequence, Appellants have stated         a claim under the the Equal Protection Clause.                    The districts at issue here, District and         District , have deviations as measured by eligible        voters approaching percent under any metric of        eligible voters. No decision of this Court has ever          sustained vote dilution of that magnitude under a        one­person, one­vote case. Beginning with Gray,       continuing to Wesberry, through Reynolds, and the       Court's many decisions since then, the issue has always         been vote dilution.               JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the many times        Alderson Reporting Company Official the Court has said that the ­­ the principle is equal           representation of the population? And we have had now,          for half a century, population ­­ that the population is           the ­­ the legitimate standard. We have never held to           the contrary.              So we have the States overwhelmingly for       half a century using population as shown in the census,           and now you're saying they can't do that anymore.                     MR. CONSOVOY: I can answer the question         in ­­ in three different ways.                  First, with respect to the phrase "equal       representation for equal numbers of people." That        sentence originated in Wesberry. But that's only half         the sentence. There's a dash, and it continues:          "Therefore, for us to hold that within the States         legislatures may draw the lines of congressional       districts in such a way as to give some voters a greater              voice in choosing a congressman than others would be          unconstitutional."             And in fact, in every time the Court uses         that phrase, which is the only one, I believe, my           friends rely on, it is either within the same sentence          or bracketed on one side or the other by protection of           voters.             Now, as to tradition, to ­­ actually, to the         Alderson Reporting Company Official word "population," we don't ­­ we ­­ we see that as           asking the question, not answering it. Burns explains         that Reynolds used population without distinguishing.      Burns itself reserved on the question. Hadley confirms         that Burns reserved on it. And here we are today.                       JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought ­­ I thought          Burns said it approved a deviation from population but          it took great pains to say, we're not saying you could           do that in every case. Burns seems to be the only ­­            the only case that you have, and Burns involved this          really peculiar situation of Hawaii with a tremendous         military temporary population.               MR. CONSOVOY: I ­­ I read Burns as           reserving on it completely, to not choose one way or the           other. It certainly did say that you do not have to use             the ­­ the census to draw districts. That supports our           position. It certainly says that you can protect         eligible voters. That supports our position.                   And ­­ and further back to Your Honor's        question about tradition, if tradition were the rule,        Baker would have come out the other way. Before Baker,           for centuries, geography was the basis. And the Court          said in Baker, as a matter of jurisdiction, and then in            Reynolds as a matter of ­­ of equal protection law, that            tradition doesn't trump the individual rights of a voter          Alderson Reporting Company Official to be protected.               And we don't have to guess about that        because we know from standing. In all of those cases,           standing was predicated on the right of the voter.                     It would be unusual if someone who couldn't        vote came to this Court and says ­­ said my one ­­ a             child, for instance ­­ my one­person, one­vote rights        have been violated.               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem is that ­­       what you're forgetting is the dual interest. There is a           voting interest, but there is also a representation         interest, and it's that which has led us to ­­ to accept            the total population base because States have to have         some discretion to figure out who should be having the          representational voice.              Burns made it very clear that we were        deferring to the State because it had a legitimate          reason for its need.                And ­­ but Burns was in the s, when we          picked total population as a perfectly legitimate way         because there's a representational need at issue as         well. Not just voting. A State has to be able to              say ­­ I think just as the Federal government did ­­           we're ­­ the legislature is protecting not just voters;         it's protecting its citizens ­­ or noncitizens. The         Alderson Reporting Company Official people who live there.                MR. CONSOVOY: So if I can just clarify:          It's not really a representational interest that's being         claimed on the other side. They ­­ a non­voter will            be ­­ there's senate districts in Texas. A non­voter            will have one representative under our rule, and they         will have their one representative under theirs. It's         an access claim that's being made. That's what the          Garza opinion from the Ninth Circuit said.                   And it's not even really an access claim.        It's a diminishing access claim. That's how far from           voting the interest on the other side goes. It is that,            if we have districts that are overpopulated with        non­voters, we will have diminishing access to our        representative.             We don't deny that access is an interest,        along with county lines, along with other interests that         the State can take into consideration, and the         percent framework allows for that. This is not a           situation where we are here complaining about a        deviation of percent or . percent. We're         complaining about a deviation of nearly percent. No           interest such as diminishing access could ever overcome        the individual right of a voter to an equal vote.                       And if you ­­   Alderson Reporting Company Official             JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Consovoy, of course it's        true that when we apportion House members, we use total          population as the metric. And the question that's         raised by your position is why it would be the case that            the Constitution requires something with respect to one        apportionment that it prohibits with respect to another.                    MR. CONSOVOY: Apportionment and intrastate      districting are fundamentally different concerns.     Apportionment at the time of Article I's framing was         focused on taxation issues, on giving States autonomy        with respect to voter qualifications. And there was a          real concern. That's why it was a ­­ the great            compromise.             What the Court held in Reynolds, as a matter          of equal protection, is that that compromise does not         justify this kind of injury.                 And we don't have to guess about this        either. In ­­ in Reynolds Alabama came to the Court and            said, "semi" we surrender. How about a plan that           mirrors the House precisely? Every county gets one         representative, and the rest is done on a population          basis. Not only on a population basis. The precise            formula used for the House of Representatives. Reynolds         said no.              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's interesting is in        Alderson Reporting Company Official Reynolds is the reason they caved was because,        constitutionally, the Arizona Constitution required     total population. It's that fact that they deviated         from their own Constitution that led them to court. So           it wasn't a caving compelled by Federal law. It was            mostly a caving compelled by State law.                    MR. CONSOVOY: Well, the ­­ not that this         Court found the case, because it wouldn't ­­ couldn't be          before this Court on a State law ground. It could only             be before this Court ­­                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. But what I'm saying         is that we ­­ we acceded on the ground that using total            populations was permissible.               MR. CONSOVOY: There's no doubt that       Reynolds thought, in that case, total population. The         Court in Reynolds thought it was permissible.                   Of course, Baker, the Tennessee constitution      apportioned unqualified voters, and there was no       suggestion in Baker that that was an additional problem         with the Tennessee constitution.                But the fundamental issue has always been       the individual right. And I think Gray is the best case             to show that.               Gray is about election for statewide      offices, so it can't be a representational issue.         Alderson Reporting Company Official There's going to be one governor. That governor is ­­          everyone is going to have the same access to that          governor or not. There are no districts.                    And yet Gray is the case that establishes        this rule. Gray is the case that says, voters are           entitled to an equal vote. You can't marry up the           representational interest that's asserted on the other       side with Gray. It doesn't ­­ it doesn't make any           sense.             We also know from ­­ with respect to        congressional districting, as late as , in       Kirkpatrick, the Court assumed, for purposes in that        case, that Missouri could district at the congressional        level on the basis of eligible voters. So I don't think             it would be fair to say that this issue has somehow been            clouded or decided by uses of the words "population" or          using the census in prior cases.                  JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm ­­ I'm sorry. Did I          just understand you to say that you think that the ­­          the House apportionment rule is not clear?                   MR. CONSOVOY: No. The ­­ that        congressional districting intrastate at the Federal      level as opposed to the State level.                   So if ­­ if Kirkpatrick v. Chrysler        says ­­ because the United States has argued that not          Alderson Reporting Company Official only is apportionment required at the Federal level but         intrastate congressional districting. And my point ­­       they ­­ and they rely solely on Westbrook for that ­­          excuse me ­­ Wesberry for that proposition.                      My point is in the Court flatly     rejected Wesberry as having decided that issue. There         is no decision of the Court that resolves this question.          It is ­­ it is completely open.                   And the only way to make sense of the         one­person, one­vote rule is to make it about eligible         voters. They are the ones who have standing. They are            the ones who can bring a claim. They are the ones who              are injured. And not only is that our view and the case             law's view, that was ­­ that was Congress's view.                     JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it your view that what         the Fourteenth Amendment means is that in all the years          between ­­ what was it? ­­ and , it was wrong            for the States to include, for these purposes, women?         They were not eligible voters.                 MR. CONSOVOY: Any ­­ there is no question         that was a problem. It was an ­­ it was an issue in the                's with minorities as well who were ­­ who were          disenfranchised. The ­­ the Court in Reynolds at the          time was doing more than one thing at once.                     JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're saying that       Alderson Reporting Company Official that was wrong. I mean, in your interpretation of the            Fourteenth Amendment from until , the State        should not have been counting women for ­­ for purposes          of determining representation in the State legislature.                   MR. CONSOVOY: For purposes of the ­­ of the          Equal Protection Clause, the one­person, one­vote rule       protects voters. If disenfranchisement of women or        minorities is an issue, those cases could have been         brought. Eventually, that issue was resolved by this         country, as was minority representation.                 But the Warren court in Reynolds was       accomplishing several things. And equal weight for        voters has to matter. A noncitizen or any other           disenfranchised person would not have the ability to        bring a one­person, one­vote claim.                  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but here we have ­­ I          want to go back to Justice Kagan's question. And this           is something that ­­ it seems everyone is arguing this          is as if this is an equal protection problem. And           certainly, the ­­ Reynolds v. Sims does deal with equal          protection. And it did deal with instances in which          voters and everything else were malapportioned. So I         don't think the court really considered this.                   But if you step back from the Equal        Protection Clause and say there are other parts of the          Alderson Reporting Company Official Constitution that, in fact, are relevant here ­­ maybe         it's the Republican Form of Government Clause. But the          words that Justice Kagan read are words about what kind          of democracy people wanted. And those words say if you           look to other parts of the Constitution, such as those,          or Republican Form of Government, that what we actually         want is the kind of democracy where people, whether they          choose to vote or whether they don't choose to vote, are           going to receive a proportionate representation in        Congress.             And if you take that as a constitutional         principle, that shows an objective of some of the         clauses of the Constitution. Then you have to retreat          from the idea that the Equal Protection Clause, as         interpreted in Reynolds v. Sims, solves this case. And          indeed, it argues against you.                 MR. CONSOVOY: So two answers.                  One is to argue that this is justiciable on         the other side as a Guarantee Clause claim, I think            shows just how far the logic has to go to come up with             something on the other side of the ledger here. This           Court has never ­­ in fact, in Baker, the Court rejected           the Guarantee Clause as a basis for hearing these cases.           To turn around now, and turn degrees, so that a ­­ a              somewhat abstract Guarantee Clause claim, that ­­      Alderson Reporting Company Official                         JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Consovoy ­­      JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not making it. I'm         making ­­ I'm pointing at her ­­ she didn't quote the           Guarantee Clause. Maybe I shouldn't have thrown that          in. But it's the same point.                   MR. CONSOVOY: If I could ­­ but Reynolds, I           think, does speak to this, because that exact theory         would be the one that would have sustained the model          that Alabama brought to the Court, that ­­ that followed          the House of Representatives, which does take account of         these issues.              And even if, Justice Breyer, even if you're        correct, that theory is correct, that doesn't solve this         case. We have alleged in our complaint that Texas could           have done much more to ­­ to manage both         representational equality, as it's called, and voting       equality to get both within percent. To say that we            have not ­­              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You had an expert say        it, but you didn't have an expert prove it. He did not             come in with a map that did that.                     map.             MR. CONSOVOY: We did not come in with a          One, we're still at the motion­to­dismiss      stage in this case, so our allegation, which is at          Alderson Reporting Company Official paragraph of the complaint, has to be taken as true.                         But second, the reason we didn't come to a       map is fundamental here as well. We don't want the           Court or ourselves to write this map for Texas. We want            the Texas legislature to do its job.                   Texas, by State law, was precluded from       taking voter equality ­­               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is ­­ does practical        possibility play into this discussion at all? I mean,           the ACS, which you posit is the way that you can find            who the eligible voters are, has been ­­ has been ­­ I            think almost decisively been proven as being inadequate.        It only measures cities with populations or places with         populations over ,. Just on that ground alone,         there are going to be districts that can't rely on it.                                   MR. CONSOVOY: I ­­ I think ­­ sorry.           JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's flawed on many       levels. We could ­­ take my assumption. It's flawed.                       decision?             Does that practicality have any play in our        MR. CONSOVOY: I will take the assumption         and then I will try to argue again against it, if you ­­             you'll allow me.               But practicality, if the Court were to hold        that ­­ two different questions. As the Court explained          Alderson Reporting Company Official in Tennant just recently, it's our burden to bring in          evidence showing that total population census didn't       protect individual rights.               We believe ­­ at this stage, we have alleged         it, so it has to be taken as true. If we can't prove              it, then we have failed to meet our burden.                     It would be a different question if the         Court held yes, the evidence you brought in is         sufficient to show that your rights have been violated         through the ACS data, but not sufficient to draw a new            map. Then I think the Court is in a very unusual place,               where I think the answer is we're back to Baker, which            would then become ­­ that would be the argument of the           dissent in Baker, which is you have a violation but no            judicially manageable way to solve it, so now we're back          to political question.               But if I could get back to the fundamental          premise, which is the ACS data, the ACS data ­­ I think             Your Honor was talking about the ­year ACS data, but          States for redistricting used the ­year ACS data. That          matters ­­ measures populations going down less than        , people. The only group it doesn't have is          individual block group data, and that data is rarely         used for districting that we're talking about here.                    Moreover, we know the ACS data is good        Alderson Reporting Company Official because it's used in Section every day, and not just            for a vague and general purpose. Under Strickland,          under Bartlett against Strickland, to bring a successful         Section claim, you have to show that you have a            majority of the citizen voting­age population in your        district to ­­ to get through the first factor for          Section .              That means if there's . percent minority       eligible voters in your district, you can proceed; if         it's . percent, you cannot. This data is used to           determine that question.               If it can do that in every circuit court in          the country ­­ and in this Court's opinions in LULAC and           Strickland supported using this data for that purpose ­­        if it can do that, it can bring a deviation of             percent to somewhere between and .                    And I don't want to leave this abstract. If           you look at the Supplemental Appendix, the data is         actually in there. If you turn to page of the             Supplemental Appendix, there is a column called "CVAP"         and it lists all of the CVAP numbers for every Texas           Senate district. I would point out that Texas asked for            these numbers to draw this map. They used CVAP to draw            this map.              If you pull those numbers and look at        Alderson Reporting Company Official District , it has , people. Right next to that           is the plus or minus with numbers. It says ,.           That's the margin of error. That's the margin of error           for CVAP data.               So if you took all of those margins of error          and used them against our position at every turn ­­ so           for under­populated district, assume up; for      overpopulated district, assume down ­­ assume it at        every turn against us, and you ran the numbers, it would           move the deviation from percent to percent.                     This is not an issue about margin of error,         about data. This is not an issue about the availability           of data. This data is used if ­­ by every demographer            to draw statewide districts at every turn.                   JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Consovoy, could I go         back to the question that Justice Breyer raised and         can ­­ stripped, if he'll permit me, of the Guarantee          Clause, because the Fourteenth Amendment is actually       quite ­­ you know, the framers of the Fourteenth         Amendment explicitly considered this issue, and, you       know, made a decision.                 So Senator Howard, who introduces the      Amendment on behalf of the joint committee that drafts         it, talks about these deliberations. And he says the          committee adopted numbers as the most just and        Alderson Reporting Company Official satisfactory basis, and that's the principle upon which        the Constitution itself was originally framed, referring       back to the original drafting. And then he says          numbers, not voters; numbers, not property; this is the         theory of the Constitution.                Now, this is the theory of the Constitution        as to one thing, which is not the thing that you are            talking about. This is the theory of the Constitution          as to House apportionment.                But again, I'll go back to this question.        This is such a clear, explicit choice that was made           about what it meant to ­­ to have equal representation          with respect to that area. And how you go from that            being mandated to it being prohibited in the State         context is something that I still can't quite work          myself around.              MR. CONSOVOY: Justice Harlan agreed with       you. He did.                JUSTICE KAGAN: That's a good person to be          on the side of.                MR. CONSOVOY: Yes.                (Laughter.)             MR. CONSOVOY: But his ­­ his position was         rejected ­ in Reynolds. Because that exact argument         was brought forth by Alabama. They presented a plan           Alderson Reporting Company Official that was not only somewhat generally modeled on an         apportionment standard, it mirrored it exactly. So I         think there are reasons why that's not correct as a ­­           just a legal matter, because apportionment was concerned         with many other things. They wanted the States to have           taxation basis. They wanted ­­ there was an issue with           suffrage, for sure. There was an issue with voter          qualifications. It was a complex, Federalism­based,        sovereignty comprise that does not apply within a State.                        I can't do any better, I apologize, than say         Reynolds ­­             JUSTICE KAGAN: I hear you as to that it           does not apply. I mean, I guess I can ­­ I can                 understand. I might not agree with, but I can            understand the position that says that the requirement        might not apply. But you are suggesting that we go           beyond that, and to say, not only does the requirement          not apply, but that States have to do it the exact           opposite way.                          MR. CONSOVOY: So, two answers.      We take our cue on that from the right that          is supposed to be protected. It all follows from the           right, and it starts with voting. We start with the           proposition that one person can't be given two votes         while their neighbor be given one vote, and from there          Alderson Reporting Company Official the Court moved in Gray to say, well, you can't do it by             calling it weighting under some sort of electoral        college model. That's the same thing.                   Then the third step was you can't accomplish        that same invidious voter discrimination by drawing       lines. Now if you accept all of that as true, that I             can't be given five votes and my neighbor be given one,           then even if it follows from the apportionment model and          you ­­ and you defend it on that basis, if it causes            that injury, I have a claim. And to say that I don't                have a claim because a different constitutional         provision protects a different right in a different way,           I ­­ we find, you know, not a satisfactory response           beyond which Reynolds itself rejects ­­ rejects the        argument.             And turning back to Section for a moment,           Congress agreed with our position. Congress relied on         Reynolds being a vote­dilution case to enact Section ,          not only in the Senate report that's been so widely used           in those cases, but in this Court's opinions as well, in           Perkins and in later cases. The Court has held that ­­           and ­­ and in Bolden, both the plurality and         Justice Marshall's dissent, said Reynolds is about vote        dilution.             And Section ­­ the same argument could be          Alderson Reporting Company Official made, Justice Kagan, about Section . Section only           counts eligible voters. No one argues that we're         discriminating against non­voters by not taking them       into consideration. If the Court were to proceed with          that kind of representational model, we would have one         rule that minorities get the ­­ excuse me ­­ the benefit           of under Section , and no protection for people who are           not minority status under one­person, one­vote. There        is a ­­ there is a real fundamental disconnect there.                        JUSTICE GINSBURG: In ­­ in your view, the         States would have a choice between the citizen         voting­age population or they could use the registered        voters? Either one would be okay?                   MR. CONSOVOY: Well, we start with the        proposition that Burns said. It's not the method by          which you distribute legislators that count. It's the         distribution of legislators that count.                 Therefore, as Burns explains, the State can       truly use any metric that adequately and fairly        distributes legislators. We think registered voters is        not ordinarily going to be the right one for two          reasons:             Gray says those who hold the one­person,       one­vote right are those who meet the basic        qualifications of voting. So there, registered voters        Alderson Reporting Company Official run into trouble.               And then Burns essentially doubles down on       that argument by saying it depends upon political        activity.             And where we're drawing lines at essentially       the beginning of the game, we shouldn't make the right          depend upon who ends up deciding to enter the fray and           choose to vote.               So we think the data that we principally        rely on, the ­­ the ACS measure of citizen voting­age          population is ordinarily going to be the fairest and         most accurate measure. But that's for the legislature         to decide when it ­­ when it reviews all this          information.             And the Texas legislature ­­ I think it's         important to keep in mind when they drew this map, they           did everything that we're asking to be done here. They           took all of this data ­­ the total census data, the           citizenship data, the registered voter data, the ­­ the         precinct data ­­ and they put it all into a computer.            And they drew their districts.                 And they used our data to draw districts in         this map. They just used it to comply with Section            and when ­­ and then closed their eyes and didn't want           to look at ­­ to see what kind of deviations it caused            Alderson Reporting Company Official for one­person, one­vote.                All we're asking the legislature to do is       open its eyes.               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think they did        that invidiously? Did they do it purposely?                    MR. CONSOVOY: Well, under one­person,      one­vote, a deviation over percent, as the Court just           recently heard ­­              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They knew that, and they        intentionally decided to have deviations greater than        percent? That's what you're saying?                   MR. CONSOVOY: I don't think we can know ­­          we'll ever know because they were handcuffed by State         law. There was an attorney general interpretation from          that precluded Texas from considering voter       eligibility. It ­­ so it's really arbitrary ­­                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That goes both back to        my point that they decided that they wanted to make this           a representational matter. But do ­­ so they were          precluded ­­ intentionally decide to exclude it?                   MR. CONSOVOY: No. Under the one­person,        one­vote rule, a deviation exceeding percent, we         establish, as we ­­ we argue as a matter of eligible            voters, itself is prima facie evidence of invidious ­­                    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, we have ­­ we have         Alderson Reporting Company Official plenty of case law that says you can have deviations          greater than percent ­­ Hawaii did ­­ if you have a            legitimate reason. And so why would ­­ the great          representational need that Justice Kagan was talking       about not be an adequate reason?                  MR. CONSOVOY: We think it is a ­­ a reason             to go over percent. That's ­­ we do not want the             perfect to be the enemy of the good on this issue. We             understand that things need latitude. We are asking for          nothing more than to bring them within the to           percent range that the Court has always held.                     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're ­­ you're now ­­       you're now saying to percent is okay instead of            percent when we use total population.                   MR. CONSOVOY: The ­­ the Court has up ­­         held up the . percent, and ­­ and Mahan percent as            the outer limit. We take our cues from those.                      JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose Texas said here, we        want children to be represented? That's all. Children.          See, they're not voters. So suppose ­­ if we take           children out of it, what's the deviation?                   MR. CONSOVOY: We haven't examined it. We         only examine on the basis of eligible voters. But          children are represented at the polls. They're        represented at the polls by their parents. If there are           Alderson Reporting Company Official parents here who have been disenfranchised, they were        disenfranchised by the State. States like California        and Texas and New York have ­­                                          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how about ­­      MR. CONSOVOY: ­­ have ­­     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about children who       are citizens when their parents are not, which is fairly          common in many areas?                MR. CONSOVOY: And ­­ and when ­­ when they          become eligible voters, they will move into this base.         They are not counted for Section , and don't ­­ haven't           heard any argument that Section discriminates against         children.             balance.             If I might, Mr. Chairman, reserve the        CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.                   General Keller.              ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. KELLER                     ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES                 MR. KELLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,        and may it please the Court:                  The only question the Court has to resolve        here is whether the Equal Protection Clause requires        every State to change its current practice and use voter          population to reapportion. The answer is no.        Alderson Reporting Company Official             Texas validly used Federal census data to       equalize total populations States have done for decades.        And the framers of the Equal Protection Clause accepted         total population as a permissible apportionment base in         Section of the Fourteenth Amendment, as Justice Kagan          said earlier.              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why don't they        use that under Section , then?                                                                  MR. KELLER: In Section of ­­        CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Voting Rights.       MR. KELLER: The Voting Rights Act?       CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.     MR. KELLER: Section of the Voting Rights          Act for tax voters ­­ and our position, unlike the          United States's position, is that only voters are        protected under the Voting Rights Act. So in         considering whether there is an opportunity to elect a         candidate of one's choice, only voters would count for         that inquiry. Indeed I ­­                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it is ­­ it is          called the one­person, one­vote. That seems to be         designed to protect voters.                MR. KELLER: It does protect voters, but        there are multiple legitimate bases here on which a         State can redistrict. Electoral equality is one of         Alderson Reporting Company Official them. Representational equality is another.                  And if I can back out, what we're dealing          with here is the general Equal Protection Clause's test         which ­­ it guards against invidious discrimination.       The Court has noted before a mere disparate impact does           not violate the Constitution. And so really the claim          that's being alleged here is one of invidious vote         dilution.             But Texas, by using total population, as       States have done for decades, and no State today uses          voter population, did not invidiously target groups to        cancel out their voting power or reduce their ability to          elect representatives of their choice.                 Rather, what Texas was doing was making the        legitimate choice to use representational equality,      which, as this Court's cases have noted, is a legitimate           interest that the State can account for in        redistricting.             What the State cannot do is submerge the        population principle. In other words, as Reynolds held,         we cannot base apportionment on geography. We have to          take account of population. And we have done that.                      There is no allegation here that our       . percent deviation of total population would not        satisfy the Court's one­person, one­vote doctrine unless       Alderson Reporting Company Official we are required to use voter population.                   JUSTICE ALITO: There are at least two        arguments that could support your position. One is that          it's one­person, one­vote, and what counts is giving        each person an equal chance of affecting the outcome of          the election. But total population figures are a good           enough proxy for eligible voters. That's one possible         argument.             And that's ­­ that's what the census       measures, and that's close enough.                 Another argument is that representational     equality is the real basis, and therefore that's why you          use population.              So which argument are you making?                  MR. KELLER: I don't believe we're making         either of those arguments, Justice Alito.                  Total population is not permissible because      it tracks voter population. At the same time, while the           Court doesn't have to reach this question,       representational equality is not the only basis on which         a State can redistrict.                It's our position that we could choose a        reliable measure of voting­eligible population without      running afoul of the Equal Protection Clause's       guaranteed against invidious discrimination.    Alderson Reporting Company Official             JUSTICE ALITO: It seems to me that the two          interests are not always consistent. They can be in          great conflict.              You can have a situation if you ­­ if you           want to equalize population, you may have a situation          where you cause great inequality in the ­­ the chances          of any ­­ of voters affecting the outcome of the          election. On the other hand, if you choose eligible          voters only, then you may have a situation where every           person within two districts does not have an equal         representation defined in some way in the legislature.                      I don't think you can just say, well,       it's ­­ you know, we serve both. What do you do when             they come into conflict?                MR. KELLER: I believe what this Court said          in Burns is you allow the States to choose the theory of            representation. And indeed, the decision to include or         exclude non­voters, Burns said, was left to the States,         because part of what this Court's doctrine has        recognized is States need leeway, and that this is a          core sovereign function. It is part of the dignity of           State sovereignty to be able to structure elections.                    And when a ­­ when a State is choosing           either representation or equality, when the two are in         tension, that's not an illegitimate basis upon which to         Alderson Reporting Company Official reapportion.             JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if the voter       population is a permissible basis under the        Constitution, I assume that's because there is ­­ is an           ethical, a good government, a liberty interest in          protecting these voters. That's a valid interest,         correct?                         MR. KELLER: Correct.    JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if in a case like          this where there is a percent deviation, something of           that order, then why isn't Texas required at that point          to recognize that these interests that are legitimate        under the Constitution, which are voter based, should        not be accommodated, and so that you should at least          give some consideration to this disparity that you have         among voters?              MR. KELLER: Well, first off, the court in         Gaffney upheld the use of total population while        recognizing that there could ­­ there was, in New York          at least, a different State, a percent deviation in            voter population. Yet the court there said it was quite           sure that a prima facie case in invidious discrimination          had not been made out.                 And so while a State can, and legitimately         does consider both representational equality and      Alderson Reporting Company Official electoral equality, the Equal Protection Clause's      general language doesn't mandate that either must take        precedence over the other.                So of course it would be legitimate for the         State to look at that data. At the same time, when we             have Federal census data, which is the most robust data          set available, it is not invidious for Texas to use that           enumeration rather than a different data set when it          reapportions. And all we have under the census data is           total population data.               JUSTICE BREYER: What we have ­­ and that's         why I think Justice Alito's question is important ­­ is           a table on page of the Blue Brief.                        Now, just looking at that table, by     inspection, I don't know whether the true ­­ whether          this is true or false. So I thought the major            difference between the two here is probably that some         areas of ­­ of the State ­­ there are a lot of people              who are working and they have children. I mean, it            can't all be explained on the basis of illegal         immigration or something. It just can't be, given those          numbers. I don't think so.                   And if we accept the principle that it's        voter equality, we are saying that the family of two of           certain age that has eight children or whatever is         Alderson Reporting Company Official getting no representation for those other people or        human beings. And if we accept the opposite, we have to            put up with inequality of ­­ of power of voters. You            have to ­­ you have to say the one or the other. And              you could take your position it's up to the State.                      But I mean, that seems to me to be what's           actually behind the numbers that he's ­­ that ­­ that          are being quoted, but I'm not sure. So I'd like your            reaction.             MR. KELLER: Sure. Justice Breyer, I        believe there's a difference between diminishing access        to representatives and actually having representation.      The United States has said that if Texas or another          State reapportioned on the basis of voter population,        that non­voters would be invisible to the system.        That's not right. They would still be represented.                     The issue is does State ­­ does a State have           to have the same amount of constituents per        representative? And a State can do so. It's a            legitimate ­­             JUSTICE BREYER: That sounds an awful lot        what they had in or something, where the British          Parliament said, well, don't worry, America, you're       represented by the people in England because after all,         they represent everybody in the British Empire.       Alderson Reporting Company Official                         MR. KELLER: Which is ­­     JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, that people are         being represented through somebody else is a little ­­         possible, but tough.               MR. KELLER: Well, for instance, a child in          my congressional district would still be represented by        that member of Congress. So the issue is ­­ really is            diminishing access to the representative. And while        that's a legitimate basis for a State to reapportion           under, there is no Equal Protection principle that would         elevate that as a rule of constitutional law that would           say that the Sate of Texas invidiously discriminated.                    JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why is one option        exclusive of the other? Why can't you have both? You            have population equality and voter equality, both,       especially when you have indicated that a voter­based         apportionment is ­­ is valid and serves important        purposes. And here it's being completely ­­ it's being          very substantially disregarded with this huge deviation.                   Why can't you use both?                 MR. KELLER: Well, first of all, there's        been no demonstrative plan that was submitted to the         Texas legislature, which has a notice­and­comment       procedure on this, or to the district court, that both          of these could have been equalized within percent.         Alderson Reporting Company Official Indeed, their demographer didn't specify the extent of        the deviations. Their demographer simply said, well,        the deviations can be reduced.                 If the Court were to try to go down the road           of requiring States to equalize within percent of a          deviation, both total and voter population, States would        inevitably have to disregard many other traditional       redistricting factors, like compactness, continuity,     keeping communities together. And that would be the         opposite of what the Court has said that States have in           this context, which is the leeway to structure their         elections as part of the core function of their         sovereignty.             JUSTICE KENNEDY: That sounds highly      probable to me.                 Has anything been written on this, or any      studies on this ­­                           Texas.             MR. KELLER: I ­­ I ­­ I don't ­­            JUSTICE KENNEDY: ­­ in ­­ in the context of          MR. KELLER: I ­­ I ­­ I don't believe so.              We're not aware of any. And we're also not aware that            this would be practically feasible. Indeed, if they had          a plausible allegation that this was possible, we would         have expected to see a demonstrative map at this phase           Alderson Reporting Company Official in the litigation.               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any idea         how often this is a problem? I mean, it is a case that,                 of course, around the country, people use total        population. But it seems to me that there will be a lot              of areas where, in terms of the actual numbers, it's not           going to make a difference.                              Do you have any idea?     MR. KELLER: I believe New York's amicus         brief suggests that in places such as California,        Alaska, possibly New York, certainly New York City, the         issue will absolutely come up. However, even ­­                    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But only in ­­ only         in those particular handful of ­­                             MR. KELLER: A few more examples ­­        CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I'm not       suggesting ­­                         MR. KELLER: ­­ Delaware, Maryland.      By no means would this necessarily be a        problem anywhere. However, if there were a rule that a            State had to consider voter population, that would        change the nature of redistricting.                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if it        were you had the same minor or de minimis deviation          allowed there? In other words, if you're within ­­ the           Alderson Reporting Company Official deviation between total population and voter population       was within ­­ under percent, does that take care of           many of the areas where it's a problem?                     MR. KELLER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, for        the reasons I just suggested to Justice Kennedy, I          believe that would be quite an onerous burden and change          the nature of redistricting. Could there possibly be a          situation out there in which a plan might be able to get             within a percent deviation of total population and a            percent deviation of the five­year rolling average        sampling in the American Community Survey? Maybe. I'm          not aware of any such scenario.                  And to back out to first principles, I don't          believe that would be a test of invidious         discrimination. That would be moving much further in         the direction of a disparate, impact­like test that the          Court has never fashioned to determine whether someone's        voting power is being canceled out, or is fenced out of           the political process.               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you explain why       the ACS ­­ your adversary says ACS is fine; it's used in            Section and Section . Why would it be inappropriate            to use it in ­­ in deciding the impact on an equal            voting analysis?              MR. KELLER: Well, our position is that if         Alderson Reporting Company Official the ACS data is reliable enough to hold the State liable           under Section of the Voting Rights Act, it would also            be reliable enough to use in apportionment.                   Now there could be issues about the       granularity of the data. For instance, the five­year         averages. We do get at census­block level, which is          about five to to , people.                   The smaller you would get for district       levels, depending on if you were at a city plan as            opposed to our State Senate plan. There may be issues           where you couldn't use the data to get within the           percent­deviation.              But certainly in larger districts, like the       Texas State Senate plan, you could use the five­year         CVAP data, and you could do that to get within the            percent deviation. Of course, we're not        constitutionally compelled to, because as the Court       recognized in Burns, that is up to the States in          choosing a legitimate population basis.                  If I could briefly address the       United States's argument on Section of the Voting          Rights Act. We disagree on this point.                    Section of the Voting Rights Act does not          protect non­voters. And earlier when we discussed        Section , I'd like to return to that to cite to the            Alderson Reporting Company Official Court the Persily amicus brief of page , because I          think this cuts against the United States's theory on         Section .              Persily brief says, "If the minority group       has very low rates of citizenship, then the        redistricting plan is not to blame for their lack of          representation. Rather, their lack of sufficient voters        is."             So the United State's suggestion that there       could be packing or cracking claims of communities that         have nothing to do with packing or cracking voting         blocks, that is an incorrect interpretation of       Section . It is not consonant with the tax, and it            would render Section unconstitutional, as not        congruent and proportional with the right to vote that         is being protected.               If the Court has no further questions, thank        you, Mr. Chief Justice.                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.                   Mr. Gershengorn.             ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN          FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING                               APPELLEES             MR. GERSHENGORN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may        it please the Court:    Alderson Reporting Company Official             Redistricting on the basis of total      population, as Texas did here, vindicates the principle        of equal representation for equal numbers of people that         is at the heart of Reynolds and Wesberry. We thus agree            that Texas was not required to redistrict on the basis          of some as­yet­undefined measure of voter population.                   However, we disagree that the Court should       go on to decide that Texas is free in the future to            redistrict on the basis of some measure of population ­­         voter population if it so chooses.                  There are, in our view, at least four        reasons why voter population cannot be required.                   First is the one mentioned by Justice Kagan.        We think it would be a very odd interpretation to say            that the Constitution forbids for State legislative       redistricting what it requires for congressional      redistricting.             Second is the very long history of States ­­        of States redistricting on a basis other than ­­ other           than voter population. At the time of the framing of           the Fourteenth Amendment, there were the vast majority        of states redistricted on other­than­voter population.      In the wake of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress in the          apportionment acts required districting on the basis of        inhabitants. And, of course, over the last years,          Alderson Reporting Company Official States have unanimously redistricted on the basis of        total population, not voter population.                 Third is the ­­ is ­­ are the data problems,          and they are real. The ACS data has a number of             limitations. First of all, it is not constitutionally         required, unlike the census. It would be very odd, we           think, for the Court to demand, as a constitutional          standard, data that does not even have to be collected.                      Second, it does not measure what the ­­ what         the plaintiffs suggest is required. It is not a measure            of voter eligibility. CVAP does not include ­­        citizen­voting­age population data, for example, does      not include felons. It does not include overseas         voters. It does not include the mentally ill. That           kind of data just does not exist.                   And third with respect to the data, picking        up on Justice Sotomayor's point, the data in the ACS          does not exist at the level of granularity, accuracy,         and timeliness needed to redistrict. To be clear, the          data level does not exist at the census block level,          which is where districting happens. It is not issued on           a timely basis. The census data comes out, for example,           in April . The ACS data, the five­year average          comes out in December, and it has data from going           forward. Alderson Reporting Company Official             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's often used       for Section .               MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, it's used for        a very different purpose with respect to Section . In           Section it is used as one factor among many to            determine whether electoral opportunity has been ­­ has        been given. So it's used along with ­­ with population           data, voting data, turnout data, a whole variety of          socioeconomic factors.              That's very different than this Court saying       every State and thousands of local jurisdictions       throughout the country have to use that data as the sole           measure for redistricting.                I'd like to then pick up on Justice       Kennedy's question.              JUSTICE ALITO: Well, can I ask you this?          Who has standing to bring a Reynolds v. Sims claim? Is             it anybody who is counted in the census?                    MR. GERSHENGORN: So Your Honor, that's a        question this Court noted and reserved in Baker v. Carr          in footnote . And it's a question that this Court has             never had to resolve in the context of Wesberry, which          of course has the exact same rule.                   We think that nothing ­­ not much turns on         it because, as a practical measure, you can get a voter.             Alderson Reporting Company Official You can always find a voter in the district. But let me              explain why we don't think it, sort of, is dispositive          here, and this goes to a number of those issues ­­                       has ­­             morning.             JUSTICE ALITO: Are you going to tell me who          MR. GERSHENGORN: ­­ we've heard this       JUSTICE ALITO: Are you going to tell me who          has standing or not?                MR. GERSHENGORN: Yes, Your Honor. We think         that it is ­­ we think that the ­­ the better           understanding is that a non­voter would have standing.         But I ­­ here's why I don't think it matters: Because              you can view our position as through either lens,         through a representational lens in which what's        happening is that the Reynolds v. Sims right is a way to             ensure that all persons covered by the Equal Protection         Clause who can't ­­ even those who cannot cast a ballot            still have a voice in representational ­­                   JUSTICE ALITO: That includes everybody who       is counted in the census.                                                     MR. GERSHENGORN: Yes, Your Honor.      JUSTICE ALITO: It includes ­­     MR. GERSHENGORN: But let me say ­­       JUSTICE ALITO: It includes aliens. It        Alderson Reporting Company Official includes prisoners.                          aliens.             MR. GERSHENGORN: And let me ­­      JUSTICE ALITO: It includes undocumented      MR. GERSHENGORN: But let me explain why I         don't think it's necessary.                JUSTICE ALITO: But does it include all        those groups?                          MR. GERSHENGORN: I'm sorry, Your Honor?       JUSTICE ALITO: Does it include members of        all of those groups?                MR. GERSHENGORN: So we think it might, but         we don't think that you have to agree with that to rule            in our way. Because we do think that the right at            Reynolds is also viewed, as we said on page of our            brief ­­ and we think this is important ­­ as a voter             right. The way to think about this, as Reynolds did,           was to view this as a right ­­ consistent with the way             Reynolds thought about it, was to say that, when you          have twice the representatives in ­­ twice the ­­ the          inhabitants in a district, you get half the vote.                      What Reynolds said, picking up on      Plaintiff's counsel's position, was that of course it        would violate the Constitution to count somebody's vote        as two or five or ten times. But then what it said in              Alderson Reporting Company Official the next sentence: "Of course, the effect of State          legislative districting schemes which give the same       number of representatives to unequal number of       constituents is identical." That is exactly the point         we're making here.               And if I could pick up, then, on         Justice Kennedy's and the Chief Justice's point about        why can't you do both.                 The reason is very much ­­ and we agree with          General Keller that the problem with doing both is that          it ­­ it largely eliminates a State's flexibility to          deal with the traditional redistricting factors. What        you are forced to do is take a large, for example, Anglo             population in one part of the State that has high          citizen rates and pair it with the situation where it          has ­­ with ­­ with populations that have low         citizenship rates in another part of the State.                      Or to take an example from the amicus      briefs, Manhattan has percent children. Brooklyn has           percent. If you have to do both, what you're doing            is pairing people from the ­­ from part of Manhattan          and ­­ and pairing them with part of ­­ of voters in            Brooklyn. What ends up happening is to do both at the            level of percent is to eliminate a State's ability to            take into account things like political subdivisions, to        Alderson Reporting Company Official take into account compactness, and all of the other         things that this Court has said is critical in         redistricting.               As to the Chief Justice's question about     whether this is a big deal or not, or whether it's ­­            "big deal" isn't the right word ­­ whether it would have           a large practical effect ­­ I would assume it's a big             deal. That's why we're here.                  (Laughter.)             MR. GERSHENGORN: ­­ as to whether it would         have a large practical effect. I think the answer to             that is yes.               What we're talking about is not just        States but thousands of jurisdictions around the       country, local jurisdictions, none of whom use voter        population as a measure for redistricting.                   What the amicus briefs show is this is not         just a situation in which things are affected ­­ States           are affected where there are citizenship differences       between citizens and noncitizens, but that children       actually are a critical part of it. It's not just that             Manhattan is percent and Brooklyn is percent          children. In Texas, the counties range, the amicus         briefs suggest, from percent in some counties to           percent in other counties. In Alaska the difference         Alderson Reporting Company Official between rural and urban is percent children in some          and ­­ percent in another.                   This is an issue that is going to affect         States and local jurisdictions throughout the country.       And local jurisdictions, to be clear, don't have the         data at the level and ­­ at the level in which this            Court would now be requiring as a constitutional matter.                      Now, I'd like to pick up on one other point          that Plaintiff's counsel raised, which is that, in his         view, it's quite unclear as to what Wesberry actually         holds. We think that that is really a fundamental           misreading of Wesberry.               What Wesberry said was ­­ the whole point of         Wesberry was that the ­­ the method of apportioning or          allocating representatives to the States had to be the         same as the method for allocating within districts in a          State. That was the reason that ­­ when what Wesberry           said was that the great compromise had to be reflected          into ­­ into redistricting.                That principle in Wesberry was exactly the       principle that then the Court adopted in Reynolds,        what ­­ what the Court said in Reynolds. It was           Wesberry that clearly established the fundamental      principle of representative government in this country       as one of equal representation for equal numbers of         Alderson Reporting Company Official people, without regard to race, sex, economic status, or         place of residence within the State.                  So it is precisely that same principle from        Wesberry which looked at the ­­ looked at the ­­ looked           at the framing and looked at the discussion of ­­ of           calculation of representatives at the framing, which       looked at the drafting of the Fourteenth Amendment, and         took that history, and then translated that ­­                   JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't your argument that       voters are ­­ are irrelevant?                 MR. GERSHENGORN: So Your Honor, I don't         think our argument is that voters are irrelevant. And          first of all ­­ so a couple of points on that.                        First, of course, the question here is, when        Texas has chosen to use total population, is that         permissible? And we think that clearly is.                    Second, we don't think voters are irrelevant       for the reasons that I've said. The ­­ what Reynolds           did was ­­ and the Reynolds line of cases was to use            total population to vindicate the voters' right. It is          a voters' right ­­ because Reynolds understood that,        when you have twice the inhabitants in the district, you          have half the ­­ half the voice before your         representative.             JUSTICE ALITO: What would you say about the          Alderson Reporting Company Official extreme case ­­ I mean, your time is going to going to             expire ­­ an extreme case. And maybe this would never           come up, but what if it did?                   Suppose you have a district ­­ you have a          rural district, and suppose it's a State where the ­­          the total number of ­­ the total population per district          is ­­ is fairly small. You have a rural district with a              huge prison and very few other inhabitants. So you ­­          and you have a neighboring district that has no prison.                       So in one district, you have that percent         of the population are eligible voters; and the other         district, percent of the ­­ the population are         eligible voters. That would be okay?                   MR. GERSHENGORN: So Your Honor, two points        in response.               First, this Court has recognized ­­ and we       don't dispute ­­ that census data isn't the sole data.          A State can ­­ and this Court approved it in Mahan ­­           make adjustments to census data to more accurately        capture actual residents in the State. We think that's          what has been happening in Hawaii, and that's what Mahan          said.             Remember in Mahan, what the State had       done ­­ what Virginia had done was count all of the Navy            personnel as home ported, which is what the census had          Alderson Reporting Company Official done. And the Court said you have to make an adjustment            to that.                                      remaining. Thank you, Your Honor.    CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       Mr. Consovoy, you have four minutes              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM S. CONSOVOY                    ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS                             MR. CONSOVOY: Thank you.     Justice Breyer, to your question about      representation of children. If that were the principle         of Reynolds against Sims, in a statewide election, a          State could give five votes to a family of five and one             vote to an individual.                That would ­­              JUSTICE BREYER: I'm just thinking that I'd        like to know, before knowing whether this is mandatory         or not, your position. I'd like to know an awful lot            more than I know about who these people are who are            being represented on the representational theory, and       who are not being represented on the voter theory.                     MR. CONSOVOY: In each ­­                 JUSTICE BREYER: Now I don't know who they          are from the briefs; and therefore, it's pretty tough         for me to ­­ to tell.      Alderson Reporting Company Official             MR. CONSOVOY: The data shows that it's a         mix of noncitizens, children, all the categories;       disenfranchised felons. It's a ­­ it's a mix. There             are children involved, of course.                 If ­­                         But ­­ but our point is more fundamental.        JUSTICE BREYER: Illegal immigrants.     MR. CONSOVOY: Some. But who have not ­­         who the State has chosen not to allow to vote. The            State can solve this problem themselves. These States         can enfranchise these people and give them the vote.         The States come here to say we do not want them to vote,             but we want them to count for districting. That should           be rejected by this Court.                 Second ­­             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not quite      accurate. For ­­ for most States, too many, they          disenfranchise prisoners, except for those who come from        that locale, which is quite rational. Most States         disenfranchise the mentally ill. So how are they ­­ who           else are they going to disenfranchise?                  MR. CONSOVOY: I'm not suggesting ­­ we're        not suggesting we should choose for the State who they          allow to vote. We are ­­ we are arguing that we should             not allow the States to come to this Court and argue           Alderson Reporting Company Official that they should get the benefit of them counting when          they make the choice, that is their right, to         disenfranchise them.              You cannot disconnect this rule from voting       and allow it to stand up. The whole thing collapses.           Wesberry has the famous sentence now that says all other          rights are illusory if the right to vote is taken away.                       That's ­­ the authors of that sentence would        be surprised to learn that the one­person, one­vote rule         has literally nothing to do with voting; that you could          have a system that crowds, in Senate districts, all           eligible voters but ­­ of them into one, and give            each other person their own district. That plan would          be sustainable, absent some evidence of racial or        political discrimination.              The State comes in to say we know we can't          do it, but we'll never try. That's not how one­person,           one­vote works. The State­by­State law forced       themselves not to try this by saying they weren't         allowed to. If they were told by this Court that they            could at least ­­ to your point, Justice Kennedy ­­ do           both, they would go back to the drawing board and try.           If they failed, they may win that case. We suspect, and            we have alleged, so it must be taken as true, that they            can do both.   Alderson Reporting Company Official             And Justice Kennedy, it will not be       traditional interest like districting, or county lines,       or anything like that will be ­­ that will inhibit them.           It is political and racial gerrymandering that they want         to do, and that our rule, and especially a rule           balancing both, will stop them. And we don't know that           abstractly; we know that from the case the Court heard          just before us.               The actual deviations in Arizona ­­ the       hypothetical case ­­ they are claiming it's an percent           deviation. On page of their own jurisdictional         statement, they concede that the CVAP deviations are         percent. And in District , the district mostly at           issue, is underpopulated by percent.                  If Arizona had to go back to the drawing         board with the Districting Commission and accommodate at        least voter, but at least ­­ or maybe both, there would           be no opportunity to engage in the political and racial          gerrymandering that has come to dominate the       redistricting process. That would not involve the Court         in those issues anymore. It would be solved         legislatively, as they should.                Section does not work without this        understanding. As Justice Scalia pointed out in his         dissent in Chisom v. Roemer, there is nothing to measure          Alderson Reporting Company Official against if one­person, one­vote doesn't protect voters.       It's the baseline.               How do you know if minority vote dilution        has occurred unless you have a baseline to measure          against? The baseline is equal voting power of voters          absent discrimination. It completely unravels.                                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.       The case is submitted.    (Whereupon, at : p.m., the case in the        above­entitled
