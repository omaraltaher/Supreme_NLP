CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument


next in Number 01-1269, the City of Cuyahoga Falls versus


Buckeye Community Hope Foundation.


Mr. Nager.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. NAGER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth


Circuit held that a municipality may be held liable in


damages because it withheld the issuance of building


permits for a proposed housing project pending a citizen-


initiated referendum election on the ordinance authorizing 

that housing project. 


In so doing, the Sixth Circuit failed to


appreciate that the municipality's actions here were all


taken pursuant to pre-existing procedures set forth in the


city's charter, procedures that the city followed to the


letter.  As non-discretionary acts taken in the normal


prescribed course, the municipality's actions here were


necessarily rational ones taken without discriminatory


motives and without treating the respondents here any


differently than any other beneficiary of an ordinance

would have been treated that was subject to a petition.


And for that reason, we respectfully suggest that the


Sixth Circuit --


QUESTION:  There's no evidence of some kind of


misbehavior on the part of the city other than the bare


claim that they refused to issue the permit during the


process of the referendum?


MR. NAGER:  That's correct, Justice O'Connor. 


Every official action of the city here favored the


respondents.  The city planning commission recommended


approval of the housing project and of the site plan


authorizing the housing project.  The city council voted


in favor of the housing project. 


QUESTION:  Wasn't there some evidence that some


city official was -- sought to delay the proceedings for a 

period of time, not -- not officially.  It didn't take --


pass any resolution, but didn't they oppose immediate


action on a couple of occasions?


MR. NAGER:  Justice Stevens, prior to the city


council voting on the -- the ordinance to approve the


project, there was a lot of public debate, and in that


public debate, there were city officials who said we --


we need to take time to hear the citizens -- citizens'


concerns.  We need to take time to understand what we're


doing, and there were even comments, we should fight this.

We should fight this and delay this.


QUESTION:  Supposing one of those comments said


we should fight this because we don't want


African-Americans to -- to move where they're going to


move, would that make any difference? 


MR. NAGER:  It -- it could make a difference. 


QUESTION:  Because even -- if that had happened,


it would still be true, as you pointed out earlier, that


every official action taken by the city was favorable to


the -- your opponents.


MR. NAGER:  Well, if -- if the actions were


taken favorably to the opponents, it couldn't make a


difference because at that point the alleged statement


wouldn't have any connection to an adverse action. 


That -- that's the important point in this case because in 

order to have discrimination, either in violation of the


Equal Protection Clause, or in violation of the Fair


Housing Act, you not only have to have a motive, you have


to have adverse differential treatment by the person --


QUESTION:  So what -- I'm trying to be sure


I understand.  I -- I think I understand your position. 


Is -- your position is that even if this ambiguous


evidence was -- clearly showed racial hostility and that's


why we're trying to delay it, there still would be no


cause of action because everything the city did was in

favor of -- officially was in favor of --


MR. NAGER:  That -- that's correct. 


QUESTION:  So that really, we don't have to try


and draw -- to decide whether or not inferences of


improper motive can be drawn from those statements. 


MR. NAGER:  That's correct because in this case,


all of the city's actions either favored the project or


non-discretionary actions.


QUESTION:  Now, what if the city had taken the


same official action that it took in this case, and every


official action either favored or was at least neutral,


and yet the city officials went out and -- and whipped up,


in effect, anti-black sentiment and -- and urged the


filing of the application for the referendum, would the


answer -- would the -- would the result be the same, 

that -- that there would be no way that the city could be


held liable?


MR. NAGER:  The short answer to that question is


the answer would be the same.  Of course, if the


referendum were enacted, it went to a vote and it were put


into effect and it was racially motivated, that action


would be subject to challenge because that would be, in


fact, an action of the city because they would have


adopted, under your hypothetical facts, an ordinance that


could allegedly have a discriminatory intent.

 QUESTION:  But isn't the -- isn't the delay


simply a -- even the delay in -- in an instance in which


the ordinance is defeated simply a lesser degree of


damage, but which would, nonetheless, be -- be subject to


a claim?


MR. NAGER:  And the answer to that is no.  And


the answer to that is no because the delay that happened


here is the delay that would happen with regard to any


referendum that was subject to a referendum petition.  And


the record here is quite clear --


QUESTION:  Well, it -- there's -- there's no


question that it -- it would, but is -- is the -- is


either the -- the statute in question here or the Equal


Protection Clause blind to an obvious reason for the


delay?  In other words, I -- I quite agree.  We start with


the assumption that mere delay in governmental processes


does not give rise to a cause of action, but when the


delay is induced by city officials for a racially


discriminatory reason, aren't we then in a different case?


MR. NAGER:  Well, it's a different case, but


it's not different outcome here, and the --


QUESTION:  Why shouldn't it be a different


outcome?


MR. NAGER:  Well, because under Monell and its


progeny, as well as this Court's State action cases, the

municipality can be held liable only in damages only if


the city -- an official with the authority to authorize it


has authorized the discriminatory action that you're


talking about.  In this specific instance, the -- every


official action favored the project, and the delay that


you're talking about was authorized by a city charter


created 30 years before the fact. 


QUESTION:  Well, the mechanism -- the mechanism


is provided by the city charter. 


I guess what I'm getting at is that if city


officials -- let's just say the mayor, for the sake of


argument, or the mayor and the city council -- in effect,


do not establish a policy in the sense that they say, we


want to stop black housing projects, but they follow a


policy of trying to make it difficult for those housing 

projects to be approved, and one way they do that is by


spurring the -- the request for referendums.  Assuming


we're going to apply the Monell rule here, isn't that a


policy position of the city even within the meaning of


Monell?


MR. NAGER:  No, because they wouldn't have the


authority to do that.  There's a difference between six


city council members voting at a city council meeting as


to what the actions of the city are, and six city council


members going out on their own in their private capacities

and expressing their views as citizens, and -- and trying


to get other citizens to agree with them as to their


private views.


QUESTION:  But not --


QUESTION:  Well, supposing, Mr. Nager, that you


have, say, a -- say, a seven-member city council and it's


confronted with a project like this.  And one of the seven


members of the city council says that, you know, he's


opposed to this because he doesn't want African-Americans


moving into this area.  The other six members of the city


council simply treat the thing on the merits.  Does the


action of this one individual taint the whole action of


the city?


MR. NAGER:  Well, it shouldn't.  Under Arlington


Heights and this Court's cases, the city could be held 

liable only if those authorized, in this instance a


majority of the city council, had the -- the


discriminatory --


QUESTION:  What if the vote was four to three?


MR. NAGER:  Four -- if it was four to three in


favor of the housing project --


QUESTION:  No.  Against the housing project. 


MR. NAGER:  If -- if they had discretionary


power, and four of them exercised their discretionary


power against the housing project on the basis of racially

discriminatory --


QUESTION:  Well, only one had the racially


discriminatory motive, one of the four.


MR. NAGER:  Well --


QUESTION:  The other three did it on the merits.


MR. NAGER:  I think there, there would be a good


argument that they would still -- that -- that the


plaintiffs would have -- would have satisfied their burden


of showing but for the racially discriminatory motive,


that the housing project would have been approved.  So


in -- in that hypothetical, which is not the facts of this


case, of course, they -- they would have had sufficient


evidence to state a claim.


QUESTION:  And your difference in the two cases


is, one, you have an official action taken. 

We deny the


project.  Here you don't have that. 


But suppose there had been, to take the clearest


case, a tape of a meeting.  The mayor, the legal director,


the head of the city council, they all got together and


say, we want to kill this project and we know that the


most effective way to do that is through this referendum


because the people won't like it and they'll vote against


it.  So they have a deliberate plan to string the thing


out and then, as the last act, instigate a referendum.


And as I take it, your argument -- you would --

you're saying even if you have that scenario, there would


still be no municipal liability.  Am I correct?


MR. NAGER:  That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 


It's obviously our hardest hypothetical, but it's also the


same answer.  And it -- and one of the reasons it's the


same answer is because, remember, under your hypothetical,


the notion is that if these city officials, not acting in


their -- exercising their official powers, but acting in


the role any citizen can, can go out and organize the


citizens of the community acting in their private


capacities to get a referendum on the ballot and vote


against it.  Of course, that's what democracy is about. 


It's about politicians taking on causes on behalf of


people --


QUESTION: 


Mr. Nager, I think -- I understand 

your argument as it applies to the city, but am I correct


that the mayor is an individual defendant in this case?


MR. NAGER:  He was.  He was granted summary


judgment by the district court on the ground that there


was no evidence that he in his individual capacity had


committed any of the acts that were alleged against him,


and that he had not organized the campaign --


QUESTION:  But -- but wasn't that reversed by


the Sixth Circuit? 


MR. NAGER:  No, it wasn't.  That issue was not

taken up to the Sixth Circuit. 


QUESTION:  Why is he a petitioner then?


MR. NAGER:  He's only here in his official


capacity.  He was sued in both his individual capacity and


in his official capacity.


QUESTION:  I see.  So there's no individual


liability at stake here at all.


MR. NAGER:  No, not -- not --


QUESTION:  Is -- is the --


QUESTION:  I'd like to ask a question, which is


these have been very interesting hypotheticals, but are


you going to have time to talk about the questions that we


granted cert on?


MR. NAGER:  Well --


QUESTION: 


And I'm interested -- what we have in 

front of us now at this point as issues.


MR. NAGER:  The issue that you have before us is


the Sixth Circuit's judgment is -- is -- because under the


Sixth Circuit's view there was allegedly evidence of


racial bias among the citizens that the municipality could


be -- somehow be held liable for that.  And that's wrong


for two reasons. 


One, it's wrong because the municipality itself


has to have the discriminatory animus, and there's no --


not only no evidence of that here, it couldn't have been

the case since they -- of course, all of their actions


were voting in favor of it, or treating the action


neutrally. 


Secondly --


QUESTION:  Arguably the discriminatory animus on


the part of the citizens could invalidate the referendum.


MR. NAGER:  If it was voted on and put into


effect, the alleged animus --


QUESTION:  No.  Even -- even if it wasn't put


into effect.  It -- if there were that animus, it -- it


could -- by our past cases anyway, if it could be shown,


it would -- it would invalidate the referendum.  But your


point is that whether the referendum was valid or invalid,


the municipality would have had to stay the project.  It


wasn't up to the municipality to make the judgment. 

MR. NAGER:  That -- that is correct, Justice


Scalia.  I -- I do want to make clear that under this


Court's cases, the Court has never said that -- that the


First Amendment activity of a petition itself is subject


to an equal protection challenge.


What the Court's cases say is if there is a


vote, either on a bill by elected representatives, or on a


petition by citizens, that the end product of that, which


becomes a law, can be challenged, and that private animus


in that -- is contextual evidence for whether or not the

people who voted on that final product were themselves


motivated by discriminatory animus.


QUESTION:  You're -- you're talking about people


who vote in a referendum?


MR. NAGER:  Well, the -- the question is if


there's a final product, was the -- the final law, was


that racially motivated --


QUESTION:  But we -- we've never said -- we've


never tried to examine the motives of -- of the citizenry


who vote in a referendum on that sort of question, have


we?


MR. NAGER:  No, you haven't, Mr. Chief Justice. 


What the Court has said is, is that intent of the law is


the key test, and what the Court has said in Arlington


Heights is because you can't look directly at the motives 

of the people who voted on it, whether they be legislators


protected by the Speech and Debate Clause or citizens


protected by the -- the secrecy of the ballot in this


country, they look at other indicia to determine their


intent. 


QUESTION:  But Arlington Heights was a city


council, or --


MR. NAGER:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  -- was it not?


MR. NAGER:  That's correct.

 QUESTION:  What -- what is --


QUESTION:  And here the referendum failed.


MR. NAGER:  That -- well, the -- we don't know


the outcome because the respondents asked for the final


vote not to be certified. 


But what is important here, I think, to address


the issue in this case, Justice O'Connor, is that the --


the position of the Sixth Circuit here is that the


municipality is somehow supposed to inquire behind a


facially neutral referendum petition and determine the


intent and motives of people engaged in the First


Amendment. 


QUESTION:  Did -- did the city have discretion


here to go ahead and issue building permits while the


referendum process was pending?


MR. NAGER:  No, it didn't.  Once the referendum


petition was filed, under the city charter, the -- at that


point, all the city council could do is repeal its own


ordinance or submit the ordinance to a vote of the voters.


QUESTION:  So what is the claim in your opinion


that we are reviewing?  I mean, I want it to be specific. 


The Sixth Circuit, insofar as its -- insofar as we're


concerned, we're interested in what the lower courts held.


MR. NAGER:  Correct.


QUESTION:  What, in your opinion, is the claim

that they're reviewing?  Is the claim that these three


individuals, the mayor, the clerk, and an engineer, acting


in their official capacities, violated the Fourteenth


Amendment or other parts of the Constitution when they


refused to issue the permit despite the petition and


despite the provision?  Is that the claim?  Or is the


claim they did something else as well?  They stirred up


the petition people, or they did some other thing. 


MR. NAGER:  Well, the -- the Sixth Circuit said


it was the former.


QUESTION:  Only the first.


MR. NAGER:  Correct.  Respondents in their brief


have abandoned what the Sixth Circuit held and which we


petitioned and the Court granted cert to review to argue a


completely different theory.


QUESTION:  May I ask you, Mr. Nager, is the


complaint in the record?  I couldn't find it.  In the --


in the papers here?


MR. NAGER:  I don't believe that it is.  No, I


don't believe -- I mean, it's -- it's obviously in the


record of the case.  It wasn't reprinted in the -- in the


joint appendix. 


Unless the Court has further questions, I'll


reserve the remainder of --


QUESTION:  Well, I -- I do.  Weren't -- weren't

there some other questions here, like didn't we grant cert


on three questions --


MR. NAGER:  Well, you did --


QUESTION:  Have they given up on the second one?


MR. NAGER:  Well, they've abandoned their claim


that they litigated and prevailed on in the Sixth Circuit,


that they could proceed on the disparate impact theory.


QUESTION:  And the last is a due process?


MR. NAGER:  A -- a substantive due process


claim.


Yes.


QUESTION:  Substantive due process? 


MR. NAGER:  And the Sixth Circuit held that


there was a triable question of fact as to whether or not


the city had acted rationally in proceeding forward with 

its referendum petition.  And we would say that the simple


answer to that was at that time, the city charter required


the city officials to do so and that judgment was adopted


by three courts until the Ohio Supreme Court several years


later reversed itself on what the meaning of the Ohio


constitution was.  But the subsequent reversal of this


highest court's evaluation of what the law was can't


change the rationality of the acts at the time that they


were taken. 


QUESTION:  Very well, Mr. Nager.

 Mr. Salmons, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS


ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS


MR. SALMONS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


Respondents challenge only the delay caused by


the city charter's neutral, longstanding provisions


facilitating the orderly processing of citizen-initiated


referenda to review ordinances passed by the city council. 


Such a challenge requires courts to balance the vital


First Amendment right implicated in the referendum process


with the equally valid goals of equal protection and fair


housing. 


In this case, that balance is clear.  The city's


actions in giving effect to the properly filed referendum


petition cannot give rise to liability under the Fair


Housing Act or the Equal Protection Clause.  It is


undisputed that the referendum petition was facially


neutral and that numerous reasonable, non-racial grounds


supported it.


It is also undisputed that the city's process


for handling such petitions was longstanding and


race-neutral.  Under any conceivable standard, respondents


have failed to provide any evidence that the referendum

process was tainted with discriminatory motive either on


the part of the city officials or the petition organizers.


QUESTION:  Suppose it was.  I mean, I don't


understand your brief from this point of view.  You were


talking about an antitrust analogy.  I mean, imagine a


plaintiff in an antitrust case deliberately, to ruin his


competitor -- and no one doubts it -- files a case in the


court.  Now, no matter how evil that person was, I can't


imagine or I haven't heard to date under the antitrust law


or any other law somebody who would sue the clerk of the


court because he docketed the -- he docketed the -- the


claim -- he docketed the complaint.  And according to what


you've said, that's what's at issue here, that they're --


they're simply carry -- now, I -- I need some explanation. 


I'm bringing it up because I'm quite honestly confused 

about that part --


MR. SALMONS:  Yes -- yes, Your Honor.  Yes, Your


Honor.  To be sure, the analogy to the Noerr-Pennington


line of cases is not perfect in this case, but it -- it --


QUESTION:  I -- I bring it up because I'm


confused as to how in your mind you see this thing


working.  I -- I mean, I suppose if a city has a totally


evil, horrible petition for a -- for a -- for a


referendum, a person still could make it and the person


who's in charge of carrying out the -- the non -- the

ministerial duties himself would not be sued even if that


person himself was evil.  So -- so what is the -- what --


what -- how does this all work in your mind?


MR. SALMONS:  Yes, Your Honor.  The -- the


approach that we recommend in our brief, Your Honor, is


that the Court undertake the question as to whether the


petitioning at issue was genuine or whether it was a sham. 


That's the same type of analysis the Court has


undertaken --


QUESTION:  Assume it's a sham.  It -- they're


evil.  They're horrible. 


MR. SALMONS:  Yes. 


QUESTION:  They're terrible.  I would think even


an evil, horrible, terrible person has the right to go to


the legislature and petition and that the clerks who are 

to file that petition are themselves clerks, and they're


to do it even if they're evil themselves.


MR. SALMONS:  That is correct, Your Honor. 


I think there are two ways in which the city could


potentially be held liable.  I think this is not a case


where the Court has to decide whether the city could ever


be held liable based on the discriminatory motives of the


referendum petitioners because it's clear in this case


that the petitioning was genuine and this isn't a sham.


QUESTION:  But what -- what --

 MR. SALMONS:  But in the situation where you do


have a sham --


QUESTION:  What -- what do you mean by saying


the petition was genuine as opposed to a sham in these --


in this context?


MR. SALMONS:  I -- I think genuine here means


the same it means in -- in the other contexts in which the


Court has used the sham doctrine, namely that it was about


the First Amendment activity.  The -- the process that --


that the city here --


QUESTION:  I just -- this is such a strange


argument.  Why wouldn't we wait and see if some action was


taken by means of a referendum, passed and became law? 


Then wouldn't we be able to say that constitutes State


action at that point and you would subject it, 

conceivably, to an equal protection analysis if the issue


is raised, and apply rational basis or whatever it is? 


I don't understand why you ever get to this sham action


and Noerr-Pennington.


MR. SALMONS:  Certainly, Your Honor, it -- in


the event that you have a referendum that's actually


enacted into law, the Court would examine it in the way


that -- that you have articulated.


We thought it was important to point out to the


Court that this process by which a city ordinance is, if

you will, stayed pending resolution of the referendum vote


is a traditional and important part of the process for


referendums, but it is also a process that can give rise


to abuse if you have a petition that is a sham.  It's not


about the First Amendment process at all.  It's simply --


QUESTION:  I don't --


MR. SALMONS:  -- taking advantage of the delay. 


QUESTION:  I don't know what you mean by abuse


in a situation like this.  I mean, presumably anybody has


a right to petition, and you know, the fact that maybe


they won't get the necessary votes surely doesn't make it


a sham.


MR. SALMONS:  That -- that is certainly true,


Your Honor.  But -- but I think there are -- to -- to get


back to the original question, what I'm trying to --

QUESTION:  The reason I'm worried, in about


2 minutes from now I'm going to hear the other side get


up, and they're going to say this is a sham.  Okay? 


I suspect.  Now, that's why I want to understand the


relevance of this. 


And I -- I come into this thinking if it's the


Nazis, the -- the most terrible racists that steal, the


most terrible people in the world, if they're Americans,


they can come in and they can vote and they can go to


their legislature and they can put anything they want on

the ballot.  And the -- the people who are mechanically in


charge of seeing that those things are voted on, that's


their job, they should do it, and if those are evil and


terrible and contrary to the Constitution, the courts will


strike them down when they get passed. 


Now, what's -- now, you explain how your thing


fits into that. 


MR. SALMONS:  Yes, Your Honor.  First of all,


let me just say that there's -- there would be -- need to


be both an objective and a subjective component to the


sham standard as there is in other contexts. 


But to try and address the question that you


originally posed, it does seem to us that there are at


least two ways in which the city can be held liable in the


event that you have sham petitioning.  One would be that


if the city officials themselves were part of the sham,


and the other would be --


QUESTION:  Well, wait a -- what is --


QUESTION:  We're trying to find out what is a


sham.  That's -- that's our basic problem.  I don't


understand what is a sham.  In the antitrust context --


QUESTION:  You -- you haven't told us.


QUESTION:  In the antitrust context, I


understand it because -- because there is the law, and --


and you come up with a phony -- a phony law, you know, you

can say it's a sham.  But there's no law about


referendums.  You could have a referendum on anything you


like.  How can you have a wrong referendum --


MR. SALMONS:  Well, Your Honor --


QUESTION:  -- and thus a sham referendum?  It


doesn't make any sense to me.


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, this Court's sham


analysis has to do with whether or not it's actually about


the First Amendment activity or it's just about an effort,


in this case, to take advantage of the delay to interfere


with someone's housing rights.  We think that same


analysis can apply here by inquiring as to whether, first


of all, the -- the referendum petition is objectively


baseless.  Is there any way that that petition could


have -- be enacted into law and enforced? 

If, for example, you had a petition that said no


minorities shall live in the City of Cuyahoga Falls,


clearly that's a referendum that could never go into


effect and never be enforced, and therefore, it may be


strong evidence that the process here is not about


changing a law of the city --


QUESTION:  So the clerk in that case -- the


clerk of the court who says I'm putting this on the


ballot -- he's violated the law in putting it on the


ballot?  Of course, if it's passed, it's totally

unconstitutional.  But you're saying that the clerks


shouldn't even put that on the ballot?  I mean, that would


be quite a novel proposition to me.


MR. SALMONS:  Your Honor, I -- I'm not


necessarily saying that the clerk shouldn't put that on


the ballot, but that would be one part of the analysis in


determining whether or not the process was being abused


and it was just a sham.


QUESTION:  Well, isn't -- wouldn't it be a


sham -- let me just put this on the table.  As I


understand it, the Ohio Supreme Court said that this was


not a legal referendum when it got all through with


things.  And if everybody had known before the -- the case


started that it was an illegal referendum, that would have


been a sham, wouldn't it? 


MR. SALMONS:  I -- I think that very well may be


strong evidence that it was a sham.  This was about an


attempt to abuse the process.  It wasn't about any


protected First Amendment activity.  And -- and in that


situation I think there is, in -- in addition to the


possibility, although I think perhaps unlikely that you


can hold the city vicariously liable based on the motives


of the citizens, I think that is a difficult question as


to whether the actions of -- of the referendum -- the


petition signers, the 10 percent who signed the petition


25

and file it, whether that action is the official action of


the city with regard to the petition just as the action of


the voters at the referendum vote is an action of the city


for which the city can held liable.  This Court need not


address that in this case.


QUESTION:  May I ask your view on the


hypothetical I asked to the other lawyer?  Supposing it


was perfectly clear that the mayor and everybody else in


this used the referendum as a method of delaying a


granting of the permit and that they did so for racially


motivated reasons, would there be any -- any liability on


anybody?


MR. SALMONS:  Potentially, Your Honor.  I think,


again, the -- the way in which the analysis would work is


the Court would need to inquire as to whether the 

petitioning was genuine in the sense that there was a


genuine effort to try and change the city's ordinance. 


And if so, then the First Amendment would provide


immunity.


QUESTION:  Well, there was, but they -- they


figured it was going to lose in the long run, but


nevertheless, let's assume they wanted to delay things for


60, 90 days, whatever it might be, because they wanted to


delay it on -- on, you know, this -- this project. 


MR. SALMONS:  Yes, Your Honor.

 QUESTION:  If it -- if it were clear because


this case is on summary judgment, so really don't know


what the facts are --


MR. SALMONS:  Well, but --


QUESTION:  -- but if there were clear evidence


that the mayor and everybody else act up in a racially


motivated reason, would there be liability in that


situation?


MR. SALMONS:  I -- I think you'd need to examine


both the motives in -- in your hypothetical not only of


the city officials, but also of -- of the petition


signers.


QUESTION:  Everybody.  Everybody.


QUESTION:  Are you talking about personal


liability or official liability?


QUESTION:  Liability --


MR. SALMONS:  I'm talking about the liability of


the city, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Okay.  So you're talking about


liability --


QUESTION:  I'm assuming everybody who opposed


the project was racially motivated and that could be


demonstrated with tape recorder.


MR. SALMONS:  I guess the short answer, Your


Honor, is that even people with racial motives have the

right to petition their government to change the law. 


And -- but if they -- what no one has the right to do is


abuse the process in order to interfere with someone's


fair housing and equal protection rights.


QUESTION:  So -- so your answer would be no


liability in that case.


MR. SALMONS:  If it was genuine petitioning,


that is correct. 


Thank you, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Salmons.


Mr. Kramer, we'll hear from you.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD G. KRAMER


ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


QUESTION:  Mr. Kramer, opposing counsel says


that you have, in effect, abandoned the second question 

presented, the disparate impact question.  Is that correct


or is it not correct?


MR. KRAMER:  It's correct, Mr. Chief Justice. 


We -- we have waived that claim that had been certified


by -- by this Court.


Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:


The city and the Solicitor General has tried to


complicate what really is a very simple case.  What is the


injury that the plaintiff is complaining about?  The


plaintiffs have been denied unlawfully their site plan and

its benefits, including a building permit.  City conduct. 


Nothing to do with referendums.  Nothing to do with First


Amendment rights. 


The issues of liability in this case, which the


Sixth Circuit took up, was did the city and its officers


act out of discriminatory motive by delaying this housing


project and refusing to give effect to the site plan


ordinance to appease racial and anti-family prejudices in


violation of the Equal Protection Clause --


QUESTION:  How could they do that if they had no


choice?  I mean, if the law told them you have to stop the


project once the referendum is filed, even if in -- in


their heart and -- heart of hearts they were delighted for


racial reasons that this was the case, nonetheless they


had no choice.


MR. KRAMER:  We believe that they did have a


choice and we cite cases to the Court from the Ohio


Supreme Court on page 25 of our brief that indicates that


the petitions did not have to be certified by the -- the


court -- by the city.


QUESTION:  But didn't the lower -- the lower


courts didn't adopt that proposition, did they?


MR. KRAMER:  The lower courts weren't asked that


question, Your Honor, because we're really talking about


whether or not the -- there was an official conduct by the

city.


QUESTION:  So didn't they go on the basis that


the -- that the city officials' action was mandatory?  The


lower courts.


MR. KRAMER:  As I said, I don't really believe


the Sixth Circuit approached the -- the case from -- from


that particular issue.


QUESTION:  So it didn't --


MR. KRAMER:  There was discretion, we believe,


and we certainly provided evidence.  And again, as -- as


was indicated by the Court to the Solicitor General, this


is on summary judgment.  For example, in the record, there


is an affidavit from the law director for the Village of


Orange that we filed with our brief in opposing summary


judgment that indicated that there was discretion not to 

certify the referendum.


QUESTION:  Well, but that -- that's a question


of Ohio law, I take it? 


MR. KRAMER:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  And the way you sought to prove it


was to get an affidavit from the law director of some


suburb of Cleveland? 


MR. KRAMER:  As one element of proof, we


indicated that that showed that there was discretion.  But


the Ohio case law indicates there are instances where, if

the subject was inappropriate -- and let's remember the


Ohio Supreme Court ruled that this was not an appropriate


subject for a referendum.


QUESTION:  Would it be --


QUESTION:  But it rules that way many years --


many years after this case was -- went to litigation, did


it not?


MR. KRAMER:  Yes, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:  And it had nothing to do with whether


it was racist, sexist.  It -- it had to do with was it


administrative or legislative. 


MR. KRAMER:  That's correct, and it also only


had --


QUESTION:  Do you have -- do you have any -- do


you have any authority to say that there is discretion to 

reject a petition that is properly legislative? 


MR. KRAMER:  Well, the -- yes, Justice Ginsburg.


QUESTION:  Suppose -- suppose you had a


legislative proposal that members of a certain race will


never be included in any kind of an equal opportunity law. 


Suppose you had -- that was the referendum.  Is there any


authority that says that under Ohio law, that couldn't be


put on the ballot?


MR. KRAMER:  I don't know of Ohio law, but


certainly this Court's decision in Hunter versus Erickson

dealing with an Ohio referendum indicates that that type


of referendum is unconstitutional. 


QUESTION:  Well now, I don't believe that's a


correct statement of the holding in Hunter.  I thought in


Hunter, this Court said that a municipality cannot make


racial laws subject to referendum and no other laws, which


is quite a different proposition from what you suggest.


MR. KRAMER:  Well, with -- Mr. Chief Justice, we


are talking about the -- this Court's jurisprudence that


deals with the -- simply because it's a referendum, if


the legislature could not do this, pass a law that says,


for example, that African-Americans cannot own property,


like in Buchanan versus Warley --


QUESTION:  If a legislature could do that,


would -- would we enjoin a legislature from passing an 

unconstitutional law?


MR. KRAMER:  And -- no.


QUESTION:  The Federal -- the Federal Congress


passes unconstitutional laws all the time. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  We've -- we've never been asked to


enjoin them. 


(Laughter.) 


MR. KRAMER:  And -- you're correct, Justice


Scalia.  And we have not asked for that.

 QUESTION:  So there's a difference between


whether the product is unconstitutional and whether the


doing of it is unconstitutional.  And the doing of an


unconstitutional referendum, as far as I know, is not


unconstitutional.  You are entitled to pass an


unconstitutional referendum.  We will ignore it, however.


MR. KRAMER:  And it may subject, if there is


direct injury, damages to my client, and that is all we


have before this case.


QUESTION:  What -- but wait.  The -- the project


is built.  Right? 


MR. KRAMER:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  So -- so you've got your project. 


And now what you're saying is that they violated the


Constitution in not giving you the permit quicker. 

And


they -- am I right?


MR. KRAMER:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  All right.


And they come back and they say, how could we


give it to you quicker?  There were petitioners who


they -- a petition and the law prevents us from giving it


to you quicker because once a petition's on the ballot,


the law says we can't give it to you.  Now, what's your


response to that? 


MR. KRAMER:  The response is that it was the

city's actions -- we believe the evidence that we've

mayor, city councilpeople looked for -- as they -- one


city councilman said, any legal shred to be able to reject


this development. 


QUESTION:  No.  But explain to me a little bit


better what -- their response is the reason we didn't give


you the permit faster is because here's the provision of


the law.  It says once a petition for referendum is filed,


and it says whether it's legal or illegal, we have to


delay this.  Now, your response to that is -- they say,


what should we have done that we didn't do once that


petition was filed.  And your response is?


MR. KRAMER: 


What should be done in a case like 

this is that there is an injury to my client.  The injury,


whether it was discretionary or non-discretionary, is --


is not the -- the question.  What was the purpose behind


denying the building permit?  And under Arlington Heights,


this Court has indicated one of the things that a court


can look at as competent evidence is did the city


officials take action to appease racial bias.  Even if it


was a nondiscretionary act, if the effect of that was to


permit private bias, they've committed a violation.


QUESTION:  That's quite a proposition.  If -- if

I have a -- you know, I'm -- I'm a racist and it really


makes me happy that this act, which I'm compelled to do by


law, hurts someone of a certain race, that renders that


act invalid even though I'm compelled to do it by law? 


I don't think so.


MR. KRAMER:  What we're saying is that it may


not be invalid, but it may cause liability.  It can be a


legal act --


QUESTION:  All right.  So what I'm hearing you


saying -- what I'm hearing you saying in response to my


question is, I'm the mayor and the other, and I say, what


do you want me to do?  The statute said, don't give you


the permit because the petition has been filed.  What


could I have done?  And your answer to that basically


seems to be, nothing. 


You couldn't have done anything. 

We agree.  But the petition itself was an evil petition.


QUESTION:  Right.


QUESTION:  I mean evil being quotes for what we


all know is going on.  All right? 


So it's an evil petition.  And therefore, when


you face this evil petition, even though you couldn't do


anything about it, you have to pay damages because the


reason we were delayed was because of that process.  Now,


is that basically your argument? 


MR. KRAMER:  Yes, Justice Breyer.  We're --

we're saying that even if it was a legal thing to do, if


the act of it was because of racial or anti-family bias,


that would be a violation of the --


QUESTION:  And now, the reason that that bothers


me, of course, is because I can think of a whole range of


evil legislative acts, and I can think of quasi-acts that


I'm not sure about, and then I can think of a lot of ones


I like.  All right.  So -- so -- but I'm worried.  In the


first category and the second category, once we got into


the business of paying damages, because it turns out that


they are evil, that would, in fact, chill the legislative


process, which is a democratic process.  And I think


that's the argument they're trying to make.  So I'd like


to get your response to that.


MR. KRAMER: 


What I would say, Justice Breyer, 

is that the fact that there was an evil motive behind any


of these acts -- and by the way, the referendum is only


the culmination of the acts.  There was a series of


discretionary acts.  For example, the strategy of the city


was to do two things.  One was to delay this project


because they knew that there was a -- a very finite period


of time for our little non-profit tax-exempt developer to


build this project or lose their financing.  So they knew


the longer they could delay, the more likely the project


would die.

 And second of all, they wanted to make the


project more costly.  So, for example, they required,


before we even talked about a referendum, a barrier wall


to be built before even a building permit that could be


issued, a 6-foot earthen wall with a 5-foot fence between


two conforming multi-family projects. 


QUESTION:  Your client agreed to that.  Your


client didn't make any objection to that.


MR. KRAMER:  My client was willing to do that


because he was told by the city it would smooth the


process over.  He certainly did not waive his rights.


And in the depositions, the planning


commissioner, Louis Sharpe, specifically testified the


reason he was demanding that was because our project was


going to have a large number of children.  Now, under the


Federal Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988, such an act


may well violate the protection against -- against


children. 


QUESTION:  You said -- but -- but, nonetheless,


he didn't contest it.


Then you say the whole object was delay.  And as


I see this thing unfold, the big delay is during the


pendency of the referendum because it was at the end of


February when the planning commission got this.  They had


conditions on it, but it acted on the very same day.  The

ordinance was approved on April 1st.  As things go in the


zoning area, from February 21st until April 1st is not a


very long time, is it?


MR. KRAMER:  No, but there was three hearings


and there was a great deal of public opposition.  And one


of the reasons for the --


QUESTION:  But the delay -- as far as -- that --


that's not -- the delay that you're complaining about is


from the moment the petition was filed for the referendum


until when he finally got the building permits.


MR. KRAMER:  The actual complaint that we are --


where we think we were injured was the building permits


not being provided to us.  The delay goes to the amount of


damages we think our client has suffered.  The official


act that we're talking about is the building permits 

being -- not being issued.  And --


QUESTION:  But you couldn't have expected them


to be issued the -- the day you filed the site plan. 


I mean, there has to be a meeting of the planning


commission.  There has to be a meeting of the city


council.


MR. KRAMER:  That's correct, and we submitted


our building permits after the -- the approval by the --


the city council.


What we're talking about, Your Honor, is that

the city's actions in denying that building permit --


we're -- at this stage of the proceeding, all we're


talking about is summary judgment.  Is there sufficient


evidence that a trier of fact would find that the -- the


actual denial was racial prejudice of city officials or


appeasement by city officials --


QUESTION:  Mr. Kramer, I asked your opponent,


but is the -- is the complaint in the papers before us,


do -- do you know? 


MR. KRAMER:  Your Honor, the complaint is not in


the appendix, but it is in the joint appendix that was


filed with the Sixth Circuit.  You'll find that in


volume I on page 37 of the record.  But it's -- it's the


Sixth Circuit joint appendix --


QUESTION:  I see. 


MR. KRAMER:  -- which I believe this Court does


have.


QUESTION:  The thing I was curious about, to


tell you the truth, did you include a regulatory takings


claim in your complaint?


MR. KRAMER:  No, we did not.


QUESTION:  You did not.


QUESTION:  Mr. Kramer, would you explain to me


what exactly you think the relevance of the subsequent


referendum was?  For example, do you say the relevance of

the subsequent referendum to your claim for delay in


issuing the permit simply is the evidence that it


furnishes of -- of racial bias ultimately on the part of


city officials?  Or is -- is its relevance that it


increased the damages otherwise attributable to the day --


delay in the permit? 


How exactly should we regard the referendum? 


You -- you understand the problem that we're all having


with -- with it.  Precisely how does it figure in your


claim? 


MR. KRAMER:  It's the latter, Justice Souter. 


We're saying that the referendum, which was part of an


overall scheme by city officials to delay this project so


that it would kill it.  And so the injury that we're


talking about from -- from the referendum deals with the 

city officials using that as the legal shred to be able to


deny the building permits.  And the evidence we believe


that we have proffered to the Court through the summary


judgment motion is that there was not only citizen bias,


which under Arlington Heights, this Court has indicated we


certainly can allow -- it's competent evidence that can be


looked at of whether or not legislators used that bias to


be able to take that action. 


QUESTION:  No.  I -- I understand that.


If -- if there had been no referendum, no

petition had ever been filed for the referendum and none


had ever been held, would you still have essentially the


same claim, though with a different evidentiary basis?


MR. KRAMER:  Absolutely, Justice Souter, because


the -- what we are complaining about is the denial of the


building permit.  That's the injury that --


QUESTION:  But there would have been no denial


of the building permit absent the referendum, there --


QUESTION:  You could win without the referendum.


MR. KRAMER:  That's correct. 


QUESTION:  The referendum's the worst part of


your case.  You -- you wish there weren't a referendum. 


Then they would have had no basis to deny.


MR. KRAMER:  To deny in -- in this case.


QUESTION: 


No, but you -- I -- I thought your 

claim was that -- that you would still have been delayed


in being issued the permits and that you would still have


had a claim for that.  Am I -- am I wrong on that?


MR. KRAMER:  I would say that we had some claim


for the time between when we submitted the request for the


building permits and how long it took them to be able


to --


QUESTION:  And in -- in the absence of the


referendum, how long would that have been? 


MR. KRAMER:  That would have been a matter --

well, we don't know.  Let me say --


QUESTION:  Why don't you know?  Because you --


there's a 30-day period.  There's a -- the city council


acts on April 1st.  That goes into effect in 30 days


unless there's an intervening referendum.  So that you


would have had by May 1st the building permits.


MR. KRAMER:  We don't know because in the record


Mayor Robart sent a letter ordering his building


commissioner not to issue a building permits, and that


was --


QUESTION:  That was --


MR. KRAMER:  -- even prior to the referendum --


QUESTION:  But that was in the 30-day period


when they couldn't be issued because it hadn't become


effective yet. 


The -- the instruction was simply what the 

law was, that the ordinance approved by the city council


doesn't become law until 30 days after that approval.  So


that the -- the mayor, to that extent, was just telling


them to do what the law would require.


But in understanding your complaint and how you


are tying in the officials to the referendum, are you


saying that absent the official prompting, instigation, or


whatever you call it, that there would never have been a


referendum, that in -- in fact that the mayor whipped up


the referendum?

 MR. KRAMER:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  We -- we


believe we indicated that this was not something that the


city responded from -- responded to from their citizens,


but this was a scheme where city officials, including


Mayor Robart with other private citizens, got together and


said, how can we deny this project. 


QUESTION:  But you've lost on that and didn't


appeal it.  I mean, he'd be a very bad man for doing that,


and you might have a cause of action against him.  But I


don't see any official city action involved in that. 


Is it official city action for the -- for the mayor to


stimulate a referendum?  How is that official city action?


MR. KRAMER:  And we're not talking about that


that's something that caused a damage.  What we're talking


about is, is there evidence that we can use to show that 

the ultimate decision, which was to deny the building


permit that caused the injury -- is there evidence that


the mayor participated in -- to appease racial and anti-


family bias. 


This is really a simple Arlington Heights case.

Justice Stevens said, which is about regulatory takings. 


I mean, what is in the back of my mind here, to stimulate


an answer, is suppose you weren't Section 8 housing. 


Suppose you were building a hotel.  And suppose the


referendum wasn't people who might be bigoted -- may,


perhaps -- I don't -- but suppose they were


environmentalists, and -- and suppose the constitutional


claim was not --

QUESTION:  People that didn't want rich people

QUESTION:  Okay, good.

uphold for you here, if the Court votes for you here,


wouldn't it then have to say that all these environmental


cases and so forth -- I -- I don't want to win your case


for you, but I might be in my question. 


(Laughter.) 


QUESTION:  The -- the -- you see -- see there'd


be quite a problem about whether a city wouldn't have to


pay damages every time that they make a mistake in their

environmental regulation and perhaps try to stop a hotel


and they thought they could stop it, but it turns out


later they couldn't.  You see -- do you see the analogy


that's worrying me? 


MR. KRAMER:  I understand the analogy.


QUESTION:  So what do you -- what do you -- what


do you say about that?


MR. KRAMER:  The difference, Justice Breyer, is


that the -- we are asking only for the Court to look at


the issue of has the plaintiffs proffered sufficient


evidence that racial bias and anti-family bias was


involved in the decision to deny the building permit. 


The referendum was part of the -- an overall scheme by


city officials to delay and ultimately kill this project. 


If that is the case, then the referendum, which Ohio 

Supreme Court has ruled was illegal to begin with -- even


if it was legal, we believe under your jurisprudence if


the motivation of the city to use the referendum was


unlawful, the violation occurs under the Fourteenth


Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause. 


With regards to your question about the


regulatory taking, we saw this -- this case under a due


process -- substantive due process, procedural due


process -- examination very similar, I think, to the


situation that's actually the exact opposite to the City

is the only participating member that was on that

QUESTION:  Also there were eight other members


of the Court that disagreed with me if I remember


correctly --


(Laughter.) 


MR. KRAMER:  But we have a new Court, Your

QUESTION:  -- you're still making the due

process we're talking here.  Right?

have a building permit granted within a -- within a


reasonable period?

 QUESTION:  It's fundamental --


MR. KRAMER:  -- about a reasonable period. 


We're talking about both -- we had raised both procedural


and substantive due process claims in the lower courts. 


What we're saying is the process was so fundamentally


flawed that it rises to a -- a due process violation. 


Whether it's substantive or procedural, we don't believe


is -- is really the issue here. 


We're talking about a process where there was a


whole set of procedures set up by the City of Cuyahoga


Falls of how to approve this site plan ordinance.  The --


the site plan procedures were set forth, permitted for a


record to be developed, and there was a -- planning


commission meetings.  There was the city council meetings.


And if the city council or the planning commission had 

denied our right to the site plan ordinance and its


benefits, we would have had a right under Ohio law to go


under the Ohio Administrative Procedure Act and get a


court to review that issue.


QUESTION:  Because there would have been


official action.  And that's the problem here, that


there -- do you -- do you call a referendum that's put on


the ballot because 10 percent of the electorate had signed


petitions -- do you call that State action, which is


subject to the equal protection surveillance?  I had

thought that that's a -- that's an initiative of the


people and it's not action of the city. 


MR. KRAMER:  Well, the only reason why the


people are able to get a referendum is because the city


charter, which is their constitution, permitted that.


QUESTION:  But that permitted it 30 years ago,


did it not?


MR. KRAMER:  That's right, but in the -- the due


process area, Your Honor, we're not talking about


discriminatory intent.  All we're talking about is looking


at whether the procedure set forth is fundamentally flawed


and does it -- is it arbitrary and capricious and not


substantially related to the general welfare as -- as this


Court has talked about ever since --


QUESTION: 


But there are all kinds of nutty 

referendum measures that voters put forward.  I -- your


theory would seem to subject a State or a city or whatever


it is to a lawsuit every time there's one of these nutty


proposals put forward. 


MR. KRAMER:  No.  We're talking about whether


you have to have a -- a protected property interest and


you also have to have a situation where there is a


arbitrary and capricious action.


In this case, we have ownership of property,


which under the original intention of -- of the Framers of

the Constitution, ownership of private property and the


ability to develop using this property for a lawful


purpose is protected by the Due Process Clause.  And when


you look at the issue --


QUESTION:  But your theory, as I understand it,


is that there was -- if it was racially motivated, there


was just sort of an arbitrary.  There was an absence of a


legitimate reason for the delays and the shenanigans and


so forth.  But it seemed to me the same argument could --


could be made if they were trying to protect the wetlands,


and they used the same kind of shenanigans.


MR. KRAMER:  Well, Your Honor, we certainly


raised the question about if this was a discriminatory


motive, that would mean that there would not be -- under


general welfare. 


QUESTION:  There would be no racial basis.


MR. KRAMER:  But more importantly, our argument


is that there is a per se violation whenever you have an


administrative matter which should be taken up through the


city council or through the courts or through a -- from --


from an administrative agency like the planning


commission.


And the evidence in the record, as the lower


courts point out, is that we met all the requirements for


the city to -- to get our site plan.  And then, when the

city council approved it, when the planning director said


we met or exceeded the site plan ordinance, they put it to


a referendum and they asked 20,000 voters to approve or


disapprove a site plan ordinance, they never saw and


the -- and whether or not that site plan ordinance


conformed to the building and zoning code that they never


read.  If that is not --


QUESTION:  No.  But what your -- what your


argument boils down to is to say that there is a


recoverable substantive due process violation whenever a


property right of yours is interfered with by a misuse of


the legislative process, even a temporary one.  Isn't that


the -- the nub of your claim?


MR. KRAMER:  I would say we -- we are asking for


a fairly narrow interpretation. 


We're saying if it's an 

administrative matter which should not be subject to the


decision of voters because this is not legislative --


QUESTION:  But what -- from the standpoint of


your claim, why does it matter whether it -- it was a


legislative use countering an administrative action, or


whether it was a legislative use with a racial motive?  It


is an improper use of a legislative procedure.  And you're


saying, as I understand it, whenever that, in fact, is


effected, there -- and -- and you can -- you can make a --


a colorable claim of -- of some economic damage, that you

have a substantive due process right to recover.  Isn't


that correct?


MR. KRAMER:  Justice Souter, we -- that is


something that we have raised in our brief, but we have --


also have raised a much narrower issue which would be


simply looking at a site plan ordinance, should it be


subjected to a popularity contest?  There -- it's


standard-less.  This Court has ruled in --


QUESTION:  You never mentioned procedural due


process in your brief.  The first mention I heard of it is


in your argument here, where you say it doesn't matter


whether it's substantive or procedural.  Your brief went


entirely to substantive due process.


MR. KRAMER:  Well, the reason that we didn't


raise that is the Court didn't certify a question other 

than to substantive due process.  We believe that it


really subsumes that issue when you look at -- the


procedure itself is so fundamentally flawed.  It is very


similar to the -- the situation in the City of Eastlake


that this Court looked at. 


QUESTION:  Would you say -- be saying that if


the Ohio court had stuck to its original position? 


I mean, it was four/three both times.


MR. KRAMER:  Well, the Ohio court in both cases,


Justice Ginsburg, first ruled that it was an

MR. KRAMER:  Thank you, Chief Justice.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


MR. NAGER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


With respect to the disparate impact claim, I


would just like to clarify that we were the petitioners,


and the Court did grant certiorari on the issue and there


is a judgment of the Sixth Circuit against my clients on


that issue.  And while they've abandoned the claim and


declined to defend the Sixth Circuit's judgment, we would


request the Court vacate that judgment and instruct that 

the disparate impact claim be dismissed with prejudice.


With -- Justice Breyer, with respect to your


questions to my opposing counsel, a point we'd like to add


to what you had to say is simply that if we had done what


they wanted, we would have been subjected to a damages


claim.  It would have been a First Amendment claim by the


citizens seeking to put something on the ballot by


initiating a petition, and it -- it can't be that in order


to avoid a Fourteenth Amendment damages claim, we have to


violate other people's First Amendment rights.

 If the Court doesn't have any further questions,


we have nothing further.


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Mr. Nager.


The case is submitted.


(Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
