CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  We'll  hear  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

next  in  Case  14­510,  Menominee  Indian  Tribe  of  Wisconsin 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

v.  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

            

Mr.  Strommer. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  GEOFFREY  D.  STROMMER 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  may  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

please  the  Court: 

 

 

            

The  facts  in  this  case  are  very  complex,  but 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  legal  question  that  is  presented  to  you  today  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relatively  straightforward  to  state.  And  the  legal 

  

 

 

 

 

 

question  is  whether  or  not  an  individual  or  an  entity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  reasonably  relies  on  class­action  tolling  can,  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolling  is  found  to  be  ineffective  at  a  later  date,  then 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rely  on  the  same  facts  to  argue  that  equitable  tolling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  Holland  should  apply. 

 

 

 

            

In  the  Irwin  case,  this  Court  specifically 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cross­referenced  American  Pipe  as  an  example  of  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defective  pleading  that  could  satisfy  equitable  tolling. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

American  Pipe  obviously  being  a  class­action  tolling 

   

 

 

 

 

rule. 

            

We  read  that  cross­reference  as  a  suggestion 

   

 

 

 

 

that,  under  the  right  circumstances,  if  somebody

reasonably  relies  on  class­action  tolling  facts  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ultimately  prove  to  be  ineffective,  that  that  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has  the  ability  to  ask  the  Court  to  find  that  equitable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolling  should  apply. 

 

 

            

If  there  is  such  a  case,  the  facts  of  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  really  should  satisfy  this  test. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

The  test  is  set  forth  in  the  Holland  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Due  diligence  and  extraordinary  circumstances  are  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

two  prongs  that  have  to  be  satisfied.  Both  of  them  are 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

well­satisfied  in  this  case. 

 

 

 

            

First,  the  Menominee  Tribe  relied  on  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

preexisting  class  action  which  dealt  with  almost 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identical  substantive  claims  against  the  United  States. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Ramah? 

            

Ginsburg. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Are  you  talking  about  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  STROMMER:  Yes.  Correct,  Justice 

  

  

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  And  ­­ and  that  was  a  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

a  decision,  unpublished  decision  by  a  district  court. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

It  never  went  any  further. 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  Well,  it  is  still  a  certified 

   

  

 

 

 

 

class,  Justice  Ginsburg,  and  the  Menominee  Tribe  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only  is  a  member  of  that  class  but  has,  to  date, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

received  a  portion  of  several  settlements  that  were 

   

 

 

 

 

 

entered  into  in  that  class  action  and,  in  fact,  is

poised  to  receive  another  large  payment  in  a  settlement 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  class  and  the  United  States  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

approve. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  issue  ­­

  

 

 

 

MR.  STROMMER:  ­­ has  asked  the  Court  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  The  issue  that  that  case 

  

 

 

 

 

 

settled  or  addressed  was  whether  exhaustion  was  required 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  all.  Minimal  research  would  have  shown  that  every 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  court  at  that  time  who  had  addressed  the  issue  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  exhaustion. 

 

            

Now,  we'll  go  later  to  exhaustion­when. 

 

 

 

 

 

That's  a  separate  question. 

   

 

            

So  how  could  you  reasonably  rely  on  a  lower 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  decision  that  hasn't  gone  through  the  crucible  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appellate  review  without  having  done  any  research  on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  its  premises  were  subject  to  dispute,  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispute,  and  rely  on  that? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  Well,  Justice  Sotomayor,  I 

  

 

 

 

 

have  a  couple  of  answers  to  your  question. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

            

First  of  all,  the  United  States  did  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

challenge  the  certification  of  the  class  in  the  Ramah 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case.  Not  when  it  was  originally  certified,  based  on 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  claims  that  were  then  in  the  case,  miscalculation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims,  nor  later  on  with  additional  claims  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  they  raised  the

argument  just  lost.  They  raised  the  argument  that  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaustion  requirement  didn't  meet  the  commonality  prong 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  class  certification.  So  they  did  make  an  argument 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

against  it. 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  Oh,  they  argued,  but  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

district  court  judge  in  the  Ramah  case  reasonably,  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

think,  concluded  that,  because  of  the  unique  nature  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  claims  that  the  Ramah  class  was  seeking  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  I  know  that's  what  you 

    

 

 

 

 

believe,  but  every  other  court  up  until  that  time  had 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

said  no,  you  needed  to  exhaust. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Now,  we  can  go  to  a  separate  question  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhaust­when  later.  But  how  could  you  at  that  point 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rely  on  that  case  to  think  that  you  didn't  have  to  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  Well,  the  Menominee  Tribe 

  

 

 

 

 

didn't  rely  just  on  that  case.  That  case  was  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

important  factor  that  it  relied  on,  but  there  was  also 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  factors  that  it  relied  on. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

In  the  Cherokee  Nation  certification 

 

 

 

 

process,  the  United  States  did  not  raise  presentment  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  defense.  Instead,  it  raised  Rule  23  grounds  as  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

basis  not  to  certify  the  class. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  the  district  court  judge  in  that  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  garden­variety  Rule  23  grounds,  ruled  that  that  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

could  not  be  certified.  Didn't  say  anything  in  his

MR.  STROMMER:  But  then  ­­

  

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SCALIA:  ­­ all  of  this  goes  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

deciding  whether  the  legal  advice  they  received  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  legal  advice.  I  find  that  quite  irrelevant. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

Do  you  have  a  single  case  in  which  legal  advice  has 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

qualified  for  equitable  tolling? 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  No,  Your  Honor.  We  can't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

cite  a  single  case  for  that,  no.

prevented  timely  filing. 

 

 

              

I  ­­ I  would  not  qualify  erroneous  legal 

   

 

 

 

 

advice  as  preventing  time  ­­ timely  filing.  I  don't 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

care  how  reasonable  it  was.  It  didn't  prevent  it. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  Well,  Your  Honor,  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

context  of  class­action  tolling,  there  is  always  a  legal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

judgment  call  made  about  whether  or  not  class­action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolling  applies.  And  if  equitable  tolling  is  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

available  as  a  fallback,  if  in  fact  that  judgment  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

not  made  correctly  and  discovered  many  years  later,  then 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  whole  premise  of  class­action  tolling,  I  think,  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

undercut  because  any  member  of  a  class  ­­ for  example, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Cherokee  Nation  case  where  the  district  court 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

judge  said  absolutely  nothing  about  presentment,  nothing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  jurisdiction,  the  government  didn't  raise  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defense,  focused  only  on  Rule  23  issues  ­­ in  any  case 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  which  a  district  court  judge  declines  to  certify  a 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class,  if  equitable  tolling  isn't  available  as  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fallback,  then  the  most  you  could  ­­

erroneous  equitable  tolling  only  in  class­action  cases? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  No.  I  would  frame  it 

    

  

 

 

 

slightly  differently,  Your  Honor.  I  would  say  that, 

    

 

 

 

 

 

when  a  party  reasonably  relies  on  class­action  tolling

circumstances  in  this  case  are  extraordinary  and  are  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are  very  rare.  It  is  very  unlikely  that  you  will  find

in  favor  of  certifying  the  class  is  what  was  ­­

presentment?  It  was  a  long  time,  wasn't  it? 

   

  

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  The  total  amount  was  707 

  

 

 

 

 

 

days,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  why  was  that  due 

  

 

 

 

 

 

diligence  ­­ I  mean,  I  know  that  we're  not  arguing  about 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

due  diligence,  but  it  seems  to  me  that,  when  there

home  free.  You  would  not  have  encountered  a  time  bar. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Two  years.  But  you,  in  fact,  didn't  present  until  four

So  how  was  that  due  diligence? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  Well,  in  the  context  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

reliance  on  class­action  tolling  applying,  Your  Honor, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  is  due  diligence.  And  it's  reasonable  diligence.  In

MR.  STROMMER:  I'm  sorry,  Your  Honor? 

  

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  class  action  has  been 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  STROMMER:  Correct. 

  

 

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  So  at  that  point  you  know 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

you're  on  your  own.  You  can't  piggyback  on  the  class. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  know  you're  on  your  own,  and  yet  you  let  two  years

class­action  tolling  rules,  you're  entitled  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entire  period  that  the  class­action  certification  was

true.  There's  a  circuit  split  which  hasn't  been 

   

  

 

 

 

 

addressed  anywhere  in  the  briefing.  Some  of  the

restart  the  clock  at  the  end  of  the  tolled  period.  In

But  another  series  of  circuits  looked  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diligence  throughout  the  period.  And  so  you'd  be  asking

did. 

            

You  are  taking  a  risk  no  matter  what  you 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  STROMMER:  All  right.  There's  certainly 

  

  

 

 

 

in  any  class­action  environment  a  risk  in  relying  on 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

class­action  tolling,  particularly,  as  the  facts  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  demonstrate,  if  ultimately  ­­

 

 

 

 

            

Justice  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  let's  go  back  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  STROMMER:  ­­ reliance  is  found 

  

 

 

 

 

ineffective  because  class­action  tolling.

you  a  question. 

   

            

            

MR.  STROMMER:  I'm  sorry. 

  

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  of  these  decisions, 

  

 

 

 

 

were  they  made  with  the  advice  of  a  lawyer? 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  I  have  a  sense  that  the  Tribe  was 

   

   

 

 

 

 

concerned  about  its  resources  and  that  they  were  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

getting  together  and  talking  about  this  and  deciding, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we're  not  going  to  win  under  the  law,  so  we're  not  going 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  file.  And  it  was  only  when  Cherokee  Nation  was

viable  claim. 

 

            

So  ­­ but  answer  my  question:  Was  there 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

legal  advice  sought? 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  They  relied  on  legal  advice 

  

 

 

 

 

 

provided  by  class  counsel,  who  communicated  with  all 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

putative  class  members,  and  made  it  clear  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolling  period  would  apply  during  the  pendency  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification.  And  they  also  made  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  we  disagree  that  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

was  ­­ if  we  think  that  was  unreasonable,  what  ­­ your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reading  of  what  class  counsel  said,  what  would  happen? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  Well,  we  still  think  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

backdrop  against  which  the  Tribe  was  making  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  ­­ which  is  as  a  member  of  a  class  that  had 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been  certified  where  presentment  had  not  been  found  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  an  obstacle  because  of  the  unique  nature  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claims  at  issue  in  the  case  ­­ should  be  an  important 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor  that  this  Court  will  factor  into  whether  or  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  tolling  should  apply. 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  KAGAN:  But  it  has  not  been  found  by 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  single  district  court,  right?  I  mean,  you're  saying 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  that  single  district  court  should  have  had  such 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

power  in  the  Tribe's  mind  that  they  didn't  do  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presentment.  And  that  ­­ that  seems  an  extraordinary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

thing.  It's  just  a  single  district  court.  A  single

district  court  has  no  controlling  authority  over  anyone 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  anything  other  than  that  particular  decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  That's  true,  Your  Honor.  And 

  

  

 

 

 

 

that  particular  decision  had  a  direct  impact  on  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

Menominee  Tribe  because  they  were  a  member  of  the  class. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  benefitted  from  that  decision.  They  received 

  

 

 

 

 

 

payments  out  of  settlement  that  the  United  States  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  counsel  had  the  court  approve  premised  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  having  jurisdiction  to  be  able  to  approve  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

They  will  benefit  shortly  next  spring  from  another 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proposed  settlement  where  the  class  counsel,  as  well  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  United  States,  have  proposed  that  the  claims  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will  be  signed  by  parties  will  serve  as  the  presentment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  satisfy  the  jurisdictional  requirement. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  yes,  they  did  benefit,  and  that  was  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  They  benefitted,  but  the 

  

 

 

 

 

point  is  there  is  one  court  that  says  your  Tribe  can  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  member.  Your  ­­ your  Tribe  didn't  present  its  claim 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  the  contracting  officer. 

 

 

 

            

And  so  why  can  they  be  a  member?  The  judge 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

addresses  that  question,  and  he  says,  normally  they 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

couldn't  be  a  member,  but  they  can  here  because  this  is 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  kind  of  case  that  is  attacking  general  practices  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  administration.

Then  okay.  Fine.  You  got  that. 

  

  

 

 

 

Then  shortly  after  that  or  maybe  a  few  years 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

after  that,  another  case  comes  along.  And  the  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case  doesn't  involve  the  situation  of  attacking  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

practices  generally.  It  concerns  the  individual 

  

 

 

 

 

contracts  between  the  Tribe  and  the  Indian  Bureau, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  ­­ you  know,  in  the  government. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

action. 

            

And  there  they  say,  you  can't  have  a  class 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

So  you'd  think  ­­ and  this  kind  of  case  you 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

want  to  bring  now  is  the  second  kind,  not  the  first 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kind.  So  you'd  say,  why  is  it  fair  to  let  you  bring 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case?  After  all,  if  you'd  read  the  opinion  closely 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  first  one,  you  wouldn't  have  thought  you  should 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  waited.  If  you  had  any  doubts  about  it,  the  second 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  would  have  told  you  you  should  have  waited.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

even  beyond  that,  the  administrator  signs  a  piece  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

paper  where  they  ask  him:  Do  you  have  any  claims  under 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  contracts?  And  he  says,  none. 

  

 

 

 

 

            

So  it  doesn't  seem  to  me  you're  talking 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  pure  equities;  you  have  very  strong  grounds. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

Now  what's  your  reply  to  that? 

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  STROMMER:  Well,  I  ­­ I  would  not  agree 

   

   

  

 

 

 

with  one  of  your  premises. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You  probably  wouldn't  agree

with  any  of  them.  But  ­­ but  ­­ but  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  Not  ­­ not  your  conclusion  or 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  of  your  premises. 

 

 

 

            

But  the  premise  that  I  disagree  with  ­­ that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

I  think  is  very  important  is  that  the  Cherokee  Nation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

complaint  alleged  the  same  kinds  of  system­wide 

 

 

 

 

 

 

short­fundings  by  the  United  States  that  were  contained 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  Ramah  complaint. 

 

 

 

            

The  Ramah  complaint  initially,  when  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certified,  only  included  one  category  of  claims,  called 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"miscalculation  claims."  But  later  on,  during  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

pendency  of  the  Cherokee  Nation  case,  additional  claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were  added.  And  by  the  time  the  Cherokee  Nation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification  decision  was  issued,  the  claims  were,  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all  intents  and  purposes,  the  same,  and  they  challenged 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  systemic  underfunding  and  short­funding  by  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

United  States  that  was  based  on  ­­ we  know  now  from  your 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  decision  in  the  Cherokee  case  as  well  as  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ramah  case  ­­ on  an  incorrect  reading  of  the  law.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they  implemented  that,  system­wide,  the  policies  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Indian  Health  Service  used  to  implement  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

short­funding  system  were  designed  to  short­fund  tribes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  they  were  designed  based  off  of  the  assumption 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  were  not  statutorily  entitled  to  100  percent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

funding.

So  the  nature  of  the  claims  in  the  Cherokee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  in  my  view,  Your  Honor,  were  the  same  as  both  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

included  in  the  Ramah  complaint  initially  and  then  as

JUSTICE  BREYER:  You're  not  making  that  kind

for  thinking  that  we  better  file  our  claims  quickly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  what  had  ­­ they  held  in  those  two  cases  are  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

going  to  help  us,  who  have  an  individual  claim.  We 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better  do  what  the  statute  says  or  the  rules,  and  we 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

better  file  our  presentment  to  the  contracting  officer 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  certainly  not  write  the  words  "none"  when  they  ask

what  you're  suggesting,  Your  Honor,  which  is  that  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribe  only  had  one  option,  which  was  to  file, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

essentially,  after  the  Cherokee  Nation's  certification 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  was  issued.  In  fact,  there  was  nothing  in  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

decision  that  talked  about  presentment  and  jurisdiction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  court  ruled  on  garden­variety­Rule  23  reasons.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

ordinarily,  those  reasons  are  not  a  basis  for  class 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  tolling  not  to  apply.  In  fact,  Crown  Cork  is 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

almost  identical,  the  same  kinds  of  garden­variety­Rule 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  reasons  were  found  in  that  case  to  bar  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification  of  a  class,  but  class  action  tolling,  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  applied  in  that  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

So  when  you  focus  just  on  the  Cherokee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nation  decision  itself,  I  think  there's  every  reasonable 

   

 

 

 

 

 

reason  to  be  able  to  rely  on  class  action  tolling. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  wait.  I  just  want 

    

  

 

 

 

to  clarify  one  point.  On  this  issue  of  ­­ that  you  were 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  member  of  the  class,  you  rely  just  on  counsel's  letter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  the  first  case,  in  Ramah,  the  letter  that  ­­ where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel  described  the  class  and  said  there  would  be  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  In  Cherokee  Nation? 

  

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No,  in  the  prior  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  No.  In  the  Ramah  case  ­­

the  class.  It's  received  settlement  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  No,  no,  no,  no,  no.  You 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

said  that  the  lawyers  had  told  you  that  there  would  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  action  tolling.  That  was  the  general  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  That's  in  the  second  case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

That's  in  the  Cherokee  Nation  case,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Yes. 

  

 

MR.  STROMMER:  And  they  said  that  when  they 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

filed  the  complaint.  The  complaint  clearly  included  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribe.  It  identified  all  tribes  that  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

self­determination  contracts  with  the  Union  Health 

 

 

 

 

 

Services.  The  Tribe  clearly  fell  within  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

definition.  And  when  the  court  ultimately  ruled  and 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

chose  not  to  certify  the  case,  the  court  said,  I  could 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  identified  who  would  have  been  part  of  this  case, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  government's  own  shortfalls  identify  each 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribe  by  name,  and  how  much  we  actually  short­funded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

them  in  the  given  years. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  But  you  haven't  answered 

  

 

 

 

 

my  question.  That's  the  only  advice  from  a  lawyer  you 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

received. 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  Yes,  Your  Honor,  that's 

  

 

 

 

 

correct,  that's  the  only  advice  in  the  record. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

I'd  like  to  reserve  the  balance  of  my  time.

Ms.  Eisenstein. 

 

          

ORAL  ARGUMENT  OF  ILANA  H.  EISENSTEIN 

 

 

 

 

 

              

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  RESPONDENTS 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Mr.  Chief  Justice,  and  may 

  

 

 

 

 

 

it  please  the  Court: 

 

 

 

            

Justice  Sotomayor,  you  stated  the  Tribe 

 

 

 

 

 

determined  that  it  was  not  going  to  win  on  the  law,  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so  it  decided  not  to  file.  Indeed,  the  Tribe  made  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

strategic  calculation  here  to  allow  the  six­year  CDA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  of  limitations  to  pass,  because  it  wanted  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

monitor  the  litigation  by  other  tribes,  rather  than  file 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  pursue  its  own  action. 

 

 

 

 

            

The  miscalculation  that  it  made  about 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  the  clear  deadline  could  be  extended  by  class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  tolling,  that  was  a  routine  litigation  mistake, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

the  kind  that  is  far  from  the  sort  of  extraordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance  that  could  warrant  equitable  relief.  Nor 

  

 

 

 

 

 

did  that  miscalculation  prevent  the  Tribe  from  filing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

earlier.  To  the  extent  that  there  was  uncertainty  as  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

whether  it  was  a  member  of  the  Cherokee  Nation  class, 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  whether  presentment  was  a  jurisdictional  bar  to  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  membership,  the  prudent  course,  and  any  reasonably 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diligent  litigant  would  have  filed  under  the  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deadline,  rather  than  wait  for  the  uncertain  application 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  tolling  and  the  potential  forfeiture  of  its  claims.

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  How  did  it  know  that,  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cherokee  Nation?  He  claims  that  the  only  decision  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on  ­­ under  Rule  23,  and  that  presentment  and  tolling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  not  at  issue  there. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Your  Honor,  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Tribe  confuses  the  definition  of  the  class  and  the  class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification  decision  with  its  own  ­­ whether  the  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  court's  own  jurisdiction  over  its  claim.  So  the  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Tribe  itself  was  jurisdictionally  barred  from  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  membership,  regardless  of  how  the  class  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

defined.  There  was  no  need  necessarily  for  the  class  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  ­­ carve  out  those  over  whom  the  district  court  lacks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction.  The  fact  that  the  court  lacked 

  

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdiction  flows  from  the  fact  that  the  Tribe  failed 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  meet  the  mandatory  presentment  requirement. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  let's  talk  about 

  

 

 

 

 

the  American  Pipe  tolling.  It  would  seem  to  me,  as  has 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

happened  in  a  number  of  litigations,  that  at  the  time 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  the  complaint  is  filed,  it  doesn't  mean  that  every 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

member  of  the  class  has  to  have  exhausted,  because  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that's  what  it  means,  then  there  can  never  be  a  class 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action. 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  I  agree,  Your  Honor,  that 

    

 

 

 

 

they  can  present  ­­

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  All  right.  So  that

issue  is  still  open  under  the  law,  because  it  would  seem 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  me,  and  I  could  be  wrong,  that  if  you  still  have  time

recover,  if  you've  done  it  during  the  period  that  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

six­year  period  plus  tolling.  That's  what  some  courts 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  done.  They've  defined  the  class  as  people  who  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exhausted,  or  who  still  have  time  to  exhaust. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  That  ­­ that's  correct, 

  

 

 

 

 

Your  Honor.  But  if  ­­ but  if  the  Tribe  exhausted  while 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  still  had  time  during  the  pendency  of  the  Cherokee 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Nation  class  action,  we  wouldn't  be  sitting  here  today. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Secondly,  if  it  exhausted,  because  ­­ let  me 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  be  clear,  that  one  of  the  problems  with  the  class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  ­­ or  a  fundamental  problem  with  the  class  action 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolling  argument  is  the  Tribe  is  trying  to  toll  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wrong  deadline.  Class  action  tolling  doesn't  apply  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  time  to  file  administrative  prerequisites  to  suit; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  applies  to  the  time  for  filing  a  lawsuit  in  Federal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court.  And  there  is  a  good  reason  for  that.  And  that's 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  the  policy  of  class  action  tolling  is  to  relieve 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigants  of  the  difficult  choice  of  whether  to  file  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individual  lawsuit  or  to  wait  and  participate  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  and  risk  forfeiting  their  right  to  the  lawsuit.

But  that  doesn't  apply  to  an  administrative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prerequisite  that  must  be  completed  either  way.  Whether 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Tribe  proceeded  individually  or  as  a  class,  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

first  step  and  mandatory  step  it  had  to  take  was  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present  its  claim.  And  it  failed  to  do  that  within  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requisite  time  frame. 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Well,  this  is  a  slightly 

   

  

 

 

 

different  argument.  You're  saying  they  can't  get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

equitably  tolled  for  exhaustion  of  the  administrative 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process. 

            

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Your  Honor,  I'm  saying  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Even  if  they  could  get 

  

 

 

 

 

 

tolled  for  filing  a  lawsuit. 

   

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Yes,  Your  Honor.  They 

  

  

 

 

 

can't  get  class  action  tolling  for  the  time  ­­ the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  period,  because  that's  not  what  American 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pipe  refers  to.  It  refers  to  the  time  for  filing  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lawsuit. 

            

And  ­­ and  in  any  event,  the  ­­ the  class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action  rule  under  American  Pipe  ­­ American  Pipe  made 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

clear  that  it  only  applies  to  asserted  class  members  who 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  been  parties  to  the  suit  had  it  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

permitted  to  continue  as  a  class  action.  And  the  Tribe 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

fails  there,  too,  because  it  was  jurisdictionally 

 

 

 

 

 

 

barred,  at  the  time  the  class  decision  was  pending,  from

participating  in  the  suit.  So  even  if  Cherokee  Nation 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

had  been  certified  during  the  pendency  of  the  class 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification  determination,  the  Tribe  was  barred. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  importantly,  the  Cherokee  Nation  class 

 

 

 

 

 

was  not  granted.  It  was  denied.  And  it  was  denied,  as 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Justice  Ginsburg  pointed  out,  two  years  before  the  CDA 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deadline  would  expire  for  the  first  claim.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribe  waited  more  than  four  years  after  class  denial  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

present  its  claim. 

 

 

            

There  was  no  basis  for  waiting.  At  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

point,  the  Tribe  knew  it  must  pursue  an  individual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

action,  and  the  only  reason  it  waited  was  to  hope  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court  would  more  conclusively  reject,  and  did 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eventually  conclusively  reject,  the  government's 

 

 

 

 

affirmative  defense  that  it  was  asserting  in  that  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  the  ­­ the  idea  that  a  ­­ a  Tribe,  or  ­­

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  any  litigant,  who  could  have  acted  earlier  chooses  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

delay  for  strategic  reasons,  and  then  could  get  tolling 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when  it  finds  out  that  it  miscalculated  the  deadline, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  unprecedented.  And  in  fact,  the  fact  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  tolling  is  foreclosed  follows  directly  from 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  Court's  cases. 

 

 

            

It  simply  is  a  common  litigation  problem 

   

 

 

 

 

that  this  Court  has  addressed  time  and  again,  where  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigant  believes  the  deadline  is  longer  than  it  is,

That  was  the  case  in  Lawrence;  that  was  the  case  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pace;  that  was  the  case  in  Irwin.  And  in  each  of  those 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cases,  the  Court  found  equitable  tolling  did  not  apply. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  Can  you  explain  something 

  

 

 

 

 

in  ­­ in  your  brief  that  would  seem  to  make  all  of  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beside  the  point?  You  several  times  referred  to  a 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

release  form  that  covered  the  years  in  question.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it's  in  the  appendix  at  Pages  240  to  242. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

If  the  ­­ if  there  was  a  release  covering 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  years,  then  why  does  anything  else  matter?  Why 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

isn't  the  release  ­­ they  release  the  claims  for  those 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

three  years? 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Well,  Your  Honor,  certainly 

  

 

 

 

 

on  the  merits,  we  agree  with  you,  that  the  release  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

foreclose  the  right  of  the  Tribe  to  collect  on  these 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

particular  years.  But  we're  at  the  preliminary  stage, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  is  to  say,  whether  we  even  get  to  the  merits  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  claim.  And  certainly,  we  think  it  does  have 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

relevance  to  the  equitable  tolling  inquiry,  and  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  timeliness  inquiry,  which  is  ­­ first  of  all,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

goes  to  the  diligence.  This  isn't  just  a  litigant  who 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

took  no  action.  It  took  one  affirmative  step,  and  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  affirmative  step  it  took  was  to  release  the  claims

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Did  the  Indian  Health 

  

 

 

 

 

Service  have  the  authority  to  require  the  Tribe  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

release  those  claims  during  the  contract  closeout 

 

 

 

 

 

 

process? 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Your  Honor,  there's  no 

  

 

 

 

 

specific  statutory  authority.  The  Tribe  argues  in  its 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reply  brief  that  the  ­­ the  Health  Service  was  somehow 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

barred  from  seeking  a  release,  but  I  don't  believe  that 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  any  ­­ certainly  in  the  government's  view 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there  was  no  statutory  prohibition  on  the  type  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

release  that  was  issued  here,  which  basically  allows  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions,  provides  a  place  in  the  release  for 

   

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions  of  claim,  and  the  Tribe  lists  agreed  to  none. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  What  would  have  happened  if 

  

 

 

 

 

 

they  refused  to  sign  the  release? 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Well,  the  ­­ the 

  

 

 

 

 

declaration  of  the  contracting  officer  that's  in  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

record  speaks  to  that  point  which  said  that  there  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

be  no  adverse  consequences  to  a  tribe  that  refused  to 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sign  the  release  or  that  signed  the  release  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exceptions.  It  was  an  administrative  process  for  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

agency  to  be  able  to  close  out  the  contract  after  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requisite  contracting  period.  But  it  certainly  is

significant  as  to  what  the  Tribe  was  thinking  in  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diligence  as  to  the  pursuit  of  its  claims,  which  is  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

concern  of  equitable  tolling. 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  So  it  turned  out 

  

 

 

 

 

 

there  were  consequences  after  all. 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Well,  there  weren't 

  

 

 

 

consequences  in  terms  of  its  ability  to  contract  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his,  or  ­­ or  the  terms  on  which  it  could  contract  with 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  going  forward.  I  think  that  there  are  consequences 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  equity  when  a  party  releases  what  ­­ releases  a  claim 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

affirmatively,  whether  or  not  that  was  something  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  required  of  it.  It  voluntarily  signed  that  release. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  ­­ but  ultimately,  even  without  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

release,  the  ­­ the  Tribe  took  no  action  to  pursue  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

claim  during  the  statutory  period.  And  counsel  for  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribe  suggests  that  we  should  equate  the  rules  for 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class­action  tolling  and  equitable  tolling,  but  equity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

operates  under  different  ­­ different  rules.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

diligence  requirement  is  paramount  among  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

Equitable  tolling  requires  the  party  to 

 

 

 

 

 

demonstrate  diligence  throughout  the  entire  period  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

seeks  tolled,  and  it  requires  that  the  impediment  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

suit  actually  prevent  the  timely  filing.  Neither  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

those  standards  are  met.

in  which  reliance  on  legal  advice  could  constitute  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraordinary  circumstance  required  for  equitable 

 

 

 

 

tolling? 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Your  Honor,  I  think  it's  ­­

   

  

 

 

 

 

this  Court  has  never  recognized  as  such.  In  Holland,  it 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  the  very  unusual  circumstance  where  it  was  mistakes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  counsel,  but  mistakes  that  really  amounted  to  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

abandonment  by  counsel.  It  was  certainly  not  advice  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel,  so  ­­

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That  it's  settled  in  all 

  

 

 

 

 

 

13  circuits.  They've  all  ruled  one  way.  You  don't 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

think  it's  reasonable  to  give  advice  based  on  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ruling,  that  that  might  be  an  exceptional  circumstance? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Well,  Your  Honor,  I  think 

   

  

 

 

 

in  that  ­­ in  your  hypothetical,  it  would  be  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliance  on  the  binding  circuit  precedent,  not  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliance  on  counsel's  advice  per  se,  especially  if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

counsel's  advice  was  ­­ was  poor  ­­ poorly  rendered. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  in  the  case  ­­ if  you're  asking  if  there 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  a  situation  where  binding  precedent  afforded  more 

   

 

 

 

 

 

time  to  a  litigant  but  yet  later  was  determined  that 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

less  time  was  available,  that  may  be  ­­ may  be  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance  that  could  qualify  for  tolling,  but  only 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  other  factors  are  met.  And  for  example,  in  ­­

13,  it's  12,  but  you're  in  a  circuit  that  hasn't  ruled. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  mean  that  it's  ­­ it  wouldn't  be  an  extraordinary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circumstance  in  that  situation? 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Well,  Your  Honor,  that  was 

  

 

 

 

 

 

the  case  in  Pace,  for  example,  where  the  litigant  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  case  claimed  that  he  was  relying  on  then  binding 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  existing  Third  Circuit  precedent  in  believing  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

his  time  for  filing  a  Federal  habeas  action  was  tolled. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  That's  one  circuit.  I'm 

  

  

 

 

 

talking  about  the  vast  majority. 

 

 

 

 

            

            

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Right. 

  

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  12  out  of  13. 

  

 

 

 

 

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  And  even  in  those  cases, 

  

 

 

 

 

 

like  in  Duncan,  this  Court  overturned  a  large  number  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

circuits  in  terms  of  the  tolling  standard.  And  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lower  courts  did  examine  whether  that  could  be  an 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extraordinary  circumstance.  But  it  wasn't  enough  to 

  

 

 

 

 

 

necessarily  get  tolling  where  the  litigant  failed  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

otherwise  exercise  diligence  in  the  pursuit  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

original  claim.  And  here  that  would  meet  ­­ be  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Fair.  Fair  answer. 

  

  

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Yes.  Exactly. 

  

  

 

            

As  this  Court  has  ­­ and  the  questions  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

already  suggested,  the  Tribe's  reliance  on  class­action 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tolling  in  this  case  was  not  reasonable.  But  even  if  it

had  some  belief  that  the  deadline  for  filing  its 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  claim  could  be  extended,  it  was  incumbent 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon  it,  under  the  diligence  standard  for  Holland,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

diligence  prong  of  Holland,  to  file  within  the  clear 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deadline. 

            

After  2001,  the  Tribe  knew  that  it  had  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

proceed  individually.  And  the  reason  it  waited,  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

words  of  the  Waxhaw  Declaration,  was  that  it  wanted 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certainty  over  its  ­­ over  the  substantive  claim.  And 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  it  amounts  to,  what  this  ­­ this  case  essentially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amounts  to  is  the  Tribe's  determination  that  it  was  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worth  the  effort  to  pursue  a  claim  until  after  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court's  decision  in  Cherokee  Nation. 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  ALITO:  Was  the  government  harmed  in 

  

 

 

 

 

 

any  way  by  the  ­­ the  lack  of  presentment? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Well,  Your  Honor,  in  some 

  

 

 

 

 

 

respects  it  remains  to  be  seen.  But  I  believe  that 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

prejudice  may  result  from  the  failure  to  present  in  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

timely  fashion. 

 

            

First  of  all,  putting  aside  the  notice 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement,  this  is  a  very  records­intensive  inquiry. 

   

 

 

 

 

And  in  ­­ in  Petitioner's  brief  they  suggest  that  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  just  a  matter  of  records  that  are  already  stored  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  government's  possession.  But  many  of  the  ­­ the

would  be  required  is  a  detailed  and  complex 

   

 

 

 

 

 

determination. 

            

And  in  fact,  the  ­­ the  ­­ the  experience  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ramah  highlights  this  where  the  settlement  negotiations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  gone  on  for  three  years  trying  to  determine  what 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  actual  damages  are  through  good­faith  negotiations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  so  yes,  I  would  believe  that  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

government  may  suffer  prejudice  as  a  result  of  now 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

nearly  20  years  later  having  to  determine  actual 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

contract  support  costs  if  this  were  to  go  back  on  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

merits. 

            

JUSTICE  GINSBURG:  The  D.C.  Circuit  said 

  

 

 

 

 

this  is  presentment,  this  is  just  paperwork,  easy  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

easy  to  do.  But  the  Tribe  couldn't  ­­ if  they  had 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presented  to  the  contracting  officer,  they  just  couldn't 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

leave  it  at  that.  They  would  have  to  take  an 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

administrative  appeal  within  90  days,  or  they'd  have  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appeal  to  the  Federal  circuit  within  a  year.  So  more 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  at  stake  for  this  Tribe  than  simply  filing  a  piece 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  paper. 

 

            

MS.  EISENSTEIN:  Your  Honor,  there's  no 

  

 

 

 

 

doubt  that  perhaps  the  D.C.  Circuit's 

 

 

 

 

 

envelope­and­a­stamp  may  have  been  a  bit  of  hyperbole. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

But  that  said,  what  the  Tribe's  argument,  that  it  was 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  subsequent  deadlines  that  would  have  led  it  to

delay,  is  really  an  astounding  proposition,  which  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  their  basis  for  tolling  is  the  existence  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statutes  of  limitation.  And  that  really  can't  be  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case,  that  the  fact  that  once  they  filed  their  claim,  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

may  then  follow;  that  additional  limitations  periods  may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kick  in;  that  that  could  warrant  delay  in  and  of  itself. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  even  putting  that  aside,  there  were 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other  options  that  the  Tribe  could  have  pursued.  For 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

example,  having  presented  its  claim,  and  if  it  did  so 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prior  to  ­­ it  said  it  hoped  to  be  a  part  of  the 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cherokee  Nation  class  action,  if  it  did  so  prior  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Cherokee  Nation  class  action,  and  the  Cherokee  Nation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  action  was  in  fact  certified,  then  ­­ then  it  may 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  an  argument  it's  part  of  that  class. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

To  the  extent  to  which  the  Cherokee  Nation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class  was  denied,  then  the  only  ­­ then  the  presentment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

requirement  was  the  necessary  step  to  moving  forward  to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

presenting  its  claim  individually  at  the  contract,  Board 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  Contract  Appeals  level  or  at  the  judicial  level. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  I  don't  believe  that  the  inevitability  of 

   

 

 

 

 

 

further  litigation  in  any  way  is  a  basis  for  tolling  in 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this  case. 

 

            

you. 

            

If  there  are  no  further  questions,  thank 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel.

REBUTTAL  ARGUMENT  OF  GEOFFREY  D.  STROMMER 

 

 

 

 

 

               

ON  BEHALF  OF  THE  PETITIONER 

 

 

 

 

            

            

MR.  STROMMER:  Thank  you,  Your  Honor. 

  

 

 

 

 

I'll  start  with  a  few  comments  on  the  last 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

point  that  counsel  made. 

 

 

 

            

The  stamp­and­an­envelope  quote  is  more  than 

 

 

 

 

 

hyperbole;  it's  just  flat  wrong.  There's  costs  incurred 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  the  Tribe  to  calculate  the  amount  of  claims.  There's 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

costs  in  pulling  together  the  letter  that  then  goes  into 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  envelope  that  is  the  claim  itself. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

But  more  than  that  ­­ and  your  question 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

alluded  to  this,  Justice  Ginsburg  ­­ the  ­­ once  ­­ once 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  claim  is  filed,  and  the  government,  undoubtedly,  as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  did  during  this  period  of  time  with  all  of  the  claims 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  were  filed,  they  would  have  denied  the  claim.  That 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

triggers  another  statute  of  limitations,  either  90  days 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  appeal  in  the  civilian  board  of  contract  appeals,  or 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one  year  to  appeal  in  Federal  district  court.  And  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

deadline  had  been  found  by  courts  to  be  jurisdictional. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  in  fact,  what  we're  talking  about  here  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  conundrum,  because  the  six­year  statute  of  limitations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

under  the  Contract  Disputes  Act  had  not  been  found  to  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional.  It  was  later  on  found  to  be

jurisdictional  as  a  result  of  the  presentment 

   

 

 

 

 

requirement,  but  the  statute  of  limitations  that  would 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

have  been  triggered  would,  in  fact,  have  been 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional,  and  the  Tribe  would  have  had  no  option 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but  to  litigate.  And  if  we  place  these  facts  on  top  of 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  happened  in  Cherokee  Nation,  it  perfectly 

 

 

 

 

 

 

illustrates  the  conundrum.  707  days  it  took  for  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certification  process  in  that  case. 

 

 

 

 

            

If  the  Tribe  had  filed  at  the  beginning  of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  process  and  received  a  rejection  of  its  claim 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

during  the  first  100,  150  days  ­­ let's  give  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

government,  you  know,  ample  time  to  respond  ­­ then  it 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  have  triggered  a  statute  of  limitations  that  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

jurisdictional  that  the  Tribe  would  have  had  to  have 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acted  on,  in  order  to  make  sure  that  its  claim  was,  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fact,  going  to  still  be  alive. 

 

 

 

 

 

            

And  that  would  have  happened  before  the  end 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  707  days. 

 

 

 

            

So  it's  more  than  a  stamp  in  an  envelope. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  really  is  a  jurisdictional  conundrum  that  the  Tribe 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

was  aware  of  and  concerned  about,  that  partially 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factored  into  the  Tribe's  decision  not  to  file  a  claim. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  There  ­­ there  are  so 

  

 

 

 

 

 

many  people  who  don't  have  resources  to  pursue  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

litigation.  How  do  we  differentiate  you  from  those

millions  of  people  with  lack  of  resources  who  choose  not 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  pursue  claims,  either  because  they  think,  at  least  up

state  of  the  law,  or  for  whatever  other  reason  they're

equitable  tolling  principle  that  won't  open  a  floodgate 

   

 

 

 

 

 

to  making  a  statute  of  limitations  basically  a  nullity? 

   

   

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  Well,  the  ­­ the  primary 

  

 

 

 

 

 

basis,  Your  Honor,  for  the  Tribe's  position  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equitable  tolling  should  apply  is  its  reasonable 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reliance  on  class­action  tolling. 

 

 

 

            

 

 

 

The  other  factors,  such  as  the  cost  of 

 

 

 

 

litigation,  such  as  the  United  States'  fiduciary 

 

 

 

 

 

 

responsibility  and  trust  responsibility  towards  the 

 

 

 

 

 

Tribe  ­­

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  If  it  was  reasonable, 

  

 

 

 

 

why  didn't  you  litigate  that? 

 

 

 

 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  There  was  no  ­­

  

 

 

 

 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  Why  didn't  you  take  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

order  of  the  ­­ the  court  below,  that  ­­ and  appeal  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

order? 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  Well,  there  were  two  cases. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

Both  the  Federal  circuit  and  the  D.C.  Circuit  ruled  just 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about  the  same  time  on  that  issue,  and  both  concluded 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same,  that  class­action  tolling  was  not  available

because  of  the  presentment  requirement. 

 

 

 

 

            

question? 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  To  seek  cert.  on  that 

  

 

 

 

 

 

MR.  STROMMER:  The  Arctic  Slope,  the  other 

  

 

 

 

 

 

case,  did,  so  ­­ so  there  was  no  split  in  the  circuits, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  the  Arctic  Slope  case  did,  in  fact,  petition  this 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Court,  and  this  Court  didn't  take  the  case. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  Menominee  Tribe  chose  not  to  throw 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

bad  money  after  ­­ after  a  bad  result,  which  was 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guaranteed,  by  preparing  a  petition  cert.,  which  this 

   

 

 

 

 

 

Court  had  already  denied  in  the  Arctic  Slope  Native 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

case. 

            

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  When  there  was  no  split. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

But  you  had  a  split. 

   

 

 

            

Honor. 

            

up. 

            

MR.  STROMMER:  There  was  no  split.  No,  Your 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

JUSTICE  SOTOMAYOR:  When  your  decision  came 

  

 

 

 

 

MR.  STROMMER:  No.  Our  decision  on  that 

  

  

 

 

 

 

issue  ­­ there  were  two  rounds  of  litigation  at  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

court  of  appeals  level.  In  the  first  round,  both  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal  circuit  and  the  D.C.  Circuit  held  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

class­action  tolling  was  not  available,  and  they  both 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remanded  back  to  the  trial  courts  to  determine  whether 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  not  equitable  tolling  applied.

And  that  first  decision  was  appealed  by 

 

 

 

Arctic  Slope  Native  ­­ or  petitioned  this  Court  to  take 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  case,  and  it  was  not  taken.  And  Menominee  did  not 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

take  those  steps  by  filing  a  petition. 

   

 

 

 

 

              

I  ­­ I  also  want  to  address  the  prejudice 

   

 

 

 

 

 

issue.  There's  ­­ if  there's  anything  in  the 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

government's  briefs  that  strikes  me  as  hyperbole,  it's 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  they  were  prejudiced.  They  have  been  settling 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

hundreds  of  these  claims  around  the  country. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

These  claims  are  very  straightforward.  The 

  

 

 

 

 

contract,  the  methodology  that's  used  to  calculate  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

entitlement  for  contract  support  costs,  are  well 

 

 

 

 

 

 

established  in  policy.  We  know  the  government  produced 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

shortfall  reports,  contemporaneous  with  the  years  in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which  these  claims  accrued,  in  which  they  told  Congress, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for  each  Tribe,  how  much  they  short­funded  them. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

            

So  the  ­­ the  government  would  tell  you  that 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

they're  prejudiced  because  they  would  have  to  go  back 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  look  at  the  contract  and  look  at  the  policy  in  place 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at  the  time  to  calculate  the  amount  due  is  just  not  ­­

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

just  not  credible,  in  my  view. 

 

 

 

 

 

              

I  rest  our  case,  Your  Honor. 

 

 

 

 

            

CHIEF  JUSTICE  ROBERTS:  Thank  you,  counsel.
