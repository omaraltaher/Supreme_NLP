 Mr. Kroger. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL JOHN R. KROGER 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

 MR. KROGER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

 The court of appeals held that Arizona v. 

Fulminante was the clearly established Federal law to 

control and govern the outcome of this case.  This was 

an error, because this Court has never applied 

Fulminante's direct appeal harmless error standard, 

which places the burden of proof on the government, to a 

collateral ineffective assistance of counsel claim, 

where the burden of proof is on the inmate. 

 In Boyer, unlike Fulminante, there is no 

trial transcript to review because the defendant pleaded 

no contest or guilty before trial.  The court of 

appeals' decision conflicts with both 

Strickland v. Washington and Hill v. Lockhart and will 

have grave negative consequences for our criminal 

justice system.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But isn't -- isn't 

Fulminante relevant as -- just for the proposition that 

a defendant's own confession carries heavy weight, 

leaving the rest of it -- the statement that -- in 

Fulminante that when a defendant confesses to the crime, 

6 

that carries heavy weight? 

7

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13 

14 

15

 MR. KROGER:  Yes, Your Honor, I think it's 

relevant to that extent, that a confession from a 

defendant is significant evidence.  However, it 

certainly does not imply, as the court of appeals 

proceeded to do here, that it controls the prejudice 

prong of Strickland, that it sets a new standard of 

review of harmlessness, that it shifts the burden of 

proof onto the government, or that it limits the 

prejudice analysis to that question of the potential 

16 

impact of the confession at trial. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 And so for all those reasons, I -- I think 

the -- the court of appeals has gone well beyond any 

potential relevance of the Fulminante decision.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is it -- if I am 

understanding your argument, it is that the Court erred 

in assuming that if the confession had been 

suppressed -- which you're not arguing for or against. 

I'm assuming you are not taking your amicus's position 

that we have to get to the question of what would have

9 

happened in a motion to suppress -- but that under all 

circumstances, if there's a suppressible confession, a 

defendant should never plead guilty. 

 You are saying that that conclusion is what 

the Ninth Circuit drew and that was wrong? 

 MR. KROGER:  Your Honor, we're -- we are 

suggesting that the court was wrong both in stating 

Fulminante provided the standard of review, as well as 

holding that you can, in effect, assume prejudice simply 

10

because defense counsel failed to file a motion which 

11 

defense counsel believed was not -­

12

13 

14 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So it's another way of 

saying what I said, which is, no defendant should plead 

guilty if it's a suppressible confession?

 MR. KROGER:  That is correct, Your Honor. 

16 

That is correct, Your Honor. 

17

18 

19 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So now, what 

is the other information that would have made a plain 

guilty in this case inevitable?  However, that's a 

higher standard than you need to meet, but -­

 MR. KROGER:  As -- as Your Honor noted, that 

is a much higher standard than we have to meet under 

Hill v. Lockhart.  There were very good reasons why 

defense counsel's advice that this defendant plead 

guilty was sound and reasonable advice. 

5

5

 First of all, the defendant faced a very 

strong government case, even at that stage of the 

investigation. 

 Second, there was a potential charge of 

aggravated murder that could be brought if the case were 

6 

taken to the grand jury. 

7

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13

 Third, the plea offer that was extended to 

the defendant and which the defendant took was very 

favorable to the defendant, both in terms of -- of 

capping the amount of time that the defendant would 

serve, as well as dismissing two additional mandatory 

minimum charges of assault and kidnapping.  So -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Were those higher than 

14 

the minimum he pled to?  Were those mandatory minimums 

higher? 

15

16

 MR. KROGER:  No, Your Honor, but they could 

17 

have been run consecutive rather than concurrent. 

18

 I -- I think more significant is the fact 

19 

that when the defendant himself testified about the 

20

21 

22 

23

reasons he pled guilty, none of the reasons he provided 

had anything to do with the strength of the government's 

case or the failure of counsel to file the motion. 

 What the defendant said motivated his guilty 

24 

plea was a concern about an aggravated murder charge, a 

25

desire not to have to testify against his brother, which 

6
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3 

4

5

6 

7 

8

he believed would be the outcome of a guilty plea.  And 

those factors were in the defendant's mind when he 

decided to take the guilty plea. 

 So in this case, even if one were to shift 

the burden onto the government -- and I do not believe 

that -- that that is consistent with Strickland -- the 

government would prevail here. 

 This case raises, I think, significant 

9 

consequences for application of Strickland and 

10

11 

12 

13

Hill v. Lockhart.  Strickland and Hill clearly place the 

burden of proof in a collateral proceeding on the 

inmate. 

 The court of appeals here shifted the burden 

14 

of proof, pursuant to Fulminante, onto the government. 

15

16 

17 

18 

19

20

21 

22 

23

One can see this in the petition appendix at page 48 

where the court states that there is not enough evidence 

in the record to prove that the defendant would have 

pled guilty had the confession been denied. 

 As I stated to Justice Sotomayor, I believe 

the government actually could meet that burden, but that 

is certainly not the burden that either Strickland or -­

or Hill requires. 

 Second, the Court's application of 

24 

Fulminante transforms the Hill v. Lockhart analysis.  It 

25

narrows it to one degree, because it's focused on one 

7
 

Alderson Reporting Company

1 

2

9 

issue, what the government's evidence would be at trial, 

rather than looking at the broad array of issues which 

might motivate a defendant to plead guilty which the 

courts will look at under -- under Hill v. Lockhart.

 For example, under Hill v. Lockhart the 

court will not only look at the defendant's testimony 

with respect to the estimate of the strength of the 

government's case, but also look at the potential for an 

additional sentence that is higher or additional charges 

10

that carry a higher sentence if the defendant proceeds 

11 

with litigation rather than pleading guilty. 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 It will look at the investigation risk that 

additional evidence would be found in, if the case 

continued rather than terminating in an early plea.  And 

it will look at personal factors such as the ones that 

were evident in this case that might motivate a guilty 

plea. 

 For those reasons, the Hill v. Lockhart 

19 

standard encompasses a broader array of factors in 

20

21 

22 

23

determining whether there is prejudice than a simple 

application of Fulminante's direct appeal post-trial 

standards. 

 It is also the case that the application of 

24 

Fulminante will substantially increase the amount of 

25

speculation which courts have to engage in compared with 

8
 

Alderson Reporting Company

applying the proper Hill v. Lockhart test.

11 

12 

13

 Hill v. Lockhart limits the amount of 

speculation by focusing on the defendant's motive in 

pleading guilty and whether the ineffective assistance 

could have influenced that decision to plead guilty. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about Judge Berzon's 

test, that seems to be simple and a matter of common 

sense, that if you get rid of the confession, then you 

have a better chance of getting a good deal in the plea 

bargain?  The confession certainly -- it -- this serves 

the defendant to get rid of that as well as weight on 

the prosecution's side. 

 MR. KROGER:  Your Honor, I would say two 

14 

things:  First, the test which is proposed by Judge 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

Berzon in the concurrence has never been recognized or 

promulgated by this Court.  So in a collateral 

proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S. Code 2254, it would not 

be clearly established law that the State court was 

required to follow.

 And second, application of that standard, as 

Judge Bybee noted in his concurrence, would require an 

immense amount of speculation.  In this case, the 

majority in the Ninth Circuit hypothesized that filing 

the motion to suppress the confession would strengthen 

the defendant's position in negotiation vis-à-vis the 

9

Government.

19 

20

21 

22 

23

24

25

 It is also very possible, however, that the 

Government would respond to filing a motion as opposed 

to taking an early offer of guilty plea by taking the 

case to the grand jury, seeking an aggravated murder 

charge, and thus, putting the defendant in a worse 

position in the case.  And, in fact, as Judge Bybee 

noted, he questioned whether the courts have the proper 

tools to be able to speculate years after the guilty 

plea whether a particular motion may have increased or 

may have decreased the amount of leverage that a 

defendant has, or what kind of response that that motion 

might have drawn from the prosecution. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  But you have to, don't you? 

I mean, what's the alternative?  I mean, imagine a case 

where it's clear there was a malpractice or an 

inadequate assistance, and it happened a long time ago 

and now you have to decide, well, was it prejudicial or 

not?  It's prejudicial if in the absence of that he 

would have gone to trial or wouldn't have pleaded 

guilty, or -- and what's the alternative to trying to 

figure out whether that's so? 

 MR. KROGER:  Your Honor -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It can't be the State 

always wins and it can't be the defendant always wins. 

10

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. KROGER:  I think the alternative, Your 

Honor, is application of Hill v. Lockhart, which looks 

not at speculation about how this could or could not 

have affected the plea bargaining process, but looks 

very concretely at the defendant's pretrial 

decision-making process and examines the record to 

determine why the defendant pled guilty and whether they 

can prove with a reasonable probability that he would 

not have pled guilty -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, but that is -- isn't 

that -- sorry, maybe we are just quibbling.  I -- I 

don't quite see it.  That would seem to me to be going 

into the plea bargaining process.  Would he have pleaded 

guilty, what would have happened? 

 MR. KROGER:  I -- I think the difference, 

Your Honor, is that when you are applying 

Hill v. Lockhart, you almost always have at least three 

very concrete pieces evidence to show the defendant's 

state of mind.  You have the defendant's own testimony 

or deposition, or in this case both.  You have the trial 

counsel's affidavit for testimony about the 

decision-making process his client engaged in, and then 

you have the guilty plea colloquy itself.

 So you always have a -- a concrete record 

11
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

that the court years later can review in order to 

determine what motivated the -- the decision to plead 

guilty. 

 If one were applying Judge Berzon's proposed 

alternative prejudice finding, one would have to engage 

in a great deal of speculation.  One would, I presume, 

have defense counsel and the government make claims 

about what they might have done in response to 

hypotheticals, which does not seem to be a -- a -- a 

reasonably judicable standard.  As a -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Without any 

confession -- forget about the brother or the 

girlfriend -- assume that there had been no confession, 

wouldn't it have been a fair conclusion to draw that 

without any confession whatsoever that the plea 

bargaining strength of the defendant in this case would 

have been appreciably higher and that the prosecutor 

would have had to offer something -­

 MR. KROGER:  Your Honor, if none of -- none 

of the three confessions -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  None of the three -­

 MR. KROGER -- had been made. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- whatsoever.  I mean,

if the brother's confession -- or the confession to the 

25

brother is a very big piece of why a plea would have 

12
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

been reasonable in this case.  Let's assume no 

confession. 

 MR. KROGER:  Your Honor, I still think 

4 

taking, recommending a guilty plea and taking of a 

5

6 

7 

8 

9 

10

11 

12 

13

guilty plea would be a rational response to the 

remaining evidence.  Even at this early stage in the 

proceeding, the police had uncovered certainly the body 

with the direct shot to the temple.  It had recovered 

the -- the murder weapon.  It had recovered the car 

which the defendants had borrowed and which had blood in 

the trunk where the victim had been locked and 

transported. 

 They had four witnesses who were present 

14 

when the plan to kidnap and assault the victim was 

15

hatched.  So they would have testified very directly 

16 

about the forming of the plot. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

 There was an eyewitness who identified the 

defendant, Mr. Moore, at the trailer where the victim 

was abducted.  And then, of course, there was a 

co-conspirator, Mr. Salyer, who was cooperating with the 

Government prior to the confession and whose -- whose 

cooperation was known to the defendant. 

 So, with all of those pieces, even if one 

24 

stripped the three confessions out of the case, you 

25

would still have a situation where the Government 's 

13

case was strong, where there was a very severe risk the 

Government would go to the grand jury and obtain an 

aggravated murder charge, and where there was 

significant advantages to pleading early and locking in 

a lower sentence to a felony murder charge. 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Kroger, from -­

General Kroger -- from everything you said, and I take 

it -- from your brief, too, that you are not urging 

the -- that -- that counsel's assistance was adequate? 

You are not contesting that the confession was 

involuntary?  You seem to be putting everything on the 

prejudice issue; is that right? 

 MR. KROGER:  No, Your Honor.  We -- we 

14 

concede and forfeited the issue that the -- the motion 

15

16 

17 

18 

19 

20

21 

22

24

to suppress would have been meritorious, but believed 

the district court got it right when it held that on 

both prongs of Strickland, both on deficient performance 

and on prejudice, the defendant has failed to make 

his -- his -- meet his burden of proof.

 I think the -- the prejudice argument here 

is extraordinarily strong, but I think the deficient 

performance, even if one concedes that the motion would 

have been meritorious, the deficient performance prong 

is strong as well, because the defendant can't meet his 

burden of proof that defense counsel's representation

was unreasonable, given the strength of the government's 

case, given the quality of the plea offer that was made, 

and given the defendant's own reasoning for why he pled 

guilty.

 The case has significant practical 

consequences for the criminal justice system.  One is 

that if the Ninth Circuit's opinion stands, it will be 

much easier to challenge guilty pleas years after the 

fact on collateral challenge, and this will undercut the 

principle of finality.  One would certainly expect to 

see fewer Government plea offers in cases like this, if 

the Government believed years later it would have to 

present all of its trial evidence in a collateral 

proceeding in order to rebut the presumption under 

Fulminante that there was prejudice. 

 Second, it has severe implications for the 

freedom of defense counsel to exercise its discretion 

and represent its client using the wide latitude that 

Strickland recognized was necessary.  Strickland itself 

stated that it's a mistake to hem in defense counsel 

with strict rules about what should or should not be 

done, because defense counsel needs that wide latitude. 

If there is a -- a virtual presumption that motions to 

suppress must be filed, even where defense counsel 

reasonably believes it will not resound to the advantage 

15

of his client and may cost the client a chance to plea 

early, the defense counsel must take that option, it's a 

severe restriction on the -­

 MR. KROGER:  Your Honor, if he had gone to 

trial on the charges that were pending, and these -­

these were not charges from the grand jury, he would 

have faced at least the mandatory minimum of 25 years 

that he pled guilty to, plus the potential of 

additional -- an additional sentence both on that charge 

perhaps as high as life, given the two other potential 

mandatory minimum sentences of -- of kidnapping and 

assault that could be brought. 

 JUSTICE BREYER:  And if they had gone back 

to the grand jury, as the prosecutor I guess could have 

done, it could have gone to the grand jury? 

 MR. KROGER:  This case pled guilty before, 

Your Honor, yes.  So -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  It could have gone to the 

grand jury.  Then what is the maximum he could have 

gotten? 

 MR. KROGER:  It could have been a capital 

case, Your Honor.  This could have been an aggravated

murder case because the facts involved a very severe 

beating to the extent perhaps of torture where a 

Defendant who was very vulnerable who had a protruding 

hernia that was in a truss was savagely beaten, his nose 

was broken, he was locked in the trunk of the car, taken 

to a remote location and shot in the temple with one 

shot of a revolver. 

 It is distinctly possible that the state 

9 

would have come from the Grand Jury as a capital case 

10

and at the very least have been an aggravated murder 

11 

carrying a life sentence, not a 25-year sentence. 

12

13 

14 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about his argument 

that his failure -- the Defendant in the case arising 

out of this episode, if Salyer did go to trial and he 

ended up getting that exact same sentence that this

Defendant did?

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

 MR. KROGER:  Yes, Your Honor.  Mr. Salyer 

did receive the same sentence after he went to trial. 

His case, though, was very different from that of the 

Petitioner, because the Petitioner was the individual 

who cocked the pistol and fired the round into the head 

of the victim killing him.  And so it is very unlikely 

that the other two co-conspirators would have found 

themselves charged with an intentional murder based on 

the facts of this case.  But because this pistol could

only be fired if it were cocked and because the round 

went into the temple, it would have been a reasonably 

strong aggravated murder case against this Defendant who 

was the triggerman.

 The final point I would like to make to the 

Court is that this case involves or should involve 

significant deference to the State court decision.  This 

was not a summary denial by the State court.  The State 

court held a hearing at which it received all testimony 

that was available.  It made very explicit findings of 

fact about the facts in the case.  It made a credibility 

finding about the evidence that had been submitted by 

the Petitioner, and it ruled after citing the proper 

Strickland standard that the Defendant had failed to 

carry his burden of proof. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's a little hard when we 

take away the finding that the confession was 

admissible.  We have to extract that. 

 MR. KROGER:  Your Honor, even if you -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm not quite sure what to 

do with the State court's case, assuming we have to 

presume, because of the posture of the case, that the 

confession was inadmissible. 

 MR. KROGER:  Your Honor, I would say two 

things with respect to that.  First of all, the State

court's decision, even if it were incorrect in its 

ruling that the confession would not have been 

admissible, the State court's conclusion that the motion 

would not have assisted the Defendant in any way, the 

finding that it would have been fruitless because of the 

other confessions, the other two confessions in the 

case, is a reasonable decision that the Court made and 

is dispositive and thus under AEDPA should receive 

deference.

 I would also suggest the case is somewhat 

similar to Yarborough v. Alvarado.  There was a custody 

issue at stake and this Court explicitly held that one 

might come out one way or the other on the custody 

issue, that reasonable jurists might split, but that 

that fact alone rendered the State court's opinion on 

16 

voluntariness or on custody in that issue as reasonable. 

17

18 

19 

20

21 

22 

23

 And again, as here, though we are not 

asserting that this confession was admissible, should 

the Court consider it, it's clearly a close question on 

voluntariness and somewhat factually similar to 

Yarborough where even if the State court were was wrong, 

it was still a reasonable adjudication of the claims. 

 If there were no further questions from the 

24 

Court, Your Honor, I would like to reserve the remainder 

25

of my time for rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN T. WAX

 Mr. Moore established prejudice under Hill 

from his attorney's failure to recognize the 

involuntariness and inadmissibility of the lengthy tape 

recorded statement obtained from him by the police.  The 

most critical type of evidence that the State can have 

in any case. 

 The Ninth Circuit's conclusion to that

Court's precedence of Strickland, Hill, and Kimmelman. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I am having a little bit 

of trouble here with your argument for the following 

reasons.  Assume we suppress the confession.  Why is it 

unreasonable for the defense attorney to have concluded 

that the evidence showing your client's presence at the 

shooting, and identification as the shooter, that it was 

solely that he should have gone to trial on a defense 

that he wasn't involved in the shooting at all. 

 Once you put him in this shooting, then the 

only issue he seems to be confused about is that he 

20
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 

2 

3

5

thinks that because it was accidental that that presents 

a defense to felony murder.  And that's clearly an 

erroneous position on his part. 

 So what made the case so weak that the 

Government was never going without the confession to 

6 

prove felony murder? 

7

 MR. WAX:  Well, Your Honor, we believe that 

the case is not as the State would have it, a strong 

case in the absence of this confession.

 We also believe that the proper focus is not 

solely on the strength of the State's case, and that 

under Hill it is necessary to look at the totality of 

the circumstances, and look for the objective factors in 

this record that inform the decision of what Mr. Moore 

would have done or would have been likely to have done 

16 

in the absence of his counsel's mistakes.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  What does your office do in 

this situation, all right, a client is indicted in 

Federal court and you anticipate that there are all 

sorts of motions that you might make if this case is 

going to trial, but at an early point the prosecution 

offers you what looks like a really good plea bargain. 

Now do you litigate all those motions?  If you have, you 

know, you have a chance of winning, of suppressing some 

statements that your client made, suppressing physical 

21

evidence, getting certain evidence excluded with a 

motion in limine, maybe you could win on a severance 

motion, do you think you litigate all those rather than 

grabbing a good plea deal when it's offered to you?

 MR. WAX:  Your Honor, the answer is 

6 

certainly no, we do not litigate all of the motions.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  So if you take the deal, 

then you want it later to be open to the Defendant if 

he's not, you know, after the Defendant has spent some 

time in jail, he's not too happy with the deal any more, 

he can now come back and say, well, the Federal public 

defender's office was ineffective because they could 

have moved to suppress my confession and the illegal 

search, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, that is all 

open for relitigation years later? 

 MR. WAX:  No, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  No? 

 MR. WAX:  And the issue here is not as we 

19 

have attempted to articulate in our brief solely and in 

20

21 

22 

23 

24 

25

the abstract the failure to file the motion.  The 

problem is that Mr. Moore's attorney did not understand 

that the statement was suppressible.  In the situation 

that you are putting to me, if I or an assistant in my 

office says to a client, look, there is a strong motion 

to suppress the confession, the drugs, what have you, 

22

but here are other factors that we should look at.  And 

at the conclusion and with that proper advice the client 

decides I will take the deal, then I have performed 

effectively, and the case is not one that could be 

subject to a collateral attack as this case is. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What would have been the

defense?

 MR. WAX:  Excuse me, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What would have been the 

defense absent the confession?  You have one at trial on 

the confession, suppressing it, how would he have defend 

the this case?

that the strength of his brother's confession is a 

given.  We respectfully disagree.  The brother Raymond 

is a police -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What motive would his 

brother have had to put him at the scene of this 

shooting as the accidental killer?  That's all his 

brother would have had to say.  He was at the scene, he 

accidentally -- this gun went accidentally off.

 MR. WAX:  If he were to appear and testify, 

which is one of the points that I believe the Ninth 

Circuit properly pointed out, that Mr. Moore knowing his 

brother might have had every confidence -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  Might.  See, that's the 

trouble.  We have a lot of evidence, I think, here, at 

least by first glance, that -- a lot of evidence he shot 

the guy.  A lot of evidence he carried -- kidnapped him. 

All right?  And now the -- now, maybe it was accidental, 

but if it was accidental, it's still felony murder; and 

24

he received through the plea bargaining the minimum

was clearly wrong.  All right.  If it's clearly wrong, 

what is it so clear, that he could get off if he went to

 MR. WAX:  Your Honor, I will respond to the

second part but I believe there is a premise in which 

10

you said, that we reject.  There is no State court

finding under Hill.  And there is no deference -­

 MR. WAX:  At pages 205 and 206 in the 

appendix in the findings of fact and conclusions of law, 

there are 11 findings of fact.  In one of those findings 

of fact, in findings of fact 8 and 9, the State court 

used the word fruitless in describing the motion to 

suppress.  In the conclusions of law the State court 

solely addressed Strickland.  And nowhere in the 

analysis is there any reference to the question of what 

Mr. Moore would have done.

10

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Doesn't Strickland require 

11 

that it be prejudicial?

 MR. WAX:  Yes, of course.  However, the 

analysis that was undertaken here never reached the 

question of what Mr. Moore would have done.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  If I assume that the word 

"fruitless" and the reference to Strickland were a 

finding, that this is not prejudicial -- if I assume 

that for the sake of argument for the moment, what is it 

that you can show that shows it was prejudicial?

 MR. WAX:  Your Honor, I think -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That was the same question 

22 

I think Justice -- Justice Sotomayor started with.

 MR. WAX:  Your Honor, there is no question

State's case includes the facts that the attorney

general has identified.  There is also as we perceive it 

no question but that the objective record showed that 

the brother's testimony would have been highly 

impeachable based on his prior work as an informant, his 

description of himself -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Impeachable how?  What 

motive did he have to implicate his brother?  You still 

haven't answered that question.  All you keep saying is, 

he was a past cooperator, he had no pending charges, and 

10

now he has a motive to do this against his brother 

11 

because of that? 

12

13 

14 

15

16 

17 

18

 MR. WAX:  Your Honor, I cannot point in the 

record to a motive.  What I can point to is the fact 

that there is in the record his self-description of 

himself as the golden boy for the police, his working 

with the same detective who interrogated his brother 

years before when he completely avoided a murder charge. 

 And as a defense attorney, in a case 

19 

involving a group of men who are not necessarily as 

20

socialized and well educated as some other group, that 

21 

his testimony would have been subject to impeachment. 

22

23 

24 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Even without his testimony, 

isn't there a very strong case of kidnapping?  Let's 

just take it step-by-step.  What would have been the 

defense to the kidnapping charge? 

27
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 MR. WAX:  The defense to the kidnapping 

charge in the absence of the confessions could well have 

been a mere presence defense, that Mr. Moore did not 

participate in the kidnapping.  He had every right to 

put the State to his -- to its burden of proof. 

 JUSTICE ALITO:  He didn't -- that he didn't 

go to the -- to the victim's RV with the other men? 

That would have been the defense? 

 MR. WAX:  He could certainly have argued 

that he did not participate in the kidnapping.  He's 

there, he's in the car, and he had no participation in 

it.  But what I believe is being missed in this 

discussion, if I may, is the focus on the question 

required to be analyzed in Hill.  Would Mr. Moore have 

gone to trial?  Would he have accepted the plea?

other -- I've got -- the other reason I asked the 

question, to be clear about it, is that -- is that he

pretty good chance of getting a better deal.  And what 

he -- like getting off.  And what he got was the

Number two is he could say his brother is not a very
 

good brother.  Moreover he's a rather dubious character 

there, and bring all that -- stuff.  Was there anything 

else? 

anything. 

 MR. WAX:  Yes, Your Honor.
 

JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't want to miss
 

MR. WAX:  Yes, Your Honor.  What we have in
 

this record is highly unusual combination of four facts 

appearing at three different stages in the proceeding. 

First, from his attorney, who articulated this in the 

sentencing -- it's in the supplemental appendix at page 

7:  Mr. Moore had a very difficult time accepting the 

fact that this was a felony murder charge, or a felony 

murder offer.  That leads directly to the fact that Mr. 

Moore did not plead guilty.

 This is only a nolo plea.  And while in some

circumstances the court will equate a nolo plea with a 

plea of guilty, in these circumstances the fact that he 

entered a nolo plea only is highly significant on the 

question of whether or not he would have rolled the 

dice. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And a competent -- and a 

competent counsel is supposed to accept their irrational 

client, who doesn't want to understand the law, and let 

him risk getting an aggravated felony charge brought 

against him, or a capital murder charge brought against 

him, and not -- and just go ahead?  And try the case 

because he's not going to recommend to the client, go to 

trial, take the plea, because you're irrational? 

 MR. WAX:  Your Honor -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's really what you 

are saying, that a competent attorney would not 

recommend to his client take the plea, and that his 

client wouldn't ultimately accept the plea, because the 

objective reality is his upside horrible and his 

downside is almost a given. 

 MR. WAX:  Your Honor, a competent counsel 

might advise his counsel to accept a plea.  The question 

of the irrational client is however one with which I 

regrettably deal on a regular basis.  Clients do not 

always accept my advice, and for whatever it is worth in

the footnote toward the end of his opinion, Judge 

Reinhardt responds to Judge Bybee by saying:  Look, he 

may not be better off by pursuing this habeas corpus 

action; it is, however, his choice.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but Judge Reinhardt 

and the court of appeals did not in fact apply the test 

of Hill, which you are asserting.  The test is whether 

he would have gone to trial.  I -- I didn't read the 

opinion as ever saying that he would have gone to trial. 

The opinion says he could have gotten a better deal. 

 That's quite a different -- quite a 

different question, and I -- I'm not prepared to make 

that the test.

would have gone to trial.

 MR. WAX:  There is -- there is no direct 

statement to that effect.  In all the cases where we 

have found where there is such a direct statement, the 

courts almost always discount them.  What we have here, 

we submit, is something more significant, and that is he 

did not want to enter a plea.  He did not enter a plea, 

and then at the first opportunity that he learned that 

his attorney had been ineffective, he moved to undo the 

conviction.  And we submit that the decision in 

Roe v. Flores-Ortega, in which this Court found it 

highly significant that Flores-Ortega moved to initiate 

an appeal at the first opportunity that he learned that 

the appeal had been lost, is applicable here. 

 That is an objective fact that this Court 

has found relevant -- and -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  That is an irrelevant 

question.  I don't see how we could go back to a 

possibly irrational state of mind.  I mean, don't -­

when you're trying to figure out what a defendant would 

have done in the absence of an error in respect to a 

plea, don't you have to ask a question:  What would a 

rational person have done. 

 I mean, I would say that's a good question. 

24 

I don't know the answer, but if we are trying to figure 

25

out he might have been totally irrational and would have

brought the gun to the scene, who by the confessions, is 

the one who pistol-whipped the victim, received the 

10-year manslaughter sentence that Mr. Moore believed he 

should have obtained.  Mr. Salyer, who went to trial, 

received the same sentence that Mr. Moore received. 

 Mr. Moore's judgment that this should be 

viewed as an accident and that it was a highly mitigated 

situation -­

General Kroger brought up that Moore carried the gun.

 MR. WAX:  Your Honor, the gun is brought to

codefendant, Lonnie Woolhiser.  He has the gun when he 

goes into the trailer and assaults Mr. Rogers.

citation for this? 

 MR. WAX:  Pages 227 and 228 in the appendix. 

And he also reiterates the fact in the sentencing, which 

I believe is at -- at page 3 and 4, the sentencing 

proceeding in the -­

JUSTICE BREYER:  They believe it.  The jury 

believes it was an accident.  Now, how does that get him 

a lighter sentence? 

 MR. WAX:  If he goes to trial, the 

24 

likelihood, first, of a death penalty needs to be put 

25

off the table.

 JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  The sentence is 

25 years mandatory for felony murder.  Now, the jury 

believes just as you said.  It believes it was an 

accident; he never intended to pull the trigger.

 How does that get him a lighter sentence?

That's my question.

 MR. WAX:  If he is convicted solely of the

receive a lighter sentence.  If he is convicted of the 

felony murder, to be sure the mandatory -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Isn't kidnapping a felony? 

 MR. WAX:  Yes.  But if he -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, then, if he is 

14 

kidnapped -- if he is convicted of the kidnapping and 

15

there was an accidental murder that took place, I 

16 

believe that that would be felony murder.

 MR. WAX:  If the jury finds him guilty of 

18 

that, his sentence will -­

 JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  And the defense to 

kidnapping was what? 

 MR. WAX:  Mere presence.  He could have 

22 

argued a mere presence defense.  In the absence -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But four witnesses put

him at the scene to kidnap this guy and scare him to

death.  Or scare him.

 MR. WAX:  Well, Your Honor, the record shows 

there was one witness who put him at the scene.  The 

record shows that one of the issues that was previously 

raised, and that in our winnowing of the issues is not 

currently before this Court, is a challenge to the 

admissibility of the eyewitness identification at the 

Rogers trailer. 

 One witness there only, and that would be 

9 

subject to challenge, and does not put him into the 

10

trailer or participating in the kidnapping or the 

11 

assault.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Wax, as far as the 

confession is concerned and its excludability, what 

effect do you think we ought to give to this passage in 

the -- in the defendant's agreement to the plea:  "I 

understand that any admissions, statements, or 

confessions which I may have made or any evidence 

obtained by virtue of the search and seizure of my 

property may well be inadmissible against me in 

evidence, unless my constitutional rights have been 

safeguarded.  I understand that if I would like to speak 

to an attorney concerning my constitutional rights, that 

the Court will grant me time for that purpose." 

 MR. WAX:  I believe you should give no 

credit to that, because that statement by Mr. Moore is 

36
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review

based on the incorrect advice of his attorney.  And we 

believe that the record here -­

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, wait.  Wait.  This is 

4 

not the attorney speaking.  I mean, this is what he

said.  He said, "I understand that any admissions, 

statements or confessions which I have made may well 

be" -- "may well be inadmissible against me in 

evidence." 

 MR. WAX:  Your Honor, he had previously been 

told by his attorney that they were not.  And when he 

was questioned in the post-conviction proceeding before 

the point of the prejudice under Hill, he says:  I acted 

and entered this nolo plea on the advice of counsel. 

 Now, to be sure there is a boilerplate 

statement to the contrary. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, boilerplate -- I 

mean, the man signed it.  How can a prosecutor ever 

protect himself against the person who signs a plea 

agreement later -- later coming in and saying:  Oh, my 

attorney misadvised me. 

 I don't care what your attorney advised you. 

The plea agreement itself advises you that this stuff 

may be inadmissible. 

 MR. WAX:  Your Honor, what Mr. Moore has 

said is:  I enter this plea on the advice of my

attorney.  That advice is conceded by the State to have 

been incorrect, and the full record of the case includes 

that plea petition document.  It includes the State's 

concession that the advice provided was incorrect.

 And while a plea petition form is standard 

in many State courts, as it is in the Federal court, the 

reality is that those forms often include statements 

that are not consistent with the facts that have been 

presented or that have occurred previously.

10

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I just clarify 

11 

something? 

12

13 

14 

15

16

 Is it your position that the prosecutor, in 

making his offer of proof at the plea on 227 to 228, 

affirmatively said that this was an accident or did 

not -- did not allege that it was intentional? 

 MR. WAX:  He affirmatively states that there 

17 

was no intent to kill.

 JUSTICE ALITO:  Where is that?  I -­

 MR. WAX:  I believe it's on page 228, where 

he comes back in and says one more thing. 

 It is on 228.  And just something that I 

missed early on:  "The indicated intent of the defendant 

was to instill fear to the point that the victim would 

not again rip them off. " The description -­

JUSTICE ALITO:  You read that as a -- as a

claim that there was no intent to kill? 

2

 MR. WAX:  Yes, sir.  And I believe it is 

also consistent with the statement of the judge at the 

sentencing, who described this as a case involving two 

tragedies.  Everyone who participated -- the lawyers for 

the defendants, the prosecutor, and the judge -­

recognized this was an accident. 

 This was a tragedy.  The judge saying, 

9 

Mr. Moore, the person who had led a good, law-abiding 

10

life, a person who had been a productive member of -­

 JUSTICE ALITO:  I have to say, I think 

that's a very aggressive reading of what was said here. 

It was not necessary for the plea to this offense to 

prove an intent to kill, and the statement that the 

intent that was necessary, which is lesser intent but 

sufficient to support this plea, was present is not a 

statement that a greater mens rea was absent. 

 And I thought you argued to us that the 

19 

prosecutor said this was not intentional.  It was an 

20

21

22 

23 

24 

25

accident. 

 MR. WAX:  Well, I believe, Your Honor, that 

is the portion to the record to which I am referring at 

page 228.  He also described at the sentencing the facts 

of the case as facts involving and consistent with the 

slip and the fall. 

39
 

Alderson Reporting Company 

Official - Subject to Final Review 

 His description of the incident is a 

description of Mr. Rogers falling back into the gun.  He 

did that both at the plea, which I believe is on page 

227, and he did it again at the sentencing.  And then he 

is followed by the judge, who articulates the 

circumstances of this case as involving two tragedies: 

To be sure, the death of Mr. Rogers, but also the 

tragedy of Mr. Moore having accidentally killed his 

friend.

 The Court of Appeals here did not apply 

clearly established Federal law, but applied, for the 

first time in a way that is non-mandated by the 

decisions of this Court, Fulminante to a collateral 

proceeding. 

 The State court's adjudication of this claim 

was eminently reasonable on both prongs of Strickland. 

40

Accordingly, we would ask this Court to reverse the 

judgment of the Ninth Circuit and to affirm the judgment 

of the district court. 

 I would be happy to answer any additional 

questions that the Court may have.
